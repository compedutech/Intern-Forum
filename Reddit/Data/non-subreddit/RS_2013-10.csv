Im feeling lost, useless, and just ready to give up.
But here is a little background on me:

 * Graduated May 2013 with a BS in Finance and Management from a good state school
 * GPA: 3.0 (oddly exactly 3.000) Major GPA: 3.3
 * From 14 till today with the exception of all of freshmen year and my semester abroad I have been employed
 * Worked 25-30 hours a week for 3.5 years as a pizza delivery driver during college, did some managerial duties without ever receiving any title. (I was offered but made more money delivering)
 * Leading up to college I worked 5 years at a fast food restaurant doing a variety of jobs at the same restaurant
 * Had an internship at Enterprise Rent-a-Car, which on name alone has gotten me some interest from some companies

Now I have a concentration on financial planning, insurance, and risk management, which means I have been contacted by a LOT of financial planning companies, which have ranged from the legit to not so legit. But a lot of them involve me cold calling and hitting up friends and family as potential “clients.”

I’ve applied to multiple organizations for a multitude of different jobs, some I’ve been qualified for, some I’m not 100% qualified for. I’ve got a lot of no’s and I have also gotten a lot of non-response from companies, which I am assuming is a less involved way of saying no.
What I would really like to do is get involved in project management or some type of implementation work. Essentially going out and teaching/training customers how to use our product. I like to travel and moving around the country has always interested me. Im also real interested in procurement, supply chain, and logistic type work.
What I am looking for is any direction, help, guidance, or any information that could help. Constructive criticism is welcomed. Maybe you have the same interests as me, maybe you’re in the field, or maybe you have some insight. Something, anything would be great."

and it's not like i'm not willing to make sacrifices; au contraire.

i would have actually stabbed my best friend in the back to get together with his ex and even got slightly physical with her... she told me that she doesn't want a relationship. cuz she decided to not have one until next year, cuz she hasn't been single in a while, and because she doesn't wan't to hurt her ex-BFs feelings... yeah, understandable, reasonable and i'm kind of a dick, but fuck you anyway, especially for the way you avoided me the last two months.

 ^^also, ^^thank ^^you ^^for ^^doing ^^this, ^^otherwise ^^i ^^still ^^wouldn't ^^be ^^over ^^you.

another potential love interest works with me, but just got out of a 11! year relationship with a good friend and ""blablabla i need time for myself now"", understandable, and actually i really like how we click at work, and we probably work better as friends anyway, so fuck you only a little.

^^also, ^^thank ^^you ^^for ^^being ^^amazing ^^at ^^your ^^job ^^and ^^in ^^general 

Then there's that girl that is just WAY out of my league at professional school. that woman is so HOT, and it seems like she doesn't even try to be, which makes her even hotter, which results in me secretly staring at her in vocational school whenever it doesn't look that creepy. she's nice, too, and i think we would fit together as well, but i have a really hard time getting a conversation going with her, and, of fucking course; turns out she has a boyfriend and is happy with him. i wish he got cancer or something. meh. 'Tis but a crush, i easily got over you.

^^but ^^i ^^still ^^can't ^^keep ^^my ^^eyes ^^of ^^you ^^for ^^long


Actually, i could deal with all of those. after some time. but this new episode of my non-existent love-life just seems to be a kick in the balls from some higher entity. i'm currently fucking PISSED at life. 

so 2 months ago, this really nice, beautiful girl showed up for trial work for and internship at my work. i show her around, get a really comfortable conversation going, i make her laugh, hoorray! I'll just wait 2 months until we work together, and there's BOUND to be romance. methinks. so fast forward, she starts working, we have a good time at work, she wants to hang out with me and my aforementioned female colleague after work, and i generally have that feeling that there were certain... cues. and just after i decided that i have to make SOME kind of move, she mentions that she's jealous when i tell her that two buddies came over for beers last night, because she has a temporary stay at work and doesn't know any one in that small town where i work.
well, i think now or never, i ask her if she would like to come to my town to hit this really nice bar for a drink... i just KNOW she would love it there. all of a sudden she's hesitant and says that she'd have to drive home afterwards, so she really couldn't have a beer. kind of dumbfounded (and also kind of woozy from last nights beers, joints and lack of sleep) i agree with her... but really, what else would i say in that situation. i mean, she seemed very open-minded to meeting new people, and didn't strike me as a person that NEEDS to drink to even consider going to a bar... and i sure do know that kind of people. then there's the quite obvious possibility of staying at my place... i did not even offer that since, you know, why embarass myself when i know the answer anyway.
in my wooziness i'm not exactly jumping from joy but not crushed either... until somebody calls for her to make an appointment. she says she doesn't have time because her B O Y F R I E N D and her have some kind of shitty plans that i cannot and do not wish to recall now or at any point in the future. 

alright. now i did feel kind of crushed. not that i showed any of that. i'm getting used to it. and i'm not letting it drag me down, because i fucking KNOW that i'm a good person, that i would make a great boyfriend, and an even greater husband and father... and also, that all my chances are going down the drain if i ever let myself think bad of myself again. fuck you though. fuck you really, really hard.

^^also... ^^i ^^still ^^enjoy ^^working  ^^with ^^and ^^talking ^^to ^^you ^^way ^^too ^^much

i am 27 years old and have never had a girlfriend. i'm a nice guy, attractive, intelligent, hard working, great at my job, and get to meet quite some women through work and school.

i'm nowhere near perfect, i am kind of an underachiever, used to be introverted and don't have that many friends. i have made some really stupid decisions in my past. but i worked hard to change myself into someone that i can respect and love, and others can, too. 

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS NO LOVE FOR ME IN THIS WORLD.

When I was still an intern a brand new 795 was sitting on the floor in our data center. It was staged, waiting to be hooked up. There was scheduled maintenance for Friday night, I don't recall the specific work but it involved rebooting a, separate, 795. 

So around 11PM the admin powers it back up. I don't remember specifics here either, I was mostly observing, but something was wrong. The 795 calls home, we put in a PMR with IBM and given our contract were supposed to receive a call back from a hardware person within the hour. That call never comes.

So around 2:30AM we finally get a hardware person on the line. Long story short, a CPU popped during the power cycle. The nearest replacement part was 8 hours away. 

Tell a bunch of guys who worked part of the day Friday, most of the evening through the night that they would have to wait 8 hours for a replacement part. No way. 

We work it out so that the part will come but in the mean time they are sending out a tech and we will cannibalize a drawer from the staged 795 to replace the broken part. Then when the part arrives from BFE the tech can place it in the staged 795. Kind of like musical CPUs. 

So a tech is on the way, eta ~1.5 hours. Someone asks if we know where the 795 is staged. ::blank stairs:: Five grown men descend on the data center. It's around 3:30AM now and we've got flashlights looking for this thing. I'm still new and have very little idea what I'm doing. I learned a lot of the DC layout that night. 

Finally we find this sucker. Just before the tech arrives. He understood the plan and I guess he did some thinking on the way there and starts telling us how he's going to have to mess with serial numbers since the new drawer will be different from the old and that's going to mess all kinds of things up. (He's telling me like I'm somebody important. I've been there a week and a half.) ""Sounds Good!"" and I walk away.

Around 5/6AM we get the green light to go home. Relief comes in and I went to sleep. I didn't follow up until Monday but apparently it did work. Happy ending but amazing still.

TLDR: If you have IBM products order N+1 devices so you have an ad hoc ""Parts Locker"" on hand.

These are fun. Screw you IBM."
1niyzo,1,2013-10-01,How do I get a grip?,nudelkopp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1niyzo/how_do_i_get_a_grip/,"Hey /r/depression. 

I'm in a weird place right now, and I just need to write some stuff. 

I have a good life. I recently graduated and I had a job the day after. I have a girlfriend who I love and who loves me back. I have good friends and I have a family that's really open and whole. I don't drink more than moderately and I don't do drugs.

Still, I'm far from happy. I'm constantly stressed, I feel aimless and I'm basically on autopilot throughout the day. I picked up smoking as a stress reliever, and now I can't stop. I don't workout anymore and I rarely cook even though I used to enjoy it.

I grew up in a small town in the middle of the Swedish forest. The best thing about that was how often I could be alone, and just not do anything.

Almost three years ago I moved to the capital to study. I've always been pretty ambitious, so I moved straight after highschool with the goal of getting a good job and to work with big brands. I've achieved that, both through my current workplace and prior internships I've worked with Nike, Phillips, Converse and WWF. I still haven't found a new goal, in a sense I feel done, but not like I actually completed it. It doesn't help that work right now feels like something I'm just supposed to do. Fuck spending 40h a week, 120h a month and 1440h a year on work just because 'that's how it's supposed to be'.

I want to be alone, since that's how I used to cope with stress. Just me and no one else for a few hours. That's what makes me calm.

My girlfriend loves me but she doesn't understand my need to be alone. We hang out everyday after work, and all weekends. If I propose a day where I can get some me-time she almost always starts crying. She's also depressed, but her problem makes her have difficulties coping with being alone. Good combination, right?

I think the trigger for my (young) depression was when I found a friends suicide note in his abandoned apartment. Don't worry, he's still alive. He just fled to turkey for a few weeks. We were really happy that he returned, but something just clicked in me that night when we found it.

On a lesser note I also feel fat and disgusting, but I feel pretty fine about that. I don't care that much about it.

I know that everything would get better if I just started doing something about my problems, like work out, find a new job or stop smoking. I've done it before. I just cant find the energy to do it this time. "

1nhhao,10,2013-09-30,"[Rant] I beat it before, this time is harder",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nhhao/rant_i_beat_it_before_this_time_is_harder/,"I am a 30 y/o male. I suffer from anxiety/depression.

*Wow, I don't think I have ever said before, or really come to terms with that, but I guess that is the case.*

Here is my story:

At the ripe age of 22/23 I experience my first 'mental breakdown.' Prior to this I was a somewhat normal 20 something. I had an normal upbringing, normal teen years and never had any sort of diagnosis or major ailment.

At 22/23 was the first time I have any sort of mental issue, other than the occasional blues. I was on vacation with friends in a foreign land and was not having a good time. I knew before I went it would be tough for me as I don't like sleeping out very much, let alone sleeping in foreign countries. I went away on a 2 week vacation and after 1 week I had to call it quits. I remember 'freaking out,' crying to my best friend saying, 'I have to get the hell out of this place.' He tried to calm and told me to just spend the day resting in the hotel, but I refused and booked myself the first flight out of the damn country.

Other than the idea that I had to absolutely get the hell out of the country; that was it. I think the lack of sleep, alcohol and homesickness just got to me. I returned home and was slightly depressed for a couple weeks. I remember just feeling mostly 'blue' that I had let all my friends down, but it passed. With that, I did get some slight anxiety at school (college; i started late) for a couple weeks but nothing so bad. In a matter of weeks I felt absolutely like my old self; ready to conquer the world.

Fast forward to the age of 24/25. I had my second mental 'breakdown.' I got a job in the big city that I had some serious issues with. I was just really unhappy with it. I hated the hours and I hated the commute. One day on the bus to work, I started to 'freak out.' I felt the overwhelming desire to spit. I am a smoker, and I had phlegm, and I wanted to spit. *I know this all sound absolutely mental, but it is true*...I realized I couldn't spit on the bus. I had no window to spit out of, no bathroom to go and spit. I started feeling really closed in on the bus and had to remove myself from the situation. I started to slightly hyperventilate; but nothing too bad and at the next stop (which was only about 3 stops after getting on the bus) I got off. I was freaking out a bit, got light headed and started to think, ""what the fuck is wrong with me?"" 

I immediately called the main source of positivity in my life; my mother. I told her I 'freaked out' on the bus and I didn't think I could go to work. She obviously told me all the things a mother should. ""you are ok, take a breath, relax for a minute and then try again. You are a grown man, you just got a little claustrophobic."" I took her advice and then after getting back on the bus I made it to work. I was fine after a slightly harrowing experience on the way there. On the ride home I vowed not to take that bus again and I never have since. I realized some days afterwards I started to feel slightly depressed. I continued to work the job for another four months. Even though I felt fine for a couple days after I had the bus incident, I noticed the following week, I started to feel major anxiety going into work. I connected the dots and knew that the job was a source of a lot of my anxiety. Lucky for me the 'job' was an internship. I ended it a couple/few months of going in almost everyday with crippling anxiety.

I actually felt fine when I was home though; or mostly fine. It was only when going into the job. So I did what any normal person who had no idea what an anxiety disorder was, would do...I left the source of my anxiety. And like that....I felt fine. No anxiety to speak of, for mostly anything. 

**For 17 months** I had no anxiety nor depression. That was until I lost an aunt. I was very sad about her death and it got me thinking about mortality. One night, in bed, I started to go down a road (mentally) I wish I never have. I started thinking about everyone I will lose in my life, everyone I love that will one day die. How did I respond to these thoughts? Well, I had a minor panic attack in bed, in my sanctuary. I woke up the next day very groggy. VERY groggy, to the point when I woke up, I said to myself ""feels like I drank last night."" When the afternoon hit I got a new, but slightly familiar feeling. That feeling was an upcoming major depressive episode. I lost interest in everything, and with depression came the anxiety. I had no idea, but the coming month would be the worst months of my life. The depression was absolutely crippling and the anxiety was like something I had never experienced. I would get anxious for the sake of getting anxious; sure I had trigger like everyone else, but it just seemed anything and everything would trigger it. There were days I barely left my bed. There were days **I was sure I would have to go to the hospital**. I can recall one afternoon, home in my mother's house (who is the only other occupant); she was at work, I was at home and I felt like I couldn't catch my breath. This lasted close to an hour and finally passed. It was the worst panic attack of my life and it was with me, in my bed, in my sanctuary, all by myself.

So what did I do? Mostly nothing. I took time off from work (freelance work from home) and focused on getting better. I had a huge support system that had no idea I was in so much inner turmoil. The only person who knew was my mom and she was huge in supporting me. She never brought it up unless I did and did everything in her power to keep me comfortable. I admit as a 27 y/o guy, living with his mom, I sometimes went upstairs and laid in bed with her. I am not ashamed; there's nothing as scary as irrational fear of nothing and everything and your mom is always your mom.

I tried to do something everyday; whether that was going for a bike ride with my cousin or stopping by a friends house to hang out. I tried to be optimistic even though I felt a huge void inside of me. I made gains daily, but also took many steps backwards. Within a month I could almost 'fake' it perfectly. Within 2 months, I actually started feeling mostly better after three months I all but forgot about the episode. Once I was out of the 'episode' I changed my life. I started exercising regularly (joined a gym) and started eating healthy. I quit smoking and started to have weekly activities planned. I got my own place to live and just enjoyed being in my late 20s, single and happy.

**I kept the demons away for over 3 years. In fact, 3 years and 2 months.**

That brings me to my current situation. I am going on week 5 of hell. About a year ago, stuff started to slowly fall apart. I had a major injury which essentially stopped my very activity exercise schedule. Once that healed I had major trouble getting back into it, and never really did. I started smoking cigarettes again, started eating most unhealthy (skipping meals, eating crap) and had problems at work.

I ended up giving up my own place and having to move back in with my mom, weeks before my 30th birthday. Typically, people would feel like absolute shit over this, but I really did not mind. I love living with my mom, maybe part of me feels bad about it, but that part is not conscious in me.

I think the financial stress started to get to me; I even had warning signs of an impending episode. I even said to myself one night after a long, long day ""man this is stress like I have never felt."" It was so long since that last 'episode,' I was cocky and thought I could never feel that shit again. I should have changed my habits that night, but instead I let the stress go on, I let everything pile up and then one day, **I had another panic attack.** I was driving and just started to feel closed in again. There was traffic which I have dealt with so many times, but this time it was different. I got freaked out. I had to get off of the road and I did. I ran from the fear, I got out of the traffic and made it to my destination.

Just like the last times, once I got to my destination, I felt fine. No anxiety in site. I was going to a BBQ with loads of people I didn't know. I laughed about the traffic with a friend and went on with the day. On my ride home, I avoided the traffic (just like I avoided the bus) and got home fine. I was in a great mood for 2 days and then, like a light was switched off; depression hit. I couldn't believe what I was feeling. Disinterest, loss of appetite, a void. It was like **night and day**. All of a sudden the very worst I have ever felt in my life had come back to me. My demons returned. With the depression came the general anxiety.

I am now in the midst of it all again and I ask myself, ""am I strong enough to pull out of this again?"" All the other times I did it on my own, but this time feels different. I am older, I am wiser and I know more about the horrors of the world. I have already been to see a doctor who prescribed me medication which I refused (for now); I have seen a therapist, told almost everyone in my family and my good friends and hired an herbalist to help me find a good mixture of something to get me feeling like my old self. These are all things I did not do last time.

In the previous 'episodes' I mostly ignored everything. I didn't do online research on cutting edge depression/anxiety treatments. I didn't use forums and read about everyone else's symptoms or diagnosis. I just did other stuff to occupy my time, but this time, I am absolutely obsessed with getting better. I have taken time off of work and tried to focus on getting better but I am already starting to feel like I am not strong enough this time.

At some moments I feel like this battle is too big for me."
1nhdhh,1,2013-09-30,Just need to vent - senseless self pity,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nhdhh/just_need_to_vent_senseless_self_pity/,"Hi reddit, just came here to post some shit that's been bothering me for a while. I know it's trivial shit, that others have problems a lot more troublesome than mine, or are in situations that are far more difficult to deal with. By all means, things are pretty good for me. I have close friends that I could talk with about anything. I'm doing really well in college, and I'm nearing graduation. I'm working at a paid internship for the moment, doing work at a prolific institution. I have family that is close and supportive. I'm not depressed. Despite all that, I need to get it out there anyways. Here goes.

In a lot of ways, I feel like a shell of a person. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life. I have always been a very reserved person, a sterotypical introvert in almost all regards. Recently, I've begun to realize I probably have some mild social anxiety. Meeting new people is a huge chore. Sometimes I can barely make conversation with close friends. Put into a situation where I know almost no-one, my brain just freezes. I can't get out of my own head enough to stop worrying about what to say.

At the crux of all this is a feeling of loneliness. As far as dating goes, well, let's just say it isn't. I can't put my loneliness into words, it's too deep. At the same time, I feel like I can't do anything to help myself. There's nothing really stopping me, but I just can't seem to do anything. I'm sickened at myself for this lack of motivation and apathy. I've been single for about five years. Prior to that I had dated someone for over 2 years and I was the happiest I had ever been. I really loved her. For whatever reason, she became more distant until she admitted that she was not in love with me, and our relationship ended. I don't blame her, we were (and still are) quite young, and everyone's got to play the field a little bit. 

In my first year of college, I partied a lot. I drank a lot. I earned a reputation as a party animal, a real wild person that could pound drinks. Having come off my relationship, I just wanted attention. At the time I didn't realize that I was getting the wrong attention. I had a lot of popularity, but it was just for my stupid drunken antics. I would drink until I passed out, maybe 3 times a week. 

During this time I never really tried to date as I was not over my breakup. However, time took its course and eventually I felt well enough to consider myself completely over my last relationship. Several months later I was pursuing another girl. We talked a lot, hung out (alone, together) etc. over the course of a few months, and eventually I went to ask her out only to find out she had a boyfriend, and had been dating him for quite a while and had never mentioned his existence. I was disappointed, but having been in a deep relationship for much longer, I was hardly affected by it all that much.

Yet for some reason, since that happened, I just stopped trying. I was never very good at randomly flirting with people, I mean hell I have a hard enough time trying to make new friends nevermind approaching people romantically. As time went on, I considered dating and flirting was what ""other people"" did, not me. Fast forward to today, and I've been out of it for so long I feel utterly powerless to change my situation.

Again, like I said before, I'm not depressed. I don't really feel sad, or angry. There's loneliness, a desire to reach out and share myself with someone... But if I had to describe my emotion in a word, I'd just say... flat. Or empty. It's like I don't feel anything, and I know I should. The closest I get to feeling anything like catharsis comes when I listen to sad music. If I felt more, I'd probably be motivated to do more. But I don't, so my constant inaction continues. Sitting here, thinking endlessly about my inexplicable self pity.

1nm6ry,0,2013-10-02,Rant/Where to go to find decent players?,mattizie,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1nm6ry/rantwhere_to_go_to_find_decent_players/,"Hello everyone,

I apologise for the long-winded post, but I have to get something off my chest.

I've been lurking r/DotA2 for quite some time now, every now and then there are very worthwhile good posts that appear. I particularly enjoy threads discussing strategy. Anyway, I used to play a fair bit of all pick, and then it got to the point where I was sick of losing, simply because we got outpicked, or my team went all full carry/retard. Following this, I found some temporary relief playing Captains Mode, strangely enough, I was captain for most of my games (before they added the button). And it really wasn't that bad; you could check each player's stats while waiting for the game to start, and it would give you an idea of their skill. Meaning if everyone had less than 50 wins, then it was drow, riki, ursa time. Then they got rid of it, and you had no clue any more, fair enough you see the odd guy that actually bothers to find out about this feature, and turns it back on, but most of the time you can only rely on commends, which are not a good indication at all.

Please skip this paragraph:
I didn't want this to turn into one of those threads about MM, but it really is beyond shit, one game I'm matched against a 600+wins pudge, the next I'm with idiots that don't understand what stack and pull means, or just as bad, ""hurr durr, a trilane is a stupid idea, no-one does that"", I can only facepalm hard. I hate to say it, but if LOL ever progresses to the point where roaming, pushing and different laning strats in general were viable, then I'd probably go play that. But fuck that.

Today I just finished a game ID#330924703. I was the QoP. And this game is what has pushed me to post my first piece of content on reddit. Teams are, in order of pick:
my team: Treant, weaver, rubick, AM, qop
opposition: warlock, PL, Sandking, Furion(prophet), pudge
Strat was weaver offlane, harrass/kill furion in jungle early, (living armor [LA] if needed), trilane top, rubick babysit, tree stacks, and LA is needed on AM, qop to harass pudge, deny runes.
What actually happened, tree went bot with weaver. they face a dual lane with prophet not in jungle (strange but weaver can still handle that, and PL gets less xp. AM is very very new, can't last hit, doesn't know how. Rubick decides to not buy anything (gets RoH), and last hits all game, doesn't harass or deny, or stack or pull, so AM can farm. Later in the game, I give up first blood to pudge stupidly, my bad, but not the end of the world. Then he goes on to hook AM, at this point we have nill vision of our jungle because rubick wants a bloodstone. And it just goes on from there, no vision, no carry, PL freefarms pushes down all three towers, no-one buys dust of course.

What I'd like to know is where does one go to get a decent team, are there any relevant forums where one may go to compile a team before starting a game? I'm Australian, but staying in Europe for an internship, so it's EU servers (fuckloads of Russians that don't or won't speak English). I'm not after legendary players, just those that understand basic concepts of the game, like warding, last hitting, farming (as opposed to pushing), stacking then pulling, that shit. I have 1000 hours, 300wins, 400 losses + abandons, though considering that a DC in pick stages counts as a loss, and that I learnt to play dota on this account, including experimenting with new heroes, I don't think that's too horrible.

My steam name is ""mattizie"", display name in dota is in Chinese characters; it translates to ""Australian"".
Thank you for your time, and apologies for the rant."

1nm4jp,15,2013-10-02,Preconception opinions (Wall of Text),[deleted],BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1nm4jp/preconception_opinions_wall_of_text/,"tl;dr - waiting to try, dad probably has alzheimer's: wwyd? 

Hi Bumpers,
I've been lurking r/babybumps for several months and created a new account unknown to my friends to ask this question.

I'm a 26yo woman and my husband and I have been married for 6 months - together for 8 years. I am in graduate school - I will graduate in May 2014 with a Master's degree. We currently have no children. We've been waiting (I've been waiting for a lot longer than we've been married!) until we've achieved some other important milestones. Of course, I want to be finished with school, and we would love to have a house first, which means that I'll need to find a job and be there for a few months before we're able to get a mortgage. Our current time-table is ""we'll look at where we are in a year before removing the 'goalie.'""

Well... today, my 56 year old father was diagnosed with early-onset dementia. We're getting some further testing before it's confirmed to be early-onset Alzheimer's. This is, literally, my worst nightmare. My dad's aunt had Alzheimer's toward the end of her life and it was the worst thing I've ever seen. I'd rather anything - ANYTHING - else above dementia. I've been praying since I was a teenager that none of my family gets dementia. And here we are... the most important man in my life has it while he's still young.

My dad is so amazing. He's the coolest man ever. A total badass. One time, he treated himself for a poisonous snake bite while hiking in the mountains. He's so smart and so strong and he's got a love for his family greater than I've ever seen in anyone else. I've always wanted my children to know my father, and now it's probable that my father will never know my children. I've been home, crying, all day. My husband came home on his lunch break and asked if I wanted to move up our ""trying"" time table.

At first blush, yes. I do. Deeply. But I don't know how conceivable (no pun intended) that is. Given that I've got some congenital uterine defects and some endometriosis, it could take us a while, and that really scares me. Every day is precious time now. But we're living off of my husband's 25k/year salary and my student loans + part time TA work. Next semester I'll be eyes-deep in an unpaid internship and won't be able to work at all. We're living in a crappy apartment and there's not a lot of room for a baby or baby stuff. Money is tight with just us and I so wanted a house of our own, and having a baby before getting a house would make a house harder to save for. I just don't know whether it's possible.

So my question is for you, bumpers and experienced mamas. How hard would it be to be a graduate student/intern while pregnant? How hard will it be to find a Master's level job when I've got an infant at home? How hard will it be to find affordable daycare (I ain't going into a lucrative business... my starting MSW salary will be about 40k/year)? How hard is it to live in close quarters with a baby? How hard is it to buy a house with a baby?

And... what would you do? Do you think it would be worth it so my dad might have a chance at knowing who his grandchildren are for a while before he loses the ability to recognize his family? Or do you think it's more valuable to give one's children the life you've been working so hard for?

Thanks. "
1nllbm,1,2013-10-02,Financial Due Diligence vs Audit (Traineeship)?,baribetti,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1nllbm/financial_due_diligence_vs_audit_traineeship/,"I have applied to the Big 4 company of my choice for the position of Audit intern, but also stated interest in Accounting Advisory (Risk Consulting) on 2nd place. After the aptitude test I got the call today for an interview. However, much to my surprise, it seems they are interested in having me in the DD team (Transaction Services line) rather than Audit (or even risk consultancy, that is).
I don't know which of them is more popular in my country, so I don't even know what to think - was my test ""not enough"" for audit or did they simply find my personality (judging by my cover letter) and skill set more fitting for DD. Or just simply trying to fill up that team because not enough applicants there... (?)

Now, I do know what Financial DD is by its definition, and it actually sounds very interesting ""on paper"" but I don't know much about the job itself - I don't know anyone who works in that service line, sadly.

So my questions are;

**1)** What are the key differences regarding the style of work between DD and auditing?

**2)** Which has better/more career opportunities (within the company / exits)? How about moving abroad - is it easier with either one?

*...and at last but not least the question I wouldn't dare to ask on the interview but can shamelessly do so here:*

**3)** Which one pays better (most likely there's no difference as a trainee but how about later in the long run)? :)

Bonus: Given my specific situation how would you prepare for this interview? Currently, I'm reading up on everything I can find about DD and gather my thoughts on what do I like about it / how I think I fit for it etc. Any advice other than that?

*Lastly, I'd appreciate any insight on the matter, so even if you don't answer any of those questions, I encourage you to put your 2 cents in.*

I'd like to persue a career in marketing, in particular social media marketing, I'm currently in a part of the world where this is a developing area so (theoretically) there should be plenty of opportunities. Unfortunately I have a contract until the end of June 2014, I'm unwilling to break it as there is a generous bonus waiting for me at the end, it's the only reason I stuck out the job last year, it would be a waste to walk away now.

I'm looking into a digital marketing course I can do online and I'm hoping to find some work experience or internship for two weeks I have off during April - hopefully then I will be able to go from there on a job-hunt.

My problem is my lack of experience / qualifications and my LinkedIn profile, obviously since I'm looking at social media and online related things it's necessary to have a profile that reflects that I'm capable. I don't want to outright lie on my profile but my current job is a teacher and I'm afraid that would put potential employers off when they see that.

How do I, in an honest way have my LinkedIn tell employers that I'm not ""just"" a teacher? Feeling really overwhelmed looking at my LinkedIn and am about to throw my laptop across the room with frustration.

So my SO (lets call him Dave) and I are in a long distance relationship and have been for a little while now.  We are about 700 miles apart which is a 2 hour plane ride.  Both of us are college students however he is a bit more financially stable than I am.  Dave has visited me once already, and I'm going to visit him next week.  Our time apart has averaged about 4-5 weeks long (I know thats not a long time compared to some other TRULY long distance couples but its still a struggle), and we've tried to keep up the goal of seeing each other once a month. 

Unfortunately, I'm beginning to struggle a lot with money, and it looks like I won't be able to visit him at all after next week for who knows how long. I've been looking for jobs/paid internships but no success so far (I guess I'll have to try harder). I'm graduating this year which means that I'll be on my own starting May 2014. I'll have to find a job where I would be making enough money to support myself.

Dave said that its not a problem if I can't visit him, because he'll just use his own money to visit me once a month. I honestly would not be able to sleep at night knowing that he would be spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars to see me while I would only be visiting him once. When I told Dave how I felt, he said that he can't be with me if we can't see each other at least once a month (two months at most) because thats not a relationship.

I really love him and I know he loves me too. However I love him too much to put him through all that trouble. His family and friends would eventually resent me, and maybe he will end up eventually resenting me. 

What should I do? Is it bad that I can't meet him halfway? Help!

**TL;DR**: LDR Boyfriend is more financially stable than I am and willing to use his hard earned money to travel 700 miles to see me every month while I can't afford more than a single flight. Bad that I can't do the same for him?"
1nk3ud,6,2013-10-01,Just for a minute,GoodAtExplaining,jazzyhiphop,https://www.reddit.com/r/jazzyhiphop/comments/1nk3ud/just_for_a_minute/,"I want to take some time out to thank all the people who post in /r/jazzyhiphop. Bear with me for a minute, y'all have done great things, and I want to tell you how.

My best friend. I've known him since we were 12, bumping Snoop Dogg and The Fugees on his basement stereo. We both grew up in Toronto, but he bounced for university in Hamilton (An hour and a half away), while I stayed in the T Dot. He went on to get a masters in biology and virology, and we still chilled. And as we got older, the music went further, from Snoop to Dre, and then when we were filling our brains with knowledge, it was Common, Kweli, and ATCQ. Though our paths diverged in life and intellectually, the music kept us around each other, reminiscing like listening to T.R.O.Y.

I haven't seen him in two years. 

Life has taken us in different directions - He studied overseas to become a doctor, and came back to Canada to intern at a hospital in Winnipeg (About three thousand kilometres from Toronto). I took a great consulting job not too long ago, in the next province over, about six hours' drive. Two years is not a long time, but when you're used to someone being around in your life like tomatoes in the summer, it's strange to not have them around, like waking up with a twinge in your shoulder that never quite goes away.

Last weekend, I went to see him. It was like meeting a long lost brother. For the entire weekend, we bumped joints I picked up from /r/jazzyhiphop, from Asheru to Jeru The Damaja to Pete Rock and InI. With the music, the edges of our personalities that had grown as we spent time apart, were smoothed over. I felt like I had a brother again. Every now and then 

I just wanted to say thanks, peeps. Y'all did a great thing, even by doing something small.

Feel free to share some good stories around the music you've posted to/heard about from this subreddit. 

Thank you, one love. "
1njucf,1,2013-10-01,Worried about my own feelings for my girlfriend.,eCh2aa4A,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1njucf/worried_about_my_own_feelings_for_my_girlfriend/,"Alright, here's how I'm going to do this. I'm going to express my problem up-front, and then provide all the background information after as optional further reading.

**Basically**:

I'm feeling conflicted about being with my girlfriend. I start to feel like I don't want to be with her, and that it's ""just not right."" But I don't want to feel this way. She's been a good girlfriend, and I enjoy being with her when I *do* feel right.

I have a shrink. I go in feeling like I'm freaking out about things, and that surely I'm not in love with her and just want out of it, and that it just doens't feel right. I ask him if this is my legitimate position, or if something else is making me feel this way (hoping that he'll tell me that I don't actually have a problem with the relationship itself). He thinks it's a fear/anxiety/attachment thing. I'm instantly relieved, and I'll text, call, or visit her the moment I leave his office and tell her how happy I am to have her. I feel good for a few days before the worry starts eating at me again.

I'm tired of feeling numb, and I'm tired of obsessing over my perceived feelings (or lack thereof) for my girlfriend. I'm tired of thinking about breaking up all the time. I'm tired of feeling like I'm stringing her along when my feelings don't line up the way I want them to. And I sure as hell don't want to end a good relationship just because my worry is tricking me into thinking I don't want it. 

I'm moving into my own place pretty soon, and I know she's going to be spending a lot of time there (most days during the week, probably). I think I'm fretting about that, because of everything I've written here and possibly just because even by itself, that's a big step. 

One other detail: things that remind me of her will often induce a feeling of anxiety, proportional to how worried I already am at the time. I guess that's not anything too significant, but there it is.

Sound familiar to anyone? Any coping strategies? Thanks.

**Background info**

My girlfriend and I started dating at the beginning of 2012. She was my first. I knew from the beginning that she would be leaving for law school, and she told me that would probably be the end of it. I had eight months to change her mind, I thought. Nine months later, one month into her internship, I broke up with her because she wasn't putting time into the relationship. To her credit, she made a ton of progress in being open with her feelings and caring about the relationship. It just didn't go far enough.

I don't remember a lot of how I felt during that nine months, but at certain times I'd have ""worry storms"" (as I call them) where I'd obsess and feel doom over things, often a different thing every day. It wasn't always that way, but there were periods whjere I just wanted out. I'd think of things like the fact that she smoked (like two cigarettes a week) or that she was getting a tattoo (which was totally fine once she actually got it). But near the end, things seemed to be getting good. Then it ended.

Eight months passed. During this time, she had two... flings?... with a couple of guys (not at the same time), driven by her sinking into a deep depression, she tells me. She has bouts of depression now and then, and has attempted suicide in the past (middle school). She's been in therapy, but her insurance didn't cover it. I'm trying to encourage her to go back, and she promises that she will. Anyway, she's been doing really well since that low at the end of last year. 

Meanwhile, in spring of 2013, I started seeing this other girl I met on OkCupid. She's pretty cool, but I have issues with her, and most of them don't seem that major in retrospect. But it didn't really feel right. I would oscillate between feeling good about her to feeling like I wanted out. I felt really conflicted. I got a really simple email from my ex, and she was on my mind a bit. I was staying over at the new girl's place that night, and I had to leave in the middle of the night because I just felt so wrong being there. I wanted to be with my ex instead.

I started talking to my ex for about a week. I'm loving talking to her. I'm talking to her all the time, and the hope for us to be back together is there. All that. Then she tells me what happened during the months we weren't talking. It hurt. Really, really bad. I noped out of that, but told her I cared about her and offered the best advice I could. I went back to New Girl. 

I was with New Girl for a while longer, and would periodically hear from my ex. I was respectful of New Girl and didn't draw out any conversations with Old Girl. But I started feeling conflicted about New Girl again, and eventually broke it off with her. By the time that happened, I was itching to talk to my ex (Old Girl) again. I did. 

We started talking. Eventually we met. I hadn't seen her in about nine months. She was so *beautiful*. It felt so right to be with her again. Over a few weeks, we negotiated. Talked a lot. She's going into the Peace Corps in April of 2014, so that's obviously a concern. Established some boundaries. Discussed how we felt about things. I mulled it over to the best of my ability and took her back. She said she had changed, and wanted another chance.

As far as I can tell, she has changed and has been a very good, attentive, girlfriend.

And I feel conflicted. Not as much at first, but over time. The Peace Corps thing really bothered me, but eventually I kind of sort of made peace with it (lol). Or maybe I didn't. I don't know. I feel weird being around her sometimes. I just want out sometimes.

I have a talk with my shrink every two weeks, he reassures me that I have anxiety and/or attachment issues, and I feel instantly better. I leave his office and text her immediately, telling her how much I love her and how I can't wait to see her again. I feel this way until something sets me off again, like her being in a bad mood or something like that.

**tl;dr**: Read ""basically"" above, then ""background info"" if you need it. "

His room is under mine and the noise he makes drives me insane. He's Turkish and plays extremely irritating, droning Turkish music that I try to drown out by playing good music over it. He's also fond of the bad ""Creed."" He laughs manically at whatever about fifty times a day. He sings (irritating, droning Turkish songs - off key.) Sometimes he loses his temper and starts shouting to himself in Turkish - which always makes me jump.

I'll be in the living room, trying to eat my lunch in peace and he'll come in and launch into a twenty minute monologue about the problems he's having with his internship and other boring shit. He's never asked me a single question about myself.

I don't mind sharing food or other supplies and will borrow some milk or bread from my roommates now and again. But he used an entire bottle of expensive olive oil that I bought. Like, the bottle is empty. I don't know what he did with it, but it's gone now. Where did it go???

Tonight he started a long, long Skype conversation at midnight. It's now 1.20 AM. I have to be up at 6 for work. An hour ago I told him I couldn't sleep because of the noise (nicely). He dismissively told me that he would ""be quiter"" then continued at the same volume. He doesn't have an indoor voice - only slight variations of loud. 

The fantasies in which I murder him become more and more elaborate each day.

1noa1n,0,2013-10-03,"I'm a rookie looking for a first Motorcycle, where do I look?",[deleted],motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1noa1n/im_a_rookie_looking_for_a_first_motorcycle_where/,"Basically, I just want to know how to find a good deal in North Carolina. Here's a list of things I want from the bike to direct your advice more efficiently. I want to know how to bargain effectively, what to look for, and what a good low (read:not too high for a rookie) maintenance bike would be. I'll add background in the end if you're interested/in case it'll help.

**Requirements:**

1.) Under $4K, 500-750CC Cruiser

2.) In North Carolina, within a 40 minute drive of Davidson. I won't go further unless it's a really good deal.

3.) No older than 2001

4.) Shaft Driven, Liquid cooled. This is more about having a bike that'll last. It's negotiable if you can thoroughly convince me against it.

**Preferred:** These are things we both agreed on that would make a perfect bike. If I'm paying the full 4K budget, it would have to have all of these checked.

1.) Sissy bar+passenger seat, so that when I'm confident in about a month or so, I can bring a friend riding.

2.) Budget is 4K but I would love to have it be sub 3K.

3.) Model Year younger than 2006

4.) Any shade of red, possibly with white or black. Or any of the darker shades of green, possibly with black/white

5.) If you think you have a lead that I'll be interested in (I'm still relatively new here so I don't know how this works really), just telling you ahead of time. On principle I will not ride a bike that has noticeable amounts of any shade of Yellow, Purple, Blue, or Brown. 

**Experience:**

I took my MSF course in late July this year (2013). I learned incredibly quickly and apart from a little line-crossing in the tight maneuvers part of the test I had perfect scoring, plus perfect in the written test. The week after I spent a couple days riding my friend's 1999 Suzuki Intruder (1500 CC, 800+ lbs). I weigh 135 and was riding in NYC, but I handled the bike fairly well and without incident. Haven't ridden in a month, but I do ride my bicycle alot so that kinda helps?

**Background**

A good friend/relative is letting me pick his next bike. We have similar views on what a nice bike is/runs like/looks like, so he gave me a budget of 4K to get one. I take this as more of his last test to me, testing my ability to find good deals on my own since he can easily find his own bike and would be able to do so more easily than me. He paid for my MSF course and basically kindled my love for motorcycles, he's taught me everything I know so far so it's not a stretch to think that this would be a kind of a final test to kick off the training wheels. Obviously I'm going to talk to him before pulling the trigger on a deal. That said, to me, the 4K would be stretched to a rreeeeally good deal and/or the perfect bike. I don't want to use the whole budget on a bike that's just good enough/close enough. 3K would be more the ceiling if it isn't ""perfect"" and/or close. He's been riding for years, so I want to get something that he could enjoy but also something that would still be fun to ride once I'm more experienced. I have alot of room to practice on roads (I'm currently in a small college town) and alot of space to really run the bike once I'm confident in my skills. My friend and I are from New York, but I'm in NC for school. The plan is I get his bike down here, ride it and practice on the practically empty roads, and then he'll drive down, put the bike on a trailer, and I'll drive us and the bike to NY so he can have it for the spring. In the summer if I'm not in the city, he might let me take either the new bike or the Intruder as transportation for any internship I may land. If I'm in the city, we'll go on rides together. He paid for my MSF course and basically fired up my interest in riding, so I really want to get a good deal for him."

I was terminated because I was put on a 60 day probation period to improve performance and on day 40 they kicked me out. It's funny because I had an internship with another company and they didn't give me the full-time offer so now with me being terminated I really question myself and feel like a piece of shit.

I thought I was improving and thought I met expectations of people but apparently I didn't. I don't feel self aware and I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. It seems like I don't understand how people view me and don't understand what I say or how my actions have implications. Lets say work wise for example, I miss minute details and don't pay have a attention to detail skill set because I would be doing a project and think I did something that needed to be done but when I get review points for it, I am surprised I missed it. 

It's hard for me to express how I feel right now because I feel like a hopeless asshole. I've always been depressed but events like these send me down a deep rabbit hole. "

My longest relationship (~2 years) ended about 2 years ago, and not well. It messed me up for awhile, but for the past year or so, I've really enjoyed being single. I'm a senior in college, and after my internship I plan to travel anywhere and everywhere that I can, which is a big reason why I picked the major I did. 

My boyfriend also had a bad relationship that ended a few years ago. This sent him into a whirlwind of drug abuse and depression that he came out of last year. He's never been to college, never moved out of his parents' house, and does not own a car. He's a great person. Really sweet, caring, loving, etc. 

He contacted me on Facebook at the beginning of the year, but we never got too serious about talking because we lived in different cities. Around the beginning of the summer, we both attended this music festival (with separate groups, although we had hung out a few times prior) and we hit it off. Inseparable ever since. 

We live pretty far apart, and without him having a car, this gets frustrating. I didn't really mind, but as far as I know, he has no money saved towards buying one and although he is appreciative of me driving always.. I feel like this is something he should take upon himself. 

That isn't the big issue, however. The bigger issue is that lately, everything I say, he gets offended by. I'm really not attracted to sensitive men, and I have a pretty rude sense of humor. On many more than a few occasions, he has become hostile/offended by something that I said out of complete innocent humor. Also, he gets very offended when I correct/disagree with him. He has know-it-all tendencies, as do I, but I'd like to think that I can admit when I'm wrong, or at least accept it.

Keep in mind, he's a really great guy, otherwise. Not that these qualities are deal-breakers, but since I've never really been in a healthy relationship, I'm not sure if they're red flags or not. 

tl;dr I'm really confused by my boyfriend's behavior. He's easily offended, and way too dramatic/serious."

1nmsf6,5,2013-10-02,Ex of 1.5 yrs [21M] gave hope of getting back together with me [21F] not sure what to do or how to get over it,xyggz1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmsf6/ex_of_15_yrs_21m_gave_hope_of_getting_back/,"So my ex and I dated a year and a half. Things were not so great towards the end. We could have worked on our problems and were actively doing so when he found out he got an internship requiring him to leave in two months for four months. Given our issues we decided to break up a few weeks after finding out he got the internship, rather than delay the inevitable.

Well, that was three months ago. He's back in January. I took it terribly at first, and additional issues with my father made it a very stressful time, given my ex had been my emotional support through thick and thin. We had been best friends for years before dating. Then I started to feel better.

Or so I thought. The ex and I kept talking on and off via text/facebook about very mundane stuff just to make his coming back easier. As we were friends before dating and have all the same friends, I have no choice but to keep talking to him if I don't want to up and find a new group of friends. Anyways, the conversation gradually got less volatile and eventually it was pleasant. It got to a point where I began missing him terribly. 

After we broke up I kept telling myself I felt like crap because I just missed being in a relationship. But it has been three months and I miss *him*. I've had other shots at new relationships but I only want him. We were friends for so long that I could be completely myself with him - and better than that, he loved me exactly as I was. Forgive how corny this sounds but I gave him my whole heart, and I don't think I'll ever get it all back. 

So just this week on monday, I, in a moment of weakness, ask him to call me. We end up talking for three hours. It was the best I have felt in so long. I confess I still have feelings for him, and he confesses the same and I am on cloud 9. He says there is no harm in trying to date again because the worst thing that happens we break up again after a month, and everything is the same it was anyways. He's coming back to town in two weeks for the only time until January and he asks to see me and I don't hesitate before saying yes. 

Well if that had been the end of it, I wouldn't be posting here. Last night, 2 o'clock in the morning, he calls me. Says he wasn't thinking straight. We are still going to be apart for too long to be making this type of decision. Says he doesn't want to do a half assed pseudo long distance relationship and he doesn't want to lead me on in case his feelings change. I tell him my feelings haven't changed and I don't see them changing and that I am willing to take the risk - that if I get hurt, then it is my own fault and I will deal with it - but he won't hear me out. He says if we still want to hang out in two weeks we can, but it will have to be as friends. He says if, in January, the feelings are still there - only then can we think about getting back together. 

I just can't believe it. He gave me this hope, and then 24 hours later, he ripped it away from me. I'm crushed. And when he was trying to console me he said if he were to come home tomorrow he wouldn't hesitate before trying again. He immediately followed it by saying I should try to move on. How am I ever supposed to move on if he leaves the door open a crack like that? And so many of our problems have been resolved. He was broke, and felt bad about going on dates, but now his intership is paying him more money than he knows what to do with. I was a stress case working all the time and writing the MCAT and couldn't commit the time we deserved together. Now I have so much free time I don't even know what to do with myself. And honestly, maybe all it is, is that it took me losing him to realize that I don't want anybody else.

I said I would wait for him to come home and not pursue anyone else, but he said he couldn't ask me to do that because it's too selfish on his part. He is a very generous, unselfish person and this doesn't surprise me. But I just can't take it. I was struggling to move on before when I thought we didn't have a chance in hell, and now that he's given me this hope, I don't know how I ever will. I still love him. I miss him so much. Nothing I can say or do will change his mind.

So now what? I feel like I just got the rug ripped out from under me. I haven't eaten since monday, which is exactly what happened when we first broke up. Am I getting broken up with all over again? And why do I care about him so much still! Why can't I want somebody that wants me and knows it and would wait those months for me. Why is it that with him, I can't listen to my own reasoning? I know getting hung up on him is a dangerous road to go down, and yet here I am. 

Reddit, I am totally helpless here. I need some advice. What the hell do I do now :( 

**TLDR** Boyfriend gets internship requiring him to leave for 4 months - we have pre-existing problems that we don't think will survive a LDR, so bf becomes ex-bf. Many issues resolve over time and this week we talk on the phone for 3 hours and he suggests getting back together. 24 hours later, he takes it back, and now I am devastated. Need advice about what to do now..."

I'm an autistic 18-year old boy from the netherlands. Let me tell a bit about myself. **The most important bit of this wall of text, for me, is the part with ""over-analyzing thoughts"". Please just read that part and try to answer it, and if you ignore the rest of the text that's fine to me.**

**My History (skip this if you don't want to read this)**

My past 4 years weren't that great, especially the last year. From the age of 14-17 i was generally insecure, had a lot of moodswings, and i didn't do much for school. Couldn't concentrate and wasn't motivated at all for school. I gamed a whole freaking lot in that period. In fall 2012, things started to get even worse and i sometimes felt pretty depressed, sometimes i felt a bit better, but it wasn't great. My doctor prescribed me antidepressum. And even though it prevented me from feeling really depressed, i was still a bit down and wasn't living my life the way i wanted it to be. In mid january 2013 it changed from slightly bad to miserable. I stopped using the medication because i wasn't satisfied with it. I stopped instantly without decreasing the doses and without informing my doctor. I actually felt good after stopping to take it, for the first 15 days... Then one evening, i started to feel very weird. I felt anxious, it scared me, i didn't know what it was. It became intenser. Every thought, everything that happened around me seemed to be too much to handle. I was almost panicking. I laid in bed and just tried to sleep and told myself that the next day it'd be over. But the next day it wasn't better, it was worse. I didn't know what was happening and i was very tempted to call an ambulance. I didn't. I went to school that day which was a very bad day at school. I called my mother, told her that i was freaking out. I can't remember everything exactly what happened that day, but it was really bad. The next day was the same story. Very f*cking anxious, feeling hopeless, didn't know what to do. I remember that evening talking with my mother, feeling incredibly depressed and just having no hope. Those two days were problably the worst days of my entire life. You don't know what mental suffering is until you've experienced something like that. It's sad to know that there are still so many people suffering from panic disorders and severe depressions. They should be offered some program instead of lame weekly therapy sessions. Not saying therapy doesn't help, but it's not as effective as the program i followed. I'll get back on that in a bit. Ontopic again. That evening i send a long mail to my therapist describing everything that was going on. It felt good to share it, though it still didn't take away my worries. I browsed on the internet that evening, and i found out i had a panic disorder. Before that i was never familiar with something like that. Before all this, I honestly thought that people with a panic or anxiety disorder were just  
some random freaks just being a pussy. I know better than that know. I found a long article which described exactly what i was dealing with, and how to get out of it. From that point on the sharpest edges of my panic disorder were gone. Though i still felt a lot of anxiety and moments were i was about to lose my mind and panic. It went with periods. There were periods where i felt okay and my mind was relatively calm (not happy, but not too bad either), and periods were i was caught up in my mind all day worrying about every little thing and not trying to panic. There wasn't too much improvement and my life still generally sucked until... i guess about half march. I browsed on the internet and found an CD-course that was directed at people with panic and anxiety disorders. I was a bit sceptic, didn't know what to think of it at first. But after i watched the introduction video, it convinced me. The guy claimed to have experienced panic attacks himself too, and he got out of it. He seemed very genuine and honest about it. And the main point that convinced me, was that you could try it for free for the first 8 weeks. Weren't you happy with your purchase at that point, then you could simply not pay and you wouldn't get the last 8 weeks of the program. So i tried it out for free (2 dollar shipping costs but let's disregard that). And it was the best choice i could ever make. It was focused very much on my own actions and thought patterns. He was giving you the tools to overcome your panic disorder, you were the one using it. The next couple of months, my panic attacks and my anxiety slowly disappeared.

2 months ago, i started doing pickup. Basically i wanted to become really good with girls. i started off really motivated, but as time progressed and i wasn't getting the succes i wanted, that motivation started to disappear and it started to feel more like an chore than it felt like something i wanted to do. it didn't feel good anymore, so my progress kinda stalled a bit. I used to go to the city every day to talk to girls, now i do it more like once or twice a week, usually going out with friends. Last saturday i met this really beautiful woman i thought i had an connection with, i got her number, and i asked her to go out with me on text. Unfortunately she refused to go. It kinda hurted. Because this is not the first time some girl refused or ignored me on text. It happened like 10 times already and i haven't had any succes yet. It's starting to hurt, yet i keep trying to be positive about this, and i won't give up. If there's anything i'm not, then it's an quitter. I learned, however, that doing pickup as an chore, something you feel like you have to do but you don't enjoy it, that's not good. Even when you feel like shit and really don't wanna talk to girls but you still do it, it won't make you feel any better and it even won't improve your pickup skills. Why? Because your mind at that moment automatically links negative emotions to pickup, so you need to do it with some motivation and  joy because otherwise you will start to feel worse and worse doing pickup.

**Mood swings**

So yeah, recently i started to have mood swings again. I can tell you an example of how this goes with me. Let's say today. I go to school, i go to english class, i feel relatively okay. I'm in a new class with new people though i'm not nervous at all. i talk, i'm myself. I'm a bit annoyed though that there is a hot girl behind me but i don't really have anything to talk with her about. I get in front of the class and introduce myself in front of the whole class (30 people or something). I was a bit nervous doing that, but not that much. Maybe i sounded a bit weird, but i didn't care too much. In the past few months my anxiety of doing things like that have decreased dramatically. Then i have lessons with my regular class with people i already know pretty well. At some point, i have a long private conversation with my internship mentor. And somehow, at the end of the conversation, i feel a little bit different. Though the conversation wasn't bad at all, i felt worse afterwards. I felt this annoying feeling again and in the next hour i started to feel insecure. It's a feeling where you can't rationalize things well and you just feel insecure and your brain feels foggy and unclear. These moodswings started to occur since saturday. Before that there weren't really such severe moodswings if i remember correctly. I used to have this during and before my panic attacks started, but i can't recall such severe moodswings since i've recovered. Before saturday i felt generally okay and i never felt really socially insecure, since saturday i do. Actually, sunday till wednesday i felt pretty down. Thursday was better, though not great, today was as good as yesterday. 

I can tell of a few possible reasons for my moodswings and bad feelings:

- The disappointments of my pickup failures, especially that girl from saturday.

- Relapse from NoFap :
I think this one is the most likely. I sexted with this girl last saturday which problably got a bad imbalance in my dopamine levels.
Check out this link for more information of what i'm talking about:

- Doing meditation the wrong way (very unlikely)
I'm doing meditation right now, but i'm not doing it consistent. I'm not sure how often to do it, when to do it, how long to do it. I read an article that it can actually be bad when you meditate inconsistently and/or too long

Anyway, do you guys have any idea what might cause these sudden moodswings, i'm not sure at all. It's weird.

**Over-analyzing thoughts**.

Because i'm autistic, i tend to over-analyze a lot of stuff in my life. Sometimes i don't know what the best option is in a certain situation, and then my brain starts to analyze it all but it doesn't work because it's such an abstract concept. i want to understand everything logically. I'm a very logical person. Whenever there's a concept that i don't know the best solution for straightaway, i want to know what is the best option in such a situation, i'll give you my main point that is wrapped up in my head:  

- Time management:

I do not know in which order and when to do certain tasks or activities. I really can get caught up in this in my head. let's say there is this girl i wanna text. There is an possibility that we get something going on. Then when do i text? Do i text her straightaway, regardless of some other activity i'm doing? do i text her after my activity? 

And let's say i'n not currently busy with something, and i have the time to text this girl, but i simply don't feel like it. Would that be an excuse to do it later? It's not a chicken excuse so i don't have to do it or something, it's just that i genuinly feel more comfortable with sending her a text at a different time then now, but would i use it as an excuse to not do it right now? 

The concept that bothers me the most is the 5-minute concept (i called it that way). I really can't figure this one out in my head.

one situation as an example: i text a girl, she texts back, i propose a meetup, she agrees with it. We meet up, we have a good conversation, we go to her appartment, we have sex, i have a really good time. I feel energetic and good again. 

And now, let's say the exact same thing happened, but all happened just 5 minutes later. Does this mean that the first situation grants you 5 minutes more happiness in life? If this was a single occuring event i would understand that it also ends 5 minutes earlier, but what if it's the beginning of a streak where you rack up a lot of girls, get really happy, achieve everything in life you want, but just 5 minutes earlier than the other situation? That would give you 5 minutes more happiness in your life, right?

See, this is a concept that i cannot simply comprehend because it involves too many factors and it just makes my brain a mess when i try to analyze something like this. Yet i know, that if i got a solid answer on how to comprehend this concept and i would understand it, that at that point i would be able to let it go. I'm serious, that is how my brain works. When i understand it, i can let it go. I've had this with multiple concepts in my life before. It's just because my autisctic brain won't allow me to ignore something i'm not able to comprehend.

**TL;DR**

Bad teenage years, got a panic disorder and recovered from it. Now i'm  mentaly relatively healthy again, yet not completely.

I got some moodswings and i don't really know why i have them.

But the most important thing: I'm not able to comprehend a certain concept. It's a concept confuses me and holds me back. 
Let me explain: When you do the things that will make you happy 5 minutes (or a certain time period) earlier in your life, you will feel 5 minutes of more happiness in your life. 

True or not? So does that mean i should do things that make me happy right f*cking now, disregarding of how i feel about it and what i'm doing at the moment? And with so many different factors it just seems impossible for me to comprehend this. But my mind won't allow me to ignore and forget something before i truly understand it. Can you guys help me with this?"

I'm currently a sophomore at a state university in Southern California. Because California will be changing their CPA eligibility requirements next year to require 150 units, I'm trying to decide what path would be best for me to go down in order to reach the 150 units and at the same time get an education that gives me as many options as possible in my future (ie. should I not go to grad school because I'll want to do that later in my career, or should I definitely go to grad school because firms will be expecting MAcc's). I'm assuming that if I want to go public after I graduate, I will need to be CPA eligible, please correct me if I'm wrong. Would it be better for me to get a double major, one in Accountancy and one in Management Information Systems (would this double major even fulfill California's new stricter rules?), or would it be best for me to go to grad school and get a MAcc?

On top of this, in this new five year school schedule required to get 150 units, what is the overall schedule of what things I should be doing and when assuming I want to work Big 4 after college? Here's my guess based on what I've researched so far, please add anything or correct anything if I'm wrong!

* Sophomore Year - Get good grades, participate in campus clubs, volunteer, join accounting society

* Summer after Sophomore Year - Attempt to get internship (unpaid?) at smaller local CPA firms

* Junior Year - Same as Sophomore, get more involved with Accounting society and join Beta Alpha Psi, go to meet the firms type events and network with recruiters

* Summer after Junior Year - Attempt to get Summer leadership program at Big 4, intern at small local CPA firm

* Senior Year - Apply for summer Big 4 internship during the fall

* Summer after Senior Year - Intern at Big 4, or other large firm (BDO, McGladrey), receive job offer (hopefully)!

* Senior Year pt 2/MAcc - If internship went well, work hard in school, don't mess up job offer, if not work on networking and finding future job opportunities

* Graduation! - Begin the joy of working in a large CPA firm

Thank you for your time reading this, I'd appreciate any advice I can get to steer me down the right path!"

I'm fairly new to NoFap, and for people who don't know whether or not it will work, they can read a day-by-day account of what I'm going through. I will be posting every seven days. Even if I relapse I will continue. 

A tiny splurge about me so you can get an idea of what my life was like before NoFap:

-19 year old college student, Asian American

-I've PMO'd around 10-15 times a week, daily.

-Before writing this, I deleted 56 gigabytes of porn. 

-I've been trying NoFap for 2 months now. Never made it past three days. Edged almost every time. This time, no edging, no PMO

-I am doing NoFap because I want to see what happens. I want to experience and log the changes in my mind and body as I go through this process. I also want to spend less time on PMO... it takes up time that I could be using doing almost anything else, which is more productive. I also believe that if I can take control over my urge to fap, I will be able to control my other urges as well. Such as my urge to eat, so I can lose some weight.  

Anyways, let the progress tracking begin. Start date: 09/24/2013 12AM

----------

**Day 1**: No significant changes. 

**Day 2**: Began drinking more water. I really want to fap, this is pretty difficult. This sounds weird and gross to some but urinating a lot turns me off. If I'm horny, I just pee, and boom, no more horny. So the water is helping a lot. 

**Day 3**: Began cold showers. Makes me feel like a MAN when I step out. Such an amazing feeling. Might be getting me a bit sick though...

**Day 4**: Edged a little. Not too disappointed since I've never made it past three days before. I will forgive myself this time but next time I edge I will reset this counter. 

**Day 5**: Today was fairly easy since I wasn't in the room for very long. Looking at girls go out and party about wearing skimpy clothing just reminds me of porn. You hear that? Looking at REAL people reminds me of PIXELATED PORNOGRAPHY. That's the kind of thought process that I want to get rid of permanently. 

**Day 6**: Relapse. Unfortunate, but this is a big step. This is by far the longest I've ever gone since I was probably 12 without any PMO. Unfortunately, my stupid ass brain decided to relapse 3 more times. Now I am disappointed.

------------------------------------

**Day 1**: I think my brain is still working to adjust itself to no porn. I no longer have the urge to watch porn. Even though I relapsed pretty badly yesterday, I think I can still make it. I made a new decree for myself: If I want to fap, I step in the cold shower, no excuses. It really helps me control my horniness. Cold showers shrink the dong so much that I can't even bring myself to TRY and get horny anymore. Even if I want to edge, I shower. If I don't want to constantly take off my clothes, I'm gonna have to stop thinking about edging and fapping.

**Day 2**: Just semi-asked a friend on a date. I have never done this before. My girlfriend throughout high school asked ME out. Yep, I never asked anyone out for anything in any way before. Any sexual relations I've had thus far was when I intoxicated. And I was able to semi-ask someone out today. I don't want to go into too many details, but I feel more confident already. I also have four internship interviews going on at the same time, maybe that contributes a bit. Now, before I even step outside, I take a quick 5 minute cold shower. Helps a LOT with my confidence, I feel like such a boss after being able to handle it. 

**Day 3**: Cold showered before an internship interview with a pretty prestigious firm. Really boosted my confidence in the matter and I think I did well. Cold showered before the ""date."" Turns out she didn't consider it a date. But then I did something I've never done before in my life. I asked her out, no bullshit, no beating around the bush. Straight up. She said no. But right now, for some reason, I am more happy at the fact that I even had the balls to ask her than I am disappointed that she said no. In fact, I don't really seem to care that she said no. I think it was mostly about me having the guts to man up and ask someone out for real. Personally very glad I was able to do this at last, after 19 years of bullshit. "
1npg5u,34,2013-10-04,IamA 24 year old living with multiple hereditary exostosis/osteochondromas (bone tumors). AMA!,nopix,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1npg5u/iama_24_year_old_living_with_multiple_hereditary/,"I was born with tiny little bumps on my long bones (basically your limbs) which as my bones grew, they also grew. I have had four of the tumours removed. Two when I was 16, one when I was 17, and the last one was last year when I was 23.

The reason for the first surgery was that I was out with some friends and my ankle started hurting pretty bad. Then it was so bad I just went home. The next day we went to a pediatric surgeon who said (after an MRI and a whole bunch of x-rays) that I needed to have surgery or else the bone was going to tear the tendons at the sides of my ankles. If that happened, the muscle would ball up in the sides of my legs and apparently that would be excruciating. We went ahead with the surgery. They ended up taking away the sharp tumours on each side of my ankle, stitched up the tendons on each side (which were about half way each) and sent me home that day with 10 staples on each side of my ankle. I had a full recovery.

My forearms also had bone tumours in them. I have since had two taken out (one each arm) and one is still hanging out. One taken out when I was 17, the other last year when I was 23. The reason for both of them were the exact same. The tumours made somewhat of a hook shape. When I was 17 I reached into my backpack and the nerve and tendon bundle running across the top of my arm got stuck in the hook which was INCREDIBLY painful. I had a claw as a hand because I couldn't get the tendons or nerves out of the ""hook"". I was stubborn and slightly embarrassed, so I didn't let anyone know until I got home. I had been trying to work my nerves over the hook at school and they finally went back over. It hurt but after the initial pain it was way better. The next couple of weeks it kept on happening. Eventually I was just easily able to push them back with no problem but my hand just started to hurt all the time so we went back to my pediatric surgeon and she got rid of the one on my left arm. Actually she got interns to do it, but that mess is a whole different story. That surgery did not go well but they did fix my initial problem AKA my left arm. Years later the same thing happened to my other arm and I went to a surgeon (not the same one as now I am an adult) the first time it happened just to get it over with. That surgery went splendidly. In and out in 15 mins, didn't even feel groggy waking up.

I originally had 19 osteochondromas (which are bone-cartilage-tumours). Now I have 15. I can live with all of them except for one underneath my thigh which makes it incredibly difficult to be comfortable in a chair (the way I need to sit causes me to have bad posture and a really sore and unaligned spine. The surgeon told me how dangerous operating on it would be and that if I did it there were 3 options. 1. Everything would be fine. 2. A nerve could be damaged and I wouldn't be able to lift my foot ever again. 3. Everything goes fine and the scar tissue causes havoc on my nerves where I would be in more pain than I currently am in. His words were, ""If you were my son, I wouldn't let you have the surgery"" which was good enough for me.

This condition sucks sometimes, but I manage :) I think it makes me stronger in some ways (I have a very high pain tolerance level).

Links to the proof:

http://imgur.com/a/ogYgU#0 &lt;== Only proof I can think of at the moment. It's my only really visible tumour that is on my knee. (Also X ray of tumour included)

http://imgur.com/a/ogYgU#4 &lt;== Same as above but only the X ray.


http://imgur.com/a/ogYgU#1 &lt;== This is the extremely painful one under my thigh.

http://imgur.com/a/ogYgU#2 &lt;== Same as second link but a closer look.

http://imgur.com/a/ogYgU#3 &lt;== This is the one I had removed last year. You will see two of the tumours (they look like hooks). The long one in the picture I still have. It hasn't caused me any problems. The one on the right side of the picture is the one I had removed.

Ask me anything :)

TL;DR I have bone tumours and sometimes they get in the way."
1npadc,1,2013-10-03,Wondering if I [32 M] should salvage a friendship with an engaged woman [25 F] I am attracted to,oneoff0332,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1npadc/wondering_if_i_32_m_should_salvage_a_friendship/,"Almost two years ago I met a woman while going back to college after a hiatus.   Before I met her, I pretty much kept to myself, did the school work and really didn't socialize with anyone else.

After our first test in class, this gal asks me how I did on the test and how I was doing in class.  I told her I was doing okay but that it was a hard class (it was).  I asked if she would mind studying together, partly because I was attracted to her and partly because it would be nice to have the help.  She agreed and we began meeting outside of class to do the homework.

After about the 2nd meet-up I noticed she was wearing a ring and asked if she was married.  She said she had been engaged for quite a few years.  After learning this I decided to stop contacting her because I thought it might cause trouble since I was attracted to her.

Eventually she began contacting me on her own, asking if I was available to study.  Not wanting to be a jerk (ignoring her just because she was engaged), I agreed to continue studying with her. 

When the semester was finished, we both did well in the class and passed.  As a way to thank me, she offered to buy me lunch after finals week.  I agreed, so we ate at a local restaurant.

It was fun being able to talk with her about other stuff besides school work and it seemed like she was enjoying herself as well.  During lunch we discussed the next semester and found we were going to be in another class together.  We decided to work together in that class as well.

After that initial lunch she invited me out again, a couple of weeks later, for lunch.  I agreed and began wondering why she wanted to hang out again, thinking maybe she was attracted to me too.  About half an hour before showing up, she sent a text letting me know that her fiance would be joining us.  I felt a little put-off by this but, agreed to meet them.  After eating with them I realized my assumptions were wrong.  I decided to stop contacting her socially.  I texted her once that summer to let her know about an internship opportunity at my workplace.

The following 3 semesters we resumed studying for classes we had together.  She began inviting me to hang out for non-school stuff more and more often.  At first, after meeting her fiance, I was hesitant.  But my being single, lonely and attracted to her overrode that and I would agree to hang out.  Eventually, I even began asking her out.  Usually we'd do something when she was alone and wanted company.  Her fiance hung out with us a couple times out of that.

This past summer after spending an afternoon together, we planned to watch a movie later that night.  About half an hour before the movie she sent a text that her fiance would be joining us.  I replied that I wouldn't want to bother them if they already had plans, but she insisted it was ok.  During the movie it was very uncomfortable sitting next to them as they had gotten somewhat intimate with each other (It was a horror movie).  I decided at that point to stop hanging out with her and keep it strictly to school.  For the remaining summer I never contacted her.

I never told her this directly because I didn't know how to without it coming out about how I felt.  I also decided to be more militant about it this time, sort of as a way to keep myself from thinking she was in to me.  So I implemented it by turning her down the next time she asked me out and tried to keep the non-school conversation to a minimum; but whenever she asked to work on the homework or to study, I agreed.  I would also often to leave at the end of class without talking to her (we used to always talk for a few minutes after class) or simply say 'hi' instead of stopping to talk to her whenever I saw her.

As a result of this, she's been reacting in kind, acting very coldly (ignoring me in return, etc).  I feel like I could have approached this more tactfully since I now realize this is what I was doing to her in the first place.  I've tried to ease up a bit, waiting for her after class and making small conversation but her demeanor hasn't changed.  She still avoids/ignores me and she doesn't text anymore.

I miss the way things were and have thought about trying to mend things but I am aware that it is half because I valued her friendship and half because I am still attracted to her.  I've decided that there are two things that I can do at this point.

(1) I was thinking of asking her to talk after class.  I will let her know that I've noticed that she's been upset and ask if I can do anything to mend things.   I will try to leave out how I feel, but if it comes up, I will admit my feelings to explain why I acted the way I did.

(2)  Her cold demeanor makes it seem like she'll laugh at me or shrug me off for talking about how I feel.  Even if I can manage to mend things, I know that a part of me will always be attracted to her and I should just come to terms with the fact that she will never feel the same way about me.  Mending thing will just postpone the inevitable.  Over time I will get over it.  So I feel like I should just cut my losses and leave her alone.

I have trouble sleeping over it and have been feeling depressed.  I feel like talking it out will get a load off my shoulders.  In the past I've never talked to women before about how I truly felt and relationships have died because of it.  This time I want to try something different for a possibly different outcome but I feel, in this situation, it makes no point.

Any advice/input is appreciated.  Thank you for reading.

**EDIT:**  *Thank you all for your feedback.  Part of me wanted to try to mend things but I think the consensus of your replies is the right thing to do.  I will leave her alone from now on.  Thanks again.*

**tl;dr**: Friendship with an engaged woman has gone sour.  I am attracted to her and wonder if it's smart/worth-it trying to salvage."
1np9t7,2,2013-10-03,Am I crazy?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1np9t7/am_i_crazy/,"Okay, so I know that certain mental illnesses surface when a person is in their 20's, I'm dealing with what I feel like is an overwhelming set of circumstances and I'm wondering if I might be experiencing symptoms of something bigger than just ""stress."" This is a long one, so read it or don't, I just need to get this out. There is no TL;DR at the end. Fuck it.

I am 23, just started my junior year of college with a bunch of people who are about 3 years younger than I am. I have tried for years (we all have the same class schedule) to connect with these people and find out what we have in common. The answer stops at our intended careers. They're nothing but kind to me, I just don't feel the kind of belonging and camaraderie that they all have with each other. It sucks to be the person sitting on the edge of all the excitement, watching everyone else get buddy-buddy with all their best friends. I'm lonely. And the fact that I'm constantly just observing might be coming off as creepy or something. I don't know. I'm insecure. 

The coursework itself is grueling. We have several different group projects (anyone who's done this knows how impossible it can be to coordinate schedules of several very busy people) that are worth huge portions of grades. The pile of assignments and research on my to-do list is staggering. I look at it and feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, that I'm not going to accomplish anything of value. The professors are extra tough on us, because ""no one's giving you any breaks in the real world."" Okay, but I'm paying you huge sums of money to teach me how to deal with things, not throw me to the wolves unprepared offering not a hint of guidance or sympathy. They often times don't even provide legitimate instruction on assignments and berate the whole class when everyone submits something different. We're all in the same boat here, my peers and I, so I guess we kind of bond over that sometimes?

On top of that, I moved into an apartment with my two best friends. One of them has since let her boyfriend move in, and no longer has time away from him where we can actually talk. He always seems annoyed by my existence and the ""stupid"" things I say. I try to stay out of their way. The other one will no longer speak to me because I asked her boyfriend to stop bringing his canine friend over when he visits (I'm allergic). I am single, so it gets weird when any of us try to hang out. I'm cool with being single, whatever. I couldn't care less, but feeling like the 3rd/5th wheel just isn't fun. Most other friends my age have graduated/moved/have real adult lives and no time for their old pals.

The apartment itself is a nice shit hole, but the neighborhood is filled with pill-popping drug addicts and bros with a perpetual hard-on for dubstep and subwoofers. My old, piece of crap car's engine exploded, so I had to buy a new car. This seems to draw a lot of unwanted attention my way in a place like this, but I didn't have much of a choice. I needed to invest in something that will run for at least the next 10 years.

Okay, so there's school and my living situation. My internship that takes up 40 hours a week is full of catty, gossipy people who inject as much dramatic bitching into every aspect of their job that it literally sucks the joy out of my life. Anything I once enjoyed just doesn't hold the same electricity anymore. I'm under the supervision of the worst one who makes even the people we work with feel terrible. She makes jokes at their expense and thinks she's hilarious, but really, she's scarring the shit out of some very impressionable minds. I really do not enjoy being stuck here for as long as I am.

My best escape from all of this? Work. I clean toilets, essentially. It's probably the best part of any day. I know what has to be done, do it, and leave. It's simple and fairly consistent. I can only squeeze in work on the weekends, so I literally never have a day off. I gotta try and pay rent and gas and the new car payment AND THEN worry about trying to buy groceries. My parents are saints and try to help when they can, but things are not easy with 2 other dependent children. I try talking to them sometimes, but my mom just ""doesn't know what to do with me anymore."" I can't even vent to her without her stopping me to tell me I'm overwhelming her and that I sound like I'm losing it. There's a history of addiction and some mental illness on her side of the family. On my dad's side? A mystery. He was adopted and denied information about his biological family. 

With all the stress, my physical health is suffering. I recently found a lump on my body and panicked until I was bounced from doctor to doctor to reveal that there was nothing malignant about the lump and it should resolve itself over time. Thinking you have cancer for 2 weeks takes a huge toll on a person. I ended up with strep throat as well, and missed some days of school (for which I was reprimanded by my professors against university policy). This made it even harder to catch up with everything.

I feel like I can't keep my head above water.

I feel like I am going to crack under all this pressure.

I feel like I am losing my mind. I think my mom's right.

I called University health services about scheduling an appointment, but they have yet to call me back.

I'm nervous about seeking therapy or psychiatric help. Maybe you fine folks might provide me with some strategies to deal with anxiety or depression, some words of kindness/encouragement...anything really. Just knowing someone cared enough to read might be nice.

I want to learn how to let this go. I apologise if I come off as selfish, I know I have a lot of faults. I am trying to learn how to forget this experience, which quite frankly, was mortifying for me. 

Two years ago, I did an internship and my boss was a supervisor who had recently been promoted to a managerial position. She is only a few years older than me and it was her first year. As time went on, she became increasingly demanding, obsessed with details (not in a positive, constructive manner), and engaged in passive-aggressive acts that made the workplace very uncomfortable to be in. Eventually, my internship came to an end and my boss told me she couldn't give me any full-time offers because the department had no money in the budget to allocate for it. I accepted the explanation and left without any qualms until I discovered from a co-worker that my boss had, in fact, given the job that she told me didn't exist to someone else. 

I really needed work at that point and was undergoing a health issue. I tried contacting her and unsurprisingly received no response. I don't know why I couldn't let go at this point. I became so frustrated and panicked that I communicated with my boss's supervisor and the department head about the issue, requesting an internal investigation because I somehow felt my boss had discriminated against me. I felt as though I had been wronged and suffering an injustice. It got even worse when the investigation found out a co-worker had accessed my medical files without permission. 

I was able to get work elsewhere but the experience has haunted me since because I am so ashamed of the way I behaved. I still feel angry and envy over my boss. I found out she is still the manager, she makes more money than I do, and she recently got married to what appears to be an amazing guy. Her life seems perfect....and mine isn't. I am frustrated and embarrassed over why I keep thinking and comparing myself to her. 

Please help me figure out how to forgive and forget. 

TL;DR: I resent my former boss and want to learn how to get over it.

1np3zo,2,2013-10-03,My [23F] roommate's BF [23F/23M] has moved in without discussion. What do I say?,kaijuhunter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1np3zo/my_23f_roommates_bf_23f23m_has_moved_in_without/,"I moved in with my roommate in December. We are both moving out in January, she to live with her BF and me on my own. We currently live in a small 2 bedroom basement suite with reasonable rent.

Her and her BF seemed to split their time equally between our place and his parents' place. Recently, however, her BF left for and returned from an internship out of country and his parents apparently became very unpleasant. His family is passive aggressive and doesn't communicate. I sympathize, but as a result they've stopped going to his place completely and are here 24/7.

Both of us are students and we're not always home. I have my gf over some of the time as well - probably 2-3 nights a week.

He's a decent guy, it's not that I don't like him or don't understand his situation, but I'm starting to become resentful of the fact that they didn't discuss this with me at all and he's not paying any rent. I know we're only going to be here for another 3 months but I if I let my resentment build and don't work through this it won't be fun for anyone.

The problem is I don't even know what to say. I would feel weird and uncomfortable asking him to contribute money. He basically lives in her room and they buy all their own food. I'm an intensely introverted &amp; private person and best I can tell, part of what bothers me is the fact that someone lives in my space who I don't know and am not comfortable around. But I don't know how to fix it. ):

What can I do?

---

TL;DR: My roommate's BF has moved into our tiny basement suite, they didn't consult me, I am resentful and uncertain of what to do or say. Also not sure if I should even do or say anything, as we are moving in 3 months and he's not a terrible roomie or anything."
1nt8j8,11,2013-10-05,Throwaway here - Girlfriend drove drunk and pounded on my front door last night. I might be single now? Help.,ALthrowitaway,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nt8j8/throwaway_here_girlfriend_drove_drunk_and_pounded/,"I've been a sometimes active member of AL for a while but needed a throwaway for this one. I just feel like I can't talk to anyone and I really need help. Thanks in advance for just listening. 

For the backstory, keep reading. For immediate advice, jump to the TL;DR

Backstory: My girlfriend (25) and I (22) have been together off and on for a little over 7 months. In the spring when we got together, we spent a LOT of time together and jumped into things really quickly. We also got in fights on occasion, the likes of which I'd never really encountered before, involving some pretty nasty talk which would later sort of resolve and we'd get love-y again. For the first few weeks of summer vacation we spent even more time together, and because I didn't have many plans or obligations I was available almost all the time. A little while into the summer I moved for an internship and we were long distance. This was definitely hard on both of us, and I recognize that I wasn't the best at it at first. I got pretty busy and wasn't being attentive or flexible for a while, but we got through it. Near the end of the summer stuff was getting worse, with my girlfriend often accusing me of cheating on her, getting mad at me for talking about work, and once telling me I had to skip work to talk to her (I didn't do this, and she later apologized for it). We also got into two big fights about family - I'm incredibly close with my family, but she is semi-estranged from hers because they are very uncomfortable and unaccepting of her being gay. She got mad at me for not ""making it clear"" earlier in our relationship that I was so close with my family, and told me that she tries to make her own family with her friends, and sort of expected me to do the same and be willing to put her on the same level as my family (which I wasn't ready for). So things were getting worse and right before I came back from my internship, I broke up with her.

Yeah, I know, here's where it starts to get weird. About 2 weeks after breaking up, I missed her and wanted to talk to her. Well we talked, which led to kissing and more and a whole weekend of spending time together and being super cutesy. I realized we jumped in way too hard without discussing any problems, I got super uncomfortable, and I broke it off. THEN, 3 weeks later, she ends up talking to me again, we talk more, talks get serious and we end up seeing each other again. After hanging out for a while and talking a LOT, we decide to give things another try. Now over the summer and over the past two months, I did have some revelations and decide some things I needed to do. I knew I needed to take care of myself more in general. Some of the big ways I have been doing this are: 1) Making a pretty tight schedule for keeping up with my college classes and meetings and other obligations, and 2) Creating a better budget so that my spending didn't get out of hand and 3) sleep in my own bed - I sleep terribly when I'm not in my own bed and it used to really detriment me when I did it a lot with her (lots of back pain, didn't really sleep, etc.) My girlfriend has gotten really upset with me over all 3 of those, for different reasons. 1) because I'm so rigid and make her feel like she has to keep to my schedule and that I give her deadlines, 2) because I didn't account for spending money with her or going out to eat at least once a week and 3) because it means a lot to her when I sleep in her bed, and she basically doesn't feel like we can be counted as a real couple unless we are regularly sleeping in the same bed (this bed has to be hers, however.)

So fast forward to last night. Here's where the TL;DR comes in

**Kinda long ish TL;DR:** Girlfriend asks me to come out to a bar with her on a Friday night, though I tell her I have to be up early and can't stay out long. Tell her I'm not sure if I can make it to bar, she gets upset, so I go to the bar. At bar she starts getting affectionate with me, then stops when another lesbian comes by. When she walks me out and I ask about this, she smiles and says someone is trying to hook them up. She and I end up in yelling fight in parking lot, she storms off, I drive home. She then gets drunker and tells me I have to come back to the bar (I am going to sleep because I have to be up at 6am). When I say I can't, she drunk drives over to my house (she had told me her friends barred her from driving because she was so drunk). Even though I told her I refused to talk to her if she drove, she POUNDS on my apartment door for half an hour and calls me 13 times. Today I see she has deleted all social media, including Facebook, Twitter, OKCupid, and she may have blocked me on Gchat. She hasn't spoken to me yet. Am I single now?

**Super TL;DR:** Girlfriend drunk drives to my house after a fight, pounds on my door for half an hour, then deletes all social media. What the hell do I do?"

Most of the realty world loves their iPads to death, but my experiences with Apple hardware ($600 and a nonreplaceable battery, you say?) and browser incompatibility with their web-based MLS viewing system makes me wonder if something else would be a better alternative.

There are a lot of really great Android tablets on the market, but the new Bay Trail tablets with 8.1 keep pace on price and offer a very nice feature set for the dollar. But I do have a few concerns. Issues include:

1. How well, exactly, does 8.1 on one of these tablets play with standard desktop apps? Sometimes, you just want to run a spreadsheet.

2. How well does 8.1 play with Google Docs? My employers are using a Google Apps based CRM system, and the full Google experience - complete with offline editing - is a big deal.

2. What's the nature of MS Office bundled? Will it access things with macros in unecessary places that trip up Google Drive? 

3. Are there any tablet-oriented applications useful for their purposes that you can recommend?

I am an MSA student and I just finished up my office visit with PwC.  I think all of my interviews went great and I am really hoping to land an internship with them this winter in Risk Assurance.  I also had on campus interviews with EY, BDO, and Deloitte, (KPMG doesn't recruit on my campus).  I have not heard from EY, but it has been two weeks so I am assuming no office visit with them.  This doesn't surprise me because the on campus interview felt a little awkward.  It was my first on campus interview and I really wasn't feeling comfortable/ natural during the interview.  

The BDO interview was phenomenal and they extended me an office visit on the spot.  I thought my Deloitte on campus interview went great as well.  I have visited there office recently, had a great familiarity with their staff, and was on a first name basis with the recruiter.  Surprisingly, I was not offered an office invite.  

At the PwC office visit I spoke with another student who let me know they had an excellent relationship with Deloitte.  She attended all their on campus functions, visited the office, and knew several staff; yet, she was even offered an on campus interview.  Hearing this really shocked me.  

Should I be worried over not being selected with Deloitte?  Is this natural with the Big 4?  Do they think I just might not fit the culture?  

I plan on contacting the recruiter to inquire why they did not bring me further in the interview process.  Any tips for how to follow up with Deloitte and possibly EY would be useful.  

THANKS!

1nsi94,28,2013-10-05,The Tales of Crazy Charles,Journeyman42,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1nsi94/the_tales_of_crazy_charles/,"Alright, boys and girls, let's listen to a tale, the tale of crazy Charles (not his real name).

I met Charles through a mutual friend when I moved away from my parents house and into an apartment in a much larger city.  The rent was decent (I paid $350 a month for a room in a 2 bedroom) and the location was great, right in the heart of downtown.  Charles seemed a decent guy at first, but lo and behold his inner douche was unleashed.

Charles was very muscular and into bodybuilding, so he walked without a shirt on all the time.  Even in winter.  He also hit on literally every single girl he encountered, and needless to say hooked up a lot.  He had three ""girlfriends"" at the same time.  I didn't mind, but all of them (and him) were very vocal while fucking.  I had to tell him to move his bed to a different location in the room, because the headboard of his bed would pound into the shared wall between his room and mine while he was fucking for hours on end.

The apartment itself was a dump, and he refused to help clean or do dishes.  Eventually I moved all of my dishes to my room so he couldn't use them, and the sink became permanently clogged with dirtyass dishes.  I washed mine in the bathroom sink.  He got a papasan chair from somewhere and, instead of using it as a chair, hung the base upside down from the ceiling as some kind of retarded chandelier.  He nailed HR Giger posters into the walls.

One day early into our living arrangement, he found a big-ass tv on craigslist, one of those massive 48 inch CRTs that some older lady was getting rid of.  We drove out to the suburbs to get it, had to haul the bigass thing up a flight of stairs, and then try to put it into my Pontiac Grand Am, which needless to say didn't have a lot of cargo space.  He had a buddy pick up the TV in a truck (why he didn't ask him earlier, I don't know, I just have so much free time to fuck around with this bullshit) and haul it to our apartment.  I made the mistake of getting an audio receiver for the TV so we could have better audio, which Charles used to blast shitty rap music at 120 decibels at all hours of the day.  His response to when I asked him, if he wanted to listen to loud music, why he didn't use headphones was ""because headphones hurt my ears"".  So I had to endure his shitty music blasting from the living room, and my room was directly next to the living room.  He also plugged his laptop into the audio receiver with a headphone jack, which lead to such lulzy moments as when he tried to have a quiet conversation with his mom over Skype about how he knocked up some girl, only for her voice to boom out like God was speaking to him.

His idiocy was amazing.  About the only thing he was good at was fucking and weight lifting.  And boxing lessons.  He couldn't afford his own apartment (his parents paid the rent) but he went to fucking boxing lessons, even though he was creeped out by the Muslim boxing instructor.  Charles also had rage issues, and on a few occasions he threatened to kick my ass (looking back, I should've called the cops on his dumbass, but I didn't want to deal with any of that shit).  Charles went to the same tech school as I did as a graphic designer, although his artwork was amazingly bad.  He did work as a lifeguard at a pool, but was fired one day because he didn't bring his uniform to work and told his boss our cat pissed on his uniform that morning.  We didn't have a cat.  There was also the time he bought a rolltop desk from St Vinny's and wanted me to transport it in my Grand Am.  He had to get some Mexican guy in a truck to carry it for him, then when they got to our apartment, Charles (who was learning Spanish) accidentally said he would give the guy 500 dollars instead of 50 dollars for hauling it.

The last straw was one night, I went out to the orchestra.  I love classical music, and the local orchestra was playing Beethoven's Third Symphony.  As I was dressing up, Charles asked to come along, and not thinking, I invited him.  He got bored of the concert halfway through, played around on his cellphone, texting one of his fuckbuddies, and hit on chicks during the intermission.  I was pissed.

I made arrangements to move in with a friend far, far away from Charles at the end of the lease.  Charles saw this as a sign to give even less of a shit, so he did.  One day when I was at work (internship related to my major), he moved the bigass CRT tv from the living room into his room.  He didn't even use it, as the TV was placed with the screen facing the wall.  He simply did it out of spite.  It was about this point that I moved all my dishes to my room.

The single most WTF moment was literally the weekend before I moved out.  Charles, one of his fuckbuddies/girlfriends, and her friend were getting drunk and his fuckbuddy got horny.  Charles and his fuckbuddy went to his room, I went to my room (and put on headphones), and her friend left.  After about an hour, I go to take a piss and as soon as I take off my headphones, I hear someone calling for an ambulance.  Then I realized its Charles!  So I go to his room and he pokes his head out.

""Journeyman!  Call 911!""
""What happened, Charles?""
""Just call 911!  It's an emergency!""

He wouldn't let me go into his room.  So I whip my phone out and dialed 911.

Dispatcher ""911, what is your emergency?""
Me ""I don't know""
Dispatcher ""Do you know someone who does?""
Me ""Yep""

And I hand the phone to Charles, who disappears into his room.  In the split second before he closed the door, I saw his fuckbuddy kneeling on the floor, with her head in her hands.  After a couple of minutes, Charles comes back out to tell me to wait outside for the ambulance.  I don't know what the hell he told 911, but two cop cars, an ambulance, and a firetruck show up at our apartment.  One of the EMT guys asked me how much vodka she had to drink.  They all leave without her.  Apparently, all that happened was that she puked while they were fucking from all the liquor they had, and then she fell on the floor.  When I went back inside, Charles yelled at me for not calling 911 fast enough and how dare I questioned him during such an emergency.

I moved the fuck out.  Didn't even end there.  During the last month, he purposefully cranked up the AC while I was at work so that the electric bill was $60 dollars (usually it was around $30, which we split).  I asked him for his half of the electric bill and he ignored me, and cut off contact on Facebook.  After I didn't hear back for about a month, I messaged his fuckbuddy (she thought they were exclusive) and told her that he was cheating on her.  Then I deleted her from FB.

Glorious post-script; earlier this year, I was hanging out with some friends when the topic of shitty roommates came up.  I brought up Charles when one of them, Pam, asks if he was a graphic design major at X college.  I said yes, and it turned out she was in his class!  Not only did he hit on her (which she turned down), for their final semester, they had to complete a portfolio of artwork to graduate.  His professor failed him because he didn't have enough work, and what work he did have was pisspoor.  Because he failed the portfolio class, he failed the graphic design program.

I hugged her I was so happy."

The back story: I started working at a popular spot in Paris about three months ago.  Before that, I was working in a similar spot in the same city where we would take the total of each week's tips and divide them up equally between the staff.  High fives or disappointment were shared by one and all.  At my new spot, there is a restaurant and a wine bar.  We share mise en place, staff floats back and forth, its pretty linked up, but at the wine bar the staff, FOH and BOH take an equal share of the tips.  In the restaurant we split it up as:

1/3 the dining room manager

1/3 the (only other) server

1/3 between the 3 cooks

Fuck that shit!  I guess that the policy dates to a time when the kitchen staff was one cook and an intern.  Now I'm pulling 10% of the week's tips for 14-15 hour days while hung over club kid is taking 3 times that for a 9 hour shift littered with cigarette breaks!

So a recent management change in the FOH, a new server coming in,  and the looming departure of my sous chef seemed like all the ingredients necessary for an equality soup.  I spoke up.  I said ""this isnt fair, let's all share it"".  My sous went to the new manager and she was defensive and upset and said no.  The next day I went to her and pleaded my case, smiley as all hell and very polite.

Well she folded and yesterday she let me know that starting next week we will be sharing the tips 20% each.  Doesn't seem like much, but the difference to me personally means that I will be bringing home an additional 15% take home each month.  An extra 300 euros for trips to restaurants in the countryside, new knives, city breaks, visiting family in England.  Just had to raise a voice!"
1nruey,2,2013-10-05,"[long story] childhood anxiety, ego, obsessive compulsive disorder, yoga, meditatoin... my story",mungabunga,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nruey/long_story_childhood_anxiety_ego_obsessive/,"When I was born, the 2nd day after my birth my dad left for another city for financial reasons. 

1 Year later my mother and sister left as well to the same city as my dad because my sister would start school.. I was left living with my grand parents. 

I was a very healthy boy.. fatty (good fatty) and very intelligent.

Around 3 years old my parents take me from my grand parents for the summer.. So i lived with them around 3 months.. and then they sent me back to my grand parents again.

I remember the moment when they sent me back.. I knew they would leave me again. I didn't like it. I didn't want them to leave me. They literally told me : ""go out with grandpa for a walk and we will wait you here"". I knew it was a lie, that is probably the first time I felt my anxiety. Like I was being lied. I went for the walk to come back and not find my parents anymore. Since that day I would cry uncontrollably. I stoped eating. I did have bad sleep. I would wake up at night asking myself questions (at 3 years old!) about everything. My grandparents were afraid. I used to ask them everyday : ""when is dad coming?"".. they kept telling me lies about : ""the bridge between the two cities is broken"" and stuff like this. (they left me at my grandparents for financial reasons, and mom/dad/sister couldnt take care of me during the day)

My parents eventually take me back around 5 years old. They send me to a small kids house.. I throw up and cry the first day. I stay a couple of days more but I never felt well. I would have friends in my neighbourhood but I didn't like being there closed in that building and waiting for my parents to come and take me. So they sent me home.. and lock me inside all day.

around 6.6 years old I have my first day of school. My dad sends me there, I cry and puke (again).. I cried the whole day and couldn't even wait my dad come and take me.

School was hard, I used to be beaten by some kids, I used to beat some other kids. At home I used to have a hard time. My dad was missing almost all the time, he was working too much. My mom was anxious herself and she used to beat on me.. sometimes without reason. I had lots of pressure on school. I was a good student but it was never enough for my mom! When I finished my homework she would never let me go play, but I had to do more homework for the rest of the week.

I used to have anxiety about speaking in front of people, anxiety about performing, anxiety about responsabilites etc. once i kept thinking about ""me swallowing"" and told to my mom that ""I only think about me swallowing.. i think about it this much that I actually swallow all the time"". (ocd?)

In high school, first day I don't cry. I had friends already in my classroom. I was a big boy, I used to protect myself.. sometimes I used to speak more loudly than  normal. So I made 4 real good friends, with whom we were all the time. Eventually the 2nd year of high school we discovered weed. That was it. My sleeping problems, gone! My anxiety, gone! My overthinking, there but good overthinking! My eating problem, gone as well. So we smoked weed til the end of high school. HS was happy period even though with one broken heart (in which I cried like a kid).. I was a cool boy in high school. I used to do what i wanted to do. I never overthought (almost). My friends were much like me so we got well together.

For university I leave my town and country to go somewhere else.. in europe. Inserting myself into this new culture seemed impossible. I was unhappy with who I was, I used to feel like ""i can be with better people than just this"" or the inverse ""they are too cool for me"". I had somehow of a breakdown the first months but I handled it well, apart the fatigue and lack of concentration here and there.. I became more paranoid since I couldnt understand everything.. language difference also culture difference, like ""are they talking about me"", ""why did he say that"", etc. And since being direct and saying smth like : ""shut the fuck up"" was impossible in this country (you have to be polite in school) i just.. shut the fuck up myself. I went to amsterdam (with one of my high school friends who lives elsewhere), tried mushrooms, had a glimpse of eternal bliss it was beautiful.

Later on I find my own friends in this new country.. who smoke weed. I start smoking really heavy weed. Every day. I used to go to classes high. Meet my professors high.. and I start feeling this unpleasent feeling here and there. Like tense, anxiety, sometimes some kind of depression. Especially when around lots of people, I was shy. Much more shy than in high school. I couldn't speak myself out. It never lasted more than one evening. I would wake up tomorrow and feel ok. When I was stressed (exam period) it was almost impossible to talk to people.. I sometimes even tried not talking to them in the streets or turn my head the other direction! It's like my head was all the time cloacked to ""exams"". It's like I had no reason to be happy.

When in masters I continued smoking the same amount of weed.. but I was tiring myself more!! At a moment, I was studying so much and I was smoking so much I didn't know what was happening. Ive had panic attacks and though, this is just me being high, I will go to sleep. When with these ""new friends"" I would feel sad sometimes. I couldn't laugh. I would be too serious. They could sense it. I could sense they could sense it (anxiety?).

One day when at a guys house, after learning my parents were fighting, after listening my mother tell me ""i want to kill myself"", after doing lots of medical checkups because i had a very upset stomach, while smoking weed instead of studying it hits me. the real anxiety attack with physical symptoms. I can't get my head away. I think too much. I was like : ""i'm going crazy"". I start speaking more and they notice it. They ask me if everything is OK. I take it personally.. like ""why shouldnt it be ok?"". I can't sleep. I try to play Play Station but I'm too tense. I decide to leave (and act normal). The shame and guilt are there. I start crying in the metro and go to sleep, telling my self tomorrow is gonna be ok (like it might have hapened before when i as just tired).

I wake up tomorrow, the same feeling of emptiness is there. I cry. I dont wanna eat. I have to study. I can't think. I think too much. Don't know how to act. Go for a walk come back, my head is thinking how I ashamed myself last night, how I have to study a lot, how my parents can't understand me. I throw the weed that was left. I decided to never smoke again. 

I go to the university and it was like people see me in a weird way...all the time. I'm anxious and nervous. I try to hide it but some things they say.. i take it like ""HMM THEY KNOW"". Paranoia. I only ride the bike since the metro/bus has too many people. I understand the weed was always there as ""reason"" for my feeling.

My parents come to my country, they try to talk me out of this depression (that lasted like 3 weeks or so). I start yoga. It helps me a lot. I still have the anxiety around people. Sometimes I want to ask my yoga professor a question but too many people are there so I don't. Physically I feel good. I have a better physical body. everything is going ok. I run. I still am sad around my friends. Sometimes I think about ""my situation"" when I'm with them. I can't let myself go. I can't be normal.. 

2nd year of masters went ok. lots of work but it was ok. I kept doing yoga, then I start my internship of 6months.. they love me. they love my work. everything is going ok! I get anxious when we eat together..but it's just a moment of anxiety..like 30-45 minutes. it's a new environement for me that's why. I have to act like a grown up. 

Work sends me in another city for working at the client. (at this moment i have stoped yoga since 3 months, i have lost muscle, and it's been 1.5 years since my ""BREAKDOWN""). I live in hotel, work 8am-8pm. and 8pm-10pm talk about work while eating dinner. I have no more friends, no more family with me. I'm all the time with my work people (collegues). 

It is stressful more and more.. I feel bad. I lose apetite but I keep on going. I'm paranoid when around my collegues. They joke about me and I almost cry. They tell me it's just a joke.. I can't not take it personally. I try to but I can't. I joke on them.. laugh and feel bad. I joke on myself.. feel bad. I try telling jokes.. almost cried. When drinking my head blocks. I freeze. My neck trembles. My hands as well. I'm doing too much introspection. I'm forcing myself to be something i'm not.. not now! I tell my boss thas.. ""going in a city from monday-friday and coming back is tiring me"". He's like : ""you will get used to it [mungabunga]"". (i think :""they don't care about me.. they care about themselves and the work I do""). This goes on for 3 weeks.. they don't notice. I have a couple of panick attacks. I try to run them out etc. One monday i start crying in the train while going there. I can't focus I can do nothing. I don't wanna work anymore.. I realise, I'm in the same situation as 1.5 years ago with weed.. just that there's no weed. And well i'm more prepared than last time. I ask my boss that I need to see a doctor back home. I see one and he gives me 3 sick days. I decide I don't want to work anymore. call my boss, fire myself. Right now I'm waiting for all the paper work to be done.

Taking some homeopathic anxiety medicine. Feeling bad from time to time. Going for runs every day and trying to eat a lot. I'm asking myself questions. When depressed I used to just cry, and imagine myself as a bum in the street or in a mental hospital. I had suicidal thoughts (which i told to my gf, and father). 
I keep reading r/meditation. I keep asking myself questions about my situation.

I notice a patern. When I need attention I act up like this. Is it un unhealthy ego I have? I will maybe start cbt soon, but i'm very sad as well. Do you have ideas? how should I act?"
1nro8n,7,2013-10-05,I think I have found my passion. How do I become a financial adviser? (CA),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1nro8n/i_think_i_have_found_my_passion_how_do_i_become_a/,"I am currently 17, and started my first year of university. Right now I am on my way to majoring in Mathematics/Computer Science. I enjoy math and everything, but I think that finances are my passion. I have enjoyed investing vehicles, saving, budgeting, and over financial health since I was young.

I am worried about whether or not this is a viable career. This subreddit seems to hate on them and constantly say that they are useless. Why would I go into a field that can apparently be easily replaced by a small amount of research?

A (seemingly silly) issue is that I don't actually know how one becomes a financial adviser. I know that you can do a business degree and likely go from there, however, is it also possible to finish a math degree and have the same qualifications and employability (after you finish your certification)? I told myself that I would get a degree that I know is employable and I wouldn't become another young person with poor career prospects.

I had a few questions about the career:

 * Is financial advising going to be 'phased out' in the future?
 * Do I have a proper picture as to what being a financial adviser entails? 
 * Can I become a financial adviser while sticking on the track that I am on right now?
 * Is financial advising an employable career?
 * What can I do to help myself get internships? What are some good university to go to for this?

Thank you so much!"

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years now, and it's always been long distance. I've been in NY and he's in CA. I'm originally from CA, and we met when I was doing a summer internship in the Bay Area. I was going to the school in NY at the time, and when I graduated, I moved to NYC for a job. Now, he just went back to school (community college) in CA after working at a job he didn't like for about 8 years. The plan was that after school for him, he would move out to NYC with me.

Now, he's going back on that plan, and he says that he hates NYC and doesn't see himself living here at all. He claims that he wants to continue the relationship, but doesn't want to move to NYC. I find it unfair because I've already established a life here in NYC, whereas he still doesn't know what he wants to do. We're on a break now, and I'm seeing him in a week (I bought the tickets before we went on a break). We've been fighting everytime we're on the phone, and I'm extremely angry all the time.

1nrhqd,3,2013-10-04,Need help to survive LDR [22M]/26F,LDR555,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nrhqd/need_help_to_survive_ldr_22m26f/,"I'll be straight to the point, but I apologize in advance for the length. We wrote this together. Some of it is my words, some is hers. Written from my point of view.

 My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year, but are currently three hours apart because I'm doing an internship in another city. The internship is very important for my career and was mentioned before we started dating. We've been apart for a month and will be until December 21st. It's VERY hard for both us, but it's killing her. I've visited 2 out of the 4 weekends (once was a last-minute surprise and we were only together for one day), we talk on the phone and skype at least three times a day. These are often short and rushed, although we try to have a longer conversation every day, but she often has other things she needs to be doing, so sitting around talking makes her very anxious. We also chat a lot on FB and send each other plenty of text messages, but because of her very busy schedule, she feels pressured and disrupted. We were pretty much living together before I left, and we both got used to having the other person just there, so adjusting to the change is very difficult. She's visiting me next weekend and we're staying at a magnificent hotel. Our 1 year anniversary is in about 2 months and the hotel is already booked for that, too.

We love each other madly. I'm crazy for her and I know she feels the same way for me. Breaking up is not an option. We're both heading towards jobs that make us travel frequently and we both want to learn how to deal with being apart.

The problem is that she's been terribly lonely since I left and she craves companionship and emotional intimacy. She needs significant people in her life, she needs a close and constant connection. She doesn’t really have a family, and that’s very difficult for her because she feels like she’s missing a significant part of what most people get to have. She has lots of amazing friends (but she doesn’t really get close to people) and she's been participating in a lot of social activities since we've been apart. Nothing compares to that deep emotional connection between us and it's killing her. It's driving her crazy, to the point where she shuts down, cries, and is stressed all the time - it doesn’t help that she’s taking a full course load, working two jobs, and now has to take care of our condo alone. When she shuts down, she gets very aggressive towards me and says really bad things that she later regrets. It's extremely taxing on both of us. She's an amazing person, my best friend and a wonderful girlfriend, so it's really hard to see her in tears, begging me to come back, knowing that it's impossible.

We discussed opening up the relationship before. In my case, I'd be totally fine with sex-without-feelings on the side for both of us. However, since I'm not too far away and able to visit frequently, we decided that it was not the best time. I would be willing to change that, but I think right now, in the middle of a long distance relationship, is a terrible time to do it.

&lt;Her speaking&gt; I’ve had a few minor crushes throughout the relationship, but lately I talk about them more often (although I’d never do anything with them if it weren’t okay with him.) I feel weird about them, like they’re more intense because of his absence, but when I think about actually doing stuff with my crushes, I feel hollow and empty. &lt;/Her speaking&gt; She logged on to her OkCupid profile for the first time in months and mentioned dating other people and honestly that kinda hurt me because I feel like I'm being replaced - but if she can find a good friend out of it, that would be great. She doesn't know what she wants, she keeps repeating that all she wants is for me to come back, so it’s impossible to discuss boundaries and how to handle these kind of things.

The last few days have been worse than ever before. She's told me multiple times that she can't do it and that she wants to break up with me, but every time I am able to calm her down and make her come back to her normal and rational state. We’re both so excited to be together again. On the other hand, she feels like if it’s this hard after just a month, if she’s this interested in other people, then she doesn’t know how to survive another two and a half months like this. We know that if I were still there, she wouldn’t feel like this, and it makes it very painful for us.

It's REALLY FUCKING HARD. We both love each other so much and that's the basis of why it's so hard. Breaking up is not an option. Tons of couples go through similar situations and they survive. We need your advice, we need your tricks. How can we make it easier? To those of you who have been in a similar situation, how did you overcome it?

We need your help.


**tl;dr**: LDR is proving to be extremely difficult for my girlfriend and we need your help.

1nrfqh,1,2013-10-04,For my Friends to read.,bullimar,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1nrfqh/for_my_friends_to_read/,"&amp;gt; Okay so at my school we have faculty advisers that are assigned to students according to their last names. The faculty advisers help students with scheduling conflicts, general questions, help with internships/employment, etc. My adviser is named Jess Depew and she's pretty hot. She's like 25 and she's only been at the school a few years. Anyway, I have been looking into getting an internship at a TV station or something over the summer, and the school helps coordinate these things with an internship database that's maintained by the advisers. You log on with your school ID and password and you can browse internships and stuff. I was having trouble logging on to mine so I went to go see Ms. Depew. That's where all the trouble started.

&amp;gt; Firstly, I walked into office like 15 minutes early like an idiot and she's in the middle of lunch. So I awkwardly make stupid stall talk until she's finished.

&amp;gt; ""Oh, hey, what are you eating?""

&amp;gt; ""Salmon. I love it. I eat it practically everyday.""

&amp;gt; ""Just salmon? That's pretty weird."" Why the hell did I say this?

&amp;gt; ""Oh, well, I don't know. I try to eat healthy, natural foods...you know, like wild berries and honey and stuff.""

&amp;gt; ""Yeah, I like food too."" *facepalm*

&amp;gt; Man, I was so nervous. Anyway, we finally begin squaring my stuff away. She looks up what I registered with in the beginning of the year. This is when the crap really hit the fan. This is how the conversation went:

&amp;gt; ""Okay, you're account name is [my name] and your password is ...'depewissexy'...""

&amp;gt; Oh damn. I completely forgot that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year. What the hell was I thinking? It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I finally got my balls together to stand up and leave. Just as I walk out the door she says,

&amp;gt; ""In the future, you might want to bear in mind what kind of things you want keep to yourself.""

&amp;gt; I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right then and there. I wanted to run the hell out of there and never, ever see her again. But something about what she just said kept me standing in her doorway. I decided to man up and apologize. I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and swallowed my pride. And then, it hit me like a train full of bricks.

&amp;gt; She was eating Salmon.

&amp;gt; She tries to eat all healthy, natural foods, like wild berries and honey.

&amp;gt; She told me that I might want to **bear in mind** what kind of things I want to keep to myself.

&amp;gt; Ms. Depew was a bear disguised as a human.

&amp;gt; Immediately, the bear saw that I had seen through its charade. It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe at me. I deftly avoided its claw and sprinted out of the office. The bear was soon in chase, crashing through the walls of the office as if they were made of paper. I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance. The bear followed, tossing the secretary aside like a rag doll. The bear began to pursue me through the street traffic. While I fought my way through the maze of vehicles, the bear simply careened its massive force through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force that was barreling down the road. The bear was gaining fast. I had no other option but to make my way into the nearest building: a preschool. I burst through the door, startling the children from their naps. Immediately, the bear slammed through the wall, crushing a child beneath his massive paws and burying several other children in sheet rock and debris. I maneuvered my way through the chaos towards the back exit. The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear. Its massive paws cut swaths through the sea of toddlers with each swipe. I used the precious time these children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground. I scrambled up a ladder to a fort-like structure. My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which I could climb to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter.

&amp;gt; I began my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside, its teeth and claws still fresh with the blood of the innocent. It let out a monstrous roar and began its assault on the cheap, woodenplayset. I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars. I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear's enormous girth came plowing through the entire structure. I grasped the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree, sending it into a daze. I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape, but for victory. I leapt off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray bar that had been shorn from the playset. The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast. I ran to the beast and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull.

&amp;gt; The bear had been defeated. I shambled home in pain but victorious.There will be more blogs and more bears in the months to come.

&amp;gt; But today, I returned home a champion."
1nrdad,1,2013-10-04,Ex from long distance relationship is back in town for three months. (need advice),heart_bender,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1nrdad/ex_from_long_distance_relationship_is_back_in/,"20F and 20M
I started dating this guy about a year ago. The anniversary would have been tomorrow. :( Three months into the relationship he was to do a four month internship in San Francisco. Our hometown is in southern Ontario. Halfway through those four months I fly to visit him for five days. We both had an amazing time. I remember walking through the airport heading towards to home so I could study for a calc midterm that was in four days. I still had some american money left so I decided to splurge on myself by getting a grapefruit frozen yogurt.   At that moment life was perfect. 

A few weeks later he leaves message saying he needs my advice on something. His boss has offered to extend his internship for four more months. I don't want him to but in the end it's his decision to make. A short while after he makes that decision he breaks up with me. Eight months is a really long time for such a young relationship. 

When he broke with me, I was sad however I knew that it wasn't anything that I had done. He would be coming back in September and in the mean time I could finally sleep. The time differences was really tiring me out.

Flash Forward to September. I am so convinced that he'll want me back that I make a bet with my best friend that he'll ask me on a date. I only bet when I'm certain I'm right. 1 weeks goes by nothing happens, 2 weeks go by still nothing happens. 3 weeks go by another guy asks me out. I go on a date with him though everything about dating reminds of my ex. The entire I can't help but think this is a decent date but I had it better with my ex. I'm not sure I want a lesser relationship when a better one failed. The morning after that date I wake up at 5am crying because I miss my ex. 6 months after he broke up with me, my heart shatters. 

Right now I just trying to pick up the pieces. I finally saw him this week. I told him how his actions hurt me, how I felt abandoned when he chose his job over me. He listened. Even while I was chewing out we still made each other laugh. He offered to let me slap him as compensation instead I asked for a hug.

I still madly in love with this guy. If I go an hour without crying due to heartbreak, I consider it an accomplishment. I know he'll be going back to San Francisco. Long distance sucks however heartbreak sucks a whole lot more. 

So my question is: Is it worth it to get this relationship back? How should I go about it?

I had a great time visiting Toronto (from the USA) and meeting new people several months ago when I was here on a short vacation. One redditor recently mentioned the Students Working Abroad Program (SWAP) to Canada and as a recent graduate, I think it'd be an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take to work abroad (given that I was not able to study abroad - so I was sad about that). 

My background : Most of my development experience is with web application development with PHP/Javascript(Front/Back-end)/Golang and a bit of Django/Rails from school. I've done three internships during my college career. 

[Link to My Resume (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/shsr8c87vtw2rru/generic_resume_1006.pdf)

What I'm Looking For: I'm looking for an opportunity with a small/mid-size firm/startup that faces interesting and fun technical challenges. I've definitely done some looking on StartupNorth and done some applying here and there. Money's not as important - as long as it's fairly survivable though I know I won't be getting as much as what I'd be getting in Mountain View, California, USA.

I've heard from friends/redditors about getting the visa first opposed to finding an opportunity first. At the moment, I have a few options between companies in the USA, but I am looking for something different. 

Tips/advice would be appreciated. :)"

What justifies buying a new suit?,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1nv5y9/how_many_suits_do_you_own_and_how_often_do_you/,"I currently own two suits, an Alfani RED charcoal gray suit that I love/hate (I think it's too dark for my complexion, I'm a caramel colored Asian), and a Navy Tallia Orange suit. Both need to be tailored but fit relatively well.

Macy's is currently having a great sale on some of their suits. Along with a coupon, I could nab a 3-piece suit for about $205. It's a bit darker navy than my current navy suit.

It got me thinking... when will I actually wear a suit? I just graduated. I could hardly get an interview before I got hired part time at a non-profit. I *hardly* wear a suit, maybe 3-5 times a year. When I had an internship in DC, I wore one once a week, but I'm living in a very casual metropolitan area now that thinks a collared shirt and slacks is ""dressing up"".

I've found every reason to justify me buying this suit. How ""it's the right color"" or ""how I've always wanted this brand's suit"" to ""it can be my graduation present to myself"" and ""maybe buying suits is my thing? like how other guys buy jordans they hardly wear"". 

At the same time, I've found reason to talk myself out of it... ""you already own two suits"", ""you already have a blue suit, just get them tailored"", ""$200 could get you something else, or save it"", etc.

Thoughts? Opinions? It's one of those purchases where you'll feel regret buying or not buying, but the only difference is that if I don't buy, I'll save myself $200.

1nuxqs,1,2013-10-06,"My [19F] family is driving me nuts, How do I move out?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nuxqs/my_19f_family_is_driving_me_nuts_how_do_i_move_out/,"Let me start off by saying that I do love my family and that I realize that I am incredibly lucky to have them. 

I have a mother, a father, and an autistic brother who is one year younger than me

After I graduated high school, I moved 300 miles away to go to school, even getting involved in a paid summer internship the semester before my freshman year. I got used to living on my own (with room mates, but they were hardly around) and loved the solitude. I could sleep as much as I wanted, leave messes for a little while before cleaning them up, etc etc. I loved the freedom.

At this time in my life, I was NOT financially independent, my parents paid for part of my tuition and housing, the rest was covered by scholarships. 

After 1 year of being at that school, I realized it wasn't a good fit and that other schools relatively closer to home would offer better opportunities, so I decided to move back home and commute 30 min twice a week to go to a different college while I sorted things out. I also got a job that pays slightly over minimum wage (relevant later).

I am currently 5 months in and I am incredibly frustrated with my living situation. My parents have always been on the over-protective/helicopter side and I know that. They complain that I'm ""never home"" and (maybe not on purpose) guilt me emotionally. 


I never experienced anything like this when I was away, which confuses me. They would keep me at an arm's length, call me 3-4 times a week and our conversations would be healthy and civil. Now I fight with my parents almost constantly (which is not an exaggeration) and cannot get 2 seconds of privacy. 

I desperately want to move out but cannot afford to. I make 7.65/hr +commission and get paid twice a month. I pay for my own gas and anything I need while at school, but I am very much financially dependent. 

I feel like my family (my dad in particular) relies on me for their happiness, and I cannot deal with that. I am not emotionally stable and sometimes, when I would rather keep to myself or do homework to stay on track, they take it personally. This morning, my father was attempting to make plans around Christmas time and asked how interested I would be in that. I historically do not enjoy travelling with my family at all, but I felt that I couldn't say that to him, so I instead asked him not to base any major travel decisions on my opinion, present or future, because I am not reliable. This made him very upset and I don't really get why. 

I wish my family would invest less in my happiness, because I feel that I hold them back from going where they want to go. I want them to be happy, but I also want them to be aware that I now have a job and a college career, both of those things require a lot of time and effort.
---

TL;DR My family bases their happiness off of mine, which is taxing for me. I have school and a job and they wonder why I am never home and never willing to do things with them in the little amount of free time I have. How do I go about moving out and would that even fix this?"
1ntsyk,2,2013-10-06,Advice on working at Big 4 with absolutely no desire to make accounting a career?,earldibblesjrs,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ntsyk/advice_on_working_at_big_4_with_absolutely_no/,"First off, let me start out by saying that I am a technology major in the business school at my university. I am much more interested in the technology aspect of business, rather than the accounting. 

Anyway, this last summer I had an internship at a Big 4 firm performing IT Audits. I really had no desire to go into accounting, but it was the most prestigious internship I was offered. I worked hard all summer and got a full time offer. However, the firm required an acceptance of the offer by the end of August, but recruiting season doesn't happen until September-October at my university. Even though I wasn't exactly thrilled performing audits, I accepted the offer because, hey, its a full time offer. Please spare any moral judgements you have, but I am going through recruiting with a few other companies right now that are offering positions which are more in line with what I would like to do in the future. Even if I were to get another offer, I'm not sure if I would take it because nearly every ""best place to start a career with"" article I read claims starting with a Big 4 is a huge advantage. My question is, does this ""advantage"" have any ground outside of accounting (that you know of anyway), and do you know of employees transferring to non-accounting positions once they leave B4?"

in the past 6 months i've contacted my dad around 8 times, compared to him contacting me once.  that is down from me calling even more frequently, where despite having good conversations i was always the one calling.  same thing with my older brother, who now doesn't even respond. every so often when i see him he'll apologize for being a shitty brother and even cried about it once or twice and promises to try and make it up to me. 

when i try to participate in facebook shit i get ignored, even when it's in the same vein as what everyone else is talking about.  shit that if someone else wrote, it would get dozens of likes (yeah that's pretty petty of me but i dont understand it at all).  so i dont really participate in facebook that much anymore.

i've never been accepted into a group my whole life; i see people excited to hang out with other people regularly, and i am never that person.  obviously this would suggest that its a problem with me since i'm the common factor through it all, but i've put lots and lots of work into it.  i try to be kind, inclusive to everyone (because i know how much it sucks to be excluded), i share, i go out of my way to meet commitments and help where i can, and people just take advantage of me until i lose heart in it.  

some people act like they like me but when i try to set up hanging out or invite them out most of the time i'm not even fucking acknowledged, just no response on phone or online. this is even after a tentative agreement to hang out a few days prior; when i call the day of or the day before theres often not even a response.  this is especially frustrating if there's evidence of those people being active, like another acquaintance just talked to them or they're posting on facebook. its fucking insulting.  i learned a long time ago its pointless to try and figure it out or inquire when you get the freeze, but when i wait for a return call it never comes.

i've been sick and unemployed for the last two months; no one cares.  life just passes me by.  i have interests and hobbies but no one gives a fuck.  some days i want to just stay in bed for a week.

i try to stay positive, but it's just so soul-crushing.  i feel like the butt of a joke, and the whole world is in on it but me. :( i've tried for so long to be strong and successful and accepted, but i feel like a fucking pussy loser with no friends and no job prospects.  i'm poor as fuck and i feel like if i died pretty much no one would even fucking care, and if they did it would only be in a hindsight-is-20-20 sort of way (besides my grandma and my girlfriend, i love you guys). instead i get to look forward to busting my life away for shit-ass pay with grim prospects and a gaping hole where friends should be.  i got an associate's degree in a field which is turning out to be totally fucking worthless and the only work i can get is unpaid fucking internships and minimum wage jobs for the last 2 years.

i even sort of fell into a group of neo hippies / electronic music enthusiasts which at first i was really excited about because on the surface they practiced love and equality for all, but really it's just a hippier-than-thou hierarchal circle jerk where it's all about who's got the coolest clothes, who knows the best djs and parties, what things do you have that can be used, who do you know.  i put a lot of effort into trying to get to know people in that group and almost 2 years later i'm welcome to the parties but no one wants to hang out.

god fucking dammit."
1ntjqa,12,2013-10-05,Seventeen (pt. 1),Grakmarr,TheAssembly,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAssembly/comments/1ntjqa/seventeen_pt_1/,"I apologize for the length of this story, if I were a better writer I would've made it shorter. But people seem to enjoy it. Fair warning, though.

[If you've got 45 minutes to kill, here's an awesome reading of my story! Dude has skills!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_kF519J0)

Edgar raised his head up from his chest; back pressed firmly into his favorite recliner, his entire body drenched in cold sweat. He stared into shadows at the edge of the living room, eyes welling with tears as he lifted the revolver slowly and deliberately to his temple. “Seventeen”, he whispered to the darkness.

The index finger of his right hand had already found its perch on the trigger during the weapon’s ascent, during which he had hesitated no more than a second, his only concern ensuring that the angle he chose would prove fatal. He clenched his left hand into a fist at his side, steeling his will. He inhaled sharply. And with further need of neither breath nor will, he clenched his right hand.

Darkness flashed brilliantly to light from the barrel of a .38 Special, as the gunshot’s dull thunder echoed around the room. The remains of Edgar Freeman slumped sideways in what had once been his favorite chair. The other man with him in that chamber smiled softly, the one in the shadows who had been briefly illuminated by the muzzle flare, that sallow man in the dark suit with the pale blue eyes. He smiled as everything turned gray.

Edgar flailed his way to a sitting position, ripping the covers off the bed as he always did when waking up from that goddamned nightmare. After the fourth night in a row with the same dream, he had taken to sleeping with his bedside lamp turned on. After the sixth night in a row, his frenzy upon waking had sent it crashing to the floor – bulb broken and shade cracked by the impact. Tonight had been the eighth night, and as he recited every vulgarity he could recall into the inky darkness of his bedroom, he swore that today he’d find the time to go purchase a box of light bulbs. Involuntarily recalling the stranger in the dream’s inappropriately sweet smile, he reminded himself to ask the clerk for their highest wattage.

After a warm shower and a few minutes collecting his thoughts on the side of the bed, Edgar set about his day. Nearly-tasteless scrambled eggs and coffee which would have been merciful if it had been tasteless comprised his breakfast, and his thoughts turned to how absurdly better Haley’s morning meal would have been. Whatever other problems they had, Haley’s cooking had been beyond reproach. He would regularly wake to the mouthwatering aroma of a nutritious breakfast which she had prepared for him – usually egg whites on a wheat English muffin with a tall glass of orange juice – at least before the morning sickness had started and kept her occupied in her prayers to the porcelean goddess for her first waking hour of every day. All this, he reminded himself bitterly, was in the past now.

As the Vice-President of Marketing for the second largest athletic apparel company in the country (and, as he thought of himself, a reasonably attractive man) Edgar was more than used to the occasional flirting – both casual and aggressive – from young female interns and employees within his department. It came with the territory, and it was never anything he couldn’t brush off. Thoughts of either taking it further than flirtations or reporting it to Human Resources very rarely crossed his mind; the former on account of his pregnant wife, the latter on account of the ego boost it provided. One month ago, however, Edgar began an affair with a particularly buxom college intern named Samantha. Above and below the brassiere, she had been nothing special; just a warm body to quell the urges to which Haley had been unwilling or unable to tend after entering her third trimester. Even the sex was unremarkable.

Their first rendezvous took place in a motel a few blocks away from the office, the type of place with bay windows overlooking less than scenic freeway overpasses, and even the roaches use black lights before scurrying under the unmade bed. As a cursory nod to legitimacy, the establishment stopped short of offering rates on a per-hour basis – a fact known because Edgar had inquired upon checking in.

After that first encounter, the two grew bolder and less discerning in their indiscretions. Edgar’s office came next, and that time had been a little more satisfying – a combination of the danger and the skirt Samantha kept on at his request. But boldness turned quickly to carelessness, and Edgar was an apprentice of infidelity less than two weeks before Haley discovered his betrayal.

Whether it was a whiff of unfamiliar perfume or a phone call from one of Edgar’s jealous rejects who had spotted the two of them around the office, his adultery with Samantha was soon the topic to which Edgar returned home from work. The accusation was on her face the minute he walked through the door. He had come home late from a particularly wild romp with Samantha, and the words from Haley’s trembling lips quickly disclosed exactly how much she knew.

It would have been pointless to lie – she had too many details and he too little imagination – so Edgar confessed, and made a perfunctory effort to justify his behavior. She cursed him with a severity and intensity which Edgar had never seen from her before, and in her final words to him she made it clear that she was leaving, and that she would make sure he would never in his life have a role in raising their child. Despite his heartache at the prospect of losing Haley, Edgar had spent too long in a cutthroat business to take threats passively, even from his wife. He laughed bitterly, and reminded her of the quality of the lawyers within his means. When he was done, Edgar said with words he instantly regretted but found himself powerless to silence, she would be lucky to get weekends and a few holidays with the kid.

That was a lie and he knew it, but at the time his main objective was to get off the defensive and regain the upper hand in the fight – maybe even make Haley reconsider her choice to leave. He would happily cut some hefty checks to a marriage counselor if it saved him from the much larger ones in the form of alimony and child support. But something in the way Haley was smiling at him suggested that he had misunderstood her intentions. And as he realized far too late; if he had been more observant, he might have noticed an empty hook on their key caddy, and connected it to that sardonic grin she was wearing.

She hadn’t left right away, like he had expected. Isn’t that always the way it works in the movies and on television? The guy comes out of the bathroom or back from the bar a little while after the fight to find the gal’s suitcases dusted off and bulging with all the expensive clothes he bought her over the course of their relationship? Her haughty and defiant, him prostrate and pleading?

Edgar would have never played the latter role in his life, but he had fully expected the former from Haley. Instead, an hour after he walked away from their screaming match to take a much-needed shower, he stuck his head into the living room to find her sitting in his favorite chair (what a bitch) staring off into space and rubbing her (Goddamn is she ready to pop) pregnant stomach.

As far as Edgar was concerned, that was the end of the first of presumably many arguments on the subject. He ascended the stairs quietly, and slipped into bed. The day had been long enough, and she clearly wasn’t going anywhere or she would have left already. Haley never came to bed, but neither did he hear the front door slamming behind her before he drifted off – so it seemed she had decided to stay at least for the night. All will be well, Edgar told himself as sleep overtook him. But I doubt she’s going to fix my breakfast for a few days.

The noise which ripped him out of that deep slumber came just after five o’clock in the morning, according to his alarm clock. By the time consciousness took hold, the sound had died as quickly as it came. He stood reflexively, and scanned over the bed with eyes barely awake enough for even that simple task. Eventually determining Haley’s side to be empty, Edgar shuffled out the bedroom door and down the stairs to determine what caused the sudden clamor.

He didn’t need to reach the bottom of the staircase, or allow his eyes further time to adjust, to know that she had decided to leave him after all. One glance into the living room cleared up any doubt on that subject. There were no bulging suitcases, or haughty looks – just an unlocked and opened gun cabinet, a crimson splatter on the wall, and a steady trickle of the same beading down the side of his favorite chair and pooling on the hardwood floor beside it.

After a moment of shocked paralysis, Edgar lunged for the house phone in huge, desperate strides. The rapidity was not for the sake of Haley, through whose newly-ventilated skull he could clearly catch glimpses of the televised presidential debate at the far side of the room, but for her blameless passenger of seven and a half months. He gave all the pertinent information to the infuriatingly indifferent emergency control room operator, and waited in the hallway with the front door flung open wide.

The gunshot had drawn a crowd of early-waking neighbors to the driveway in front of the Freeman residence, a phenomenon bred not out of bravery in the face of danger but from the casual ignorance of danger reserved exclusively for neighborhoods peopled by the wealthy and sheltered. They eyed him accusingly, none with less than dawning suspicion in their gaze. Edgar raged at them for this; first with harsh thoughts, then with guttural growls and impotent flailing. They would collectively step backward when his fury and frustration flowed strongest, and advance again when the yelling waned in ferocity – a human tide of slack-jawed gawkers.

The spectacle was temporarily dissolved by the wailing siren and subsequent appearance of an Advanced Life Support ambulance, from which paramedics rapidly spawned just a few minutes after Edgar’s conversation with their dispatcher (another feature exclusive to the type of neighborhood in which Edgar and Haley Freeman resided). The crowd made way for the emergency vehicles, but soon found a new vantage point on Edgar’s lawn.
The paramedics discovered Edgar’s wife slumped over in his recliner, and strapped her lifeless form into a gurney. Once she was properly secured, they wheeled her rapidly out of the house and into the back of their ambulance. Edgar jumped in as well, and there was no time to either ask or answer any questions before the crew slammed the bay doors and sped off toward the county hospital.

Between checking vital signs and attempts to keep oxygen pumping into the corpse of his wife for the sake of her unborn child, Edgar noted the cautious glances being shot his way by the Paramedics – as well as the blue flashes from multiple police vehicles following close behind the ambulance. I didn’t have anything to do with it, he wanted to say – to scream – but in the back of his mind he knew that was just a degree or two away from being precisely the truth, and so he remained silent.

He had thought they would throw the handcuffs on him as soon as they arrived at the hospital, but instead the throng of police officers just explained they would wait with Edgar while the doctors did what they could for the baby – and maybe get some information from him if he felt up to talking. Edgar nodded assent, largely because the officers bore all the mannerisms of men who intended to get some information from him whether or not he felt up to talking.

They stood outside the operating room, lined up in the viewing area. The officers gave Edgar his space; his face mere inches from the glass, taking occasional breaks to wipe the window off with his sleeve after frantic breaths had fogged it to the point of opacity. They questioned him hesitantly; he answered them hastily and with little regard for the words he used. His concerns were elsewhere, and he knew there was nothing he could unintentionally blurt out to incriminate himself. He watched as the surgeon made a large incision into Haley’s lower abdomen (at least she’s sedated for this, Edgar thought insanely) and set about removing the baby from her womb.

Within a few minutes, everyone in the viewing area knew everything they needed to know. The officers knew that Haley had apparently died at her own hand (the autopsy would either confirm or deny that), that she had likely done it as a result of her husband’s infidelity, and that Edgar had seen little or no warning signs leading up to the suicide. Edgar, meanwhile, knew that the baby was alive but fading fast, that the baby was a boy (they wanted the gender to be a surprise, one of the few things on which he and Haley never disagreed), and that the baby was being placed in an incubator as a last-ditch effort to save its life.

Edgar stood outside the room, the police now keeping an even more respectful distance as he watched his infant son die. There was little commotion about it, and little the doctors could do to prevent it. The child’s eyes opened once the entire time, and the next thing Edgar knew they were pronouncing the time of death as 5:46 AM. They just cut him out of Haley at 5:29, Edgar thought frantically. My kid – my son – was alive less than half an hour. I didn’t even have time to name him. A girl and Haley names him, a boy and I name him; that was the promise we made since we couldn’t even fucking agree on names. Edgar slammed his fist against the wall, and distantly felt his knuckles grinding. As he fell to his knees, his hand hurt far less than the scalding hot tears welling behind his eyes."
1ntf4h,0,2013-10-05,Me [25M] found out my gf of 1 year [23F] did a porno shoot in the past.,throwawayforaproblem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ntf4h/me_25m_found_out_my_gf_of_1_year_23f_did_a_porno/,"My gf and I have been dating for a year now and have known each other for a little over a year. We went to cross-town colleges but met at one of my friend's parties. After being friends for a couple of months, things got serious as we started to really like each other. It was as if we were a perfect match. 

I made it clear pretty early on in our relationship that I wanted complete honesty between us because we really liked each other and therefore should at least show the respect of being transparent with things that could affect the other person. She understood and for the most part, things worked perfectly fine for us.

But I got hit with a ton of bricks a couple of days ago. My gf came over to my place visibly a little shaken up and worried. I asked her what was wrong and she hesitated. I thought to myself, okay she cheated and just waited for the bomb to be dropped. I asked her if she cheated and she emphatically said no, that she would never ever do such a thing. She said she loved me and cared for me so much. So I told her to tell me what is wrong then.

She then began to tell me that 2 years ago, while she was still in college and a couple of months before we met, she made a porno video. I asked her what she was talking about because I didn't want to believe it. She said that a couple of months before we met, she got an offer to do one of those amateur teen girl casting videos with a legitimate company. She said she was having some money issues, her internship was not paying well because she was going to school full-time and she didn't want to turn to her parents for help. So she took the gig.

She thought she was lucky because it turned out she was an alternate stand-by for some girl who may or may not have been able to do her own shoot. One of the production guys said that they would pay her the full amount she signed for up front and would use the video if/when they had to. Well just 6 months ago, her video was released and my gf just found out about it a couple of days ago from another friend of hers. She was shocked and worried because she thought that after a year had passed, they had probably decided not to release her video for some reason which is fucking stupid because she's hot so why would they pass up an opportunity like that after paying her already.

I was pissed as she told me all of this and I asked her if they at least used a condom. She said no, that both had to get tested before the shoot. But I didn't care because the fact that she decided to intimately fuck another guy she just met without a condom, on video, made me think she was some floozy slut. 

I told her I was pissed and needed time to register all of this and she started to tear up and apologize and all that which didn't do much for me because of how betrayed I felt. She told me to forgive her and I asked her how after she *literally* whored herself out but most importantly, was not honest about it with me. I told her that I needed a couple of days to think about what was going on even though in my mind, I was sure I was going to dump her either way.

I am so pissed and sad at the same time right now. I trusted and loved this girl and she drops something this big on me like it was no big deal. What sucks even more is that I've met her parents and they like me very much, like a son, and I like them a lot too. I wouldn't know what to tell them if I broke up with their daughter because as pissed off as I am at her, I would never even think about telling them what their daughter had done. After all, she betrayed me, not her parents.

I don't know what to do. I've ignored her calls/texts or the past couple of days just to understand what is going on. No luck so far.


**tl;dr** - Girlfriend was in a porno video before we met and didn't tell me about it. I'm pissed and want to break up with her because I can't stop thinking that she was some dishonest whore to me."
1ny1cz,1,2013-10-07,Who is in the wrong here?,ificouldhaveitall,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ny1cz/who_is_in_the_wrong_here/,"So my brother and I have been going to a summer camp for two weeks every year for the past 3 years. Over time, since 2010, we have made many friends. One of these friends is a good friend of both of ours who I will call Hannah. We were like the triple threat, we loved each other so much and it was great. She is a senior in high school now and my brother and I are sophomores.

So this summer we all went as CITs (counselors in training,) and over the two weeks, Hannah and my brother got really close. They started developing feelings and they pursued them. On the last day of camp, we were told whether or not we got an internship, which means we get to stay for another week. Hannah and my brother got it and I didn't. So they stayed another week and pretty much started dating.

Hannah lives in NY and my brother and I live 150 miles away from her. And she's a senior in high school. So it's a long distance relationship between a sophomore and a senior. She is going to college next year.

My problem is that this relationship will obviously not work at all and I have told my brother that and I have flipped out on him numerous times over it and I've said some stuff that I shouldn't have said and of course he told Hannah. She doesn't hate me or anything but we're not the friends we used to be ever since they started dating. It's annoying and they will obviously break up by next summer.

So at *OUR* camp, they're having a get together for everyone at the end of the month and I want to go and see all my friends. My brother doesn't want me to go because he doesn't want me to hang out with him and Hannah but Hannah wants me to go because she misses how we used to be and because camp used to be all of our thing. I am mad because she is my friend to and I can't even talk to her or see her anymore every since their bullshit ""relationship"" started. 

We used to be such good friends and now it's blown because they did this.

Who's in the wrong, me or my brother?"
1nxwbx,0,2013-10-07,my life is a lifetime movie,[deleted],sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/1nxwbx/my_life_is_a_lifetime_movie/,"
I’ve had a pretty rough college experience. My freshman year, four years ago, I was raped in November. The cops found naked and unconscious in a parking lot. I had been drinking, but I was with someone I knew- the person that ended up doing this to me. But I didn’t do anything about it because it was he was my at the time closest friend in college and I didn’t want to start anything because I was drunk. After that I didn’t cope well, it took me a long time to start to hangout with my friends and meet new people again- the way that I was able to do this was through blowing/eating a lot of molly for over a year period that ended in a downward spiral, eating over 2 grams to even feel and effect. But at that time I was seeing a boy G and only intimate with him, he was my backbone during all this. Sadly he was unable to live full time where I did so things feel to the wayside. He was the person that basically helped me be me again after my rape and added in my drug addiction. But a year later I started to date this kid N, because I was trying to filled void of G and love in general, and we stayed together up until last week, which ended up being three years. If it wasn’t for N I would have killed myself, overdoses, or dropped out of college. He was the only one that took care of me and spent time with my pathetic self. But our relationship got very dependent and unhealthy, a lot of other things happened, my unexpected pregnancy and miss carriage, his trying to kill himself because of personal issues. But when all of this started to spiral out of control last November G after he got out of rehab moved to my area and turned my life even more upside down. I had feelings for both, loved and cared for them. Back and forth, back and forth, between the two G and N. G pretty much used me and fucked around with other people. He ended up giving me chlamydia and really fucking up and complicating a lot of thing in my life and relationship with N. I tried so hard to help with his sobriety, be there for him and he would gravitate to me and I would try to be best friend as possible. But I was only taken advantage of in a lot.

But I’ve trying to work on myself, strengthen myself, be independent and stand-alone. So, last weekend when all of my best friends were away I finally cut things completely off with N, ending out long-distance relationship (he moved home after college this past June). This left me feeling the most alone and empty than I have for years. Since high-school I have been filling my void through different drugs, relationships, or meaningless sex and for once I just want to be able to be happy with, love, depend on, and respect myself.  And last week was a really hard struggle. Because I’m in my fifth year of college a lot of my friends have moved away, or are just as busy with school and working full/part time and having an internship, so that makes me feel like I have no one to reach out to because I had been feeling so empty I was wanting to fill that void with the number of substances I’ve had issues with over the years. I decided that I wanted to take it easy this weekend, stay in, and see G on Saturday night after I got out of work because he leaves tomorrow (Tuesday) for NJ for court then jail for his second DUI. Saturday he ended up blowing me off and screaming at me at 3AM for not going to the bar. Despite that I am broke, starting to get depressed, didn’t get off work until 11:30PM, and made shit for tips. Sunday morning continued the same way, with him yelling at me over the phone and ended in a text from him telling me that he came out to everyone last night, and that he is gay. I cannot help but be hurt and upset. I am not angry at all that he is gay. I am happy for his self-discovery and honesty. I hope that it will allow him to actually become sober and not use substances as a coping mechanism for this probably long time inner turmoil. What I am sad about it that I feel used, lied to, taken advantage of, a piece of ugly meat that he was never attracted to in the first place, and the thing that made him feel like, wow, this is so disgusting I now realize that I could never be attracted to that.  I hate myself for hating myself that caused not respect my body or myself and sleep around and get taken advantage of by people that do not care about or deserve me. I’ve put in so much time, care, and love into a human being that has only made me hate myself even more and hurt me (and he’s not the first person to do this to me). Not only that he drove a huge rift in my relationship with my best friend NC. To the point where at time I wondered if they were fucking, but she ended up being the one the he came out to and she and my other best friend H kept this secret from me for two months while G continued to fuck me and play games with me. I know they were doing the right thing be being quite, because coming out is extremely personal and not something for something to tell another person about someone else. I fully acknowledge that they were acting properly, but I cannot help but feel hurt, lied to, and betrayed by the people that I really need to rely on right now. I cannot reach out to them. I have huge trust issues and something like this, although I know they were doing the right thing, really just destroy my trust in them because they watched and played dumb and he’s ripped me apart and used the past few months. I feel so alone. I hate myself. I cannot stop crying and do not know what to do. On top, of that I have this inner turmoil of wanting to handle this on my own, but part of me just really needs someone to come hold me or hangout with me. I don’t want to feel like I need someone to be they’re for me, and I hate that I feel this way but I honestly cannot handle being alone right now. It’s making me even more depressed. I don’t know what to do or who to turn to. I’m so ashamed of myself.

1nxpsd,69,2013-10-07,Interested in contributing to Dota Radio? We have one on-air host position available! Details inside,TheRealZyori,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1nxpsd/interested_in_contributing_to_dota_radio_we_have/,"Hey guys!

Dota Radio launched with a bang, much in thanks to some awesome support from Reddit!  We wanted to start this thread off with an expression of gratitude for all the feedback and praise that showed up across the multiple threads folks put up.

As many of y’all know, our goal is to emulate a more traditional radio format, which means adding radio talk shows to our programming!  Right now we’re working on launching the *Dota Radio Morning Show*, which will air 5 days a week for about 45 minutes in the morning (around 10am EST) before we begin casting for the day.  

The show format is modeled after what they do over at [The Dan Patrick Show](http://www.danpatrick.com/), but for Dota 2 instead of traditional sports.  The format hinges on our ability to find interview guests on essentially a daily basis- that's where you come in.

------

We are looking to add one person to the staff to fill a necessary role in this newscast.  The person that fills this position will serve as a permanent on-air host, but will also need to have channels of communication with potential guests, including players, casters, team managers, team owners, bloggers, and really anyone with an informed opinion about what’s happening in Dota 2.

We need someone with a vast network in Dota 2 that is comfortable approaching prominent community members for statements and offering interview slots.  This individual will work very closely with Zyori and Hippie in organizing show content.  He/she will be given creative freedom over who to approach and how to best utilize our time slot set aside for interviews.  Someone up-to-date on recent tournaments and match results is most desirable.  

TLDR; your job is to find daily interview guests for our Dota 2 newscast

------

**Requirements:**

* Decent quality mic
* Firm grasp of the English language
* Availability from ~10-11am EST at least 4 days a week
* *Well connected with players, team managers, and community members*
* Passionate about Dota 2 &amp; esports

------

**Bonus:**

* Nearly Philadelphia / South Jersey / Delaware area
* Experience in live show production

------

**As for pay:**

We do have some funds available, but we much prefer to invest in hardware and infrastructure rather than directly into people’s pockets whenever possible.  Most of our staffers operate as interns that are looking to get something on their esports resume. There is a possibility for pay, though most likely through revenue-sharing options.  Compensation varies greatly by individual and will be discussed on a case-by-case basis; payment is possible for the right candidate.

This position is a great way to make a name for yourself and be on air 5 days a week without having to invest in quality streaming equipment.  It's also perfect for someone who free lances or works on a flexible schedule that wants to get their foot in the door with Dota 2.

------

1nxina,0,2013-10-07,Big 4 Target School and its starting to look like I will be in the minority WITHOUT a Big 4 offer :( Feeling pretty down right now.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1nxina/big_4_target_school_and_its_starting_to_look_like/,"So, I go to one of the top accounting schools in my area and it really seems like at least half the people in my classes already have jobs lined up in the Big 4. 

I know plenty others in my classes who don't but I'm a top performer in my classes and in previous jobs so I'm really getting bent out of shape over it.

I applied to all four firms.

Delloite- never got to schedule an interview and everyone I talked to who applied didn't get to either (about 5 of us).

EY- I have a second interview lined up.

PWC- Interviewed Thursday and no call back or email.

KPMG- interviewed Wednesday and no call back or email.

I'm really just feeling pretty down. I don't want to be in public forever so I need to start at a really big firm.

I just don't even know what to do with myself. I must have really blew it. 

Also, if you're wondering why I didn't intern Big 4 its because I missed the deadlines and was unsure if I was eligible. I'm a rare commuter student at my school so I don't get to hear about all of this stuff the same way. Sometimes I think the fact that I'm a commuter student hurts me because when alum interview us they want to talk to someone like themselves."
1nxiec,2,2013-10-07,2L at T14. To drop out or not to drop out?,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1nxiec/2l_at_t14_to_drop_out_or_not_to_drop_out/,"I am currently attending a t14 paying sticker. I understood the risks of going to law school but decided to risk it anyway. I had the usual ""plan""- do well as a 1L, and then join the 40+% of students from my school who get BigLaw gigs, work at the firm for 5 years or so, in that time pay off all of my debt and save some money, then switch to a position that pays well (but not BigLaw well) but offers normal working hours. 

Well, unfortunately (at least for me) I did not do well in my first year. Even though I did all the assignments, read supplements, and took practice tests for every class- I ended up in the bottom 1/3. OCI comes and goes and I strike out.

Now, the problem is that I am taking on all of this school debt when according to my school career adviser my best chance of landing a job is targeting small firms that pay anywhere from 45k to 70k (this is assuming I'm even going to get a job there). 

I thought about going the DA route, but my interests lie in business law. So even if I somehow manage to convince the DA that I always wanted to be a prosecutor and get a summer internship, the city I want to work in has a hiring freeze at the DA's office.

I have also considered doing JAG, but that's just not something I am interested in- I like having control over my life, even if I do make foolish decisions that cost me a lot of money.

If I drop out now, I will have a six figure debt, but it will be half of what it is going to be if I stay in law school until graduation. I could at least land an entry-level job that pays 35k a year; and, and 35k a year working 40 hour week with 100k debt  seems better than 60k a year working 60 hour weeks with 200k debt (plus, the interest on 200k will make a huge difference)

Should I cut my losses now and do something else? Or stick it out till the end? What would you do in my shoes? 

Thank you.

How do you do it?,Fatalfable,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1nwh8x/kind_of_having_an_anxiety_attack_about_my_weight/,"I felt like shit yesterday and decided to binge eat again to the point where I am having such a large insulin spike I felt like I had a full nights rest in 4 hours. 

I have quite a bit of history with fitness and have lost cumulatively 100+ lbs over the past couple of years constantly fluctuating between the same 30-40 lbs range. I have gained back another 30 something lbs since March? Just from binge eating. 

This is all due to my schedule. I have to be up in the morning at around 4 or 5 am depending how I am feeling. Be out of the house an hour later and have another hour commute to college. Then I wont leave for another 12-14 hours in which basically 100% of that time is being productive whether it is spent in class, studying, doing work, or practicing on my primary instrument (music major... kind of). Then of course another hour or so back home and I am just beat up and don't have it in me to spend the 2 hours I have left of the day to exercise or cook meals for an entire day away from home the next day. Saturday and Sundays are usually free.

How the hell do some of you guys do it? I feel that if I had the drive of  when I first learned what the hell macro nutrients were and how to manage them along with my calories, when to eat what and why, etc. I could somehow pull this off. Although, this was a major issue before. I used to sleep 3 hours a night 5 or 6 days out of the week (procrastinating unlike today) and fitting in the right meals and an hour of HIIT training a day. I would be fine for a month and a half to two months until I would get severely sick and be left off with some kind of cold and fever combination for about 2 weeks and another 2 or 3 of kind of recover. This is followed by diminished motivation and having to build back up to where you left off if at all. This last part has happened to me 5 times or so. Very annoying which is why I won't sacrifice sleep now. Plus, it makes school so much harder. 

I am a music therapy major, I am already prepared as a performer to do my job. I am simply putting in my 1200 required clinical internship hours along with my gen ed classes. Although, I have my classical guitar professor who constantly puts more work on me which is an extra 4 hours a day if I want to be prepared. I almost want to give up my guitar stuff just so I can so I can exercise again and feel happy. 

AHHH can someone help me out here? "
1nw4iw,2,2013-10-07,"Exhausted, demoralized, in pain, alone, and stuck in a rut...just looking for some optimism or advice.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nw4iw/exhausted_demoralized_in_pain_alone_and_stuck_in/,"Hey everybody, I just wanted to rant about my present situation for a bit to get it off my chest and this seems like the best place to do it. This'll probably end up being pretty long, but I'd truly appreciate it if some of you would read through it. Thanks for listening, I'd love to hear any advice if anybody has some ideas on how I can improve my life or be happier in general.

I've been having a rough couple years, and it's getting tougher and tougher to be able to convince myself things will get better. It all started when I was diagnosed two years ago with a skin condition that, while not-immediately life threatening, is very demoralizing and stressful. Without going into a ton of detail, it's a very, very rare genetic condition that causes tumors to grow in my skin all over my body. They start tiny and take years to grow, but they never go away, they just keep growing over time. While only a few are even visible now, I already have more than 50 growing in my skin all over me, and it's likely that after a few more years, I'll really start becoming disfigured by it. The only ""cure"" is to go through very painful (and expensive, thanks U.S. healthcare industry) surgeries to remove them, and it just wouldn't be possible to have enough surgeries to rid them all. Besides, I'd be riddled with scars and more tumors would just grow in their place eventually. Despite some of the tumors causing pain, insurance will often just claim the condition is cosmetic and therefore operations to remove them are no more essential than plastic surgery. So getting a single dime of treatment covered is a fight every single time, and I often have to wait until a tumor causes excruciating pain to finally get it cut out. The medical industry doesn't give a shit about this condition; in fact, there's more money being spent to research this condition in dogs than in human beings (apparently dogs can get it too). 

While the chances of this condition becoming life-threatening are somewhat rare, the dangers are there; if one of these things starts to grow in my internal organs, I could die. This condition also mimics the growth patterns and form of a very deadly cancer too, and so if I get this certain type of cancer the odds would be virtually zero that it would be detected early enough to treat me (before it spreads).

While the chances of this killing me are fairly low, it's so, so, stressful. I've been slammed with a nagging feeling of existential dread that's been beating me down for two years straight. I think about this condition every single day and feel sick whenever I find another lump, wondering if maybe my luck has run out and this one is cancerous. Wondering how disfigured I'll be in a few years even if I manage to not get cancer. Wondering how long I have to live. Wondering if I'll somehow one day come up with enough money to get the most painful tumors removed, as they get more and more painful. On top of all that, I've worked very hard to get myself in great athletic shape and I'm very proud of my body, so it makes me feel awful to see my body slowly being disfigured, to see all that hard work go to waste. It leeches away at my self-worth and esteem and has taken away one of the things that gave me confidence, being in great shape. Running my hands over my body, I can feel the tumors by the dozen in my skin. I can't imagine anyone wanting to touch me because of these, and being fearful about someone being affectionate with me makes me feel awful. If someone ends up loving me at some point, I dread the day I have to tell them about this disease, and the reaction they might have when they try to be affectionate and touch me.

I previously struggled with depression for years and was finally, finally, just coming out of it and starting to feel truly happy when I was diagnosed with this condition. It sent me spiraling right back down, way below where I was even at the first place. My girlfriend of two years saw my mood changing and started to act much more distantly towards me. When I tried to talk about it, she would complain that the condition was all I ever talked about and would get angry at me for being sad all the time. She eventually moved back in with her family and started to ignore me. Despite that, I still worked as hard as I could to keep the relationship together, but no matter what I did she would remain emotionally distant. Eventually, after a lot of passive-aggressive behavior from her and a constant refusal to ever talk about our relationship in order to try to work things out, I broke up with her.

Now I feel like I have absolutely no support system. Money is way too tight for a therapist. I recently graduated from college, and all my friends have relocated to various sides of the country for work. I'm stuck in a shitty small town in the southern U.S., and I hate it here. I can count on one hand the number of people that are within twenty years of my age that live here, no joke. It's essentially a retirement community. I feel so, so alone. My friends have gradually stopped talking to me, and initiating conversation rarely works anymore, I usually get no response. I know I have to move out of here as soon as I can, I feel like I'm absolutely wasting the best years of my life alone in a place with no chance at a better job or making new friends or finding a relationship. So I'm applying for jobs all over the country, and despite a killer resume, a ton of relevant skills, internship experience in several major cities, and graduating with honors from one of the best schools in the world, not a single job application has even warranted a response. Not even a rejection or a ""thanks for applying"" generic form letter. I knew applying for jobs out of state in a competitive industry would be difficult, but after 6 months of effort to absolutely no effect, it's hard not to feel worthless. I see nearly every single one of my friends from college landing jobs, going on adventures, living in fun cities, making a career for themselves, and finding relationships, and it makes me furious, jealous, and hateful. Where did I fuck up? I have incredible grades and plenty of work experience, why do I get to be left behind? I went to a great school, I got great grades, I worked my ass off every single day for years and years, what did I do wrong?

And so I'm stuck here, in a town I hate, with no friends for hundreds of miles, no chance of making new ones here, nobody to talk to, no career, treading water in a low-paying, no-future job that doesn't allow me money enough to do anything but sit at home on my days off. The feeling that I'm wasting what's left of my youth and the best years of my life is eating me alive. The stress of my medical problems has been dragging me slowly, slowly, down and I can barely even remember what life was like before this disease. One piece of advice I received from an older person here was ""go out and have fun, your 20's are the only time in life you don't need to worry about medical problems!"" All I've done every single day for two years is torture myself over my medical problems, and it made me feel even worse to think that most people my age don't even think about stupid bullshit like medical conditions. I'd give years and years of my life away for just a single minute of having the medical stress lifted off my shoulders. And I know I'll never, ever be free of this disease, that those days are long gone.

I've felt lonely for so long that it's growing into something worse, a constant feeling of cynicism and hate towards myself, the future, and the world in general. Even though I used to get compliments all the time from women (when I was actually around people my age) on my looks and my intelligence, I still didn't feel any better about life, or myself, or my future. I don't know why. I assume the worst case scenario in every situation I come across and I have no hope for my future, which I know is a little silly, the odds are still on my side to have something of a decently happy life, and obviously billions of people have it much worse than me, but I still feel hopeless. I never had a fantasy that I'd be a millionaire and things would always be easy and my life would be struggle-free, but I never guessed my life would be this...demoralizing and lonely. 

I'm a kind, loving person, and being so, so, lonely is the worst feeling imaginable for me, because I remember this feeling very well; back when I first struggled with depression, saying I didn't handle it well would be a massive understatement. I isolated myself, lost all my friends, and didn't talk to anyone for years and years. I obviously learned that that wasn't the way to deal with it, so I made friends, chased my dreams, and slowly climbed out of the pit. I was happy, finally, for a time. But now I find myself just as alone and isolated, and the difference now is that I feel like it's been forced upon me. The loneliness has brought some bad, bad memories back.

On the outside, I'm tough. I'm happy. I'm invincible. I'm fine. I'm tough. Nothing's wrong. I'm a man. I'm tough. But on the inside I feel gutted, ripped apart, and completely, completely, alone. Knowing that while I'm in this city nothing will get better just makes the job search even more depressing and desperate. I can't imagine a few more months like this. I'd give nearly everything I have for a warm, loving hug, a smile, or a gentle hand to hold through the night. Or even just someone to talk to in person, some sort of eye contact. It's hard to believe a couple years ago I was happy. That I had finally escaped depression and things were looking up. I've found myself becoming cynical, jaded, hopeless, and hateful, and I despise every second I spend here. I just want a reason to be hopeful, something to think about that isn't so bleak and lonely.

Thank you for listening. Despite what it might sound like, I'm not trying to throw a ""woe-is-me"" pity party. I'm tough as nails, I'm one hell of a fighter. I just wish some sort of luck would find me after these last couple miserable years is all. Thanks in advance for any advice you might have to give. If you read through that whole thing, thank you so much."

1nw0tv,7,2013-10-07,Mixed Signals! How do you know when another guy is interested in you more than just a friend?,dcubed333,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1nw0tv/mixed_signals_how_do_you_know_when_another_guy_is/,"I know there are hundreds of posts about similar situations, but I wanted to post my story and see what kind of next step advice people would suggest. 

I'm 24, freshly out of the closet, and currently finishing my last semester at graduate school.  My coming out happened after spending 3 months in NYC this past summer for an internship.  It was the perfect opportunity for me to live authentically in a new city, as I had finally reached a point in my life where I accepted me for me.  

Upon my return to grad school this fall, I began to share with only a few close friends that I had come out.  I go to a VERY small private business school and people love to gossip.  Therefore word started to get out about me, but I am fairly confident that not everyone at school knows that I am gay.

Enter the guy in question.  Lets call him GB. I've casually known GB since last year, but after we returned to school and gossip has gone around about my sexuality, he has been giving me a lot of attention and more mixed signals than I know what to do with. I spent a lot of time this summer trying to learn the ins and outs of gaydar from other gay friends in NYC, and I feel like GB has thrown a wrench in my detection system.

It all started one night a bar that everyone from school hangs out at.  
Backstory of GB.  He's tall, good looking, athletic, and literally every girl at school lines up to throw themselves at him.  However, he has never pursued a girl at school and he's left girls probably more frustrated than me. 

Back to the bar. A few weeks after school, I saw him standing at the bar waiting for a drink and I decided to walk up next to him to order myself one. After he jokingly puts his arm around me and says some cheesy pickup line (caught me way off guard), we started to talking about post graduation plans.

We talked for 2 hours (never have we talked that long before). First thing I noticed was the most consistent direct eye contact I've ever had with anyone.  I don't think we looked away from each other once. We kept finding so many things in common with one another and the conversation flowed so naturally.   It ended with him asking for my number.  Later that night he texted me saying, ""it was so good getting to know you more tonight, sorry we haven't talked sooner. Lets meet up this week.""

At this point in time I had convinced myself that he was straight and all I was doing was simply projecting what I wanted to see in his behavior. I do this so as to not get my hopes up, as with any platonic straight guy friend. But then a few nights later, one of my good girl friends from school (not knowing anything of that night at the bar with GB) texts me saying ""GB gay?? If so get on it!""

Confused I responded by asking her to explain. She said that a bunch of girls at school were convinced that he is gay and really far in the closet. My first thought was, okay, he are 5 jealous girls who are just pissed that GB doesn't respond to their advances. But then over the past month and multiple questionable actions, I'm starting to think they are right.

Since the bar, GB and I have hung out quite a bit.  This is strange, because what I noticed since last year is that GB is very popular on campus and is always seen with groups of people.  However, now all of a sudden he takes a lot of time out of his week to spend just with me and specifically one on one.  We grab meals together of campus, go hiking, and spend time just talking. In addition to constant eye contact every time we meet, he has now started to throw in fleeting touches.  Such as lightly grabbing my thigh or touching my arm when making a point. At a recent meeting on campus for a club, he leaned in close behind me while seated and whispered in my ear while letting his face brush against mine. (I nearly lost it!)

I would respond with more flirting, but I'm honestly left not knowing what to do. Especially during one instance this past week where I got super mixed signals. We had just gotten back from going out to a late dinner and drinks and we're sitting in my car.  When it was time to say goodbye or continue that night and he got really nervous and quite uncomfortable.  All of a sudden after 4 hours of eye contact he wouldn't look me in the eye after we pulled into the parking lot. It was like he had something to say, or was waiting for me to say something but I didn't. All we said was goodnight and ""talk tomorrow.""

We texted and talked since then, and are meeting up again this week, but I don't know where to go from here. 

 1.) I am not entirely sure he knows I am gay. I've never directly told him, although I believe he heard me talking about it with a friend at the bar (she was drunk and literally yelling at me ""why do you have to be gay?"" Haha) Should I directly tell him I am gay? And if so, how do I causally work that in without freaking him out if he really is still in the closet or just straight? It all just seems weird to me that he really started talking to me after people at school began to find out I was gay. Maybe just coincidence.

2.) As mentioned, if he is gay and not ready to deal with it/accept it I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable. Over the course of this questionable month I've begun to really appreciate his friendship and I am afraid to lose that. If he is in the closet and not accepting it, I've been there (after all I waited till 24 until I fully accepted it), and I don't want to flirt with him, freak him out, and send him further in the closet.

3.) Is there any subtle ways I can flirt back to send signals to him that I am interested? The only ""safe"" ways I've learned are maintaining his eye contact, looking away shyly every once and awhile and also playing the fleeting touch game.

I guess I am just frustrated because I don't know how to proceed and I can tell that I've started to develop feelings for him. If you've made it this far thanks for reading.  Reading Gaybros has helped me get through a lot of my own personal coming out process.  I would appreciate any advice or insight people are willing to offer. You guys are the best."

1o0u29,0,2013-10-08,My Problem with J. Crew,NobleGnome,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1o0u29/my_problem_with_j_crew/,"In high school I was a very competitive rower.  I was always trying to put on muscle, particularly in my legs, which gave me some scary proportions.  I at a time I was a 6' tall, 145lbs, guy who could leg press 1200lbs.  Because of this, I never invested in clothes because the fit would never be decent with out a tailor and I knew I would just out grow them in a couple months anyways.

However, now that I'm done with crew and have a decent paying internship, I want to invest in clothes that will last, which brought me to J. Crew.  Now I buy everything from them.  If I need a shirt, sweater, jeans, really any basics, I just wait for it to go on sale and pick it up with my student discount.  I know my sizes with them so I can shop effortlessly and I rarely ""need"" tailoring.  I'm not bored with anything I've purchased from them which is perfect because everything has lasted for longer than expected.  And in short, this is my problem.  With the exception of some shoes, ties, and other accessories, I find myself getting dressed in the morning wearing almost exclusively in J. Crew.

I am worried that I'm not branching out enough but I'm so content with my purchases at J. Crew that ordering from a different company who's fit might not be right and who is more expensive just isn't worth the risk for me.

The competition is hosted by Disney Imagineering. The deadline to apply is October 15th and the deadline for submission is November 15th. My self and two friends want to compete and think we have a legitimate shot at being one of the six finalists sent to Disneyland California (for free) IF we got one more team-member. We're looking for someone with great creativity but also has great skill in computer-based art programs. We have noticed that past winners have one thing in common: their submissions are very professional when it comes to the design/presentation aspect. The three of us are as creative as it gets, but means nothing if we have no way to present our ideas. Finalists will present in front of a panel of imagineers and cast members, and all finalists have a shot at possibly getting internships with Disney Imagineering. 

If you're slightly interested, would like more information, and are creative with skills in computer-based design programs (photoshop, etc.) send me a PM. I would like to send in our application in the next few days.

I'm going through Fall Recruiting right now as a Junior, trying to line up 2014 summer internships. I applied to 9 firms, got 8 interviews - so far 1 has declined, I have 2 left to do.

Today I just heard back from Moss Adams, and they've given me a second round interview. I first interviewed at my school in Portland, and since my first choice of location is Medford I am going to be doing a 2nd round/office visit there. I haven't heard when it will be or what it will be like yet, but the details will be worked out soon.

So, my questions: What do I need to do differently this time around? Will the interview questions be more intense? Or at this point do they just want to get to know me? Am I supposed to be asking more questions this time? Am I pretty much already ""in"" or is this still a trial process? 

Any other advice that people may have, general or specific to Moss Adams is greatly appreciated. Thanks! "

With this in mind, I've been toying with the idea of doing a joint degree program, with a Masters of social work and a masters of public administration.

My question, though, is whether I would be better off just doing the SPA concentration with my MSW. I'm afraid of going down that path because I know in most (if not all) states you cannot become an LCSW unless you have a clinical degree, and I'm not sure I want to rule out that option, even though I'm not sure I want to go down that path.

I also am struggling with whether I should do some clinical work before seeking an administrative job, so that I know what it's like to be on that side of the profession. I know I'll take whatever job I can find, but I want to have at least a goal before I get started on another degree (or two!)

I decided to go back into therapy again, still with my university. But the counseling center primarily employs interns and so they're really transient. The counselor that I saw last year isn't there anymore. So I'm going to see yet another new counselor and have to give my whole story again and start from ground zero showing this new person who I am. And I just find it really frustrating; it's impossible for me to build reasonable rapport with a counselor when I live 6 1/2 hours away from home and the counselors keep changing. What's the point of even seeing one if I start from the bottom every time I start? 

Feeling a little hopeless...I don't see how I'm ever going to improve if this keeps happening. What's more, I honestly don't know how I'm going to go through my life story again. I'm just so numb about it all and I don't have the energy to do it all again.

1nyar2,1,2013-10-07,Me [23/m] having trouble deciding between two girls. (x-post from /r/askmen),5678throwaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nyar2/me_23m_having_trouble_deciding_between_two_girls/,"TL;DR at bottom but please read it all. Sorry for wall of text

So I guess I should start from the beginning. Last winter my best friend of 3 years, lets call him Jake[23/m], started dating this girl whom we'll call Susan[19/f]. Since he was my best friend and she practically lived at his place we all became good friends. Soon I went away for the summer for an internship and Jake moved back with his parents across the country. He did this for various reasons including money and only having one class left that he could take online. Before he left (at the end of the summer) he was asking me to keep her company since he wasn't going through with the LTR that he agreed to try and she didn't have too many friends.

By the time I got back from my internship Jake had been moved back for about 3 weeks and had started to talk with me less and less. I would try and talk with him and he would always find a way to make the whole conversation anywhere from 3-5 minutes. The night I got back I was hanging out with one of my roommates and he introduced me to his girlfriend's friend whom we'll call Lilly[21/f]. Lilly seemed cool but I did only get to talk with her about 15 minutes before she left. About a day after I got back I was hanging out with Susan since we both had the day off and we ended up sleeping with each other.
At the time we both agreed that it was sort of a mistake and we would never mention it to Jake because by this point he had stared to get depressed about moving in with his parents, not having a job, feeling like a loser, etc. Some time in the following days we agreed to be friends with benefits (I had been in a 3 year dry spell and she only liked sleeping with people she trusts) and continued sleeping with each other from time to time.

At about this time Jake would only talk with me if I started a conversation and would usually escape it by saying he didn't feel good and would just stop talking with me. I found out from Susan that he would still have conversations with her, some of them about me and how our friendship is basically over since we don't live in the same place anymore along with other reasons (not working together on projects or at our job). He did mention that he didn't know how to feel about me hanging out with his ex, even though he was the one that told me to, and I told him that if he was uncomfortable to tell me.
About a week or so into the FWB arrangement with Susan I told her that I was starting to get feelings for her (we were spending a lot of time together) and that we needed to stop according to our terms (if anyone started getting feelings we stop) and since she was still kinda in love with Jake. Of course it didn't stop but I started pursuing Lilly more aggressively.

Lilly and I would occasionally chat over FB and moved to texting each other while Susan and I continued our FWB. I stopped really getting more feelings for Susan since I had another prospective girl and it was more of a traditional FWB arrangement. About 3 weeks into the FWB situation Susan starts telling me some of the stuff Jake is saying to her about me and even showed me chats that they have had about me. All through this time I still try and talk with Jake but he keeps just pushing me away.

So let's skip ahead to about 4.5 weeks into the FWB situation. Susan claims that she is now starting to get feelings for me and is kinda hinting that she would like to date me. Lilly and I finally go on a short coffee date (she is halfheartedly cramming for a test and talking with me).
Around week 5 or 6 Susan and I start talking about what is going on between us and we both agree that it kinda feels like we are unofficially dating, but she still cares for Jake, albeit less and less every day. We agree to just see where it goes

Skip to a week ago (week 7). Susan is now saying that she is done with her ex and would kinda like to date me. I wen't clubbing with Lilly, my roommate and his girlfriend over the weekend to celebrate Lilly's 21st and ended up crashing with Lilly in a hotel. Nothing happened since we were in a room with 4 other people (including her mom and aunt) among other recent problems. Susan asks about it and then proceeds to get upset at me when I tell her the truth. She feels like she is second to Lilly even though she isn't and I promised not to do anything until I figured out what I want to do.

I do care for Susan and think that we would make a great couple but I am not sure what to do about Jake. He was a good friend but recently he has been a dick and has even said that if anyone wanted to be his friend they had to ""fight for him"". At the same time I wouldn't mind seeing where this thing with Lilly would go. To top it off I am going to be graduating in December and leaving for another state in January.  I know that Susan would be down for a LDR but I am not sure about Lilly nor am I sure that I want one. At this point I don't know what to do. Do I go with the relationship I am already kinda in (Susan) and permanently loose a friend (Jake) or do I go for Lilly and hope that he comes around? Please reddit, at this point any advice would be welcome.

TL;DR -- Friend moved cross country left ex whom he promised a LDR. Didn't do LDR. His ex and I get together as FWB because we hung out a lot. Another girl comes into picture. Have feelings for both girls. Possibility of relationship with one and guaranteed with other. Not sure what to do."
1ny97o,2,2013-10-07,Me [21F] and my BF [28M] have been together for a little over a year (last 4 months LDR) and we aren't sure we can handle the distance anymore. What now?,niccole456,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ny97o/me_21f_and_my_bf_28m_have_been_together_for_a/,"So we've been at the LDR for a few months now, and it's been difficult.  Very difficult.  I'm 4 months into a 7 month internship, the only time I'm going to see him is in 2 weeks for a few days, I'm going back for a wedding. 

There are good things that have come of it; better communication, relying on each other emotionally, etc but it seems like the distance might just be too much for us right now.  My BF said the other day that it pretty much feels like we aren't even dating because of the limited amount of contact we have with each other.  Our schedules are the worst - I work 7am-5pm, he works 2pm-10pm (4pm-12am my time).  We talk on his lunch break for fifteen minutes maybe sometimes and then try to skype on the weekends.  

""Going on a break"" has been mentioned but not a decision that has been made, but at this point I think we both are aware that we aren't getting much from the relationship other than the pressure to make it happen (which seems impossible right now).  

I guess I just don't know what's best, should we go on a break, continue talking when we can, but if other dating opportunities come up take them and plan to date when I'm back?  I guess what's even the difference between taking a break and breaking up with a possibility of dating when it's possible again?  I'm having a super hard time knowing how to go on with this the best way.  Any experience and advice would be greatly appreciated.

At my lowest weight earlier this year, I was 121lbs and shredded - thanks to bulimia and excessive exercising. I've kicked the eating disorders, but now I'm on a 2-month sedentary job internship in a city with amazing cuisine. Since I don't banish my food to the toilet bowl anymore, it has found a new home on my thighs and stomach. 

The business meals, happy hours, and special event dinners aren't doing any favors for my waistline or my well-being. Here's the plan:

* Eating clean --&gt; sticking with unprocessed or minimally processed foods when possible. No diet or sweetened beverages, no Splenda or other substitutes. Water with fruit for flavor at all times. Not calorie counting because it tends to be a trigger
* Sticking with current routine of 30 mins of Pilates per night
* Walking for daily commute as time allows, vs. public transportation
* Incorporating bodyweight programs (SimpleFit and Beast Skills) into workouts until internship is over and I have access to a gym again

Goal: Not worried about numbers on the scale, just want to feel BETTER and STRONGER!

Will add measurements when I can grab some tape tomorrow

Good luck everyone, let's do this!"

Most of the websites I come across claim that GIS is an expanding field with many job opportunities but then I look at the comments and there are tons of ""I'm in GIS and can't find a job to save my life"" posts. Is that something you guys agree with?

I've got a MA in Applied Sociology (learned a lot..but goodluck getting a job) and am going back to school. I've been taking some Computer Science courses and I enjoy the programming aspect of it but not really the math and electrical engineering components. I have my doubts to actually being able to complete all of the math in any reasonable amount of time or at all (although I still plan to casually work at it). A career advisor at the school suggested I look into GIS since I really enjoy using computers, I’ve done some work with environmental orgs using GIS technology, there are areas of overlap with Sociology, and I seem to be able to learn at least moderate programming.

I could probably get a degree in Geography with an emphasis and certificate in GIS in about 2 years. However, I'm terrified about investing that time and money into something that won't have any job opportunities (like the position I am in now with Sociology). Any ideas/suggestions? Thanks! 

EDIT: This is assuming I do things correctly like participate in internships, continue to learn some programming like Python (currently I'm about a year into learning Java and will soon be looking to expand), and really focus on learning as much GIS software as I can.

Evidence: A meta-analysis and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT)
• Meta-analysis (1) of 21 RCTs (including RCT below) with 91,074 patients (54% males) randomized to multivitamins or placebo for 3.5 years. Most are primary prevention  studies from Europe or North America. 
o No effect on overall mortality: Relative risk (RR) 0.98 (0.94-1.02)
 -No effect on cancer mortality: RR 0.96 (0.88-1.04)
 -No effect on CVD mortality: RR 1.01 (0.93-1.09)
 -Multiple subgroup testing found no differences
o No evidence of publication bias or meaningful heterogeneity

• Physicians’ Health Study II: Heavily publicized RCT (2,3) of 14,641 men (mean age 64.3) randomized to Centrum Silver™ or placebo, followed 11.2 years. 
o No effect on overall mortality: Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.94 (0.88-1.02)
 -No effect on cancer mortality: HR 0.88 (0.77-1.01)
 -No effect on CVD mortality: HR 0.95 (0.83-1.09)
 -No effect on CVD events: HR 1.01 (0.91-1.10)
 -Reduced cancer incidence: HR 0.92 (0.86-0.998) 
• These were adjusted (for unclear reasons)
• Unadjusted is not significant RR 0.94 (0.87-1.003)
o Multiple Issues: lots of exclusion including run-in to remove non-compliant 
patients, adjustments (without clear reason) always in favor of multivitamins. 

Context: 
• Multiple cohort studies have found no mortality reduction with multivitamins. (4-7)
• Vitamin supplementation may help reduce overall mortality in undernourished populations (like rural China). (8) However, in this RCT of 4 different vitamin interventions, only one reduced 
mortality RR 0.91 (0.84-0.99)
• Meta-analyses of different vitamin components on mortality
o B-Vitamins:(9) No effect
o Anti-oxidants:10 Increase mortality RR 1.04 (1.01-1.07) 
 -Increase with vitamin E, beta-carotene and high-dose vitamin A
 -No effect from vitamin C and selenium
o Vitamin D:(11) Decrease mortality RR 0.97 (0.94-1.00)
o Increases and decreases are small (Numbers Needed to Harm (NNH) or treat around 200 over 5 years)

TLDR: Present evidence does not support the routine use of multivitamins to reduce mortality, cardiovascular disease or cancer for people in developed countries.

I would appreciate any info or offer that could help me find a developer position in Sweden. 

So i am a programmer and currently a Comp.Sc. student in Riga, Latvia. Have got two year professional diploma and am continuing my studies. I have a 2 years experience with some variety of technologies starting with internship in Accenture as .Net #C programmer and some part time job developing Drupal webdites. But now have mainly been working as a C++/PHP programmer with MySql db designing and Javascript coding when needed. Also have a little experience with C programming microprocessors.

Have studied in Denmark in my previous studies as Structural engineer, but later decided that programming/ software development is the thing that i actually love. Have been learning swedish for 4 months. 
So I am looking for a C++ or PHP position but ideally a position that would require some creativity and ingenuity on projects in different platforms.
I am definitely looking to master C++ and related frameworks as I have the not that original dream of getting into Game Industry. I would prefer an larger city where i could possibly continue my studies

Anybody can contact me in comments or pm.

I started lifting a few months ago to work on overall strength, but now I'd like to really focus on dropping the fat by adding some cardio and watching what I eat more carefully. Currently I lift with my roommates 3x/week. I'm going to be adding core work, running and/or cycling, tracking all of my food, and really push myself to increase my lifts.

My goal is to drop about 20 lbs in the coming 12 weeks. Mostly, I'd like to drop from a snug size 14 to a comfy size 12. I'm confident that I can do this; at my heaviest I was 210 and within a year I had dropped to 175 after making some lifestyle changes. I gained some of it back over two years of grad school, working, internship, lack of sleep, and the usual excuses, but I've decided to stop making excuses and to make my health a priority again.

Current: Weight: 185lb

Squat: 125x5

Overhead Press: 65x3

Bench: 85x5

Waist (@belly button): 34.5""

Thigh: 27""

Hips: 44""

Goal weight: 165 lb"
1o32fo,6,2013-10-09,Confession,snowboardshorts,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1o32fo/confession/,"I'm never really happy.I have struggled with depression for years. As a kid I dealt with a lot of abuse from my family. My mom would pick on me and tell me my friends didn't really like me or want to see me because I was weird and hyperactive, she would get involved in everything I did. She made me lose my best friend because she told me my best friends mom called and said I couldn't come over anymore. She told me that I was getting stupider because I wasn't doing well in school, and maybe we should go back and have them re test me for intelligence because if I was so fucking smart why was I failing my assignments. I remember when I quit ballet she got super upset and threw my favorite tapes out the window of the car. Stuff like this happened often. My Dad was gone from home a lot and has always had a short temper. When he came home it was late at night and there would be more fights. He would take the dishes out of the dishwasher and break all of them and yell, my mom would yell. My dad would hit me and threaten to break my neck and tell me how easy it would be for him to do that, just break all my bones, or kill us all and burn the house down. He would hold his hands over my mouth to stop me from crying until I blacked out from lack of air. I couldn't breath through my nose because of the snot from crying. I got dumped in the shower naked and they would dump ice on my and cold water. 

They made me feel responsible for their debt, marriage problems, problems at work, and for going to the therapists I didn't want to go to. It was always about the most stupid little things, like not having dinner ready when he got home. They blamed me for their fights, I was their first kid.  We would get into fights and I would just cry and cry because some part of me thought that if I kept crying someone would help me. I was medicated from an early age at first for hyperactivity, then for bipolar disorder, then for depression. No matter what I did something was always wrong with me. If I was doing poorly in school it was because I had ADD not because I was too burnt out to care. If I fought with my brother it was because I was manipulating my family somehow, trying to be the center of attention, not because that's what siblings do. I was forbidden from talking to my siblings. I was often told that no one would ever love me, or want to hire me for a job because my grades were poor and because my mental health record would follow me into adulthood. These things were said to me at age ten.

 My parents would go to a doctor, and tell them all this stuff that never happened, making it look like I started the fights and blaming me for all the problems. No one ever listened to my side, and I was drugged without my consent. I remember having the pills shoved down my throat. I hated it. The pills took away my power to think or feel. I just existed and it was maddening. I would fall asleep all the time against my will because they made me so fucking tired. I had to stand up in class to keep from falling asleep and sometimes that happened to me anyways. When a doctor would not give me the drugs my parents would pay to go find a new doctor who would. They would provoke me into yelling at them and record it and use it as proof to the new doctor. I fantasized about killing my family, and the only reason I never did was because I didn't want to go to jail for the rest of my life or be locked in an insane asylum. I never had any friends or anyone over because my parents wouldn't let me. I almost never got to go to other people's houses. 

I ritually hit the wall until my knuckles bled and I liked to feel the pain because I could feel nothing else. I thought no one would ever love me, it was like a fairy tale to me. I told myself even though I was ugly and horrible eventually someone would love me. Like Cinderella.  I would stand in the bathroom late at night and stare at the mirror imagining I could be a better person who someone would love. I became bulimic and started making myself throw up because I wanted the pills out of me, and because I hated my body and how fat I was.

 Every time the psychiatrists said I was getting better and took me off my meds my parents would provoke me into another fight and use it as an excuse to prescribe something else. I believed I was fucked up until I tried an experiment. I stopped taking all my meds and didn't tell them. I went through the same cycle where according to my parents I would get ""better"" until I was taken off the imaginary drugs. Then the cycle would start all over again, even though I was not taking anything. Slowly, things became less horrible. As I got older the physical abuse mostly stopped, but the mental abuse was constant. The guilt over being who I was, over making them spend money on me. I quit everything I ever loved doing because I was constantly told I'd never be good enough at it for it to matter. Swimming, volleyball, running, basketball, rugby.

 I dove in to books and they were my only friends, and even my books got taken away. I would hide them like contraband in between the sheets and outside in places where I could find them. Books are the only reason I didn't kill myself. I felt like at least through the words on the page, I could touch the mind of another human being and that mental closeness was better than being alone. I went off to college and did great the first year. The next year I had a total break down.

 I was too depressed to get out of bed, and my anxiety made me feel so sick I threw up. I failed my classes and didnt tell anyone. Not even my boyfriend at the time. I asked if he would still love me if I was failing my classes and stuff and he said if that was the case it would just mean I didn't care enough about us to try. I could never get up the nerve to tell him what I was going though after that. I loved him, and he left me because essentially I couldn't be honest with him. He never said that was why, but its a big part of what the problems were in our relationship. He left me over email after two years. He has not spoken to me since and its been three months. 

What started out as something good between us devolved into an abusive relationship for both sides. I could not let him go because he was the only person I thought could love me, and he couldn't share his feelings or emotions. Towards the end I was ending up with bruises every week and a couple broken bones but I don't even care because I cared about him more than my self or my body. Even though he left like he did I don't hate him. I just feel nothing except for sometimes when I'm having ice cream, or looking out the window and I remember being happy with him and it hurts so I kill the feeling because I don't want to remember anymore because what I had with him was never what I really wanted it to be, he was just someone to love, who made me feel less alone. But he never loved me back as much as I did him. He never would have made the sacrifices I did for him. He made me move out of my dorm room by myself with a broken wrist because he was mad at me, for example. His own life and self were more important to him than me.

 I wanted to die so badly I would sit and look at the lethal dose of medicine I laid out for myself. I calculated exactly how much i would need to kill me. I reached a breaking point where I realized I could either end it all or keep trying. I tried to go to a counselor at the school, but she never helped. She just sat there and felt sorry for me, and when i asked her what I could do to fix my life she told me that was up to me, I eventually just stopped seeing her and laid in bed. I slept a lot to get away from the world. I sometimes wondered if I really existed or if I wasn't real because no one seemed to be able to see me and no one really talked to me. I finished up the school year failing my classes. I went back to my internship, and worked there for part of the summer, living a lie. I only left because if I hadn't they would have got my transcripts and realized I was failing and fired me, even though I was good at my job. 

I decided to just tell my parents I was failing, expecting rejection. I was going to join the military and somehow pay off my debts. They didn't reject me and told me I should come live with them so I did, because I didn't know what else to do. 20,000 is a lot of money. As soon as I got home the abuse cycle started up again. They would say they wanted me to get better, then they would tear me down. Telling me everyone knows I am a failure, I had a bird in my hands and I crushed it, now no one will want to risk hiring me, I'm an embarrassment, they always knew I would fail college, they are going to kick me out on the streets, I'm too full of myself, I should have more humility, they never had problems when I was gone, that I'm a manipulative person and am lying about the depression. 

I still want to die but lie and say I don't. I don't know how to fix me. I don't know if I should move out because with my part time job I would barely make enough to cover a rent here. I asked to go full time but they wont hire me because they would need to pay me benefits, which is really unfair because I already work five days a week and am just under the hours that would qualify as full time. I have told bits and pieces of this to people, but never the whole story. I act happy, and laugh and pretend I never worry, but in reality I have this huge burden that weighs down my life and makes me feel trapped and alone. I feel like no one really knows me, but if they did they would hate me."

The thought of being rude or cold to someone without provocation makes me shudder.  Generally, it takes a LOT for me to be annoyed by someone-- they have to really be trying hard, haha. I love people!

That said...

Every once in a while I will come to just find someone completely repellent.  That's the case right now with a coworker.

I'm in my late 20s, she's in her early 20s.  We rarely have to work on projects together, but when we do it's fine.  She's not the best at her job, but she tries. 

She's well meaning, and most of the time very nice.  (She easily becomes impatient with our interns, which really irks me, because she is someone who requires a LOT of instruction herself.)  

She's very awkward.  She doesn't know when to end conversations properly, often just trails off.  She mumbles constantly and I often have to ask her to repeat herself.  She talks to herself a lot when stressed.  She also will start trailing off awkwardly in the middle of a conversation sometimes, and when someone else will start to speak, she interrupts them loudly to finish her thought (when the person had obviously thought she was done speaking).

I hate myself for being so irritated with her awkwardness, because *I used to be awkward too!*  Middle school was so tough for me until I ""found myself"" (I know, groan, lol) in high school.  So USUALLY I have a huge soft spot for awkward people.  But not her.

She doesn't know much about the world around her, and doesn't really care to (I think she believes everything she needs to know comes from her church).  Now, my problem from her does not stem mainly from this.  True, she's very conservative politically, due to her strong Christian religious beliefs.  I'm a progressive atheist.  But I have more than a few friendships with people with similar belief systems to her, and it's never presented a problem and never made me think less of them.  It's just a bit different with her, I guess.  I usually am not at all quick to judge someone based on their religion or political stance.

Our desks are right next to each other.  EVERY TIME she returns to her desk from being somewhere she says, ""Hi. What's up?  How are you?""  Every single time.  It drives me nuts.  EVERY TIME I eat lunch she says, ""Ohhh that smells good. I'm so jealous.""  She doesn't eat lunch herself, and you guys, it takes everything in me not to say, ""YOU COULD HAVE LUNCH TOO!""

I could go on some more, but those are the first things that come to mind when I'm trying to describe what annoys me about her.

So my question is...

Do any of you find yourself becoming this annoyed with a nice person?  What do you think my anger toward her is stemming from?  Any tips on how I can quiet my brain when it's yelling at her?

Thanks, all :)

I'm a third year student , first year in Software Engineering (I know, pretty expensive to change majors but I'm happy.)

I just want to ask you guys how I could save up money in general.

I know there's a FAQ but I'm more specifically asking...

What kind of investments and things can I do to maximize the money I will have saved by the time I leave school to get a career?

I want to have enough money to be able to get settled in right away and live in a nice place in a nice neighborhood off the bat (Girlfriend and I are deaf so we want safe neighborhood because we can't hear anyone break in.)

I also have three kittens, and we've been very careful not to get them in situation where they get sick or anything and we ration their food.

I have a good idea of how to spend money on food and I cook pretty well so I can be frugal with food but what about everything else?

Girlfriend and I plan on getting internships every summer to get money and job experience.

So what can I do to maximize my savings now and maximize how much money I will have when I leave college?

P.S. My school is paid for, but I do have a bit of loans to pay off.

[22 F] confused after recent breakup with [22 M] of almost 5 years [LDR],sockembopem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o1oc0/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here_22_f_confused/,"Sorry this is going to be very long but I feel it is necessary... 


**TLDR** Had a happy and satisfying LDR for 5 years when out of nowhere he tells me that something is missing....


Five years ago (2008) ""M"" and I began talking through an online video game that we both played. We were both 17 at the time and seniors in HS. After continuously talking and calling one another we agreed to start a relationship even though we were thousands of miles apart (TX - VA). As our relationship progressed we would constantly call, text, chat, and webcam each other every day. We spent the next 4 years of college talking to one another every day. We would webcam and chat daily, watch movies together, play games, and basically anything else we could think of that involved spending time together while on a computer (LDR, remember?). We tried to visit each other as often as we could but it would mostly be during big breaks or holidays.




**Senior Year**
During this year M became busier in school and we didn't get to see each other as much as in the past. He started an internship over the breaks so we weren't able to visit over the holidays. I know at times I was sad because I felt like he wasn't giving me enough attention and I would start talking to other guy friends from back home to fill that void. I never stepped out of line with any of them but I knew that I wasn't entirely happy with how the relationship was going. When I eventually brought it up to M he said he couldn't always talk to me like before and that he was sorry but school was very demanding at the time. I remember telling him that since we are a LDR communication is very important and vital to our relationship. He was understanding but also felt I wasn't being realistic. I eventually became more accepting of us not talking all the time but even still at times felt neglected. Looking back now I know I shouldn't have been as needy but I guess that was one of my downfalls in this relationship.



M began to vocalize how tiring commuting back and forth was becoming. I began to visit him more whereas before it had been pretty even. I brought it up and he just said how it was tiring and he wasn't sure if he could keep visiting every month. At one point during this time he mentioned the idea of us taking a break but we talked it out and decided not to. When we did visit things were still normal and we always had a great time together and never had huge arguments. Sex was also never a problem with us, we always were excited to do stuff when we met up again. 





**This Past Summer**
Now that I was back home in Tx I asked when he would be able to visit me since he hadn't been to Tx in a good 1.5 years. He just started working at his new job and said he wasn't sure because he couldn't take off. I was understanding even though I was pretty sad about it but I knew that this was the reality of us now starting to work. Since graduation we weren't really getting on webcam anymore with each other because when he would get home he would want to do other things to spend his time before he went to bed early. At first I wasn't really understanding but eventually I found a job and became more accepting/understanding since I was the same way. We would still text every day, less frequently but constantly after work. We did make sure to watch some shows and videos together on the weekends whenever we weren't busy which was nice and I know we both enjoyed that. 



In terms of his future, he has no plans on going back to school but wants to work his way into a long desired career path. For me, I have been considering going to grad school and was hoping to apply to graduate programs. During my time looking into programs I started thinking about applying to ones in VA. I didn't really mention it to him because I wasn't sure if I really wanted to go back to school but I continued to do my research into the various programs. I ended up finding a program that sounded like a good fit for me and that was a few hours away from where he lived. 




Eventually, I made plans to go see him last month (Sept) for his sister's wedding. During my stay I planned on asking him how he felt about me applying there. The week I was there for the wedding was very normal. He did work during the day but when he came home he was very loving and sweet and caring like always. I was on my period so we didn't have sex but we did fool around at night. During the weekend I spent time with his siblings whom I have become really close to over the past 5 years. We all enjoyed sitting around playing drinking games and talking with eacother. M always made sure to ask how I was doing, if I needed anything, and would show me affection by kissing me or holding my hand, etc. 



**The Dreaded Talk***
I asked what he thought of me applying to schools in his area; he was quiet and said he didn't think that was the best idea. I asked him why and he went on to say how he wasn't sure if things would work out. He kept going on about how he knew I was very family oriented (come from a huge and close immediate and extended family) and that he didn't want to be the one to force me to give them up to be with him. I told him that it was ultimately my decision to move and that his family would be able to give me everything I needed. He said he would feel like an asshole for forcing me to do that and how eventually in the future the type of work he wants to do would require him to travel. I told him I loved to travel and that I would be okay with that but then he said he would probably have to go alone and that he wasn't sure if I would be able to handle living by myself, go without communicating with him, and again without the support of my family. I told him that we have done long distance for so long that I think I would be able to be okay with that and again how his family would always be there for me for support, communication, love, etc. I told him that me going to school there was just an idea and that I still wanted to apply to schools in my area. Eventually he went on to say how he just wasn't sure if our relationship was right and that he feels we are just growing apart. I told him that I could see how he might think that but that isn't what I wanted and that we didn't need to make any decisions right there and then. We agreed to continue our relationship but after I left I felt like he was already dumping me.



The next few days were brutal because we didn't text much at all during the day and when we did it was very brief. I was already feeling empty so I decided that I would go ahead and talk with him. When we talked he said that it doesn't feel right to continue our relationship and that he feels like it's not going to work out in the long run and that it would be best if we just ended it now. He repeatedly said how he just felt like something wasn't right/was missing and it wasn't fair to either of us to continue. He went on to say that he thought it was best if we distanced ourselves because he knows how attached we are and that eventually we start seeing other people. He said the more he thought about it the more it just felt like the right thing to do. 




**Closure**
A week later I texted him asking if we could talk because I wanted some closure. I was confused by everything he told me and felt like he wasn't being completely honest with me. We talked for an hour on webcam and he tried to explain it as best as he could to me but I am still pretty confused. 



During our talk he started off by saying how the relationship was wearing on him and how he also didn't want to have me make the decision to move. He said it was a culmination of how he feels about everything and that he just feels like the best thing for both of us is to move in different directions. He wasn't sure if he had the emotional feeling to keep the relationship going and wasn't sure if he feels ready or ever felt ready to move past that. He said he always thought it would be more clear but that it hasn't and he isn't sure if it ever will and it's not fair to me or himself to keep it going. I told him I felt like he was using the distance and his future as an excuse to not say he doesn't want me anymore. In reply he said he gets along with me and that we are great friends but in terms of the relationship sense he just felt like it was wearing on him. He said he felt like making it work was going to be more of a struggle and that he doesn't feel up to that. He said he doesn't see it working and he doesn't want to keep investing in it when it's not going to work. I told him that saying distance is one thing and saying he's not emotionally invested is something completely different. In response he said he didn't view it that way but it was more an accumulation of things. He said it was hard for him to admit that since we are great friends and get along so well. He also said he respects and admires me and wishes he had specific reasons but he doesn't. I told him how I thought a lot of it was because everything going on right now with him starting his new career and he said it was probably part of it but the reason was that again, he isn't emotionally invested in continuing. He also mentioned that he felt a relief to let things end and i told him how that was understandable because of how draining a 5 year LDR can be. 



After this he went on to say how we are both eachothers' first real relationship and that he wants to see what else is out there and see other people. He wants that flexibility at this point and having that feels like there's a relief to it and that is more of what he wants to do right now. I told him that there obviously isn't going to be someone else like me and that though another girl may have similar traits it won't be the same. He said he understands that and he's been happy every moment he's ever been with me and that i've shown him so much and he just feels like we both need to see what is out there and meet new people and grow in more ways. He also said he didn't feel complete or like if it's absolutely everything he's ever wanted. He feels like he needs to move on to see if he can ever feel like that. I told him i understood but that of course it will feel like we are outgrowing each other when we aren't close enough to have other experiences. He replied by saying even if we worked it out he feels like he's just letting it happen and that he's not making the decision he really wants to. After talking with family he said that if he isn't feeling like his heart is truly in it now it never will be and that he is trying to be fair to both of us. His feelings have been building up for a little bit and to him this felt like a better time than any to lay it all out. Again he kept saying he wasn't sure what it is and how he has been choking up when talking with other people because he can't explain what it is because he doesn't know. So I asked him why is he willing to let it go so easily if he doesn't even know and he replied by saying he just knows that it's there and in the back of his mind he never felt like it was quite what he wanted and that he doesn't know what it is but that's just how he feels. He said he wants me to still be in his life and talk but that it's unfair to continue the relationship when he's not reciprocating what i'm feeling and that he really doesn't want to hurt me over a long stretch of period of time and that it scares the hell out of him. 



I asked him if there was anyone else and he said there was absolutely nobody else, not even on the radar and that he knows that when he was with me he loved me and he still has feelings for me but after talking with his new brother in law something he told him resonated with him (the guy was in a LTR and just felt like something was missing and then when he met his wife he said it was a completely different feeling). He said it's not that he doesn't love me but that it's one of those questions of where do you see yourself in 5 years and he just doesn't and he didn't feel like it was fair and that when you meet more people you learn what it is and it's hard to have just one experience and know everything.  



He ended the conversation by saying he's not seeing anyone and is honestly trying to figure himself out and trying to make a push to better himself and that's just really what he is trying to do right now. 



**My Thoughts**
All of that said, I know he obviously has fallen out of love with me but I feel like he isn't realizing that what we have is special. We have been together so long and gone through so much growth together to where it might feel to him like he no longer loves me but I feel like this is a temporary bump. I am also upset because throughout the entire relationship he has been the one who has always been so great about communicating and he would always try to get me to communicate more and yet he never once told me that this was how he was feeling. To me this all came out of nowhere and I wish he gave me a heads up to where we could've tried to address the issue and maybe I wouldn't be taking it as hard as I am now. 



It's so hard for me to accept that it's over because I could really picture myself being with M for the rest of my life. I could vividly see myself being with him and having kids with him and being happy for the rest of my life. We have always been so compatible on so many levels and never had any major arguments other than dealing with the distance and my neediness. I just don't know how to go about handling the break up. It is too hard to accept that the person I want to be with for the rest of my life does not feel the same way. And yet he still wants to be friends and have me as a part of his life... Does that mean he never really loved me or is it more of a bad timing/him not knowing what he wants and us being too young type of thing? I just wish he was honest with me and told me when he started feeling all of this. I also wanted to just hear that he doesn't love me anymore but he never flat out said it. I have been struggling to not contact him but I miss my best friend and I don't know how else to deal with the situation. I love him enough to let him go but it just makes me so sad knowing that he most likely will never make his way back to me.


I know I need to move on and I am trying but I can't help but feeling like he's making a huge mistake that is going to end up as regrets for the both of us. If he still loves me then why isn't he willing to fight for me? :["

Warning, wall of text ahead!",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1o1ihi/its_been_downhill_ever_since_we_met_in_person/,"I'm not sure if he's feeling the same, but because of the way he acts, I think he may be.

I'm gonna give you guys our story so this will be less disorganized, and hope he doesn't see this, because I don't want him to know my feelings until I can tell him them. 

We met online, on a depression chatroom. He was trolling, but he was also depressed, I was legitimately depressed and went there to be less lonely. I met him maybe after a couple days of visiting the chatroom? We met September 26th of 2012.

I, honestly, lied to him from the beginning. I lied to him about my age, my name, and some small details. I told him about my name in October. I didn't think my age would be a good time to tell him, as I was younger than him. (I'll refrain from telling how much) He started college sometime around January, going into culinary school to be a chef. Around sometime in May, my parents offered to let him fly here. My parents didn't know his age and they didn't know I'd lied to him, so I refused to accept their request. It was very depressing, I'd fallen in love with him but was afraid to tell him the truth. So then, come July, his mother offered to pay his plane ticket for him to fly here. He, of course, said yes.. which I was unaware of, and I told him I thought we should wait, and it cause a huuuuge mess... then, she bought the ticket, and he told me about it. That's when I realized I had to tell him. I told my mom everything, she was a bit upset but she got over it.  I was dumb enough to wait until he bought the ticket. I told him my age.

He, understandably, flipped the fuck out. I thought he was gonna kill himself. I convinced him that we could make this work because we loved each other, that age was just a number, and everything would be fine as long as we didn't do anything sexual. So, after about two days, he was a lot better. He said I was right and that we could make it work and that he'd do anything to be with me, because he knew that we were made for each other.

He flew here July 26th, on our 10 month anniversary. It was amazing.. amazing. We'd waited 10 months for this and it was so worth it, but I got far too comfortable and got so used to him being around. I was very emotional, little did I know I was actually PMSing so it made me be a pretty big bitch. I was annoying, I'm sure, as I couldn't keep my hands off him. I don't mean sexually, I just mean in general. I loved just having him within reach. Once, we (me, him, and my parents) went on a road trip to a town a few hours away. We stayed in a hotel and were once gonna play Monopoly with my mom. I refused, got pissed, went into the bathroom and cried. He made me open the door and we hugged it out and I apologized. A few days before he left, we laid in his bed, just crying. I helped him back the night before it was time to go. We slept on each other in the car ride to the airport. I didn't even realize what was going on, saying goodbye felt so odd and I didn't quite realize he was actually leaving until I couldn't see him anymore, that's when it hit me and I cried like a baby in the middle of the airport terminal. He left August 9th.

We both got pretty upset, but were still in the phase where it was like, ""Wow, I'm really sad but that was really amazing and I love you a lot."" Eventually, the happiness wore off. We fought quite a bit a few weeks after he left. By ""quite a bit"", I mean we fought sometimes every other 2-3 days.. and it was over stupid stuff. It's changed a bit, we haven't argued as much but we have argued. I blame me.

I've been feeling like we don't talk as much, like we don't tell each other as much as we used to. I feel really distant from him, and I miss him a lot, which is making me (and him) really depressed.

That's when his internship got really close. He realized he could come here for it, because he wanted to own a restaurant with a wooden smoker and smoke meat and butcher and etc.

We thought he'd be able to come stay with me for his internship but his college denied his request. It really devastated us. Everything would have worked out amazingly if he could have come. He could have stayed with me, he'd go to ""work"" (his internship would have been a paid one if he came here), I'd study while he's at work, he'd come back and we could do whatever we wanted. After he finished his internship, he'd go back to graduate. I'd soon be finished with my schooling and then could do whatever I wanted. He'd be finished with college. We could get married really soon, which we plan on.

His college took fooooreevvveerrr to get back to him on it. I had higher hopes than I should have, just because it would have been so perfect. So they said no, the budget was too low, because they had to come check on him several times to see if everything was good.
 
Lately, it's been getting harder to wait. I miss him a lot, and it hurts like hell. He's been really busy, finishing up what little bit of college he has left before his internship and whatnot. He said he'd try to visit for Christmas, which will be great because my birthday is December 21st, so he can come around that time, maybe. But I just don't wanna wait anymore. I've been feeling so lonely, he's been going to sleep sooner, he's been really busy and tired. I'm not upset with him, I understand completely. I just miss him. 

And I just wanted to get this out because tonight has been really hard."

I have been separated from my wife for almost a year now. O recently started a job after finishing school last spring. I had been unemployed since fall of 2011. The issue of child support quickly came up. I have been trying to set something up quickly because the communication from the social services office was mailed to the wrong address, now a court date is pending. 

I own three cars right now, all three are dead. I recently took one to a good friends shop to get fixed. A couple weeks after that is when the their car died leaving without a vehicle. The car that is in the shop is still several paychecks away from being fixed and forced me to offer my wife less in child support temporarily until I get my car fixed. This did not sit well with her. She then started bringing up all kinds of shit.

We separated because she cheated on me. After months of staying in the same house, but not rooms, she asked me to leave. I obliged and moved in with my parents as I had no money and no job. I was only able to see my daughter once a week due to school and schedules. I never complained because I didn't want issues between my wife and I.

I landed a NASA summer internship and an awesome job with a local company a and started a little more than a month ago. I was now able to see my daughter more. I have spent the last month trying to rebuild my life. Moved in with a friend, buying all the things I left behind, paying debt from being unemployed. Now I have to fix my car fast. I make more than twice my best paying job ever but still live paycheck to paycheck because of ask the expenses of restarting my life.

My wife doesn't seem to understand how much I have sacrificed and how much I want to take care of my daughter. I feel like she is using child support as an excuse to live a better life.

A few things that I left out along the way. My wife is sharing our house with the person she cheated on me with. I asked for nothing other than my cars and to store some of my stuff as I had nowhere to take it. My first offer of child support was approximately the same amount I contributed when I was unemployed, not much but it would have kept her from struggling while I fixed my car.

I'm sure I left something out, but I'm tired and frustrated."

I'm curious how other INFPs have handled stuff like interviews, applying for positions, etc.

I've already applied for some companies and had a few interviews, and I think the biggest thing that sticks out to me is how fake everything feels, and the fact that I'm not really that great at telling someone about myself. I have a good knowledge of the subject, I've learned a lot about it just on my own time before entering the program, but I always find talking about it directly and trying to make myself sound good to be hard. I tend to be fairly modest about my knowledge, I hate sounding like I'm better then someone, but that doesn't really work well when interviewers ask me to start spouting off stuff about why they should hire me. I really just makes me feel uneasy. I'm fine talking about stuff I know or demonstrating my knowledge, but just trying to tell someone *why* they should hire me is extremely hard for me, even if I feel like I'm a good person for the job. Every-time I come-up with an answer, it just doesn't really feel like *my* answer, just some scripted, obvious answer that anybody could come-up with and is just what I think the interviewer probably wants to hear.

I'm curious to hear, if any of you are willing, your experiences in this area, and any recommendations you may have of how you managed it all."

Okay, just spilled my heart out here. Pretty long but could really use some help.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iv351/i20m_just_broke_up_with_my_gf_20f_after_8_months/) is the original post after the breakup. 

---

I broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months in July. Things were okay the last month of summer. Not to say she wasn't on my mind, because she was, it was just that I was extremely busy and didn't have a lot of time to commit to thinking about my choice. When my internship ended for the summer, and college was only a week away, I started to think more and more about her. We really had no contact between the breakup and the first night back at school.

---
Back to college:

We share the same friend group so it was inevitable that we would be around her. My heart was literally racing with anticipation for the moment she came into my apartment (the whole friend group was at my appt). We were all ""pregaming"" in my apartment and within 20 minutes of her being over, we ended up in my room talking, and me telling her that I thought I made a mistake. This was Aug. 23rd, and within a week we decided we would be 'exclusive' and try to figure this situation out. We were hanging out, talking, and acting very closely to how we had when we were together. We didn't have sex or anything during this time, and there was minimal amounts of kissing. Then things started to get a little weird. on Sep. 8th, I had really started to get bothered by how she was acting. The night before I was to meet her at a party. When I was on my way, I ran into my friends who told me the party was not letting anybody else in. I texted her and told her I couldn't get in. No Response. I texted her a few more times and still no response. I went to a bar in the area (yes I know i'm not 21 i don't need a lecture on this.) and one of my friends (who was throwing the party) was there as well. He told me ex-girlfriend was hooking up with a guy at the party. I went to HS with this kid and honestly he's not very credible so I didn't believe him at first. So on my walk home from the bar, in my drunkenness, I texted her questioning her about what my friend had said. I didn't get a text till the next morning...

---

She responded pretty early and apologized profusely and told me she gave her friend her phone and slept at the same friends apartment (a girl). So we both went out again the next night separately, and at about 12:30 i told her i wanted to talk. I went to her apartment and long story short she told me she doesn't want to get back together and that I hurt her too much from the initial breakup, yet she still loves me. So now that I was annoyed with this out of the blue (ironic if you read the last post) choice, i once again pressed the question of whether she hooked up with anyone while we were back at school and 'exclusive/trying to figure things out'. she simply kept replying ""that's not important"" or ""i don't want to talk about it"". Finally, over a week or so, i found out she did hook up with someone, and it was the night I was supposed to meet her at the party.

---

Now I am in a weird spot. She doesn't want to lose me as a friend, but she doesn't want to be together. So since all of this has happened, it has been a month of me going back and forth on what to do. First I told myself we could no longer be friends. Then the feelings persisted and I just wanted to see her. It went back and forth between be friends / cut her off probably 5 times. The one thing that has been consistent in my mind is the fact that I know I am in love with her. There is no doubt in my mind that I want to be with her, even after what happened, because I know what kind of person she is. She was really drunk the night she hooked up with the guy (and trust me, I know that is not an excuse and I still cringe over the idea of it even happening), and we were in a really weird place. The time spent over the summer without her and then seeing her back at school removed all of the doubts I was having leading up to the break up.

---

Current time:

She has an 18 credit semester, works 10 hours a week, and is trying to be more involved in her sorority. I understand that she feels like she is scared to get hurt and scared to try again, but when we were together, we were really perfect for each other. I honestly don't think we ever fought during our eight months. She tells me she may want to try down the line, but I can't just wait around for that it will destroy me. 

Also some important notes:

* when I say she wants to be friends, she want things like snuggling, watching movies, rubbing her back, etc; aka relationship things, not friendship things. 

* Her best friend hates me and was the one who helped her when I broke things off, so undoubtable told her she can never take me back

* Her mom loves me and pushed her to try and fix things.


**So reddit, I want her back. How do I get her to take this risk on me? I really love her, and though nobody can 100% say they will never hurt someone again, I feel so strongly that I will not. I really do feel like this is the girl I see myself spending the rest of my life with.**



**tl;dr**: Broke up with her because of doubts. Two months apart, want her back, doubts are gone. She is scared to try again."

I'm coming up on three months at my new job and I'm almost to my breaking point. Reddit, I work hard. My job is my life and has always been a source of pride for me. I interview well, have been told that I seem extremely put together, and come across very confident. Work feels like the one area I succeed in, but at the same time, I'm extremely paranoid about losing my job, and it's become crippling these past few days.


Background: Immediately after graduating, I took a 3-month (full-time, paid) internship with the potential to turn into a concrete job. A close friend of mine worked at the company, and had originally started as an intern before getting hired on. 3-months came, and I was signed on for another 3-months. After 6 months, they made me an offer, and I accepted.


Things took off and after a few people were laid off, I ended up picking up the slack of a coworker who was let go. I was essentially working two jobs and stressed out all the time. I repeatedly talked to my boss and HR to tell them that the workload was undo-able, only to be told by my boss that she was happy to ""help me prioritize"". Then, if I didn't complete a task, she would say I needed to figure out how to get everything done. There's only so much time in a day, and I found myself working constantly- 13-14 hour days became my norm.


In the last 6 weeks I was there, I started feeling extremely paranoid about getting fired. I'd surpassed my quarterly goals though, and tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety talking, that I'd be fine. The day before it happened, I could sense it. Sure enough.. I was laid off the next morning.


Again, I was super fortunate and got another job a month later. 6-month assignment, with the hope that budget would be approved and they would bring me on full-time. Six months came and went, I was signed on for another 30-days, then another, then another. Nine months total before I was told that there simply wasn't budget for my position. Technically, my contract ended. No harm, no foul. My boss gave me a great recommendation, and I got another position almost immediately.


Now, I'm coming up on 3 months at my new job, and while my at-will employment has no contract end-date, it does state that the first 3-months is a probationary period and can be terminated at that point. Again, I've been working extremely hard (and long hours- 15 hour days). Even though I've only been here a short time, I'm leading a number of large projects, and for the most part succeeding (minus a few beginner errors that come from learning new process). However, a new woman just stepped into the management role for my team just 2 weeks ago, and she makes me extremely nervous. I feel incompetent around her, and I'm sure she can smell it.   

I can't go on feeling this anxious wondering if/when I'm going to get fired, and I have no idea what to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advise would be great.

I'm waiting for my intership to start in two weeks, then I have some exams and final paper left. Those are easy, but I'm scared, paralyzed. I don't know what i'm afraid of though.

I've been in this situation before, several times. I don't want to be on a sick leave again and mess everything up. I called my doctor, but she cannot call me back til next week, my other worker is on a holiday. But they cannot solve my problems, I know, they give me more meds. I'm on voxra now.

This happens almost every autumn, it gets better during spring. But I cannot wait til spring. I want to get better and finish my studies. But however I think this through, I just cannot understand how to do it. I know it only takes to read some books and do the paper but in my mind it is a huge task, even the smallest ones are too big things to do.

1o4jhq,6,2013-10-10,"My [25f] BF [24m] of 3 years isn't willing to move with me, and I don't know what to do..",sillylittlegirl8,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o4jhq/my_25f_bf_24m_of_3_years_isnt_willing_to_move/,"First post, forgive any errors, please.

My bf and I met when I started university away from where I was from. Since day 1 I told him that I would likely not stay in his area after graduation because there wasn't anything else for me there, graduate school or career wise. We talked about what we would do when the time came, but at the beginning of the relationship I still had 2 years left, so that felt really far away. At that time he said he could see him self moving with me, as long as it was within a reasonable distance from his family. Which is totally understandable, I don't like being too far from my family either.


I graduated after dating for most of the 2 years I was in his city and then moved back to my home city, only three hours away, so I could save some money while working and studying for the LSAT to get into law school. I got into my top pick school, which just happens to be in my home city, still leaving us three hours away from each other.


Through out the ~1 year that we've been living a few hours apart, we actively talked about what we would do when I figured out where I would be going to school and he told me that if I got into my top choice he would move in with me in my city. I found out I got accepted early December and he agreed that he would start looking for a job down here.


In the past year he's had a couple family issues. His older brother is kind of a dead beat. The brother, his wife, and his 1yo all live at home because his brother makes less-than-stellar business/life decisions and has poorly invested and therefore lost everything he had. My bf gives him a little money each paycheck to help with little things, but his brother relies a lot on this money. (imo, they're enabling his brother, but this an entire other conversation) His dad had a minor heart attack and he wasn't comfortable leaving his family at that time, so he put the job search on hiatus for a bit around then, but now his dad is well again. Then his parent's talked about separating which freaked him out for a but, but they've since worked it out. And on top of that my bf only has a high school diploma making finding a decent job very hard in the field he's currently employed in.


He’s since resumed his job search, but I don’t think he realizes that he’s not going to be able to go out of market and get his current pay. He says he wants to make sure he can contribute and pay for things, and I appreciate that; he wants to take care of me and I couldn’t ask for anything better. But I think he’s being unrealistic. I suggested maybe he could take a part time job down here and maybe work on getting some certifications or whatever else he needs that would make him a better prospect to employers. I’m not hurting for money, so I don’t need him to work full time so he can pay for everything. Just working so he can help with food, and have a little extra for his own hobbies would be fine for me.


I've just started law school. Everyone always warns you it's going to be intense, you're going to be busy, and you're not going to have enough time for everyone the way you used to. A couple months in now and I can see what they mean. I do not always have time to talk to my bf on the phone every night, which means I definitely don't have time to make spontaneous trips up to see him like I was able to before school started. We talked about how him living here with me would enable us to see each other and interact better because it could be something as little as going to the grocery store together to spend our time. The little things that can’t happen because he’s not here are the things I need the most right now, I feel.


It's not to say we don't make time for each other, we do. I just don't think this type of relationship, the way it is now, will work for me for too much longer. I honestly feel like I can’t sit and wait around forever. There is so much going on in my life. I’m meeting new people, networking, studying and reading for more hours that I thought possible. I’m involved in a couple organizations through my law school that have time commitments, but look great on a resume when it comes time to get my summer internship. And he’s not here to experience a single thing with me. 


I personally feel like he’s afraid. He’s never travelled, he’s never been more than 6 hours away from home, and the one time we did go away that far it turned out a family member was going to the same place, so we stopped and saw them. I don’t think he can leave his family. And the thing is, I can’t fault him for that. My family raised me to be more independent, but I don’t see anything wrong with being connected to your family. But does this mean were just not compatible? Am I being selfish needing him to move? Is he being hesitant for a reason I just don’t see? I’m at a loss as to what to do..

As a serious Hi-Rez game fan having played since Global Agenda launched, there is no doubt that this is the best game to come from your studio.

I played Tribes more heavily than any other Hi-Rez game and like many others, was sad to see Tribes become dropped. However now that I see what Smite has become, I no longer hold that grudge. 

Anyways, I just wanted to say thank you and pass compliments to the dev team.

1o99de,2,2013-10-11,Just got offer from my #1 choice firm... But not for summer. Listen to my problem...,Gradius87,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1o99de/just_got_offer_from_my_1_choice_firm_but_not_for/,"So here's my dilemma: I'm 25, live on my own, pay for my own schooling, pay all of my own bills, and work full time making $20 an hour.

I just offered a winter internship at my #1 choice firm, however I was hoping for a summer internship. 

The reason I want summer is so that I can work part time (23 hours) at my current job to keep my benefits. If I take a winter internship I will only be able to work Sundays at my current job which means I'll lose my benefits. And also means that I will not be considers part time but instead ""limited"" part time

I will not have a full time offer (if even) until fall 2015 most likely, from this firm. That means I'll have a year of being ""limited part time"" at my job in between internship and full time. I would have to wait until a part time position opens back up at my current job in order to regain benefits but that is not a guaranteed chance.

What should I do? If I don't take the internship I may not get another chance at this point."

1o8xki,0,2013-10-11,What are the legal hurdles to changing the way graduate students are treated as employees?,codyish,legal,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1o8xki/what_are_the_legal_hurdles_to_changing_the_way/,"I've read a few articles recently about a push to change the laws in regard to unpaid internships (basically that they should be illegal, since it is illegal to not pay somebody for work, even if they agree to it.)  This got me thinking about graduate students in STEM fields that generally have their tuition waived and get payed a meager stipend since they usually do some combination of teaching and research.  The stipend is usually low and there is often attempts to justify it with the social capital and upward mobility that a graduate degree is supposed to provide.  When I do the math for my own degree the number of hours I worked for my stipend I end up significantly under minimum wage.  Even when I add in my tuition waiver I'm right around, but still below, minimum wage.  What protections are there for graduate students in this situation?  What things could be done to ensure fair compensation?  Is this an important issue? Can graduate research/teaching assistants be unionized?  What other issues are there?  Maybe I'm naive but in my experience people do the best work and are most productive when there are valued, compensated appropriately, aren't ask to work too many hours, and are allowed to have proper work/life balance.  Most graduate students/recent graduates I know are miserable, broke, stressed, and not well adjusted."

I know that PT 9+ all work with 3rd party hardware, but I can't seem to find information on whether or not the SE software falls in line with the 9, 10, 11 product lines as well. Does SE follow the version numbers and work with 3rd party hardware?

1o704f,1,2013-10-10,She (F 24) has delayed moving out to Utah with me (M 25) by 4 months amid constant fighting. Is this it for us?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o704f/she_f_24_has_delayed_moving_out_to_utah_with_me_m/,"She and I have been in a serious relationship for a year and several months before I decided that I would move to Utah for graduate school (and skiing, naturally).  When I first moved out here I was incredibly down on myself for leaving her and my friends.  I knew I made the right choice career-wise and hobby-wise to move 1800 miles away, but I was very reluctant to leave my friends and her.  She, on the other hand, was incredibly supportive- she was just going to finish her Psychology degree this Summer and move out there as soon as she could.  Despite her track record of being disorganized and not knowing what she wants to do with her life, I took her work on it and put plans in motion to move.  Then she found out she had to take classes this Fall.  No worries- we'd go long distance for a semester!  She had full intentions of moving out here in January.

We're now two month in to the LDR and this last month has been a battle.  First, we had a full fledged pregnancy scare that put us both on edge (I've been able to visit once a month), followed by her discovering that she has to retake a class next Spring to graduate.  Combine that with her not having a job right now nor money and owning a car that wouldn't be able to complete the drive without a $2000 repair and it's not looking good.  Because I love her and she's an amazing person, I've tried to accept all of this and have tried to steer her in the right direction- ""Get an internship, make some money, I'll pay for half""- but this usually results in her being furious at me because I'm never sensitive enough when we're talking about her situation.  Every time we fight about this I keep telling myself that this is a difficult situation for her too and that she will eventually figure things out.

So I think I'm approaching my limit.  I'm nearly convinced that when she's supposed to move here next May, something else will come up, just like it did this summer for Fall classes and right now for Spring classes.  I'm incredibly homesick and miss her but with the high ratio of arguments over the phone vs having a good time on facetime, its becoming more and more difficult.  I'm not sure I can last seven more months like this.  Fortunately, I've met some guys that are practically man-whores so if I stick with them, meeting women shouldn't be a problem, supposedly, but I don't really want to pursue anybody but her.  Moving back to where she lives isn't an option either because I'm in a really good situation for my career and it would be a bad move to throw all I've achieved to get to where I am today.

We were amazing in town together and I probably did this to myself by moving.  She's beautiful, has a great personality, and the most caring person I've ever met.  However, she's very immature when it comes to planning and careers and I'd hate that to be the reason we're over.  But at this point, I'm nearly too strung out to continue.  

What should I do?

TL&amp;DR:  Moved away, decided to go long distance with my amazing GF.  Things keep coming up which delay her moving with me and we keep fighting.  Where do we go from here?

At the end, I believe I will have about 12k-15k saved up. 

I've been lurking around r/investing and the other related subs recently.  I would like to set aside 1k into a trading account to experiment with, doing my own research on companies.  I have been fooling around with simulators for the past year, and I can do okay.  Is this a bad idea? 


I don't know much about investing, but I have been trying to learn by looking through these boards, reading investopedia, and all that other good stuff. 

I don't have a Roth IRA... I know its good. I should start one?

I've read a bit about mutual funds. Would that be my best bet as far as investing?

What about paying off student debts? I think I'll be in the hole about 40k by the time I graduate. I've seen some people on here saying that paying off debt is the best investment.  However, assuming I get a job in my field when I graduate, I will be making more than that in one year. 

Another quick question: What are the differences between an ETF and a mutual fund?"

I saw the post earlier today by /u/corgisaurio and I thought that you guys might be able to help me out with my situation too.

My dream has always been to get into the film industry. Originally my plan was to go into a film school right after I graduated high school but due to some personal reasons I ended up at a cheaper in-state school where I won't be able to do anything film related (aside from the once-a-week, kinda crappy film club). 

My new plan was to spend two years at this place and then transfer to a university with a good film program but lately I've been thinking that maybe it would be better for me to drop out of college and try to get film/video internships or jobs back home. I hate it here and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I feel like I'd have a better chance if I just started working now instead of waiting around taking unrelated classes. 

I've taken video classes and have made plenty of short little movies (shot for local film festivals, competitions, and even a private company once) so I'm not exactly starting from rock-bottom, and I know people who might be able to help me find work but I also know that this would be a serious gamble for my future. 

So I'd really like some advice. What would you do in a similar situation? Is it better for me to hold out in college or should I take the risk and drop out?

Thanks a bunch."

1oazt9,33,2013-10-12,How I Fucked Up 3 Film Interviews,zeltrine,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1oazt9/how_i_fucked_up_3_film_interviews/,"We've all been nervous at interviews. Some of us choke, or forget our rehearsed lines, or we say something that we regret and can't seem to get out of our minds. Well, I've had my fare share of those moments, and I'm going to share them with you now. Hopefully you can learn a thing or two from my mistakes.

1. The F Word

I had the internship in the can. I was interviewing for an assistant position at a management company. All I had to was not mess up the interview. I knew the guy who was running the company, I had worked with him a few times for seminars at USC. All I had to do was be nice and answer the questions.

The guy I knew had to run, so his partner had to interview me. He looked look maybe only a few years older than me. He started asking me questions and for some reason I felt really comfortable talking to him. He was not that much older than me, and I really wanted to connect, so I let my guard down. That's when it just left my mouth, I said the F word. Fuck.

However, it didn't register in my mind that I had ruined this interview. I thought I was doing great. It just slipped and I played it cool, like we were equals or something. Suddenly, his body language changed. He got up from behind the desk and moved closer to me. In retrospect, he actually was moving to the door because in his mind this interview was over and he just had to kick me out. However, he was so smooth that I the time I thought he was just getting close because he became more comfortable. He was still polite and kept asking me questions. It was only until later that I realized that he was mumbling and thinking of questions. He really wanted me to leave, but I was too dumb to realize it. I thought the interview was still doing well.

Then he started mentioning that he has a few other interviews, and that I'll find out by next week if I got it or not. It was time to go. I shook his hand and left. It was only until I got to the car that I realized that I had screwed up the interview. I never heard from them again.

2. Jingle Balls

The job was basically mine. As long as I didn't fuck it up, it'd be mine. It was an interview for a full time production assistant position. A few months earlier I had worked with this production company for about 12 days, so a lot of people knew me. Even though I knew I had a good chance, I was still nervous. I was in the lobby and they called me in.

We went to a meeting room and I sat on one side while the three other producers sat on the other side facing me. It was go time.

They asked me basic questions, and asked me what I wanted to do, and why I wanted to join their company. I said I wanted to learn how to be a better producer, which was true. There was a cynical producer he said ""Why are we even interviewing him? Just hire him already!"" We all laughed. The interview was coming to a close, almost home. Then suddenly, the bald producer said, ""Can you sing the Call Me Maybe song for us?"" In my mind, I was like What the fuck? Why? What for? Is this a joke? I'm sure he were just kidding around but it was such a weird request, and it was three dudes interviewing me, so I just went with the first friendly dude answer that popped into my mind: ""Sure, I can sing it, but I'll have to squeeze my balls to reach the high notes."" Everyone laughed. I thought ""I got this!""

They said, ""We'll let you know in about two weeks."" I said thanks, shook their hands and left. They didn't contact me until almost a month later, but it wasn't for the position, it was just to help out for a day or two on a spec project. However, that fell through and they never contacted me again.

In retrospect, I don't know and I still don't know if it was my stupid comment that ruined me. It was only until later that I thought of the perfect response: ""Well, I could sing it for you, but I don't want to make your ears bleed."" It was short, sweet, and unoffending. If only my brain had thought of it first.

3. Coffee 

After the Jingle Balls incident, I didn't need to work since I had saved enough money. However, after I shot my first feature film The Grotto, I was out of work for a few months and I had to get back into making money. I had worked for this other production company shooting behind the scenes footage for a new movie coming out. I shot the interviews with the director and he was a really cool British guy. After the third day of shooting with him, I asked him if he knew of any positions opened at the production company he worked for a big commercial production studio. He said ""Well, let's set up a date and we'll grab some coffee to talk about it."" I was ecstatic. I didn't think he would offer such a thing - I just thought he would recommend me to to someone else so he could get rid of me.

We finally locked down a date for a Monday, which was a week from when we set it up. However the Thursday before, the secretary emailed me and said ""Are you available today at 2pm?"" I hadn't rehearsed or prepared mentally. It was Thursday at 11am - I had only 3 hours . I said ""Yes!""

I arrived at 2pm exactly, and entered the Commercial Studio air hangar building. It was their third one, they were expanding rapidly. It was a beautiful set up with minimalist design everywhere. I waited patiently for the British director to arrive. He came out in a rush, ""Sorry mate, I don't have much time. You wan't some tea?"" I wasn't expecting that comment. He doesn't have much time? Well, what was I thinking? That he'd give me an hour for free? I probably had 20 minutes of his time, tops. I was totally not prepared.

He made some quick tea for me, and we stepped into his office. It was sparse, just a desk, a couch, and a coffee table. I sat at the edge of the couch. He slid out his chair and crossed his legs. He looked at me and said ""Okay, for the sake of time, tell me what you're looking for. Let me know what you're thinking."" Straight and to the point. This was the complete opposite of when I was shooting his interviews. He was laid back and relaxed, the epitome of chill. Work must have transform him daily with stress and anxiety.

I asked him if there were any assistant editing or production assistant positions available. ""Mmm, no, sorry mate, I don't do that kind of hiring. But listen, I want to help you, I really do! Maybe if you tell me more about yourself, I can do my best to help you.""

I went into my rehearsed diatribe of how I went to USC and created my own production company. I told him how we had shot a few films, and we recently did some shooting for ABC Television's HR department. He was surprised and confused, and asked me why I was looking for a job. I said I needed something more consistent. He said, ""It never is, you always gotta hustle. It's a constant hustle.""

I then went into how I was becoming more of a writer and how I wanted to be a screenwriter. That's what confused him even more. He said, ""I don't understand, are you looking for a job, or do you want to be a writer? If you want to write, go write! And listen, I like you, I really do, but how you came in? It's not good, you have to be more prepared. So what do you want?"" I said point blank I was looking for a job.

""A job? Okay, I'll see what I can do about that."" He quickly rolled his chair over to his laptop and started typing. ""What's your website?"" he asked. I gave it to him. He started watching our reel, but impatiently skipped through most of it. ""Good stuff, not bad."" He then started watching really old shit that I didn't want him to see. He kept skipping through it and commenting. ""Hmm, some music would have done it some good."" He kept going through our old stuff in our vimeo account and it was getting me angry, not at him, but at how disorganized our company vimeo account was. I decided to revamp the company website so it wouldn't happen again.

I really wanted to show him my favorite commercial, Dibs, but the vimeo search is horrendous. I couldn't find it. He kept selecting crappy old videos. I HAD to show him my best video. The director suggested he go get his friend because he was a screenwriter. He left the office to go get him. I was determined to show it to him. I went on my laptop but I couldn't connect to the internet. So I did the dumbest thing I could do that moment: I went over to the director's laptop while he wasn't there.

I searched and still couldn't find it. I turned around and he saw me on his laptop. ""HEY! What are you doing!? Jesus, you're definitely earning points today."" I instantly regretted my decision and felt ashamed. My ears turned hot red from embarrassment but I now had to talk to his screenwriting friend. At that point, the director clocked out of the conversation and focused on writing work emails and messaging through iChat. Talking to the screenwriting friend was a lot easier. He was definitely cool to talk to, bringing up similar movies that we both liked. I told him that I've written 3 feature films, and he said I should send them to him, and that he would respond in about a week. I was once again hopeful. No one had ever asked to read one of my scripts, maybe something good will come out of this!

The conversation turned to my age, and I said I was 26. The screenwriter turned to the director and said, ""Hey, what were you doing when you were 26?"" The director responded by saying, ""Uh, let's see, I was earning $300,000 a year, working as an assistant director to [insert famous British director]."" My balls shrank. ""So, you gotta get to it!""

The screenwriter left after giving me his email. The director then got on a phone. I still wasn't done with my tea. The director looked at me and said ""Okay, goodbye!"" He was kicking me out. I hated myself. I said ""I'm really sorry about the laptop."" He said ""Don't worry about it, talk to you later.""

I never heard from either him or his screenwriting friend.

In retrospect, it's always when I do something spontaneous when shit goes awry. My emotions overtake me and I lose control. I tried really hard to make the interview with the British director work, but I just had to go ahead and do that stupid move of looking at this laptop without his permission. Had I only thought about my next move a little bit more, I would have prevented that disaster.

TL;DR: Fucked up three interviews by saying/doing stupid shit. Learn from my mistakes.

She had surgery (posterior pelvectomy) then adjuvant chemotherapy (6 cycles) and was considered in remission for 6 months, before discovery inguinal adenopathy and small lung and liver metastasis. So she started chemo again this spring.

She has suffered from depression for years, but would always refuse to see a doctor. When she was first diagnosed, she went through a ""just let me die, I don't want treatment"" phase. And again in spring 2013. 
The thing is, she actually responds well to treatment. Apart from being real tired and some diarrhoea, she has few secondary effects of the chemo. Each CT-scan shows a very good response, with some metastasis actually disappearing and all the others shrinking.
But she won't believe it. She spends her time on conspiracy-like websites, believing instead that doctors are using her as a test subject, all because an oncologist told her her particular form of cancer was uncommon. 
Where it gets even more complicated is that I'm a doctor myself, and work in the same hospital she is treated (though thankfully in another unit). So she used to ask me lots of questions she wouldn't ask her oncologists, and I'd answer to the best of my abilities, although I always told her they would be way more competent than me for that. It wore me down, but I still answered. I fact-checked these bullshit websites she sent me, debunking the fluke studies they cited.
Until a few weeks ago she stopped, after I told her pursuing or not chemo was her own decision, that I would support either way, but that no one could take for her. I was stupidly relieved. She would still talk of the everyday life going to the day-hospital, of how one intern was young and blundering, of the nurses and etc, but not of the treatment itself. I felt this was healthier and was glad. I was stupid.
Yesterday, I got a call from my aunt, her sister in law, who was very worried. She lives in another country, is a 10 year survivor from breast cancer. My mum sends her so many emails asking for counsel, because she stopped trusting her oncologists, my dad and me. She thinks we're all in a conspiracy to use her as a lab rat, that cancer doesn't kill but chemo does, that cancer is a fake disease created by evil doctors... She refuses to see a psychologist, or to meet other patients to share experiences. Threatens to kill herself if she has to see one more doctor.
My aunt seems to be the only human being she still trusts, and it lays a very heavy burden on her. We're at a loss.

I phoned a friend of mine who's part of the team that cares for my mum. She said no problem, my mum can take all of her medical file and go to another cancer center to ask for a second advice, and that even if it's the week end she'll prepare everything so that by monday my mum can get an emergency appointment somewhere else. If she wants, that is.
I just hesitate to tell my mum that it's all right if she wants to stop the treatment, it's her decision and she doesn't need pseudo-scientific rubbish from the Internet to justify that. But even without the chemo, she'd still need psychiatric care, and she refuses to get it, and even to acknowledge she might have a problem there.

People who have cancer, what could you advise us to do ? What to say ? How to act ?

Sorry for the long rant, I needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading anyway."
1oa1eg,3,2013-10-12,Depressed? Lovesick? Drugged,UnknownAbuser,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oa1eg/depressed_lovesick_drugged/,"I was an extremely successful student in high school. I went to college where I knew noone. I made some friends. Couple months in, I got a call that my dog died and my mom had cancer. I got heavily addicted to robitussin then coriciden. Also I started smoking a pack a day. I fell in love with a girl back home, and quit robo after about 6 months of almost daily abuse. Lots of crying and sadness I kept to myself. I started abusing my adderall scripts monthly. Over the summer my parents expressed a lot of disappointment in me. Meanwhile I was putting on a lot of weight. 
     When I returned to school for year 2, my mom was cured, things were looking up, I quit smoking cold turkey for about 3 months. Went home for winter break, my dad expressed even more disdain for my lifestyle, even though I had drastically improved. On my return to school I started smoking cigars daily, began being broke every day again. I was gaining even MORE weight. I started skipping classes. I would lie in bed and sleep an entire week just to get to the weekend if I had the chance to go see my gf. I felt pathetic that I had screwed up my classes so much, especially since the year before I had pushed through much adversity. I wore one pair of pants the entire winter. I stopped doing laundry, and stopped brushing my teeth. I was freezing the entire winter. I blamed all of my problems on the terrible sleep patterns I had. I lost all motivation, I wanted nothing to do with my major, and gave up on getting an internship because they always rejected me. I ended the semester with terrible grades, taking a withdrawal and finding myself in academic probation. 
Over that summer I started volunteering, getting better sleep, and was even able to function without my adderall. I started doing standup and felt validated for the first time in a long time. I came back to school this semester with motivation back, but as has been the case, about 3 weeks in I shut down. I still haven't changed shorts the entire summer and fall. I can't save money for more than a day, I'm smoking cigars all the time, and blowing through my addy scripts in two weeks. I can't ever sleep when I want to, I stopped brushing my teeth entirely. I spend half the week eating fast food and half eating loaves of bread cause I'm too broke from the fast food. I can barely convince myself to go to class and sometimes I'll even go there but be too afraid to go in and have people ask me where I've been. I'm terrified of phone calls, and interviews. The only motivation I have is comedy, but writing has forced me to look at some of the parts of my life I've been shutting away. 
I don't know if my problems stem from loneliness,
If they stem from my drug abuse,
Or if I'm depressed but I've only recently begun to consider the fact that maybe the reason I lose my motivation, feel lonely and worthless and guilty out here is because I might actually be depressed whenever I get out here. I really pick myself up when I go home, but when I come out here I just hate everybody and everything about my life and where it's supposed to be going. 

I really felt like I was almost out of that funk a couple weeks into the semester but it's almost like one or two things happened and I just shut down. Going to 1 or 2 classes the entire week. I just want the week to be over and I'll sleep as much as I can all week.  The next week, I'll get a maximum of 5 hours a night. These aren't even nightly sleeps, just sporadic naps. I lowered my adderal script over the summer, cause I felt like I could ween myself off.  My abuse has gotten even worse out here. I feel trapped in a program I don't want to be in at a school I don't want to be at. 

I can't say however that I've been sad. That's why I never considered depression. It seemed to me my problems were too petty and all saying I'm depressed would do would put me on more pills. 

I can ramble on about other reasons but I'll stop there. I've come to realize something about me just doesn't function in my current lifestyle. I've been given the option of going home or switching majors. I would love so much to go home, but I fear I will return and be a failure there too. 


So am I just lovesick/lonely? 
Should I consider that I am mildly depressed?
 Or have I burned through my serotonin receptors after a couple years of dxm abuse?

Thanks"
1o9u81,45,2013-10-12,I survived PUA. AMA,AlphaBaller9000,TheBluePill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1o9u81/i_survived_pua_ama/,"Longtime lurker, first time poster. I know every few weeks a former TRPer posts an AMA, and at the risk of boring anyone I want to do the same.

Back in 2009, a long-term girlfriend cheated on me and broke up with me. Before and through the time I was with her, I was unambitious, in poor physical shape, and had “nice guy” tendencies. The breakup was particularly devastating and unprecedented. In retrospect, I see that she was too young (still in college) and I was too immature for that relationship to have a future, but it was humiliating nonetheless. 

About two months after the breakup, I stumbled on a copy of The Game at a friend's house, and thus began my bizarre odyssey into PUA. For the first year, I didn't study it systematically, and couldn't even finish Strauss's book (it's overlong and quite dull as you may know). I was a mess at the time and couldn't have come across something worse for me. 

A little over a year after the breakup, I started dating a girl I met through a friend. Although I wasn't over the breakup, I had gotten into decent shape and was projecting a lot more confidence, partly because of what I'd learned from PUA—but I treated her like a gentleman and didn't game her. After three months, she broke up with me. In spite of great chemistry we just didn't get along. I smelled the smoke in the breeze a week beforehand and started having sex with another woman who I had a great connection with. I had never cheated on anyone before, and it made me feel powerful and proactive. She was leaving the country in only a few days, and I didn't want this girlfriend who yelled at me all the time to rob me of the opportunity to be with someone else I liked. From all this, I realized that I liked being kind of sleazy. A week later, with both women out of my life, I sat down and read the Mystery Method cover to cover, twice. 

For more than a year afterward, I started keeping score of my romantic life and analyzing every encounter. I never went to a bootcamp, rarely read forum posts, and besides the four PUA books authored by Strauss and Mystery, I never could get far into any other books. I became fully invested in PUA thinking but remained deeply ambivalent to it—I knew it was mostly  ridiculous and occasionally odious, but there were certain kernels of truth to it. I needed to stop being a “nice guy;” get out there and actually talk to women; and actually try to elicit the interest of women rather than being aloof, boring, random and constantly talking about myself. 

I only knew one other PUA, who I eventually lost touch with after moving. I spotted him at a coffee shop wearing ridiculous clothes and reading cosmo and said ""hey, I need a wingman, are you good?"" Turns out he had done a brief internship with Neil Strauss's ""Stylelife Academy"" and concluded that while Strauss and his groupies were all just out to make a buck, PUA still held water. He did okay with women, I'll give him that, but his confidence and ability to approach strangers was kind of awe-inspiring.

My own results were mixed. Ostensibly a success but ultimately maybe not worth the cost. I'm 5'9” and reasonably handsome, but not terrifically masculine. In the year and a half after reading Mystery's book, I had sex with 15 women, more than doubling my lifetime sex partner count. I don't know if it was “game” that led to this outcome, because I was going out much more than ever before and really trying much harder as well. I hit a stride about a year into it where I totally stopped thinking as a PUA (the fact that everyone else in my life thought it was ridiculous helped with that), and even stopped quantifying and self-monitoring my romantic endeavors. 

I don't know how I ultimately lost interest. Maybe I just had enough sex. Perhaps I felt remorse for some shitty things I did during that time. I was tired of drama and constant ups and downs. I genuinely didn't like disappointing women and hurting their feelings. Around this time, I revisited the PUA community online—as I mentioned, I never got much into forums—and was troubled to see its metastasis into TRP.  If Strauss or Mystery's books, silly and creepy as they are, had even a fraction of the malice of people like Matt Forney, Roosh, or Heartiste, I simply could never have gotten into PUA. 

I've been reading Blue Pill and Manboobz for months, mostly for entertainment but probably also as some kind of catharsis. I haven't had sex in months either—I'm not seeking it out, and when opportunities have arisen, I've just felt some strange aversion to it. I've been seeing a woman for a couple of weeks now and although I like her and she is attractive, I just have no desire to sleep with her. Even before PUA, this would have seemed unimaginable to me. 

What I realize now is that for me, PUA was never about getting laid. My sex drive is pretty so-so. For me it was driven by: 
1. Desire to have mastery over my relationships with women and be incapable of being hurt
2. Anger and resentment towards that girl that broke my heart
3. Deep-seated misogynistic beliefs 
4. Envy of guys who got laid more than me

I never denied these things for a minute when I was into PUA. I knew these were my motivations and realized how pathetic they were, but the feelings were real so I pressed on anyways.

To the issue of misogyny: shedding these beliefs can be kind of hard. Some of them you just realize aren't true. Others are much more insidious. I had to ultimately use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to ask myself why I felt upset about women at times, then write down those feelings, interrogate potential reasons why I had them, arrive at the underlying belief, and finally write down a list of reasons why it isn't true. 

The other day, one of my girlfriends from my year of living shamelessly asked me, “can you still love a woman?” I said I know I could as a human being and a friend, but romantically, I don't know. 

I feel like I escaped from PUA with some dignity, but it's so embarrassing to even contemplate. At least I'm finally moving on with my life. AMA

1ocjl5,1,2013-10-13,My boring life story.,sad_ninja,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ocjl5/my_boring_life_story/,"I guess I'll start after I moved schools in 5th grade. The reasons aren't important, but my parents moved to a completely different city halfway through my 5th grade and so I switched schools. I met my first real friend there (M). When sixth grade came about, he went to a different school than me. I was sad, but come the next year he transferred to my school. We were inseparable. I trusted him with everything and wasn't afraid to talk to him about anything. Things went bad though, and fast. When it came time to choosing a high school, he didn't want to go to the same school as me. The worst part is, he wouldn't tell me why. He would always avoid the conversation. We ended up fighting about it and once we switched schools, he never spoke to me again.

It was that summer that my sister was also moving away to college. We would usually fight, as siblings do, but aside from M, she was the only other person I would talk to and play games with.

I was literally (I actually mean literally) the only person from my middle school to go to a different high school. This high school got fed most of its students from the local middle school. Everyone already had their group of friends and weren't very friendly to new people. I ended up spending most of my free time in the library, reading. I managed to make one good friend on the bus. We actually became really great friends. However, when he got his first girlfriend, he began hanging out with only her. Of course I understand things change but I rarely saw him after that. They dated all throughout high school.

About the time they started dating was the time I got had a big fight with my only other friend from middle school. The details aren't very important but it was for an extremely ridiculous reason. She was so pissed off at me that she stopped talking to me.

That was my last friend until senior year. As usual, I had nothing better to do than read, play video games, and do my homework.

Starting my senior year, I decide to change things. I joined an after school club. This club started in the summer and ran until 5-7pm after school. The club focused around studying multiple subjects and then competing on who could score the highest near the end of the year. I met a couple of people there who I guess you could say changed my life.

The first person I met there was a guy who introduced me to a group of people who I can call my ""friends"" (more on this later). The second was a girl.

Ever since we met, she treated me differently. We would spend the whole time studying together. She would write on my notes, hold my hand, draw on me, sing to me, and even had a pet name for me. Now, I didn't like her. At least, I didn't like her when I first met her but when you spend 6+ hours a day with someone everyday, you get to know them. 

I finally accepted that I had 'fallen in love' with her 5 months after we first met. This was also around the time she and her boyfriend had broken up. However, things continued as normal with us. I didn't want to confess. I think I was scared because deep down I felt like she didn't feel the same way but the way she treated me said otherwise.

Eventually, I decide to confess. I didn't realize it until after but, I chose a very special day in February (take a guess). I said it, and she rejected me. Why? I never found out. Things took a 180 after that day. She began ignoring and avoiding me. I tried to get things to go back to normal but it just didn't happen. There were 4 months left in the school year. This went on for the next 4 months. 

I don't really remember much after that. It was boring, that's all. I took a pillow to school and slept the whole day. The summer was also pretty uneventful. I stayed home and just played video games.

I only got 1 good thing out of high school, and that was the other friend I made in that club. He introduced me to a group of people he knew online through games. I've been in that group ever since that day. I can't call them real friends though, because even though we've been through a lot, I haven't met most of them in person because of the huge distance between us. I would like to some day meet them...

So then college started. I didn't get into the university I wanted. In fact, I got into my last choice school into a major i didn't want. I really wish things would have changed in college, but in fact they got worse.

My dorm experience wasn't horrible. The only thing I really did not like were the bathrooms and the fact that everyone was alcohol crazy. My roommates were nice people but they were usually out drinking. I only lived there for a quarter before I was somewhat guilt-ed into living with my sister by my parents.

The education at this school sucks. It is suppose to be one of the best schools in the country for my major but the professors are terrible. They can barely speak English. Most of them are also assholes. I stopped going to most of my lectures.

Just like that, first year flew by. The only somewhat positive thing was that I was offered an internship for the spring/summer.

The internship is best thing that happened to me for a while. I got work experience, learned a lot, and got paid. However, I did spend my whole summer at school. Now, my body type is average (not fat/skinny), but I lost 20 pounds during the summer. I was working 30 hours a week and taking classes for 20 hours. I barely had time to eat. I think was worth it overall. I really did like this summer, at least up until September.
 bu
I skipped over a somewhat important detail. At the beginning of this year I met someone through a friend. It was kind of odd how we became friends. We met through a game and we had fun. Before I knew it, we were playing all day. Very quickly she asked for my number and she would call me almost every day. This went on up until the summer started. This is where I fuck everything up.

The details matter, but I rather not go into them. It was fault though. When I think about now, she really did care about me but I didn't want her to. I pushed her away. I ignored her. I was mad at her. I did everything I could to keep her out and I did. I succeeded. Near the end of the summer, we were no longer friends.

It hurt a lot. I didn't want that. She was one of the very (very) few people that actually cared about me. No one had ever really shown interest. They had all left but she hadn't. That was strange, so I pushed her away. I regret that everyday I wake up now. I apologized a million times but it isn't enough.

School started again and I realized I really hate it. Same shit I dealt with the past year; professor sucks, classes are boring, and I'm not given the classes I want. I'm forced to take classes I took in high school again. They don' let me take certain classes even if there is room because it is for 'X major only'. You know what? The people in that major are FAILING those classes but you won't let me take them? College is a big waste of time and money. Why am I still here? Because I have a really great research job. If it wasn't for that, I would have dropped out.

What's the use though? If I drop out what would I do? There are two jobs I think I want. One requires 6 more years of education. The other is a giant gamble.

This is my story so far. I felt the need to share this just because. Writing it makes me feel somewhat better. No one has heard this story. No one has ever really wanted too... I guess that's why I wanted to post it. Maybe someone will read it.

TL;DR: So here I am today. The people I consider to be my real friends are people I have never met. I hate going to college but I don't have any other choice. the only human interaction I have is with my sister but we barely say a word to each other (long story). I don't know if I hate my life, but I think it's boring. It has been for a very long time and I'm getting tired of it. No, I am not suicidal. I think life should be worth living. So why isn't there any worth in mine..."
1och1m,12,2013-10-13,At what point is my (25/F) relationship with my fiance (27/M) none of their business? (50'sM/F) My parents are growing more and more intrusive.,helicopterparentsugh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1och1m/at_what_point_is_my_25f_relationship_with_my/,"My parents do not trust my fiance. At all. Since the moment we became serious, they have been seeking out reasons to find him ""suspicious"" or ""hiding something"". At first it was the fact that he didn't finish college. His explanation to me was that it was due to financial reasons, and he does intend (next year, actually) to return to school and finish his degree. I have zero reason to find any of this to be untrue and I trust him 100%. My parents have never said what they believe the actual reason to be, but the way they talk about, it's like they expect to find that he assaulted another student or wrote a bomb threat and got kicked out or some ridiculous shit like that. After sitting down and having a long conversation about it, they then found something else to be worried about. At this point, it's been things like his reasoning for living where he's lived (they seem to think he was on the run from the cops for who knows what reason.. the actual reason was he moved for a change of pace) to a facebook message he apparently posted four years ago about doing drugs (my mom stalked his entire facebook, and I mean read EVERY LITTLE BIT.. by the way, I looked and couldn't find the status, then asked my fiance and he was equally confused and couldn't find it either.. we think she was confused and on somebody else's facebook, plus he doesn't do drugs anyway), to.. other shit I don't even remember, it's all so stupid. I'm fucking tired of their shit and I don't want to deal with them calling me anymore, with my mom in tears, freaking out and worried that I'm in love with a serial killer or something.


Some important information:

1. I am somewhat financially dependent upon my parents at this point in time, which makes things complicated. They have been giving me money in order to assist with finishing grad school since I only have time to work part time due to also having an unpaid internship and classes I have to attend. I am done in December so this is coming to an end soon. This makes things complicated because I'm scared I may piss them off so much that they'll end this. I guess at this point I could make do but I have so much freaking debt that I'd like to avoid this if possible.

2. This is not my first serious relationship. My parents were not like this with my exes. This is, however, my only engagement. 

3. My fiance is slightly unconventional, I guess you could say. He has tattoos, used to have piercings (still does technically, but does not wear any jewelry in them). He grew up in a family with a lot of financial difficulties so he's really had to work to get where he is today since he has had zero support from his family. He works at a job and is saving to finish his bachelor's degree. In comparison, my parents are very conservative, straight-laced, Christian types who are well off, and have been able to give my brother and I anything we need. Because he comes from a different background and appears the way he does, I think this is part of why they are the way they are. The lack of a college education is a huge thing for them, seriously. 

4. I live with my fiance. I trust him 100%. I'm not sure where they're getting these ideas from. I have no reason to not believe him. He has never been anything but amazing to me and I love him with all my heart. I can't even begin to explain how much it hurts me to hear them suggest these horrible things about his past. 

5. I have brought all of this up with my fiance. He's been nothing but open with them, even giving them his email and inviting them to talk with him, though it is really beginning to piss him off since being accused of this shit is pretty upsetting.

6. When I've asked my parents WHY they are so worried about him, their responses included:

*""We barely know him""*. Ok. Well, fiance and I live 12 hours away so that makes things difficult. They've met him only a handful of times. I rarely see my parents (maybe once a year) so it's not like they could expect to see him every fucking weekend or something. I'm not sure what to do here.


*""We have much more life experience than you.""* Not sure about a good rebuttal for this one since I can't deny it, but at the same time, I think they're misguided as fuck. 


*""Mom's depression and anxiety cause her to worry a lot.""* I'm sympathetic to this, but it seems I've become her scapegoat. Apparently my life is the reason my mom is in therapy (worried about not just my relationship, but things like my career prospects, finances, etc). While I'm not 100% optimistic about my career due to the economy right now, I'm not freaking out about it like she is either. I have a job waiting tables and I'll be able to up my hours to full time when I graduate anyway, so it's not like I'm totally screwed. 



It's 5 am, I have to work in the morning and I can't sleep, and I feel like I'm going to cry. I realize that it's necessary to put an end to this, but I'm looking for insight into their craziness and possibly a good way to approach them about everything without seriously affecting our relationship. It seems every time I end one of their worry sessions about some aspect of his life, something new crops up.

**tl;dr**: My parents are incredibly nosy about my fiance due to a sense of mistrust that I don't understand. It's causing a lot of stress and I want to put it to an end. "

CMV.,CommaInTheAir,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1oc7zp/i_believe_that_recent_college_graduates_who/,"I majored in Computer Science at a large public university. Upon graduation, I had job offers from multiple large companies, and I accepted one for $60k/year to start working within a few weeks of my graduation. Within 2 years, I was able to buy my own home (with a mortgage, to be clear), which I now operate as a rental property. I have remained gainfully employed since, and have increased my salary significantly in the intervening years.

Things have not changed that much since 2006. All of these things should still be possible today.

I worked hard in high school to gain admittance into a good university in a competitive major that would guarantee me a job upon graduation. Then I worked hard through university to get good grades and build a strong professional network through internships. Now I work hard at my job to continue moving up.

I believe that students who have trouble finding jobs when they graduate either did not work hard enough to be competitive in the job market, or chose a major that would not offer strong job prospects upon graduation, and are now experiencing the consequences.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bam. She met you and thought to herself - young man with bright future. Let's bag him with a pregnancy and live the perfect life. She's probably going to pay for the baby now, then once you graduate and get a job she will be looking for the payout. **+20**

Yeah! Nothing more appealing to a lady with lady hormones than getting knocked up via a 20-year-old intern who lives with his parents. Ooh, yeah, gonna get me some of that nectar of the gods, manna from heaven... **motherfuckin' child support, bitches.**

OP, obviously concerned with the tone this thread is taking, asks the important questions:

&gt; I don't have any wealth of my own. Can she get money from my family if I can't pay for child support?

&gt;&gt; Oh, you're paying. Or you're going to jail. **+41**

Cue the jerk-within-a-jerk (ourojerkos?) about how they all totally know a guy who went to jail for not being able to pay child support, therefore child support laws only exist to ruin the lives of unsuspecting fathers and prop up lazy feminazi single moms, because their anecdotal evidence is totally representative of the court system across all fifty states. Christ's sake, guys. By that logic, I could say that no man has ever paid child support because they all ran off to Russia to escape paying the back child support they owed, because that's what my dad did that one time. But that wouldn't make it *universally true* or anything.

Oh, speaking of which, it wouldn't be a child support jerk without that useful suggestion! 

&gt;...he also has the right to leave the country... just saying... OP, get your degree and take a permanent vacation to Europe? **+7**

Oh, and while you're at it, have a redpillian ""I just want a traditional Asian wife, not a slutty slut who sluts!"" jerk, courtesy of OP:

&gt; She has a somewhat new BMW; and lives in a town house by herself. I don't know too much about her finances. I am just terrified right now not just because of the child support. But because this fucks up my chances of ever getting a respectable Asian wife.

And then...

&gt; I want to marry a girl that shares my same culture and values. I'd like my children in the future to know about their heritage and language.

Luckily, a few other commenters laid down the truth with regard to this line of thinking. That said, the entire thread is just a trainwreck. While I have my reasonable doubts with regard to its legitimacy (it seems like half the long story posts on that sub are just pot-stirring bullshit made up to fan the flames of bitter misogynists' Cheeto farts), I'm certainly going to be following its inevitable updates."
1obr1u,2,2013-10-12,I think I hate all my friends because I am more mature than them.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1obr1u/i_think_i_hate_all_my_friends_because_i_am_more/,"This is going to sound vain and I know Reddit hates overly-confident people, or confidence in general, but I need to write this out because I really can't tell anyone else. In fact, I have no one else to tell because I have lost so many friends.

I like my friends on the surface. But honestly, I feel like I am ages ahead of them in maturity. I'm 21 years old and go to a community college...I'm at home with my parents and am saving for my own car. This description makes me sound like a burnout, but let me further explain what got me here.

The year after I graduated high school, I spent in Europe and lived in Scandinavia as a foreign exchange student. At 18 years old, this alone made me grow up and when I got back nothing was the same. Yes, we had both gone off and done different things, but I was away from America while they were in their freshman dorms able to go home for the holidays, text their parents at free will, etc. But when I got back, my friends actually treated me as an inferior, because I hadn't gone off to a 4-year university...I felt incredibly judged and singled out because of it. I guess it could have been because they couldn't relate or something, I don't know.

Upon coming back, I  went to community college for a year and *then* I went to Disney World, again, on my own for a 7 month internship. With Disney on my resume, a month after coming home, I am now working 2 professional jobs and interning for an NFL team and also work for a blogging site. I will have my Associate's in Arts done by January. I feel pretty accomplished, but I still feel like my friends consider me a burnout.

I have completely lost contact with most of my friends, and when I text them, they don't really ask about me and I carry most of the conversation. They figure that I'm a burnout, when in actuality, I think that our interests are just polar opposites because our lives have just turned out differently. I get along great with older people. I understand their humor and I can continue a decent conversation without fault, whereas my friends treat talking to adults like it's a chore. I don't find my friend's humor funny anymore, and in fact, I find it kind of childish.

No, I didn't go to a 4 year university, but with my life experience I feel like I have taken 2 giant steps ahead of my friends on the maturity scale and I sort of hate it. I have moved into a professional world rather quickly, while they are graduating with their degrees.

I guess I should just say I don't relate to them anymore. And now I'm living at home, working, literally with no friends. I don't like the few people left in my town and I don't connect well enough with my friends anymore to visit them comfortably. I want to go back to Florida for school, but right now I am stuck in a rut, sitting on Reddit, thinking way too hard about shit.

So yes, this came across as bitchy. I'm aware of it. But I hate sitting here knowing that I lost friends over wanting to achieve different goals that did not fit the general hivemind we were fed as high schoolers.

If you read this, thanks for reading. If you've experienced this and have advice, I would love for you to share. If you think I'm a bitch, you're right, and please feel free to tell me that, too. I just won't really care that much because, well, I am a bitch :)"

WTF do employers actually want?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ogmtf/screw_this_wtf_do_employers_actually_want/,"I need to vent, as the title says.  I'm not necessarily looking for advice (although if you have any unique advice or specific pointers they'd certainly be appreciated) but any similar experiences please share, because right now I am more discouraged and angry than I ever thought possible.

I've been turned down for ALL the internships that I interviewed for in the past couple of weeks..  Please read on before making any comments.
I'm a senior accounting major at a top-20 ranked public university.  My GPA is a 3.2 cumulative and just under 3.5 considering just the accounting classes.  

I spent the past year studying for the CMA, I passed Part 1 no problems, currently awaiting results of Part 2 (almost certain I passed).  I am preparing to submit all my paperwork to start sitting for CPA portions next year.  I have the 150 hours as I am prior military (was a marine), and am starting the graduate program in the same university in the spring.

My resume covers ALL of this.  I also tutor the entry-level management accounting class and have done so for more than a year.  I also spent time working at the campus' military service office, helping other vets get their GI Bill stuff set up.

I'm trying to say, I have a lot of experience and good stuff on my resume.

How many undergrads can say they've passed a professional-level cert portion??? I have met none.

I know my GPA is less than perfect.  I know the Big Four are very unlikely to consider me (Crowe dismissed me outright as well).  I'm ok with that.  I interviewed for some big industry players though.  They all turned me down.  One didn't even give me a second interview.  The worst part is, a couple of the interviewers were CMA's!!! And they barely acknowledged that I've passed a portion of the damn thing.

I know you're probably thinking I blew the interview.  I don't think that's the case though.  I made plenty of eye contact, I stayed calm (I very rarely am unnerved), spoke clearly, was on time, polite, thanked them for THEIR time, etc.  I was knowledgeable about the companies as well.

The internal audit internship?  I EVEN ASKED IF THE HEAD OF INTERNAL AUDIT REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE!!! The golden question in considering an employer for internal audit.  Ugh.

So I don't have a 3.8 something GPA, fuck me right?  I'm untouchable?

Anyone else out there ever been this frustrated?

I like her as a friend, I do not think she likes me anymore than that either. However, I am scared that because of how plain and boring I am with my conversation and constant low energy level that she is only hanging out with me due to sympathy or pity about my girlfriend being gone for so long.

So, r/askseddit, while I am not trying to get tips to seduce and take her home, I would like advice on how to be fun, funny, provocative and someone she would genuinely like to hang out with. Remove all doubt from my mind about it as well.

A is some set which is defined as all the elements of something I know is a vectorspace with some condition bounded to them. The summation and scalar product is defined just as it is for the vectorspace in question.

Is it enough to check wheither the summation and product are intern in A to know that it's a vector space? It is on a intuitive level.

Specific example

A= [ vectors of R³, condition blabla ]

Summation and scalar product for A are defined just as for R³.

So let's say I start checking the definition of a vectorspace. Is the summation intern in A?

I find yes.

I go on, next is that it has to be commutative. But I'm not sure how to check that, I know that it is commutative for R³, so is that argument enough for that?

What I'm trying to say is that intuitive I feel that the extra added property could only be a problem for it being intern in A, I know that all the other properties of R³ are fine. 

So am I correct?"

Between my internship hours and my hellish class schedule, I barely have time to eat and think anymore.  I know I've been especially on edge as of late due to the first wave of midterms, and I'm so sorry if I've made you upset by snapping at you for the smallest things because of that.  Our long distance relationship has been hard on us before, but it's really hitting me hard this semester.

To be completely honest, I feel like I've been losing myself to classwork, and because of that I feel like we're slipping away from each other.  I feel like I'm not doing my job as a boyfriend, and I hate myself for it.  I haven't been supportive enough of your athletic career, nor have I been supportive enough of your graduate school endeavors.  Even though you tell me that it's okay for me to focus on myself and the pressing issues at hand, I feel that I cannot continue to go on working my hands to the floor like this.  You are an intrinsic part of my everyday life, and because of that, I need to be better for you.

I know over the last 4 and a half years our relationship ebbed and flowed a bit, and I know that it will become much harder over the next three years when you're going to be at graduate school, but I need you to know that I'll be along for the ride right there with you.  I'll find a career wherever you end up going to school.  I'll move out to Texas if need be.  If you end up having to pay in full for graduate school, we can pay off your loans together.  I'll be there for you every step of the way.

You mean everything to me... and I'm a fool for ever taking you for granted.  I love you so much."
1ofwu4,4,2013-10-14,The Narrows,[deleted],batman,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/1ofwu4/the_narrows/,"Hey guys, here is a story that I had to write for school. I thought you guys appreciate it. It's about the famous crime-fighting duo of James Gordon and Harvey Bullock, set around Year One time.


The Narrows


“If, on a winter’s night a traveller were to walk through these streets he’d go by unnoticed.” The Cashier snarled at us, baring his yellowed teeth.

“If you see this man please let us know.” Harvey replied and placed the wrinkled photograph on the counter. We flinched as we stepped out into the snowy streets that made up the Narrows. How could a man so infamous simply walk out of a lunatic asylum into the night? Who helped him escape? These questions were branded onto my mind while we scurried back to our car, like all the rats who call this place home. The familiar scent of day-old scotch clung to the walls. Harvey was silent on the way back to the precinct; he was always troubled by unfinished jobs. The road above us was illuminated by our Chevy; we were still as blind as the bats that roam this city unchecked. Thump. Harvey swung the wheel as we skidded across the ice; the rats ran to their holes. I grabbed my Magnum as the door clunked open. The cool air shattered my breath. There was a dent on the roof of the car, something, or someone had crushed it. There was no sign of anybody nearby.
 
“James, you can’t seriously think it’s him? We don’t have time to indulge your little obsessions, there’s a lunatic on the loose.” Harvey spoke calmly, but I could see his eyes twitching, searching for some evidence, something to let us know we were safe. The Chevy was warm and comforting, but I still couldn’t get the feeling that we were being watched out of my head. The adrenaline was wearing off by the time we reached the bridge. As we left the Narrows everything seemed brighter, even though the night was late. The thick orange glow flickered through the cables; I was going home to Barbara and my unborn child. I smiled, I could almost smell the biscuits warming in the oven, that scent of cinnamon all throughout the house, that perfume I got Barbara that she insists on wearing despite the fact that I know she despises it.

The Chevy sputtered into a space outside the police department, Harvey wished me a merry Christmas and left for home, we both know where he is really going. The doors were glistening with condensation as I pushed them open. The silence of the road was extinguished by the bustle of the building. Some men were putting up tinsel and decorations across the walls; I was greeted by the intern Dent. “Barry from Forensics says that there was no sign of forced entry or exit in the cell.”

That news does not make this job any easier. “Tell Barry I’ll speak with him tomorrow, I just have a couple of things to sort out tonight. Oh I forgot; how is Law School going?” I replied in the most cheerful voice I could muster. 
“Everything is going fine Detective!” the boy replied. Dent was filled with so much optimism, he always wanted to be a solicitor, guess that means he won’t be out there freezing his fingers off and living drunk like Harvey. At least this world has a little hope. I’m damned to hell anyway. My office was small and dark, covered in boards and newspaper cuttings. Harvey would tease me for them; they weren’t my cases, just my ‘obsession’. The cork was pierced by pins holding all the sightings of bats in this city. I was always intrigued by the Chiropteran order, now they had come to my city.

An hour later I climbed the cracked black steps to my home, awaiting the warming biscuits. The fragrant cinnamon. My family. All separate memories crossing at this one moment. Victor from next door asked me whether we’d caught the madman yet. I dreamed of bats that night.

I am an International student who completed his High School from India &amp; is in Sheridan College right now &amp; will complete his 3 year diploma in Computer Systems Technology this year.

Well, as the question says, my academics have not been that great though I still try to keep my score around 70%. Moreover, my high school scores are not that great either. 

Well, for an international student, I think a diploma is not enough to get a well paid job even though at the same time I think that if one has skills, he can get a job he likes. I am good at the stuff I do &amp; been even appreciated for my efforts when I did my internship. Furthermore, I intend to get a Degree in Computer Science &amp; I would love to get into either UofT or UofW as they are well known their computer science program (though I will keep my options open).

Some of my friends have told me, that I can get into a University by completing the high school requirements from here (like taking courses from Virtual High School). Is it true?

Though I still have time for getting into University as I intend to get a residency here first, then join a University. But still I want to get an idea of 'how' will I get into a University if I have an average academic background."

I've asked her about it and there's no denial that she puts a lot before me.

But I know she doesn't want to break up...this is just her nature. She's always been closed off, but never to this degree.

I'll give her credit in that we are busy students with our own separate internships which keeps our schedules tough, but it's not like we're overly busy to the point where we can't afford **any** time.


What can I do/say to let her know I'm not happy with being at the bottom of her list?

I've been looking for something that would really catch my attention so i could make it something great instead of something mediocre. 

What i would love to do is start messing around with Lua and Houston until i'm comfortable and then spend about 2-3 months of free time creating an addon of sorts. I'm not worried about it already existing, or even a better version of it being out there somewhere. I just want a project i can work on, that will have some use somewhere in game. But i have not quite reached the stage where im ready to take suggestions or ideas. I am pretty comfortable with most of the lower level languages you are taught in college but i have not yet done any scripting. I was wondering if anyone knows a good place to find some tutorials on Lua, where some good information about the Wildstar API that is provided in Houston may be etc etc. I would be more than willing to accept help from anyone to learn, and if i can get up to speed in Lua it would be even cooler to work with some other people in coding! Especially since i'm concentrating in Game Development!

PS to Carbine - I am disappointed beyond words that you do not have an internship program. I went to your website today to check it out and found a nice one liner saying ""We do not have an internship program "" :(

tl;dr: Need a place to learn Lua. Would be awesome if someone would help me learn or learn with me and could work on future projects for Wildstar together. Also any information on the Wildstar API since i cant find much.

1oeck3,7,2013-10-13,1 1/2 years since my last post and things are going well,YTT1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oeck3/1_12_years_since_my_last_post_and_things_are/,"[Nearly 1 1/2 years ago I last used this throwaway to just write down why everything was going shit at the moment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/x5orb/everything_i_do_is_failing_at_the_moment/)

After that, things didn't get much better. Rather worse. I dropped out of university last summer and didn't know what to do afterwards. My parents were supportive, but since they didn't know what I wanted to do ( neither did I), I am pretty sure they felt helpless themselves. The next 6 months, I was just sitting at home playing videogames and going to sportstraining. Family matters got worse and worse. It got to the point where I was in my room for weeks without contact other than my internet friends. At that point I don't know what sparked my interest into becoming a teacher, but after talking with previous high school classmate who is going down that path and getting an internship at my local school, the deal was sealed for me and I had decided for myself. But it was mid December now and the next start for university courses was next Octobre. I applied for low-end part time jobs just to make my family a bit happier that I am still doing things with my life. The job was at a car rental return at an airport. I did my job and I did it okish. But I hated it. I felt so bad for people who had to pay thousands because of scratches and dents I and my coworers had to find on cars. I got more and more depressed again about my whole situation and the job, but didn't want to quit since my parents where happy about me finding something to do and accomplishing things. I took a 2 week break. I was considering quitting and was about to get into the circle of self-loathing as previous again, but somehow I didn't. I got back from the break, did my job to the best I could ( even though I still hated it), was happy and just probably a way nicer person than before and got recognised by the bosses. I got promoted into a special division for premium customers and so forth. I always had problems with establishing relationships with people because of being extremely shy and awkward, but in the break I realized that noone knew me at work and I could be who I always wanted to be or who I always was, but never could act on it, because I was put down by ""friends"" for behaving so different. Coworkers liked me, Bosses gave me quite big on the side bonuses. It was a decent time to be honest. I was popular for the first time in my life and that just by being myself. I never dreamt of something like that happening. I had a few people, who wanted my number just so we could hang out some time. This must sound so silly, but that was one of the greatest experiences in my life. But before I went to university once again, I wanted to broaden my english language skills and my just cultural knowledge, so I applied as an Au pair in England. Directly the first family accepted and a month later after quitting work and hearing the phrase ""We will miss you here at work"" quite often I was off to Colchester. Not much I can say about the time there since I was mostly occupied with the children, but it was great overall. Next interesting thing was back in Germany. The introductory phase for upcoming teacher. I attended with one of my coworkers from work also starting that semester. I talked to people, but was falling back into my old persona being shy and reserved. I went home nearly crying on the train, because I felt ashamed of myself and throwing everything I worked for down the drain. I have no clue how I cope with these things, but the next morning I was back to my ""new"" me. I found  one bloke studying the same thing hitting it right off and just became good friends with him. Over the next 2 days we somehow got pretty popular and liked, because we were there for everything. I even met a girl at a silly game and we had a crazy few days after only to find out that we were not made for each other, but that would not happened before in my life. People again were just asking for my number or facebook. Now it is 2 weeks after this event. 3 hours before I should get up to go to my ""first"" day of university again. But I could not be more happy and more excited and at the same time nervous about what to come, it can only go upwards looking at the progress I made over the last 6 months. For the first time in my life, I feel good about myself. I know where I want to go, but I want my path there be as crazy and fun as it can be. I now know who I am. See you again Reddit and thank you in some bad times with your fun and wit."

Can you tell me about the transition from learning accounting theory in school to applying this knowledge on the job? How much do you expect us to know when first starting (I know they will say ""nothing"", but it should lead to decent conversation)

Whats the most difficult part of transitioning from associate level positions to manager and partner levels?

Looking back, is there anything you learned during your time working at X that you wish you knew when you were a student?

What are some of the traits that successful interns have had in the past?

Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently in your career?

What kind of specific tasks are Summer Interns typically assigned? I know that my knowledge will be limited when starting my internship.

How do you manage your tasks and time when working on multiple client engagements?




Ideally I'd want these all to lead to conversation or have some non-work related conversation come up beforehand, but I don't want to ask ""What do you like to do in your spare time"", or ""why this firm"" at the end of an interview.

This last week she says she's been thinking about what she wants in someone she wants to spend a long time with.   

The thing is the distance has made her see that there are some things that aren't there in our relationship as much as she wants, and she feels like she's starting to push away. She says she doesn't feel that drive with us as much anymore, and to be honest it's tearing me apart.  

The part that is the worst is that she's always felt that she doesn't see us working in the long run, and it's not changing. It may have disappeared in the background, but with the space it has become more clear. Some of the things that attribute to that are our difference in religion, and our difference in maturity.  

She is a devote Christian, and I am still in the process of finding God's love, and I think it's one of the things distancing our relationship. On top of that, she feels that I've learned a lot more in our relationship that she has, which to her didn't feel all that even or equal.  

These last few days, I haven't slept a whole lot, but I have gotten closer to God. I guess at this point, I'm putting a lot of trust into something I am still learning about. But I also don't know what to do. I feel so hurt and lost. I've opened so much about myself, and I'm just scared that it was for not a whole lot.  

Edit: Forgot to mention that I am visiting her this weekend to try to figure out what we are going to do.

He's starting his internship and will be in it for a while.. maybe a couple months.

After he left, we both got really sad. I got a lot better and then it just went downhill. We're both really depressed and soooo done with waiting. I know we don't have much left but it's still *so. hard.*

I'm so afraid he'll just decide he's tired of waiting. I know so many long distance relationships end after they met, because they can't handle the distance and stuff. 

We're trying to work out visit dates but we're not sure if he'll be able to come before next year, and I can't go there.

It hurts a lot hearing him all sad a lot and I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried my best to make him feel better, and we're trying to get together, but sometimes I'm afraid we won't make it. "
1ogyjq,9,2013-10-14,Mid-20s looking for a change of pace,20sneedsadvice,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ogyjq/mid20s_looking_for_a_change_of_pace/,"I am currently in my mid-20s living in a metropolitan area on the east coast. I make decent money as a consulting engineer (in the construction field) and really enjoy what I do. I have been at my current firm since I was an intern during college. We are a very small operation and have been doing very well during the three years that I've been here. In fact, we have grown more than 200% since I've been working with the company and at this rate, I have no doubt that we will continue to do so.

I am a generally adventurous person and enjoy traveling and experiencing new things. I have been in my current city for about 8 years and I am at a point in my life where I am eager to move forward and try a change of pace with my life, and I think my current situation allows me to do so.

My question really is this: How advisable is it that I leave my current job to find something else? 

My current plan is this: My lease for my apartment will end at the end of January. From now until then, I will continuously look for new job prospects (this is the step that I currently am on) while also try to save as much money as I can. I have no real destination set in mind, but I am very much looking for another metropolitan area, whether it be in the US or elsewhere.

My PF situation is as follows: I am currently single. I have no more loans of ANY type (hurrah!), no other financial burdens and have about $10k in my bank accounts. I drive an older reliable car that I maintain relatively well and that I think will last me just about forever. I live very simply and do not need many things. Fortunately for me, I am currently still under my parents' health insurance (thank you ACA) for another year.

For the most part, I think this question is PF related, but if not, if anyone could provide me another related subreddit that would be very much appreciated.

All in all, what do you think? Any advice, good, bad or ugly is appreciated. I'd like to hear the truth, and perhaps anecdotes (and even just general comments), and what I really should expect.

Thanks for your time, PF.

EDIT: I've taken out my option of heading out before I have a solid plan nailed down. I realize how unreasonable that is and perhaps my wanderlust was what was driving me in that direction. Regardless, I'd like the advice and criticism to continue whilst ignoring that option. "

1ollek,2,2013-10-16,How my 3rd dui saved my life,syounit,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ollek/how_my_3rd_dui_saved_my_life/,"    I am 26 years old, and I have been drinking for 13 years on and off. I could always drink more than everybody else and I didn't really care to know why until I got my 2nd DUI in 2007. After that I was forced into recovery programs that I didn't want to be in. I met some incredible people, but i already knew that my drinking wasn't over yet at that point, bc thats what i had in my head. This is also the time I lived in a halfway house and met my friend Ali who was charged with a DUI homicide (her passenger who was an alcoholic passed). She helped me out so much back in 2007 and within the first week I knew I was going to be friends with her for the rest of my life. 

    After I got out of jail she was sentenced and went away for awhile. For the next 6 and a half years I took drinking head on and went through a journey that showed me why I am an alcoholic. I can't even tell you how many times I tried to quit drinking by myself over that time period, but it was so many times. I met my current GF back in 2009 and told her right away that I had a serious alcohol problem, and she said we can figure it out. Most of my attempts to stop have been while I have been with her. I've also learned that you cannot stay sober for somebody else. It sounds stupid but it just doesn't work, your alcoholism will convince you that the person you love is trying to ruin your life. Its disgusting. I put that girl through a world of pain with my alcoholism (emotional and mental pain, not physical). She drinks sometimes, and we have drank together, but I always take it to the next level. I always end up ""transforming into the monster"" as she calls me. We enjoyed drinking together at first, but as time passed, she began to hate me when i drank, and eventually she just wouldn't drink anymore because she didn't want to encourage my drinking, but that wouldn't stop me. I got so drunk on new years of 2011 that when we came home that night and got into a fight, i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, and handed it over to her and said, ""why don't you go ahead and kill yourself because nobody cares about you, not me, not your parents, not anyone."" She was incredibly upset the next day and I didn't know why until she told me, I didn't have any recollection of that happening and I still do not. 

    This is the point where I started to fear my drinking, or I should say fear myself when I drank. Was I becoming dangerous or was I just completely selling my soul to alcohol? This is the time that I started to experience longer and heightened periods of anxiety and depression after drinking. By this time I stopped going to see my friend Ali and had surrounded myself by people who were alcoholics, but had worse situations than myself, which allowed me to justify my own drinking. 

    I took care of my grandfather during this time because he was starting to have problems staying home alone at home and what not. My drinking still came first, but I did my best to take care of my papa, but even in his last days of being able to talk clearly, he still told me that my alcoholism was bad. He told me that he was happy my grandma died when she did back in 2005, because if she saw me today, it would kill her, because I was her favorite grandson with so much potential, and I was throwing it all away with alcohol. Eventually he needed more care than I could provide.

    I had been struggling with school because of my alcoholism, and it had almost cost me my relationship countless times. The one thing I can say though is that I have never cheated on my gf while intoxicated, or ever, i have never wanted to bc i knew what it took for her to put up with my shit. My family has helped me out through my troubled times, and have hoped for me to figure out my own plan for sobriety, but it hasn't happened up until recently. I went to detox after begging my dad to send me there because it came to a point that I physically couldn't stop drinking otherwise I would withdrawal. After I went through detox I kept myself sober by not drinking at all. That lasted for about 5 months until I decided to drink again. I didn't go to meetings or anything and told myself that all it took was my willpower. Eventually I gave into the screaming voice in my head to drink again. I remember that drink too, it was a Pacifico on tap with a lime at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Vegas. As I drank the beer, I remember how satisfied I felt to finally soothe that voice and how defeated and helpless I felt at the same time.

    As it had before after my periods of brief sobriety, my drinking picked up right where it left off. I tried to control myself as much as I could, my girlfriend and I even had a few times drinking together where we got along, this had not happened in years. This reinforced the thought that I was in complete control and that I was finally a normal drinker again, but sadly I was only fooling myself. For all the times I kept myself reserved around my girlfriend while drinking, I just hit it that much harder when she wasn't around. I began to lie again, hide my drinking, and fall into an endless pit of anxiety and depression. In the weeks leading up to my DUI, I finally saw my alcoholism for what it was. I wasn't able to function normally before that, but I had finally progressed to the point where I was able to maintain going to school, excelling at my internship, and maintain a normal sleeping schedule. 

    I had become a fully functional alcoholic and my sickness was exponentially degrading me as a human being, finally taking the bigger piece of myself away from me and leaving me more and more empty everyday. Relief finally came when I received my DUI. Finally I am forced to stay sober by having a monitoring bracelet, going to AA meetings, and going to counseling. Im facing harsh penalties, but thats okay. I've committed a crime and I accept that. I will go to jail and pay hefty fines, but I accept that. Today I can look at myself in the mirror and feel some control again. I can tell people that I am an alcoholic and I know and believe it with everything in me. I know now that I cannot do this on my own, and the people at AA are going to help me stay sober so long as I continue to go and want it bad enough. 

    Drinking is no longer an option for me, because it is more than just a DUI next time. It will cost me everything, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, my job, my future, and most of all I will loose myself entirely. My demon haunts me everyday but I am not longer willing to give into its demands. I am going to fight for my sobriety, and everybody is helping me now, and I am finally willing to accept it. My friend Ali has been sober for 6.5 years and she took me to my first AA meeting since my dui and i have never felt better. I am lucky to have the support of everybody around me, and I now realize my sobriety depends on who I surround myself with, how I live my life, and most importantly the maintenance and preventative measures I take (AA) to prevent a relapse. I realize that it essentially comes down to the point where I have the choice to take that first drink, and today I am doing everything I can to prepare myself to say no when and where that situation arises. 

    If your an alcoholic, you can do it too. Living in active alcoholism is the equivalent to living in hell on earth. I don't believe there is a God, I believe in myself and everyone around me. If you think AA is just about God, your sadly mistaken. I am finally free from alcohols strong grasp for the first time in years, and I cannot wait to continue on my journey. Theres nothing wrong with admitting to being weak and meaning it, because only then you can begin to heal. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to all the people that are in recovery, may everyday be better than the last. To those of you that are still stuck in the midst of your addiction, just remember that help is always out there, weather it be AA, rehab, or whatever else. Never give up because it is 100% possible for you to beat this, it all depends on what you want, if you can accept it, and what your going to do to free yourself."

(crosspost from /r/atheism),nathanbweller7,DebateReligion,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1olfcv/serious_discussionqa_former_conservative/,"I am a former ""intern"" for an extreme right-wing conservative evangelical ministry called Teen Mania Ministries. I went to their film, television and new media internship called Center for Creative Media after high school where as a 19-21 year old I made an estimated 200+ videos, wrote sermons, magazine articles, and helped concept/produce massive stadium events for indoctrinating tweens and teens.

The events I helped to produce were called Acquire the Fire and Battlecry. If you went to either of those events in 2007, I'm sorry, I wrote most of what you saw there. Ironically, it was during this time that I began to question my own faith as I encountered more and more challenges squaring reality with the talking points I was given to work with.

This questioning and disillusionment lead to some serious clashes with leadership. Unfortunately for me, I was on an isolated campus in the no-man's land of Texas with no vehicle, no money and now way to escape. Myself and many other ""interns"" were forced to work insane hours--sometimes 100+ a week--for months on end. This lead to intense insomnia, anxiety attacks, and a myriad of other health problems such as high blood pressure, nosebleeds and more.

I say ""interns"" because that whole ministry works on a sort of bait-and-switch program where they convince you that you're going there to learn. Once they have you there, they put you to work and say that your education is in figuring stuff out while they pile endless and unreasonable work on you. That's why a 19-21 year old kid was overseeing the media production of a 30+ city stadium tour. To say that the pressure was intense is putting it mildly.

What's worse is that as I began raising more and more concerns about the message we were expected to deliver (to kids no less) the tactics of ministry leaders to ""keep me in line"" became extreme. I was forced to work for days on end, getting no sleep for 48+ hours at a time. Then, I would be sent into meetings in a dazed and confused stupor to be told about God's expectations for my performance. My questions were met with disappointment and manipulative please to not ""betray"" someone who felt like a father to me, etc. etc.

The net result of my experiences at this ministry is that I've been dealing with PTSD for about five years. Experiencing this ugly side of a faith I thought was literally God's gift to mankind, forced me to take seriously the arguments against it. Once I gave those arguments equal weight, they easily made an undeniable case for the pernicious lie that religion is.

Which brings me to why I created this post. I haven't spoken out against that ministry or Christianity in an open public forum until now because I felt like they would have an easy ad hominem attack that would discredit me: ""look how crazy he is, you can't take his claims seriously because obviously he has mental problems.""
However, I feel that I've made enough progress towards mental and physical health at this point to engage the topic meaningfully. I want to take time now--as someone familiar with both sides of the fundamentalist vs atheist/secular worldview--to discuss or answer questions people might want to ask someone with my particular life experience.

tl;dr--I used to be in a crazy Christian cult that brainwashes kids. At the time I wrote a lot of their material, perpetuating the cycle of brainwashing. I'm now an atheist who would like to speak up about the dangers of religion. Let's talk!

1ol37k,12,2013-10-16,Might have ruined my girlfriend's career hopes,HenrysFury,Anger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/1ol37k/might_have_ruined_my_girlfriends_career_hopes/,"Heyo,

My girlfriend of two and a half years is studying to be a dietician. To help network for a certain hospital's internship, she applied to volunteer there.

Anyway, she couldn't figure out when or where her orientation was, only that it was today. Neither of us could get anyone on the phone. After about 30 to 40 minutes of answering machines, I left a voicemail saying someone could ""call me back and subject themselves to a relentless tirade of verbal insult or grow some balls"".

It took a lot for me to write that out, as it may have seriously altered my life and my girlfriend's.

Anyway, within 20 minutes I get a phone call from their Human Resources department. My girlfriend's volunteer position has been deactivated/delayed for the next 6 months. She can reapply after that.

The weird part is, I don't remember thinking ""okay, this would be a good thing to say right now and leave as a message,"" I just remember saying it. Almost like I slipped.

I'm in a pretty bad place right now (I was an even worse place a half hour ago). Can I trust myself? Do I have no judgment or sense of consequences? Am I going off the deep end here?

My girlfriend has said I need to demonstrate that I have self control and that I can judge the consequences of my actions. Basically that I'm not a ticking time bomb that could hurt her, her family or her career. I'm a little bit surprised she hasn't left me.

1ol1ad,4,2013-10-16,Where to start.,throwaway711117,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ol1ad/where_to_start/,"I really have no idea where to begin. I just don't know who to go to at this point. 

I hate my internship, which yesterday I got written up for being sick even though I work with food they still think that I should come in sick. Whole mess of that made me want to leave and fly back home to my parents.

I hate myself at this point. Exactly one year ago today I found out I was pregnant. I stuck my head in the sand because I was only 19 I didn't know any better (still don't know that much) and eventually got my big girl panties on and told my exbf. He made it clear I wasn't having a kid with him and was forced to do the unspeakable. After I got the abortion I had instant regrets and ended up in the ER for complications, can I have kids after the whole procedure? I'm not sure but will probably kill me if I can't have kids of my own.

Currently have a new bf who I really really like but sometimes I just don't know whats going to happen. I'm sick of just being another girl to someone. Everyone I know is married or having kids and I know I'm not that old and it will still happen but I just don't want an uncertain future anymore. Yeah, it seems dumb but deep down I want to be engaged and  have a day just about me. I've never really had that before.

I don't really know what to do and not really sure what I WANT. Just for all the stress to go away :/"
1ol175,100,2013-10-16,[Serious Discussion/Q&amp;A] Former Conservative Evangelical Propaganda Writer Turned Atheist Here. My Story After The Click...,nathanbweller7,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ol175/serious_discussionqa_former_conservative/,"Hey everyone in /r/atheism, this is my first post in this subreddit. I'm not sure how interested you guys will be in this thread but I wanted to put it out there in the hopes of having a good discussion and meeting some like-minded redditors.

I am a former ""intern"" for an extreme right-wing conservative evangelical ministry called Teen Mania Ministries. I went to their film, television and new media internship called Center for Creative Media after high school where as a 19-21 year old I made an estimated 200+ videos, wrote sermons, magazine articles, and helped concept/produce massive stadium events for indoctrinating tweens and teens.

The events I helped to produce were called Acquire the Fire and Battlecry. If you went to either of those events in 2007, I'm sorry, I wrote most of what you saw there. Ironically, it was during this time that I began to question my own faith as I encountered more and more challenges squaring reality with the talking points I was given to work with.

This questioning and disillusionment lead to some serious clashes with leadership. Unfortunately for me, I was on an isolated campus in the no-man's land of Texas with no vehicle, no money and now way to escape. Myself and many other ""interns"" were forced to work insane hours--sometimes 100+ a week--for months on end. This lead to intense insomnia, anxiety attacks, and a myriad of other health problems such as high blood pressure, nosebleeds and more.

I say ""interns"" because that whole ministry works on a sort of bait-and-switch program where they convince you that you're going there to learn. Once they have you there, they put you to work and say that your education is in figuring stuff out while they pile endless and unreasonable work on you. That's why a 19-21 year old kid was overseeing the media production of a 30+ city stadium tour. To say that the pressure was intense is putting it mildly.

What's worse is that as I began raising more and more concerns about the message we were expected to deliver (to kids no less) the tactics of ministry leaders to ""keep me in line"" became extreme. I was forced to work for days on end, getting no sleep for 48+ hours at a time. Then, I would be sent into meetings in a dazed and confused stupor to be told about God's expectations for my performance. My questions were met with disappointment and manipulative please to not ""betray"" someone who felt like a father to me, etc. etc.

The net result of my experiences at this ministry is that I've been dealing with PTSD for about five years. Experiencing this ugly side of a faith I thought was literally God's gift to mankind, forced me to take seriously the arguments against it. Once I gave those arguments equal weight, they easily made an undeniable case for the pernicious lie that religion is.

Which brings me to why I created this post. I haven't spoken out against that ministry or Christianity in an open public forum until now because I felt like they would have an easy ad hominem attack that would discredit me: ""look how crazy he is, you can't take his claims seriously because obviously he has mental problems.""

However, I feel that I've made enough progress towards mental and physical health at this point to engage the topic meaningfully. I want to take time now--as someone familiar with both sides of the fundamentalist vs atheist/secular worldview--to discuss or answer questions people might want to ask someone with my particular life experience.

tl;dr--I used to be in a crazy Christian cult that brainwashes kids. At the time I wrote a lot of their material, perpetuating the cycle of brainwashing. I'm now an atheist who would like to speak up about the dangers of religion. Let's talk!"
1okyrl,3,2013-10-16,Sudden day care problems!,_Smashley_,Mommit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1okyrl/sudden_day_care_problems/,"I am a substitute teacher, so finding day care for my 22 month old was a nightmare since I need day-to-day rates and drop in care.  We finally found a place that is run by a pair of sisters-in-law in one of their homes.  They are nice, it's clean, and they're willing to take her at last minute notice.  A couple weeks ago, dad would drop her off and she was fine.  She said bye and went to playing.  She took naps for them without a problem and seemed to enjoy going. 

All of a sudden she hates it.  She went 4 days last week and threw a fit the last two days.  One day, she even made herself throw up and dad ended up going and picking her up.  They have said she has been crankier than normal and whiney throughout the day, recently.  I thought she might be sick last week, but it happened again today and she doesn't seem to be sick at all.      

The problem is I don't *have* to work and am not really even making any money from it.  I was hoping it may lead to a long-term position and thought it would be good for her to interact with other kids, too.  I do, however, have a month-ish long internship coming up in January for grad school that I have to do to graduate.  During that time, she will be at day care everyday so it's basically inevitable that she goes.  

I don't know what to do.  Do we keep sending her to daycare where she seems to be miserable?  What can I do to make it easier on her?  Why might she all of a sudden be freaking out?! "

At the midpoint, I currently have a C in the class. I'll work my ass off and hopefully do well on the final, but even then, the best I can probably pull of is a B-. 

The other part of the equation is that I just had an office visit for a Tax internship and I LOVED the office/people and I thought it all went well. If I do receive an offer, I will most likely accept it. 

Now here comes the main question, should I stay in this tax class and try to salvage a B-? Or should I take the WP (doesn't affect GPA) and try hard to get an A next semester? I currently have a 4.0 Accounting GPA so getting a low B would affect that significantly, but I feel like a WP in Tax I would look terrible when trying to get a Tax internship. I feel like that would get my offer rescinded. Do firms (this is a National firm) normally ask for transcipts? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!"
1okuwl,7,2013-10-16,My 3rd DUI saved my life,syounit,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/1okuwl/my_3rd_dui_saved_my_life/,"I am 26 years old, and I have been drinking for 13 years on and off. I could always drink more than everybody else and I didn't really care to know why until I got my 2nd DUI in 2007. After that I was forced into recovery programs that I didn't want to be in. I met some incredible people, but i already knew that my drinking wasn't over yet at that point, bc thats what i had in my head. This is also the time I lived in a halfway house and met my friend Ali who was charged with a DUI homicide (her passenger who was an alcoholic passed). She helped me out so much back in 2007 and within the first week I knew I was going to be friends with her for the rest of my life. After I got out of jail she was sentenced and went away for awhile. For the next 6 and a half years I took drinking head on and went through a journey that showed me why I am an alcoholic. I can't even tell you how many times I tried to quit drinking by myself over that time period, but it was so many times. I met my current GF back in 2009 and told her right away that I had a serious alcohol problem, and she said we can figure it out. Most of my attempts to stop have been while I have been with her. I've also learned that you cannot stay sober for somebody else. It sounds stupid but it just doesn't work, your alcoholism will convince you that the person you love is trying to ruin your life. Its disgusting. I put that girl through a world of pain with my alcoholism (emotional and mental pain, not physical). She drinks sometimes, and we have drank together, but I always take it to the next level. I always end up ""transforming into the monster"" as she calls me. We enjoyed drinking together at first, but as time passed, she began to hate me when i drank, and eventually she just wouldn't drink anymore because she didn't want to encourage my drinking, but that wouldn't stop me. I got so drunk on new years of 2011 that when we came home that night and got into a fight, i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife, and handed it over to her and said, ""why don't you go ahead and kill yourself because nobody cares about you, not me, not your parents, not anyone."" She was incredibly upset the next day and I didn't know why until she told me, I didn't have any recollection of that happening and I still do not. This is the point where I started to fear my drinking, or I should say fear myself when I drank. Was I becoming dangerous or was I just completely selling my soul to alcohol? This is the time that I started to experience longer and heightened periods of anxiety and depression after drinking. By this time I stopped going to see my friend Ali and had surrounded myself by people who were alcoholics, but had worse situations than myself, which allowed me to justify my own drinking. I took care of my grandfather during this time because he was starting to have problems staying home alone at home and what not. My drinking still came first, but I did my best to take care of my papa, but even in his last days of being able to talk clearly, he still told me that my alcoholism was bad. He told me that he was happy my grandma died when she did back in 2005, because if she saw me today, it would kill her, because I was her favorite grandson with so much potential, and I was throwing it all away with alcohol. Eventually he needed more care than I could provide. I had been struggling with school because of my alcoholism, and it had almost cost me my relationship countless times. The one thing I can say though is that I have never cheated on my gf while intoxicated, or ever, i have never wanted to bc i knew what it took for her to put up with my shit. My family has helped me out through my troubled times, and have hoped for me to figure out my own plan for sobriety, but it hasn't happened up until recently. I went to detox after begging my dad to send me there because it came to a point that I physically couldn't stop drinking otherwise I would withdrawal. After I went through detox I kept myself sober by not drinking at all. That lasted for about 5 months until I decided to drink again. I didn't go to meetings or anything and told myself that all it took was my willpower. Eventually I gave into the screaming voice in my head to drink again. I remember that drink too, it was a Pacifico on tap with a lime at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Vegas. As I drank the beer, I remember how satisfied I felt to finally soothe that voice and how defeated and helpless I felt at the same time. As it had before after my periods of brief sobriety, my drinking picked up right where it left off. I tried to control myself as much as I could, my girlfriend and I even had a few times drinking together where we got along, this had not happened in years. This reinforced the thought that I was in complete control and that I was finally a normal drinker again, but sadly I was only fooling myself. For all the times I kept myself reserved around my girlfriend while drinking, I just hit it that much harder when she wasn't around. I began to lie again, hide my drinking, and fall into an endless pit of anxiety and depression. In the weeks leading up to my DUI, I finally saw my alcoholism for what it was. I wasn't able to function normally before that, but I had finally progressed to the point where I was able to maintain going to school, excelling at my internship, and maintain a normal sleeping schedule. I had become a fully functional alcoholic and my sickness was exponentially degrading me as a human being, finally taking the bigger piece of myself away from me and leaving me more and more empty everyday. Relief finally came when I received my DUI. Finally I am forced to stay sober by having a monitoring bracelet, going to AA meetings, and going to counseling. Im facing harsh penalties, but thats okay. I've committed a crime and I accept that. I will go to jail and pay hefty fines, but I accept that. Today I can look at myself in the mirror and feel some control again. I can tell people that I am an alcoholic and I know and believe it with everything in me. I know now that I cannot do this on my own, and the people at AA are going to help me stay sober so long as I continue to go and want it bad enough. Drinking is no longer an option for me, because it is more than just a DUI next time. It will cost me everything, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, my job, my future, and most of all I will loose myself entirely. My demon haunts me everyday but I am not longer willing to give into its demands. I am going to fight for my sobriety, and everybody is helping me now, and I am finally willing to accept it. My friend Ali has been sober for 6.5 years and she took me to my first AA meeting since my dui and i have never felt better. I am lucky to have the support of everybody around me, and I now realize my sobriety depends on who I surround myself with, how I live my life, and most importantly the maintenance and preventative measures I take (AA) to prevent a relapse. I realize that it essentially comes down to the point where I have the choice to take that first drink, and today I am doing everything I can to prepare myself to say no when and where that situation arises. If your an alcoholic, you can do it too. Living in active alcoholism is the equivalent to living in hell on earth. I don't believe there is a God, I believe in myself and everyone around me. If you think AA is just about God, your sadly mistaken. I am finally free from alcohols strong grasp for the first time in years, and I cannot wait to continue on my journey. Theres nothing wrong with admitting to being weak and meaning it, because only then you can begin to heal. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to all the people that are in recovery, may everyday be better than the last. To those of you that are still stuck in the midst of your addiction, just remember that help is always out there, weather it be AA, rehab, or whatever else. Never give up because it is 100% possible for you to beat this, it all depends on what you want, if you can accept it, and what your going to do to free yourself."

""Eight years ago, I was an intern for a sports writer, covering my first Knicks game. There's an area at MSG where the celeb fans go after the game if they are willing to give an interview. There were two that night: New York Jet Keyshawn Johnson, and Hanging With Mr. Cooper star Mark Curry. 

I approached Johnson and asked him politely for an interview. He replied 'nah, kid. I'm good.' 

I was crestfallen. My first attempt at a big interview and I was shot down and belittled. By someone who was standing in the interview area! So I sheepishly approached Curry - and he couldn't have been more kind, classy, and helpful. He was awesome and engaging, and I was able to write a great story.

There are two lessons to take from this story. One, be nice to everyone - you never know who will be introducing you 8 years later. Two, Keyshawn Johnson is a dick.

1okj7x,19,2013-10-16,Not sure if marijuana is alleviating or causing my anxiety.,[deleted],Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1okj7x/not_sure_if_marijuana_is_alleviating_or_causing/,"I'd like to preface by saying that prior to consuming cannabis I was already suffering from social anxiety and nervousness. Without marijuana it was really easy to fake pretend being myself and essentially be an actor throughout high school to fit in.

Weed flipped a switch I guess and made me see how stupid I looked objectively (e.g wearing trendy clothes, listening to shitty rap...ugh). I stopped pretending and started being the real me.

So from then on I smoked marijuana daily and pretty much until now because it seemed to resonate with my energy. It's been 3 years and I probably haven't gone a week without a smoke. That said, its never caused me to go into full blown panic mode. Instead, it acutely increases my awareness to the point where I start seeing myself objectively, which in turn leads anxiety in social situations. You see, I am a guy with pretty bad cystic acne who has tried everything short of accutane. Marijuana makes me realize that people can probably notice I covered my red gashes in concealer, which is like my biggest secret as a guy. Ultimately, its not the weed that causes my anxiety, its the heightened awareness that makes me see im pretty hideous and look unhealthy (due to cysts) despite drinking only water and eating more healthy than my friends. 

Anywho...I'm pretty tired of this awareness. It drains me so much to the point where currently socializing once a month is more than enough for me.

I kind of want to not care about my appearance anymore. I dont want to notice people from 100 yards and go into defense mode. I just want to excel at my internship without feeling like I am being watched, or ridiculed, or thinking I spoke way too loud because I was nervous. My brain is tired from overdrive mode.

Conversely, marijuana makes me feel good and alleviates my back pain after a day at work. It also stimulates my appetite and makes me happy to play with my pets.

Im at a crossroads with cannabis, Druggit. I've been considering trying Xanax for work days or something."

I poke around for about a minute.  After a minute if I haven't figured out the issue I put them on hold for up to 10 minutes.

1okf7d,5,2013-10-16,I just don't know anymore.,Bcadren,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1okf7d/i_just_dont_know_anymore/,"I can just plain warn people ahead of time; this is going to be long and vulgar for a little bit.

I am a game designer; I am an artist; I am a programmer; I am a performer.

 I am driven by the desire to bring meaningful change to the world through my artistic medium; to innovate within the medium; to paint and I've see in my dreams; and moreover to make lasting works that people will enjoy and remember me for.

I've seen myself that way for at least the last six years. I went to traditional 4-year college to better prepare myself to go out and do it. And, what I want most is to succeed as an independent, either completely by myself or with a small team.

But...I've never really finished anything. I have to levels that were satisfactory to my professors in school; but never to my own levels and more importantly, never to a level that I could actually go out and publish and have people play the game. And, for the last few months, I feel like I've completely lost my way.

See, honestly, I'm most the way through the program; finished upper level credit and literally -just- need an internship to finish; but I haven't found that. Honestly, this is out of not really putting all of my best foot forward and I'm aware of that. See after I finished everything; I ended up stuck back with my parents and the plan was over the course of a few weeks to a month I'd get what I have at least presentable to the public and set up a nice portfolio online in order to get something. What actually happened was after about three weeks of being out here my self-esteem had eroded enough that I never finished the portfolio and all I could manage were some really half-assed attempts to get some attention.

I do want an internship; especially in something that isn't currently my strong suit, like network programming; but I'm not a lifer, I don't want to be tied to a company for a very long time. I just want to be trained well enough so that my general education of all things game is enough for me to be able to be autonomous, should the need arise.

The real problem arises in my lack of support. You see; since I've been out here with parents; which are literally the only people in the world I'm not comfortable talking to, I haven't had anyone to give me direct feedback on the updates to/creation of a more complete portfolio and more importantly; I haven't had a social life in the slightest. See we live in...well, the complete middle of nowhere and since the middle of high school; I've gotten some level of cabin fever or depression during summers; due to the lack of human contact outside of my parents. 
Then as soon as I stopped working; which happened about twelve weeks ago, now. I just got completely stuck in this loop of ""I'm depressed because I'm not working."" followed by ""I can't manage to concentrate, because the depression is getting to me."", eventually snowballing into ""what exactly is the point of working anymore? I never get anything done and even if I did i have no idea if it'd make money or anyone would even care. Besides, I'm by myself and one person can't possibly make a game worth playing without some help and support."" which now with the additional stress of the student loans entering their repayment period turned into ""What's the point of doing anything; I'll never make the money to get out of this debt; I'm a worthless sack of compost and I wasted my parents money and I'm too shy around them to even talk to them about this.""

I think about potentially getting some kind of scab job; just something shitty in order to try to not default on the loan or something; but then I realize that it's only going to make it worse. It'd turn into ""I went to college to get into debt and work a shit job I could have gotten even if I fucking dropped out of high school.""

I used to have ideas; I used to have faith that something I could make even completely by myself could be relevant and enjoyed by thousands of people. Now, I can't even fucking manage to work for an hour without thinking 'what the fuck is the point, anymore?""

I have such a huge collection of ideas and projects that were done enough for school but halfdone or less as far as actually publishing goes and hell most of those, I'd need considerable seed money to pay for licenses in order to legally publish.

Occasionally for a few minutes to hours; I'll start sounding like my old self. Say I'll put out a free prototype and we'll get a kickstarter up to pay for the costs of actually publishing for profit and see how it goes; but the feeling is too damn fleeting for me to actually get shit done. I start delving back at the last point I was intelligently working on the project and maybe add a few more lines of code before going crisis again.

The situation lead to a game addiction for a bit. Playing video game, less to enjoy the game or study how it was made and more just for the escapism; to try to stop thinking about the rest of the world at all. But, it's getting so bad that I've lost the ability to emotionally hide in that anymore.

As I said earlier, my parents are very literally the only people I'm not really comfortable talking to about this. Honestly, I'm not quite sure as to why. I suppose it's because judging by the menial labor job my dad still has in his 50's and the obvious toll that it's taken on his body it feels like they've given up so much over me and given how content they are in the middle of nowhere; I don't think they'd understand how much the isolation afflicts me anyways. Every time I make an attempt to talk I wind up watching television. This isn't even really me hiding from talking in the television; this comes from the fact that when my father isn't working he's watching tv. He stays too tired to do much else and I, not really being able to talk to him, but wanting some form of emotional support, usually wind up joining.

I don't hate them; I have never really had much against them; I just -can't- manage to talk to them.

My Myer-Briggs type is ENTP, often described as 'the inventor' or 'the visionary'. At the beginning of my last semester. I took off on a journey to try to bring one of my weirder ideas to a reality. It's probably too technical for a lot of people and I like to keep my ideas secret so I won't say what exactly. I had a less than productive relationship with my adviser and never really finished what I was trying to do. On some level I feel like I owe it to myself and the school (since I did go through an undergraduate grant program) to make more prototypes (I have since had a completely different idea; that I never tried during that period; that in theory would accomplish the same thing), but honestly, every time I even start it goes back to the same thing; though even worse than the games. I -don't know- if this will work. I -don't know- that anyone would care or use it if I made it. I -don't know- if I could make any money off the technology. All I really do know is putting myself on 80-hour work weeks I'd be looking at 6-8 weeks of work, minimum...and then that's a prototype and I'd really need experts from multiple other fields to finish it. 

My self esteem and faith in my design is too low to take that path. It's just that way with everything right now. I feel like shit; the designs in my notebooks are shit; even if they did work no one would care. What it boils down to is; I only stay confident in my ideas when other people are confident in my ideas. I'm really strong at pitching things in person; but I need someone else there with me who trusts in my idea in order to really push it forward and...Out here my support is very limited to non-existent. There's just so much I have half done; though that one seems like it will remain the most important to me. 

What's really pathetic though is on the basic level; the stuff that should just be sprucing up a portfolio, should have taken a hours to days to do and I've been unable to touch for months.

I feel like I'm repeating myself now and I'm sorry.

I could talk about relationships and my past; but honestly, it's not that much of a concern right now and 'lack of dating' is very implicitly true in 'middle of nowhere' with little to no social contact. Thank you to anyone who made it this far. It's honestly helped just to bloody get it out. The only way it even comes out is times spent looking at acquaintance's FaceBook pages, wondering if my life would be different if I was in a relationship with them and started that earlier in my life. But, that's an irrelevant regret and I'm aware of that. Such thoughts only really show that I'm so currently devoid of hope that I look to hopes I could have once had in the past."
1ok3mh,6,2013-10-16,My Paranormal story (Clock),Tip14,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ok3mh/my_paranormal_story_clock/,"Here is a story for all the paranormal reddit people out there. First off if you don't believe it I don't care at all... There are going to parts in this story where I use (...) to explain the situation or provide detail. I am not a great lit / writing person so I am just doing the best I can to explain things, and hope that it makes sense in the end. Overall I am just posting my story no more no less. I am not seeking pity or glory. I am just posting the facts about what happened to me, and hopefully I can give some sort of advice to anyone else who has experienced this type of situation. 

(STORY)

When I was around the age of 14 my mother (whom was adopted) happened to inherit a rather ordinary clock passed down from my grandfather. My grandfather bought the clock from a yard sell 5 years before his passing. The clock sat upon his mantle for years after he purchased it, but sometime after the purchase the clock stopped working, and it was set there as pure decoration. Anyway my grandfather died of a heart attack which were deemed natural as he had already had a stroke before. My mother was upset as one would be, but after a while the heart ache died down. 

Anyway my mother went through the estate divided up all the belongs between sisters etc, and thought that having the clock would be a great piece to remember her adoptive dad by. Not long after the clock was in my mothers possession strange things began to happen around our home. It started as just simple things. For one the clock would suddenly chime around 3am (despite the fact there were no batteries in it, and it had not worked for years). This was just minor compared to what happened next. This went on for a couple of weeks, and despite the high strangest about it we just shrugged it off. After a while my mother started to complain about a presence in her room / home that seemed as if it was watching her, or was trying to do her harm. 

My mother immediately took the clock of the mantle and put it in a storage compound a few miles down the road. All paranormal activities stopped etc after the clock was removed (but for the recored if there was more going on I had no idea of it as my mother only told me these few things once I was older). Anyway fast forward several years. I was junior in college and my other passed away at the age of 45. She died of CHF (Congestive heart failure) when I was 22 (I started college late so the ages do not match up) Being the oldest of 3 brother, and the main executer of the estate I was charged with gathering all my mother's possession and bringing them back to where I lived, and then going through them (My mother had moved to Pikeville NC when I was in college, and was staying with her boyfriend, I lived in Kannapolis NC at the time, and was doing my internship for school while staying with my grandparents). So I went to Pikeville and gathered all my mother things (cars, jewelry, china, clothes etc). 

I took them back with me to my current home and only home now (my brother came with me, but my step brother went home to his real dad which my mother was in the process of divorcing). 

Form this point on of this story my brothers will be renamed so they do not warranty any attention. My brother that is blood related will be named J, and my step brother N, also my friend will be named P. 

When I went through a pile of papers my mother had I found a bill detailing a storage unit she had in Kannapolis (where i lived) she was behind on the payments, and the owner of the storage unit was going to lock it off, and sell the items inside. I thought that it would be a good idea to get to the unit and remove what was inside before all this happened. So I went to the lot smoothed things over with the owner and retrieved the items. When I first opened the door to the lot there were cobwebs every where. It looked as if no one had opened it in ages. I rummaged though all the items and retrieved what I thought were important items. I found the clock amongst the items and threw it all into the car I had, and took them back to my grandparents place. 

The clock was then placed in the basement (which me and brother now lived) at my grandparents house. Not long after the clock's arrival it would do the same thing it did before which is ding at 3am. I inspected the clock, and found that there were no batteries inside, and that the clock was fully non operational. Me and my brother J determined that it was strange what was happening, but it wasn't a big deal, and continued on with our lives. Shortly after (maybe 2 weeks) me and my brother had some strange experiences. 

First off my brother slept upstairs in a room that was empty at my grandparents. I slept downstairs in the basement with the clock because it was the only room left available. At random times when you where in the basement it felt as if something was watching you. Me and my brother J along with P felt it. We would occasionally stay downstairs, and play BO1 till late hours of the night, and well all felt this strange presence. After everyone left I would go to sleep on the bed that was in the basement. 

Sometimes I could feel this presence as I went to sleep, but being the person I am I just threw it off as being paranoid, or stupid so I would go to sleep. One night I went to bed as usual and during my sleep I saw the door to the downstairs bathroom open, and then violently shut. It scared the crap out of me multiple times, so I decide to start sleeping upstairs with my brother. On other occasions (and much more common) me my brother J, and friend P would hear footsteps echoing above us in the upstairs this freaked us out also. I remember asking my grandparents multiple times if they where awake at 3am, and were walking upstairs. 

They both said no, and it made me and my brother scared. So after several weeks of dealing with the door slams, and the footsteps we took the clock, and all my mothers belongings to a storage place he had. All the paranormal activity stopped the next day. We had moved all the items of my mother along with the clock to the storage unit. 

(5 months ago)

Fast forward to the present day. One day my Uncle called, and said that we needed to remove the items from storage, as the area we had them stored was for sale, and he needed the items out for the future owners. I was married then and I had just gotten a new home in Concord NC with my wife. Me and my Uncle never had a good relationship to begin with, and so removing the items from his storage was just a way to keep things peaceful. So me and my wife, and my father law went to the storage area and removed all the items. The clock was one of the times. 

We stored all the the things inside our garage. The strange thing began to happen the moment we brought the clock home with us. The first thing was that my dog (mini pin) would not go near the clock. She hated it barked at it any chance she got. Even when it was stored in the garage she would sit beside the door in a aggressive stance as if someone, or something was outside our home. This was rather unusual the dog never was aggressive towards anything or anyone since we had it. 

We decided that it was merely because the items stored in the garage had a strange sent she did not know. A week after having the clock it would ding again like it did before at 3am. Since it was in the garage I could barely hear it, but it was loud enough that one night I noticed it. Once agin this scared the hell out of me, and my wife as we had no idea what was going on. Weeks later the same feeling I had before came again. 

Me and my wife both felt as if something was watching us. We felt it during the day, and night. It was a constant feeling as if something was in our home. We had no idea what was going on. We were scared, and at that point I HAD to tell my wife the story behind the clock. 

She was at first doubtful, and worried that we had some how let something in our home we couldn't deal with so I promised her that after the end of the week if things did not get better we would remove the clock, and attempt to destroy it. Well before the week was out it got to the point we couldn't wait. I was sleeping one night and I felt this weird presences that someone was watching me. I couldn't put it on my mind what, but I knew something was in our bedroom, and wanted ME. All of the sudden I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move, or do anything at all. I was half way asleep, but awake fully in my mind (I can't explain this) so doing the only thing I could do I prayed. I tried to utter the name of Jesus multiple times, but my mouth just trembled. After multiple minutes of being in this state I finally was able to utter the words of ""Jesus help me!"" immediately my wife woke up, and the paralyzing effects stopped.

I was free! Whatever tried to attack me had fled, and I was now able to move, and talk with my wife. We were scared, and hurt. We had no idea what was going on, but we both knew what we had to do. The next day I put the item up for sale on ebay. It was my hope that the item would be sold to someone that could handle whatever was attached to this clock. We knew the clock was the item behind all the events going on in our home. So to make a long story shorter I sold the item on ebay for the grand sum of $10, and attached a note for the seller detailing the story, and events behind it. Below you will find the note I sent to the buyer.

(Note)

Dear Buyer,

First off I would like to thank you for purchasing this clock from me, and my family. This clock has been a burden to me, and my family for sometime. Although I do not outright believe in the paranormal there is indeed something not right about this clock. Please whatever you do with this item be careful, and I hope the things that have bothered me, and my family will not bother you.  In the box you will find the clock, and the broken part that goes inside it. I’m sorry for not cleaning it, but I felt it would be best to leave it as it is because I do not like being near or touching it much. 
As a word of caution remember that in my auction I said that I will not accept returns, or will not take the clock back it is now YOURS, and whatever comes with it. I will say that I will if you have any questions I will do my best to help you if you feel so inclined below you will find my email address as well as phone number please contact me via email first rather than phone, as I usually do not have my phone with me. I would also like to point out that if you are a paranormal investigator, or something of that nature I do not want to be part of an investigation. Please do not contact me with those requests. I will however answer questions if needed be, but my family and me want no fame, or interest from this clock.  We are just happy it is out of our possession. 

PS: As I stated in the auction I did not guarantee that you would experience paranormal activity from purchasing this clock. If you haven’t then I’m sorry, but please do not file complaints, or false advertising about the clock as I do from time to time sell items on ebay and I care about my reputation. Once again I hope that with this clock you find whatever it is your looking for, or whatever experience you are hoping to have.

Sincerely,
The Tipton Family

(PS)

So there is my story it maybe strange, and it my seem unlikely, but it is MY story. I hope that anyone who reads this will be able to cop with the paranormal. There are strange things that happen in this world there are things that we do not fully understand my hope is that one day someone comes across this posting, and can re assured that there is a way out, and you can with faith remove whatever is haunting you with a strong faith in God, and Jesus. 

Sincerely, 
Tip14

1ojw2f,5,2013-10-15,Chem Grad School Advice Needed,DeltaZeta9,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1ojw2f/chem_grad_school_advice_needed/,"I am struggling with the decision to attend grad school and would greatly appreciate any words of advice from current students, prospective students, or alumni. Here is where I stand:

* 5th year undergrad, Specialization Program (finished April 2014)
* Completed Industrial Internship in Analytical Chem (Oil and Gas)
* Interested in nanoscience, alternative energy, oil and gas, materials chemistry.
* GPA ~ 3.6

However, there are a few things I must also consider: 

* I'm 24
* I have a guaranteed job with my internship company when I'm finished. Currently working there part time.
* My GF also works there (graduated April 2012, BSc Biology)
* She wants to move our relationship forward. AKA move in together, make money, house, pets, etc.
* Few chem PhD positions within company.
* Do not want to stay in academia long term. Industry is favourable.


So I ask: Would it be more beneficial to go on to grad school (MSc or PhD), delay starting my life, miss out on 3-5 yrs of wages, put off our future in order to secure a better life later?

Or

Stay with the company, continue to be promoted (cannot reach PhD ceiling), obtain P.Chem, start life and enjoy more freedoms while I'm young?"

1oogy8,5,2013-10-17,[FR] Having some confidence is awesome.,Fender1310,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1oogy8/fr_having_some_confidence_is_awesome/,"Hello guys,

Let me preface this by saying that before I knew seddit I did not know shit about anything in life, at all. Reading everything up here, getting it confirmed by friends made me rethink how I act around people, not only girls, in general. Seddit turned my life to the better.

Let's get started now.

I work in a small fries stand in a mall and I regularly meet girls and we talk to them (my co-worker) and we occasionally get numbers. By we, I actually mean him, he gets numbers. Applying my knowledge from here and copying him I landed a few numbers as well.
The first thing I noticed was that Eye Contact **is so extremely important!**
I cannot stress enough how much differently girls look at me when I look them in the eyes the whole time while they order. Some are in awe that I can operate the register while smiling at me, others just like my smile and small talk.

However, I never built upon that, quite the contrary always occured. My co-worker always took the initiative and told a few nice one liners and got the numbers. He did it just for fun though, as he has a gilfriend already. He always tells me that this is the way to learn and honestly, he is right. Getting rejected is the way to learn, getting your ""numbers"" stolen teaches you how to get them yourself, the best way possible. I finally build upon this.


One day a group of girls comes by and one of them is especially talkative. My co-worker was not there at that time and I striked up a nice chat. She was clearly into me and she left without anything happening. The next day she came with a friend and I was just chilling at work, not actually working (I have nothing better to do, anyway). She recognized me and we all talked and I just went for it. She talked about doing an internship at the stand but it was just for the sake of talking.

I told her, ""Write in your number"", and she did.

I felt fucking amazing.

What followed was 2 hours talking with her and her friend. Her friend wanted to leave but she (lets call her Agnes) did not want to. In the end they did but she did promise to come by again tomorrow. That day I actually worked and she came 20 minutes before closing down. We started to chat again and my co-worker described me as being very aggressive, confident but not quite arrogant. He told me that I really showed what I wanted early on by telling her that I want to go to her place. I told her she should stay till I am done with work and we drive to her place. She shyly told me that her bus was coming too early and that she wanted to leave. After all she stayed and we went to the bus stop together. Me, Agnes and my co-worker waited and I talked on with her. 

At this point I realized that I need to escalate or else I fail. She did not mind me touching her back, so I pulled her by her hip closer to myself. 

My Co-Worker saw that she was quite hesitant and what he did next was awesome and I love him for it. He became the most awesome wingman ever.

He calmly said: ""Look, Agnes, our bus is coming and you obviously want him and he wants you, kiss him and get it over already""

At that moment he left for the bus and I grabbed Agnes by her hip, pulled her into mine and she went for a hug. I was devastated as my co-worker watched me from behind and gestured me to go for it.

I pushed her a tiny bit back and looked her in her eyes. At that moment I neared for her lips but she still hesitated. I boldly said: ""Yes, or No?"" and we kissed. She asked: ""Happy now?"" and I just left with a smile.

I still drove with my co-worker and he was proud of me. I am proud of myself.


Seddit, I never thought the day would come that I could use what I learned from here, but it came and I am more than happy. This is just the step in the right direction.


Thank you seddit, thank you for everything."
1oobig,9,2013-10-17,"I've [21M] been seeing someone who is way too young (16f) for me for last four months. Is it possible that it works out, or should I just end it?",ThisIsTrouble,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oobig/ive_21m_been_seeing_someone_who_is_way_too_young/,"I'm going to change some minor details like names/locations for privacy (and am using a throwaway account for that reason). This really isn't an issue I can go to people I trust IRL over, so I'm here. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, and I appreciate the time anyone puts into reading it. 

This June, I met someone during a pool party. I was at a friends' place and they were throwing a pool party and his friend's younger sister had some friends over too. Somehow, I ended up talking to one of the sister's friends for a long time and we exchanged numbers. I knew that she was younger than me, and I still talked to her and flirted with her. So that is completely, 100% on me. I don't know what it says about me. 

She texted me later that night, and we fell into this amazing, easy conversation. It was just so much fun talking to her, and she was so smart and cool and funny. That first night, we were texting until something like 5AM. The next few days were pretty similar, and we got to know each other really, really well. I asked her out about a week after we started texting, and we just went to a movie and had ice-cream after. We didn't do anything beyond holding hands. 

We had a really good time, even though the movie wasn't that great (The Bling Ring fwiw). I immediately had regrets and second thoughts, and became super worried about her age. I'm 21 and a University Junior, and she is 16 now, but was 15 when we first met. Which is super, super young. I don't really have a defense. I knew how old she was, and that she was too young when I met her. Its just that she is so, so fucking pretty and then has this amazing personality, that I lost track. I did wise up after that first date, and just stopped talking to her because I realized this was really, really stupid and I was falling for her. 

The not talking lasted like 4 days, until I gave in and answered her texts. She was telling me that it was really not nice for me to just drop off after telling her that I really liked her, and I started to feel guilty. That led to us going back to texting, and then calls every night. She wanted to meet up, and I avoided it for like two weeks. Kept making excuses, because I was aware of my feelings for her, and like the right/wrong thing to do. 

I just also want to say this, because it might seem like I'm an awful person reading this. I've never messed around with anyone around Emily's age before. At all. I'm also (normally) smart. I go to a top-ten university for undergrad. I've had great internships, I volunteer, etc. The point is I'm not a shit-head who hits on underaged girls normally. 

To kind of speed this up, later in June, Emily and I met up again. We had a fun date, and then fooled around. We didn't have sex then. After that point, though we were spending all of our free time together, and a couple weeks later we did have sex. It was the day after her birthday, so she was 16, if that makes it any better. The rest of the summer was just so much fun, and we were both really, really happy. We had to keep things kind of a secret because of the age thing, and that kind of made us grow closer to one another. Like an us v. everyone else feeling. We both said I love you to one another, and the relationship was really, really serious. 

I went back to school in September, and we had a really emotional, going away talk, where we both were crying, and we agreed to just see where things go. I'm in school about a three hour flight away from her, so it isn't like we can see each other regularly. We've been talking every single day, and she had her parents fly her out here a couple weeks ago, under the guise of wanting to visit my undergrad and see a friend. We had an amazing weekend, and then the same really difficult saying bye deal. 

At first, I did have a lot of regrets and guilt about the age thing. Its technically not legal, but from what I understand not a felony, and not really enforced. But it is still possible that something could go wrong. I'm also 5 years older than her and she is in high school. It should be weird. I just love her more than I've ever loved anyone before, and I know she feels the same way about me. It is just so perfect when we are together. I don't want to give up on that. 

I haven't really tried to pursue anything with anyone else, and for all intents and purposes we are in a long distance relationship. I'm not a fool, and I think the odds are stacked against us staying together. Its like a very, very low chance it works out. I'm going to be studying abroad in London starting in January, and I've been feeling like us calling things off before might be the best bet. It is probably fair to her in that it'll let her be a normal girl in high school, and not like juggling a long-distance relationship with some older guy and it'll let me experience studying abroad fully. I just don't want to have regrets and end up losing her, when she is seriously nearly perfect for me. We just get one another so well, and I don't think I'll find that with just anyone. And I know breaking up with her, would break her heart. She depends on me for so much, and she loves me so much too. So I don't know. 

I just want some guidance and advice from people that have been through something similar. Hopefully, people can look beyond just the ages and ugggh. Thanks for reading this fully if you finished the entire post. 

**tl;dr I (21m) met a girl (16f) over the summer, who I knew was too young for me. We hit it off though, and started to talk a lot, and just fit so well together. I tried ending things, but ended up still talking to her. We had an intense summer romance, and have been essentially dating since then after I went back to University. I'm going to study abroad next semester, and have been thinking that calling things off might be a good idea, but don't know if it is or isn't.** "

1onwts,2,2013-10-17,Review Coming Up...Could Use Some Advice,Neo_Unicorn,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1onwts/review_coming_upcould_use_some_advice/,"I've been with my company for 7 years...6 as an independent contractor, and the last year as a full-time employee. I'm the only designer and handle a large volume of work with quick turnaround (about 100+ ads and 5-6 postcards/flyers a month).

I'm being paid about $5,000 less than the low end of the most recent salary survey by The Creative Group for my position. I get no health benefits, and no 401K. I have 5 vacation days a year. Sick days are not specified, but after a 3 day hospital stay a few weeks ago for anxiety issues (which the boss knew about), I had to be back at work within 2 days because the printer deadline was that week.

To say I'm feeling burned out is an understatement. But employment opportunities are low in my area for graphic design, and I have to work since my spouse cannot (disabled). 

My boss is a good guy.  He took me on full-time when my spouse lost his job due to the disability, which I am grateful for. He started this company by himself out of high school. I came aboard about 10 years into it, and it has really expanded since then. But he tries to part with as little money as he can. He is slowly becoming a little more open with his spending (we finally got a water cooler and a keurig machine).  He bought me a laptop so I could work remotely, but seldom lets me do so (Maybe twice a month).

 I do know the revenue of this business, with only 4 employees, is between 500,000 and 1 million a year, but am not sure of all the expenses.

I've told him I'm at my capacity for workload, and his solution is to find a local college kid who wants an unpaid internship :-(

SO, going into my review next week...I want to stress to him how important it is for him to compensate me more, get me some PAID help, more vacation times, perhaps a stipend for health bills (which have cost my family well in the thousands), ect. I'm starting to earnestly look around for other work, and have 3 irons in the fire right now (which is rare, like I said). Should I outright tell him I'm looking for other employment? I'm afraid he will see that as a threat and not take kindly to that. But he will lose me if things don't change. I know he values my work, and tells me so verbally, but financially, not so much.

tl;dr - review coming up, burned out - should I tell boss I'm ready to leave company if changes aren't made?"
1onpzm,2,2013-10-17,I have 3+ years experience and CIS degree. Should I get A+ before N+?,awesomface,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1onpzm/i_have_3_years_experience_and_cis_degree_should_i/,"So I had a random question. I did 5 years in the Marine Corps and went to school immediately afterward. For the last 2 years of my 3 at school, I worked 30+ hours a week at a small online college in IT. That's where I essentially ""popped my cherry"" as my friend was able to get me the job with no experience and that is where I really learned from scratch. Since my friend left almost immediately after, and the other guy there was not helpful, I pretty much had to learn EVERYTHING on my own for the entire office of 90+ people.

After I finished school and got my degree in CIS, I didn't find a job for about 3 months and by then I was in dire need as I have a wife and 2 children (3 now). My iOS developer internship fell through as the company was too small and I really wasn't finding success in the analyst positions as they seemed to require internships that mine didn't reflect. I also found those environments to be VERY high stress for my personality so I really didn't focus on them. I finally got a call back from a company that contacted ME originally a month back about desktop support making a nice living. I've now been at the job for over a year and I love it. I'm really finding that I love the IT field in general. I'm really good at it and I love helping the users; i get a good satisfaction from solving problems that other people can't as well.

Anyways, long story short, I have a degree and a couple years experience. I'm extremely capable and certainly well past the level of A+ so I just started studying to get my N+. Since with both of my IT jobs, I've been relied on for WAY more than desktop support (i'm sure many know how that goes) I figure I should get that since i'm already doing a lot of it but really don't have the technical knowledge...just a lot of google and messing around. My question is, does anyone think I should even bother getting my A+? It would certainly require minimal studying as the only real things I would need to study for is stupid technical definitions for things like CPU northbride vs southbridge (I saw a question about that on a practice exam after 10 softballs and was like WTF?). 

I'm really comfortable here and really not worried about my job security, but I know to never get too comfortable as i've seen downsizing happen and it spares NO ONE. I know I'm extremely capable and I would think my experience/degree would be enough but does anyone have any experience as a recruiter/hiring that might be able to alleviate my concerns of not having an A+? I would think if I got my N+ as well, people would realize that I have no need for an A+ but I know sometimes recruiters don't know IT and are looking for the ""checked boxes"".

**TLDR: I have 3+ years of great, legitimate experience in desktop support and general ""all around tech guy"" and a CIS degree. Should I get my A+ just in case or will no one care at that point with my current credentials?**

Edit: The company I currently work for is a fortune 500 company and the office I work at, I manage about 300 users (100 remote). We have a call center downstairs (about 200 people) that I work with a little (resetting vdi's) but we have 2 other techs and remote people that handle that mostly. I am obviously extremely undermanned and have been training one of the downstairs techs to help me with what they can and I have time to train them on. Just thought i'd mention cause it think it helps pad my resume a little more.

1onjc9,25,2013-10-17,Being a bitch/feminist/party-pooper... RANT,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1onjc9/being_a_bitchfeministpartypooper_rant/,"Hey TwoX, hope you are all having a wonderful day :)

So I'm studying in a heavily male-dominated field. The ratio of girls is about 5%. I'm in engineering school and my program is the one with the lowest ratio. I can't wait to finish my degree and do something that (I hope) will be fun every day! My problem is the general attitude with everyone at school (especially in my program). There is so much going on, I don't even know where to start.

One thing that bugs me is how girls are always going to be ""rated"" by the guys, and her level of attractiveness is going to stick with her. ""Maria the hot one"" - ""Karen the cute one"". I understand people can be attracted to others. But what bothers me is that guys are never going to label each other like that. It's going to be ""Karl the one who's really good at math"", ""Paul who got an internship at *awesome place*"". It makes me angry that I'm never going to be ""bee27 who's really smart"".

Second thing that I don't know how to handle. All of our work, except for exams, is mainly group projects. I usually like to be the leader in a group. I like to push people but it seems like if I do so, I will be a bitch.  If I give my opinion and ask the group to debate on it, I'm a bitch. If I am stubborn, I'm a bitch. Sometimes I don't know if I should shut up and be considered ""nice"", of say what I think but be hated by everyone (and possibly, future colleagues).

Lastly ... I don't really hang out with guys from my program. My usual circle of people is from other engineering programs, but there are social events where I interact with these people and I really don't mind, they're usually fun. My problem is their comments. I usually see those on the program's facebook (closed and private) group. Comments about ""hot new girls at school"", ""hot women at this networking event"", ""you should take this class, the teacher is hot"". When I read these, I swear my face gets red and I just want to tell them that these women do not teach or study at our school to be solely judged on their appearance. They are smart women who wish to learn or teach. These comments would not even surface would the person in question be a man. Other times, I hear rape jokes (although pretty rarely) and I also don't speak my mind. I'm extremely sensitive to that, given how ""easy"" it would be for a girl at my school to get drunk and get assaulted by guys at our many parties.

Last thing, one thing that bothers me is that many girls do not seem to be sensitive to all of the things I have mentionned. I sometimes feel like a few of them lose their self-respect in order to be ""liked"". They will take their t-shirt off, let guys do mock sex on them (kind of like miley cyrus and robin thicke lol) for the laughs, ask stupid questions I'm sure they know the answer to (but again I can't know for sure).

TLDR : male dominated study field, afraid of saying what I really think, wish guys would respect girls a bit more, even if there's just a handful of us

Sorry for the long rant. is anyone here in a similar situation?? I'm curious to know what you think :)"

1onbi2,3,2013-10-17,Can someone please give me some advice? I don't feel like I have any hope left for the future.,LunaSeven,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1onbi2/can_someone_please_give_me_some_advice_i_dont/,"This is going to be a long read, so please bear with me...

First of all, I should tell you all what the cause of my depression is. It's not a chemical imbalance, as it is for some people. My depression is caused by my parent's divorce last year. My family was my reason for living, my #1 most important thing in my life, and as necessary to me as food, oxygen and water.

Due to the nature of the divorce, I have had no contact whatsoever with my mother for over a year and a half. I never even had the chance to say good-bye to her. My father just took me home one day from college to his house instead of hers. I cannot reach out to my mother, because I am financially dependent on my father and he would put me out on the street if I had any contact with her. 

So, this situation has destroyed me mentally and emotionally. I love BOTH my mom AND my dad, but I have been forced to remain loyal to my father. I cry every single day for my mother, to see her again, to hug her...and when I am in this state I cannot even get out of bed, feel happy, or anything.

I am a broken person now, unable to hold down a job or pass my classes in school (I'm now on academic warning and am going to have to resign from my internship today).

Therapy DOES NOT HELP. Medication DOES NOT HELP. Belive me, I have tried them both! The only thing that would fix me is if my parents got back together, and I am *fully* aware that will never happen.

The money has run out for my college fund, so come December I will have to find a job. I don't know how I can do that with my condition. I don't know how I can do anything. I literally can't function now that I've lost my family.

I don't even know if you can help me, but thanks for listening to my rant. I just need to vent..."
1omyf1,10,2013-10-17,My ex took my dog,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1omyf1/my_ex_took_my_dog/,"Yeah, so this is kinda messy, and I change tense several times for no reason.

The story begins roughly four years ago.  I had been dating my then girlfriend for about six years.  After working for a small bakery for a few years, she decided she wanted to pursue a career in the pastry arts.  

So, she enrolled in pastry school, which I thought was a bad idea - not because it was an essentially bad idea, but because the timing was bad, and she hadn't really explored any options.  She refused to discuss it, and I didn't press the issue because I didn't want to interfere with her dreams.  The thing is, she enrolled in secret without even telling me the details.  It cost her $50,000.  I mean, we had been living together for five years, and I had no voice in the matter.  Believe me, she had only wanted to do it for like a week, and rushed into it before anything could stop her.  It's how she operates.  She actually could have gone to community college for free.  Plus, the school she went to was shut down for being a scam, but not until after she graduated.

Now, the final part of her education was a three month long internship, which her school called an externship for some reason.  Well, she decided that the best place for her to do her internship was in Naples Florida, which was thousands of miles from where we were living.  Well, she moved down there and signed a one year long lease on an apartment.  I didn't want to move to Naples.  I tried to convince her to do her internship at a small pastry shop in the city we were living in.  The owner was French, and knew his shit.  Anyway, she just brushed my concerns off like they didn't matter, and I didn't press the issue because I didn't want to be a ""controlling boyfriend.""  The thing is, she didn't even discuss it with me.  It was just like ""This is my dream.  I'm moving.  You can come if you want, or...""  but she never said anything about breaking up.

Well, I moved.  She warned me that she'd be working a lot, as though warning me made it okay for her to be working 70-90 hours a week.  No, I don't think that's okay, if you've been in a relationship with someone for six years, without having a serious discussion about it.  She just rushed into it, and all my attempts at communication were disregarded.  I had never been in a relationship before, and I didn't talk to anyone about it, so I just had no clue what was really going on.  I just wanted to be a good boyfriend, and not interfere with her dreams.  And, everything was just *happening*.  It was hard for me to see her in a negative light.

So, I'm down in Naples Florida.  She's at work ALL THE TIME - six or seven days a week, at least ten hours a day, sometimes up to fourteen hours a day.  When she is home, she's too tired to do anything.  I'm working from home.  Naples is a retirement and vacation city.  It's just a huge strip mall.  I'm lonely as fuck - no friends, no idea what to do.  There's nothing there.  I decide to get a dog.  I go with my ex to the shelter.  I pick out our dog.  I pick her up at the shelter and bring her home while my ex is at work.  I take care of her for an entire year, while my ex is at work.  I spend hours at the dog park every day because there is nothing else to do in Naples.  I take her walking for miles every day.

After a year in Naples, my ex decides that pastry isn't for her - gives it up completely.  We move back to our home city, and into a condo where my late grandmother used to live that now belongs to my parents.  They don't charge us rent.  For about six months, my ex doesn't have a job.  I'm still working from home.  So, we both take care of our dog.  My ex does some special training with the dog, so that she can be off leash.  Well, after six months, my ex's workaholism strikes again.  She gets another job where she can spend all her time.  I'm not exaggerating.  It got to the point that she was at work every day, at least nine or ten ours a day, then working while she's at home the rest of the time.  That's the way it is for the next year and a half.

Now, our dog had always been really weird about being inside.  She just had a lot of anxiety, and never seemed very happy, but only inside.  She'd just kinda settle into a chair, and stay there for the entire day, no matter where in the house anyone else was.  When she'd get outside, she'd be like a completely different dog.  She loved to play and wrestle, but indoors she seemed to interpret everything as a threat.  Well, I decided that it might be a good for her if we got another dog, and good for me too, because our first dog's mood was really bumming me out.  I felt bad for her.  So, we got another dog.  That was about two years ago.

One year ago, I decide that I simply cannot stand to be in the relationship anymore if something doesn't change.  My ex is working more and more.  It's all she does.  She's always too tired to do anything.  I never get to relax with her.  It's been this way for almost our entire relationship, but never this bad.  We had made plans twice to move to a different city - where there's really good rock climbing, climb more, and not work so much.  Both times, the plans were dashed because my ex wouldn't quit her job.  There's shit I want to do with my life.  I want a relationship in which I can actually spend time with my partner, where we're building a life together.

Well, she decides that she'd rather just break up.  Dumps me.  I beg her to just take a break, go to a relationship counselor.  She refuses.  She refuses to even talk to me about why she wants to break up.  She just says ""we don't make a good couple.""  I try to tell her that it's the job.  She denies that it has anything to do with anything.  Kicks me out of our apartment (we had moved out of the condo and into an apartment).  I move in with my parents.  I'm extremely depressed because our nine year relationship had just collapsed and it was as though she just didn't give a fuck at all.  I mean, I saw her a few times, and she'd act all chummy.  ""I went on a date.""  I wouldn't respond.  ""I went on a date.""  like I was supposed to ask her about it.  But, she wouldn't answer my calls.  She wouldn't respond to my texts.  My nine year relationship came to an end and I didn't even get to talk to the person about it.  

Before this goes on much longer, let me just say that she ended up with our original dog, and I ended up with the new dog.  My ex changed her phone number and moved out of state with the dog, and basically scoffed at me when I said that our original dog was my dog because everyone knows the new dog was my dog and the old dog was her dog because she did special training with her.  It's like she could only see the time she spent with the dog, and couldn't imagine the 100x more time that I had spent with her.  Ugh, she just had this snide fucking attitude when I tried to talk to her about it.  Even my dad yelled at me when I said I was upset about it ""That's her dog!  This dog is your dog!""  Did I mention that she just fucking quit her job like it was nothing and moved to a climbing destination like we had planned, all the while accusing me of not having aspirations?  She also gave our cat away, whom I had taken care of for four years, and wouldn't tell me to whom she gave it.  

The thing is, our dog loved to play keep away, and whenever the four of us (myself, ex, dog 1, dog 2) would go play in the field next to our house, after dog 2 was tired, I'd always make sure dog 1 got the ball, and I'd chase her around because that's what she loved, that's what she lived for, and that's how we played when she was a puppy.  But, my ex would always want to stop playing and go in.

1omg2p,4,2013-10-17,"I feel like I'm a terrible person, a pathetic piece of shit, and I don't deserve to be alive.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1omg2p/i_feel_like_im_a_terrible_person_a_pathetic_piece/,"I've slowly lost my friends, lost things to do and become less and less confident in my ability to do anything. I just go through the motions day after day, regretting my past decisions and letting life pass me by. 

I've become more and more irritated with my job. For the majority of the past 7 years I've been a pharmacy technician. I became more and more irritated with the selfish pharmacists and technicians I worked with. The pharmacists and techs would dick around on their phones and I'd bust my ass for the pharmacy. I was always the person who rearranged their schedule for everyone. I could never get full time hours so I started working customer service in the store here and there. I eventually got fed up with the pharmacy completely and now I work as a stock and customer service clerk in the store. I don't use my brain at all. It's boring and repetitive work but I need the money it gives me. At 28 though, I feel like I shouldn't be working a shitty job like the one I'm at, especially since I have a college education.

I have a BA in sociology, which I regret doing. I had no idea what I wanted to do in college. I had absolutely no plan going in and I completely wasted my time there. I never joined anything and pretty much spent all of my free time in my dorm or apartment playing video games or browsing the internet. I worked on the weekends back home so I never spent a weekend at school. When I should have been out making friends, finding an internship, finding myself, or planing for the future I did nothing worthwhile with my time. I couldn't find a better job upon graduation so I started graduate school in demography. I hated it. I can't teach and my ideas were shit. I started drinking heavily while in the program. I never finished my master's thesis and I eventually dropped out of the program. 

After failing to find another job (again) I enrolled in library school this year, which I'm not sure is a good idea. I interned at a few libraries but nothing permanent. I'm getting myself into more debt for a graduate degree which I'm not sure will help me anyway. Another bad decision on my part.

I had a DUI in August which I feel terrible about. I rear ended someone and totaled my own car. I'm glad no one was hurt but the fact is that I drove drunk and I feel like a total piece of shit for it. One more reason why I hate myself. I lost my license and got put on a non reporting probation for a year. I feel like it's now going to be impossible for me to find a job in a new profession with this on my record (I can't get it expunged). One more strike against me. 
 
I've had nothing but failed relationships. Every time I meet someone and we seem to hit it off it never works out. There's always some better than me. Someone smarter, funnier, wittier, all around better. 
I managed to date someone for more than a few dates earlier this year for the first time, but it didn't work out. I also have a huge crush on one of my co-workers but she already has a boyfriend. Just as well anyway. I don't think I really have anything to offer anyone anyway. I have no money, I'm not attractive, and I don't really have any talents. 

I'm also a virgin. I know that I shouldn't let that bother me but it does. Being almost 30 and having zero sexual experience makes me feel inadequate. I'm afraid that if I ever do find a girlfriend and our relationship progresses to that level of romance, she'll be completely turned off that I really have no idea how to make love. I want to know what sex feels like and I want to know how to please a woman.

My week mostly consists of waking up, doing school work or mindlessly browsing the internet until I go to my job, work, come back to my apartment, browse the internet some more, go to sleep, and repeat the process. I have nothing to look forward to: no events, concerts, or whatever the fuck people do with their time.  

I really don't know anymore. Going to sleep now, maybe I'll wake up somewhere new, or as someone else. "

A year after I started, I was ""promoted"" into a role which would have me help train and develop new hire talent. Since then, I moved on to temporarily train full classes of new employees and even oversee the mentoring process.

For this time, I've had my eye on the supervisor position at my company. See, my job doesn't do merit raises or anything like that, so the only way to get paid more is to get moved into a different role. It was a long process but finally, my company is expanding and hiring on a lot of new people. I helped train and mentor many of them and I found out today that I've been accepted into the company's supervisor internship program, where they'll train me and ultimately give me a team of my own!

I couldn't be happier and couldn't think of a better place to post something like this. After a really challenging year, personally and professionally, the hard work has paid off!"

We were poor, and we were many. I was known as the smart one, and people always expected me to become successful. My parents are kind of like hippies, and didn't think much of me getting an education. When I graduated I never plan on how to pay for college. At this time I realized my parents didn't pay taxes, so I couldn't get financial aid. I did community college for three years not properly planning out my degree, just thinking I was getting my basics. I ended up paying my parents taxes and getting into a university. This whole time I had been living with my parents. I decided on getting my degree in physics, but then realized I was way behind in the program. A year later I switched to engineering due to job opportunities. My third year in the university, my grandma died. Up until this point, my grandpa had been taking care of my family. When my grandma died, he couldn't cover our rent, so my dad decided to move a few hours away (Keep in mind my parents had been listening to this ""modern day prophet"" who said our town would be destroyed.)     

At this point, most of my siblings had their own lives. My three younger sisters and I had been living with our parents. One of them, ""J"" fell into the cult and wanted to follow my parents. My other sibling ""S"" was pulled out of school after the second grade and had absolutely no education (no matter how much I tried.) My other sibling ""R"" had a normal life, and ended up moving in with her boyfriend. I still had two years of school to go at this point but no job.     

My brother took me in and I immediately got a job as an intern getting paid pretty well. I offered to move out (he's married) but he needed help paying the rent. I stayed with him for two years, graduated and moved out. I now make 70k a year, and have gotten to know some influential people. My boss in particular is a multimillionaire who has taken me on as his protege, giving me opportunities to consult people inventing new products.   
I still don't feel like I make much money. Taxes and health insurance take up 33% of my check. Outside of that, I've racked up a 60 thousand dollar student loan dept which cost me $800 a month. Rent, food, gas, and utilities doesn't leave me with much extra.     

My brother gave me a call a few moments ago to let me know my parent got evicted from there apartment, and might go to a salvation army homeless shelter. My parents still think the world is about to be destroyed and do as little as they can to get by. My brother tried to get them to come back to our town but they won't. My little sister ""R"" really wants to leave but nobody wants to take care of her. Over the past few years I've been buying her books to study and get her GED, hoping that she can get into the army after. She doesn't read the books and sells them. My brother is worried my parents might die in five years if they continue this lifestyle. I know if I try to help them out, my opportunities for success are dashed. I don't know what to do.   

**TL;DR:** Parents follow cult, might become homeless and continue to do as little as they can to get by. Family expects me to take care of my 19 year old sister who has a second grade education and no motivation to do anything in life. "

Mathematics with an applied actuarial science and finance option as well as a statistics minor. I have a GPA of 3.27 currently, but it will be a 3.38 at the end of this semester(December). My GPA in my major is around a 3.6(my overall GPA is lower because I switched from engineering, which I was not enjoying). I have had one internship, as a marketing analyst intern at a smaller(100-200 people?) company. I was able to get a great letter of recommendation from this internship. I have experience working with SAS, MathCAD, Excel, Minitab, and a bit of C++ and R.
Basically, I am strongly considering graduate school for statistics at the moment and I had some questions.

1. Is it too late to be considering graduate school at this point?
2. How competitive would I be, and what sort of schools should I be looking at?
3.What kind of things can I do RIGHT NOW that will increase my chances?
4. What are some pros and cons for Master's vs. Ph.D?
5.What kind of aid is available, and what kind of aid would I be likely to receive with my GPA?

Any other relevant information would be greatly appreciated. I realize I am looking at this later than I should have, but I am just curious where I stand.

Thank you in advance :)"
1oq64x,1,2013-10-18,I'm only staying around because I need a car for work,onigai,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oq64x/im_only_staying_around_because_i_need_a_car_for/,"Me and my mom have a rough relationship. I actually up and left my sophmore year of college and moved in with my dad (my bf also joined me as he had just had his house foreclosed, that's a whole other story). she had hacked my fb and everything, told people I took everything from her house (I only took things I had bought myself). she badmouthed my bf and accused me of doing anything for a dick, and called me a whore. I learned who my friends were that day because they reared their ugly heads and told her off so hard it was enough to bring me to tears.  I was forced back into contact with my mother when she was told she had cancer. at the time I was in engineering school and in the process of slowly realizing that I was in over my head. so I used her as an excuse to change majors and switch to a two year degree somewhere else, but in all honesty, I didn't feel like repeating another year of engineering classes. 

I actually had family try and cancel my placement/entrance exam to my new school because I was going to ""abandon"" her at the hospital, I was going to be late because of the exam but I was still planning to be there to pick her up.  luckily the idiot was dumb enough to threaten me with it before actually doing it so I had a chance to call the school and tell them not to believe anything they don't hear from me regarding my schooling. not 15 minutes later my adviser called me and asked if I was okay because someone called saying there was a family emergency that I wouldn't be at the exam.

now I should mention me and my stepmother never have gotten along (my father sure can pick them) me and my bf were forced to live in the back room of their moldy basement that was halfway through reno that was never finished after Irene. there was a kitchen and bathroom and two other rooms but she filled them up almost as soon as we moved in with junk from their second house. I felt like I was living in a hoarders house. There were mice, spiders, silverfish, mold and some freaky looking slimy things that we would find under mirrors. 

but we were happy, even with the constant torment about how ugly and disgusting and worthless we were from the woman. My bf bought me a white mouse after we caught a mouse in our live trap (that mouse had a very strong personality) and I named him and everything even though I had to let him go (my bf felt really bad). this little white mouse helped us get through this surprisingly, I guess it gave us something to look forward to when we got home. but our little fuzzy friend gave us more to be harassed about as well. hell the hag even poured bleach on him because he ""stank"" (he smelt like the average hamster).  I know for a fact there was no way they could smell him upstairs because not only was he in the farthest room from the stairs but we kept an automatic air freshener in the room and it always smelt fresh. 

eventually things went south between me and the hag and I ended up back at my mothers and my bf at one of her friends' house who ""volunteered"" to help. later the woman renigged on the offer and my bf wasn't even allowed to use the bathroom after we got home from night classes. he now live two blocks from me thank god and has the coolest roommate you could find on craigslist.

so here I am at my moms, she threatens to take the car from me any time I don't do what she wants, shes even tried to tow it(luckily her bf stepped in). I graduate in a month and already have a job in the field which is 30 minutes away but its the happiest place I've ever been in my life, I love it there. last night I was with my bf at the school for his presentation and we go again next week for mine.  last night she texted me asking me where the hell I was and now is taking the car from me. there is no bus to where I work, its a warehouse surrounded by farm land and its owned by a small company. anyway, I'm losing the car two weeks before internship ends, I'm required to work these weeks or I can't graduate. she texted me and flipped out asking where the hell I was and where was her car, that I better not have driven my bf to Carlisle (its where his ex and children live). from what her texts said, she knew her car was not in front of my bfs apt. Even if my car was on drive mode she wouldn't have known I was anywhere but his house until after the first text. not only that I had told her where we were going the night before while I was helping edit his paper. I have seen her drive past bf after bf's house. shes even snooped on my bf asking why there were a bunch of girls hanging around the house(he has a 2nd floor apartment, it used to be an attic before it was split into 4 apartments, and the girl downstairs is pregnant so I'm pretty sure it was a baby shower). so I finally confronted her about it ""wtf? why are you always driving past F's place when I'm staying over its creepy as fuck, you  knew I was at the school for F's graduation presentation"". now its how dare I accuse her of being a stalker and shes so through with me and I'm done. Also she wants her car and I'm never going to drive it again. supposedly. but so far no cops are at my work so I doubt this isn't going to be much more than her badmouthing me to the point I'm suicidal and then some.

I can't even bring myself to tell my boss I may not have a way in on monday, I'll probably end up crying.

I'm so close to being able to get out and be free, now its all going to hell. I thought I would tell someone so I can make the pain in my chest go away. but I'm not sure its working.

edit: I just realized my story has nothing to do with the title. I'm sorry."

Most of the time he is completely fine, but sometimes an event will shake his confidence and he'll slip right back into his anxious ways for a few months.  He just finished an internship and graduated college about 2 months ago, and now the company he did his internship for wants to hire him.  Our wedding was about a month ago, he had pretty high anxiety on that day and now he's having troubles trying to shake it.  He does have some beta blockers (very low dosage) that he takes every day and also some type of medication that is very similar to xanex that they gave him 10 of that is supposed to last 4 months.  The beta blockers don't seem to be doing much for him, but that might be because he's taking such a low dosage.  He saw a therapist earlier this week, but he isn't a huge fan of him.  We tried to get him into a woman that specializes in anxiety but she doesn't have an appointment available until the end of this month which will be after his interview.

He knows about breathing techniques and they help a little, but can anyone give me some advice on how to help him cope? I know he'll feel better once he gets a job...but the interview and first few days on the job are going to be tough for him."

A scholarship I'm applying for requires that I submit 8 portfolio images for review, should I send them 2 images each from 4 projects or 1 image each from 8 projects? Should I go for diversity or consistency? 

Additionally, since the internship is Fashion Branding based, should I include pieces that are only tangentially related to fashion?

For example, two of the images I intend to submit are from a hypothetical microsite mockup for Aston Martin which still falls within the luxury category but isn't directly related to fashion. 

I should mention that the criteria for the competition is quite vague and provides little direction. It only states that entries must display intellect, vision and innovation however the review panel is composed entirely from those working within the fashion and luxury industries. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

1op5j6,3,2013-10-18,I'm Done With College,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1op5j6/im_done_with_college/,"I'm 19, male, of standard to above average intelligence, living at home, going to college right now, and I'm sick of it. 

I stayed home and went to the shitty college in my home town because every-fucking-thing I wanted to do was rejected by my parents. Every course I wanted to take wasn't what they wanted me to take. Every place I wanted to go 'wasn't really where I want to go.' I'm sick and tired of not standing up to my mother and step father, and this is the end of it. I'm not some 16 year old bitching about how shitty school is, I'm someone who wants to take life in the direction I want, and not let what other people want me to do be the only way I live.

My highschool marks were good enough to get me into just about every college in Ontario. I wanted to take a year off and work, my mother wanted me to go straight into college.


I went to college. 


I wanted to take a course on Interior Design. My stepdad said ""what are you, gay?"" and my mom told me there are no jobs in that field right now. I know my mom was right, and I knew that. Well, aside from the family friend who works heavily in landscape and interior design, who told me he would have no problem referring me to companies, or even letting me intern under him. 


I'm straight. I didn't go into an Interior Design course. 


I wanted to go into an Engineering course in a college in Toronto. I got accepted, and I was really happy. I had even changed my last semester Grade 12 courses to a more advanced math so I would qualify. According to my mom and stepdad, I didn't want to travel to Toronto every day. Of course I didn't want to drive 2 hours every day. I want to live in Toronto, regardless of schooling, I like the city, I want to get away from the suburbs for a bit. 


According to my stepdad I don't really like Toronto, and once I get there I'll never make the money to move away. 


My mother said that living out of town is expensive, and I agreed, but I showed her I got into the course I wanted at the college I wanted. She said she thought the college in my home town was better. They don't have the course I want. 


Since 'I don't want to live in Toronto and I don't want to go to my choice school,' I didn't accept the offer to go there.

The only semi-relevant course to Engineering was Computer Networking at this college I'm at. 


I got accepted. 


I don't like the core courses, they relate to nothing that I want to do with my life. The Communication courses are alright, at least they hold some use for me.  I don't like the college I'm at. It has a decent reputation. It's relatively inexpensive. I'm living at home and saving money there. I'm working part time around school which is what I want to do anyways. 

I don't like the school all that much. I keep thinking about how much more enjoyable studying a field I care about might be. Maybe even working full time and moving to Toronto for a while. I listen to my high school friends talk about how much they enjoy being in Nursing, in Computer Programming, in Criminology out of province, or how glad they are that they took the year off and are saving up for their field of study out of province. I'm here, in the course that hold little relevance to my life, doing everything because I listened to what my parent's wanted me to do.

I'm going to tell my mom I'm leaving college this week. I'm passing my courses. I don't enjoy them, I'm not learning anything I care about or want to care about. I haven't suddenly been exposed to an area I want to pursue as a career, I've been taught that I dislike learning about the OSI model, and don't really care about how many Volts a 1 and 0 (binary) are converted to when being sent across a copper wire. I've also learned that I've become restless living at home, and that isn't a fun feeling.

Mom is going to be upset. She wanted me to stay close, and I get that no one really wants their son to be a drop-out. My stepdad is going to tell me that I'm just wasting money, that I already paid for this semester so suck it up and finish it off. I'm just going to tell them I've made up my mind. I'll go to college when they can accept I'm going to go into a field I want, or at least can stand. 

I work tomorrow. I'm going to tell my boss I can start working Tuesday through Friday again. I'll start working full time to save up enough. Not sure what 'enough' is. Enough to pay my loans off and my car insurance. Maybe a bit saved up to go to a school I want next year.

I'm debating selling my desktop computer. I built it, it's pretty new. I might be able to get $800 out of it and pay back some of my loans, maybe put a bit into first or last rent on a place in the city. I'm not sure why, but for the past 3 years I've had this dream of moving to Toronto. I'm in no rush to get there, but if I'm not in school, maybe it's time. 

TL;DR - Rambling. Tired. Upset. I think this post went from ""I'm angry with how my life is"" to ""I just don't know."" read and find out if you'd like.

1op222,1,2013-10-18,Take Yourself Out of the Pressure Cooker,mariabruggere,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1op222/take_yourself_out_of_the_pressure_cooker/,"Last month I felt like I was on the verge of some kind of weird breakdown. I had gotten hung up on September 11, various conspiracy theories, the Syrian war, the Newsroom, and everything else the news had to offer. I wasn't just feeling down on myself, I was feeling down on the world, but that only made me feel worse about myself. Pathetic, I know.

But why?

Because here I sit, in fabulous Los Angeles with a college degree from Oregon State University, work experience in various areas of the entertainment industry, a worldly background, and charisma to boot, and I feel like I can't find a full-time job (that I like) to save my damn life.

I'm not talking part-time job, volunteer work, or internships, I'm talking a job. The 9-5 lifestyle that consists of a salary, benefits, company camaraderie, the whole lot. Sounds easy, right?

When I, and anyone else that was born anywhere from 1985-1992 were told that we would spend all this time in school, go to college, make lifelong friends, and graduate with the knowledge and opportunity to blast into the work force and find a great job paying $40k plus with benefits. We were lied to.

Is it the liars fault that we were lied to? Not at all. Even though we want to believe it, our parents can't predict the future. They couldn't predict that terror would strike us in ways we didn't think was possible. They had no idea the banks were full of terrible people doing selfish things. And they definitely didn't know that most of us would still be living with them at the age of 24 or 25, working part time at Starbucks and part time at Red Robin and living at home.

I visited home recently and realized how many people still live in the town I grew up in and they have part time, minimum wage jobs, and college degrees. See what's wrong with this picture? We are the milennials, we are supposed to be the ones that save the world. We're supposed to be the ones that put a stop to global warming and human rights issues, and vote for the first female president. But so far, we haven't figured much of that out because we are struggling to survive ourselves. Therefore, all the old farts think that we are lazy. HA.

As I sit and think about all of these things day in and day out - about how I can get better every day and how I am going to make a difference, I get frustrated. I know one day I will have a career I love, the family I want, and so on and so forth, but right now it all seems so far away. The milennials went through such a transition in history and we haven't completely made the switch yet. That part we are still trying to figure out.

When I thought I had reached my breaking point a few weeks ago, I finally got enough sleep to snap back into the glass half full skeptic that I am (sort of ironic, I know). And I realized this:

Working a minimum-wage job with a brand new shiny college degree isn't the depressing part. Living with your parents doesn't suck that bad (after all, you did it for the first 18 years or so of your life). But what does suck is giving up. Giving up on your peers, your country, and yourself. If you do all of that, you are sure to live a miserable life.

People have said we are the problem generation. With tattoos, piercings, truck driver mouths, and Miley Cyrus, but we still have many great qualities. Our generation elected the first African-American president. Our generation has brought you things like Tumblr and Facebook (and you're lying if you say you don't like them). And our generation brought you us - we are who we are and we're not really going to ever change no matter what you say, but be grateful, it will be a good thing one day. When the milennials are old and pooping in their adult Pampers, the young people are going to be grateful for us and what we accomplished.

What I'm really trying to say to the people my age (24 or around there) is don't put so much pressure on yourself that you give up completely. Don't crumble into a million pieces and work at 24 Hour Fitness for the next 10 years. Do what you want to do. Get your bills paid, of course, but don't give up what you're passionate about. If no one is going to offer you a real job anyway, make your own. Do it yourself.

I put all this pressure on myself that I have to find the perfect job tomorrow, I have to lose 15 lbs. this week, and that I have to find the man of my dreams and have a baby by next Friday.

That might sound really super crazy to some of you reading this, but believe me, there are a million other 20-somethings out there thinking the exact same thing. In so many ways I want so badly to be perfect that I almost feel like I'm nothing but a lazy piece of crap, but that's not the case! Not even close. I am worth a full-time job, the benefits, the husband, and the family. But Rome wasn't built in a day.

Moral of the story? Take your time. Pay your bills however you need to. Live your life one day at a time. When you lie down at night to fall asleep, think about each thing you did that day to accomplish one step closer to your ultimate goal.

For example:
-- Today I secured a part-time job
-- I started a new writing class
-- I rode my horse

Those are just three things I did today that helped me in various ways move closer to my ultimate goal. Life is supposed to ultimately be something of joy, laughter, and willingness to love.

Try it, I dare you.

""Dear Hiring manager:

I want to express my interest the Intermediate Coastal Specialist position at AAA.

I have been actively involved in oceanographic research and field work since the beginning of my undergraduate studies. 
During several summer internships and eventual short-term position as Junior Oceanographer at BBB, I assisted with deployment/recovery of marine instrumentation and performed field data processing, interpretation and presentation tasks. I also created MATLAB-based software that analyzed raw oceanographic data which was much more user-friendly than the old manufacturer's software and allowed to cut the processing time at least by half. 

While working as a Research Assistant at the University of CCC, I developed a highly complex numerical model that examined various aspects of large-scale ocean currents. This model revealed previously unknown recirculation mechanisms that take place in the world ocean. 
My technical expertise includes fluency in several programming languages (MATLAB, C++, Fortran), depth knowledge of various analytical programs (OriginLab, Microsoft Excel, Wolfram Mathematica, Maple) and solid experience in scientific and technical writing. 

I appreciate your taking the time to review my credentials and experience. Again, thank you for your consideration.

Because I'm poor and all that.

I'm interested in computational method development. All my research so far has been MM or post-HF development with a lot of random using DFT there, but I really love DFT and I'm mostly applying for grad schools with that in mind. Specifically, I have come to prefer the more condensed matter physics type DFT codes (TDDFT is awesome to me!).

Now I kind of want to attend my own graduation (which will take place in Scotland) because lol robes or something, and there are a couple of theory summer schools in Greater Western Europe that I want to go to, so I'd like to find some sort of paid employment for 4 months in Europe. I've got a job offer, but it's neither in Europe nor any sort of DFT.

Does anyone know about research groups that would match my ridiculously specific criteria and might have funding for this type of thing? 

Addendum: I think at this point I'd also be fine with exchange-correlation functional type stuff, but I gather there's a lot of competition and little funding there."

I received a less than acceptable answer from Sen. Portman.  Below is my re-address to the Sen. (it's long, so I apologize for that in advance):

""Senator Portman,

Growing up I was always told that in this country, we can contact our elected representatives to voice our concerns on issues.  Earlier today (18 Oct 2013), I decided to exercise that right.  I attempted to contact you in regards to a situation involving the snuffing of journalism and freedom of speech, and the Presidents involvement in a situation with a journalist.

Instead of a reply from you, or even an aide of yours, I received a reply from you saying how glad you were that I was contacting you in regards to the government shutdown, below is the e-mail you sent me, verbatim:

“Dear George, 
  
Thank you for contacting me to express your views on  the bipartisan agreement to reopen the government and avert default.  I am grateful to have your input, and I appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.   
After weeks of dysfunction in Washington, I was glad to see the partial government shutdown come to an end and Congress work together to ensure we did not default on our obligations. I was also pleased that my push for income verification to prevent fraud and abuse in the implementation of President Obama's healthcare law and minimize the negative impact on Ohio families was part of the final agreement.   
 
Although the government shutdown ended and default was avoided, moving from crisis to crisis creates an environment of uncertainty and is no way to bolster America's economy. Unfortunately, we do not have a long-term fix that will prevent another shutdown in January, which is why I will continue to fight for passage of my End Government Shutdowns Act. This bipartisan legislation would ensure that Americans do not have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over their heads and would provide more certainty for our economy and government agencies and the families across the nation who rely on them. More details on the End Government Shutdowns Act can be found  here.    

Now that Congress has temporarily avoided this crisis, I am hopeful that President Obama will stick to his promise and come to the table to negotiate on a path forward to deal with Washington's underlying problem of overpromising and overspending that brought our nation to this crisis in the first place.   

My colleagues and I are ready to negotiate on how to rein in Washington's out-of-control spending so that we not only prevent a future debt limit crisis in February, but also avoid passing along this debt crisis to our children and grandchildren.  Unless this borrowing is restrained, future generations will face a doubling of their tax rates as well as lower living standards and we have a moral responsibility not to endanger future generations with the consequences of such economic irresponsibility.  This is why I am  looking forward to being a part of the bicameral and bipartisan budget conference committee that was established to address our serious spending issues.    
Ohioans deserve more from Washington. A long-term plan to curb spending and put our nation onto a path toward fiscal responsibility would be a step in the right direction.  
  
Once again, thank you for taking the time to write. I am honored to represent you and the great state of Ohio in the United States Senate. For more information, please visit my website at www.portman.senate.gov, where you may also sign up for my newsletter. Please keep in touch. 

Sincerely, 
Rob Portman
U.S. Senator”

Now I don’t know about you, but your response addresses none of the concerns I contacted you about in the first place.  

Please please PLEASE respond back to me ACTUALLY TALKING about the issue I brought up to you earlier.  Remember, it is WE THE PEOPLE who got you into office in the first place and you are supposed to work for, and answer to US!

Respectully,
A very angry voter

PS In case you need another copy, below is the original message I sent you. 
 
ORIGINAL MESSAGE:

Senator Portman, 

I am contacting you in regards to a news article I came across this morning, and it is the first time I've heard about this.  Below is the link:

http://www.democraticunderground.com/10023300531

My question is, why is the President trying to silence journalism and freedom of speech?  Are those things not what we, as Americans, preach to those around the world, especially in repressive countries?  For being as freedom loving as he claims to be, this sure seems like the exact opposite of what he preaches.  

As a member in the U.S. Armed Services, this is one of the many great freedoms I risk my life to defend, and I find it absolutely repulsive that a man who is supposed to lead us, and be a shining example and an embodiment of us as a whole, would even entertain this idea, especially when this journalist was about to be pardoned.  He needs to be reminded that the job of a journalist is to be a watchdog against the horrible acts of a government, and should not be punished for doing their jobs, but instead praised. 
 
I urge you to contact the President, and to make this issue known and to right this wrong.  Thank you for your time.

Very Respectfully,
George DeNillo""

I feel this is unacceptable coming from an elected official.  Now don't get me wrong, I understand that chances are his secretary or intern or whatever actually sent me a canned response, but it is his name that is attached to the e-mail, so he must be held accountable.

I want this to go viral, we deserve a proper response from our elected officials when we contact them.  Thank you in advance to those who decide to help

I have two scenarios in mind, both involve you pretending to be something else, your secret is revealed, you are seduced into submission and then fucked silly.


1) You were always a tomboy, playing outside in mud with the other boys. Dolls, dresses, and pink never had any appeal for you. Your adolescent years were spent as one of the boys, you played and fought as well as any of them. 

Then puberty hit and you got tits, small firm ones to be sure but tits none the less. Baggy clothes, the occasional girlfriend, and a mean right hook kept you in the ""bro"" category. 

I'm college you drank, swore, and fucked girls like one of the guys. But sometimes when you were alone you would use a toy on yourself, never with any one though. 

After Graduation you made a fateful decision, Alex was a unisex enough name after all. You packed up everything and accepted a junior position in New York, as a man. Surgery and hormones was a option but you couldn't bring yourself to do it. You had the right hairstyle and clothes to pull it off, a small framed effeminate guy hardly stands out in NY.

You fooled them all, even some of the girls in the office are chasing you. Except your Boss, you can't shake the feeling that he knows. The way he looks at you penetrates your disguise and your cunt leaving you wet, even more so when your mind drifts to the time you walked in to his office to see him changing shirts. 6'2 Ripped and Tanned sporting a couple of days beard, and from the gossip around the office a long thick cock, attached to a man who enjoys the submission of others.

You should quit and get a job somewhere else, away from this man, you really should. But we both know you'll stay and play this most dangerous game.



2) Trap, that's what they call you on the internet. Your childhood was cliche but the results weren't. You always wanted Daddy's attention but he was never home, mommy always wanted a girl, and jenny from down the block might have made you play dress up too often. Whatever the cause your course was set early.

You always had girlfriends but at the time you suspected not like the other guys had. The boys locker room was a nightmare, puberty might have skipped a few steps leaving you almost hairless, high pitched, and only 4"" hard, you were an easy target, and the taunts of *boyclit* still haunt you.

Moving out west for college seemed like fate, you could start again. Alex became Lexxy, the makeup and fashion skills form your girlfriends came in handy, and who would notice a slightly taller than average girl out here? In 4 years no one ever called you on it, and more than one suitor chased after your ass.

An honors degree secured you a job in tech valley, and expensive implants made you the center of attention for every man in the room. You are the girl you always wanted to be, everything is perfect, except for your Boss, the owner and CEO of the company and a former Marine Captain back after 2 tours in Afghanistan.

You first meeting with him was walking in on him fucking one on the interns. Watching his thick cock slide in and out of her ass and her whimpers of pleasure filled you with lust, fear, and jealousy. The little slut didn't last long, neither did the next one.

Now it's become a game between you, when you manage to catch him he just looks at you, daring you to take the place of whichever girl he's fucking. Daring you to fall to your knees and worship his cock, just the thought makes you shiver, and let's not get started on what thinking about his cock sliding into ass does to you. 

Tonight is a company event, and you've seen the way he looks at the new girl. Tall, blonde, nice tits and a tight little ass. The little tramp looks too much like you to be coincidence, she even bought a cheap knock off of the dress you were planning to wear. If you're not careful he'll be balls deep in her before the night is half over.


Let me know which scenario you prefer."

They're neat people and good at what they do, but their methods are in many ways very oldschool. While the hardcore focus on prospecting and leaflets (they deliver them themselves - or did, until I showed up!) is very effective, it's my assigned task to give their day-to-day operations a tune-up.

Since they're currently storing all their contact info in a spectacularly complicated spreadsheet, I figure step one is to find a CRM. (Step two is for me to spend many hours doing data entry. I don't like step two.)

After much research (and binning eEdge/Market Leader, even though they're obliged to pay for it regardless), I came up with the following candidates:

Top Producer: Old-school. Everyone hates it. A lot. Not cheap.  

Salesforce: The Audi RS6 Avant of solutions: Does everything brilliantly all the time, will cost you your house.   

SugarCRM: This looks a lot like Unix: Very clunky, infinitely customizable. Unless tasks can be automated VERY heavily, but is it worth it?

Zoho: Plan B. Well regarded, not too expensive.

And finally:

Insightly: Cheap, simple, and integrated with Gmail, which my employers absolutely love. It could be improved in a lot of ways - you have to use filters to generate your own e-mail lists and manually enter them into ConstantContact, and there's no automation, and Google integration could be much better - but it's effortless to use and fills the primary role of ensuring my employers contact people they met at open houses. 

So, market professionals, am I herping my derp? "

Chapter One

                                        Monday's Suck

    It was the beginning of a cold, dreary Monday, and some idiot decided to resurrect me. With stale creaking limbs I clawed my way to the surface. Above me I saw the dark silhouette of a man, black against the pale light of the moon.
   
    ""Alright wise guy, was it you who got the bright idea to resurrect me?"" I said, one graying hand still on the casket.
   
    ""Um..yes?"" The bald man who resembled the fat statue of Buddha said in a squeaky voice, wringing his hands as if already regretting this decision.

    ""Are you asking me or telling me?"" I snapped back at him.

    ""T..telling?"" He stammered uncertainly.

    With an exasperated sigh I lay back down and demanded, ""Alright kid, kill me and bring me back again some other time, sometime more cheerful. Is July still nice? Then reawaken me in July, but not now.""
With an irritated glance at the foggy, damp, groggy morning, I lay back down in the casket and turned the one eye I still had to him expectantly.

    Looking like Christmas had been canceled, the bald little man exclaimed, ""N..no! You're supposed to do my bidding! That's why I resurrected you!""

    With a sigh I sat back up and, pointing with one decaying finger at my arm, from which the strong smell of rotting meat came from, and said, ""Well, if I'm going to be living again, could you do something about this?  It really draws away from my eye.""

    ""W...well You see,"" he stuttered. ""My spell didn't bring you back to life, it made you a... well, it made you a zombie.""

    ""Great."" I sighed as I climbed out of the casket. Dragging one foot behind me I began to trudge toward the road.

    ""Wait! Where are you going?"" Cried the man with a voice that all too much spoke of complete disappointment.

    ""Look,"" I said, patting him friend-like on the back, immediately regretting it as a finger fell off. ""If I'm able to walk and talk again, I may as well visit some friends. After all, who know how the world may have changed in the past fifteen years?""

    ""B..but,"" he began, practically begging now. ""You're supposed to do what I ask!""

    ""Look buddy, you seem like a perfectly nice, albeit creepy, guy. But I'm going home. Or at least, to what used to be my home... Man I'll bet it's changed. I wonder if they ever fixed that old creaky gate...  Anyway though, maybe some other time, but for now goodbye."" I said turning to head to the road again. When I hear a dry sob behind me, irritated, I turn on the spot, and say, ""Hey, cheer up. Maybe you can resurrect yourself a nice zombie girlfriend. This one, the one I'm pointing at, she used to be a real looker back in the day.""

    With that I began on my old route home for the first time in fifteen years.

                                      Chapter 2

                          Death can't get rid of scars.

    Unbelievable, I thought to myself, after fifteen years of death the place still aches. Remembering that eventful day, I stuck out my remaining thumb in the hope of hitch hiking, and thought back.

    The year was 1998, and, just like today, it was a cold, wet, foggy Monday. And, just like every other Monday, I was driving to work. I should have known, then and there, to turn around, for the day was not going to be a good one. On my way in, I hit a bird. Not just a sparrow or Blue Jay, but a hawk. A full grown, red-tail, idiotic hawk. And unlike those smaller ones, the hawk did some substantial damage to both itself and my car. So I spent half the morning cleaning bird feathers and blood out of the grill on my Mustang, time which should have been spent on the hour-long drive to work. 

    After what I'm going to call, ""The Bird Incident"" from now and on, I was already half an hour late. But I decided to go anyway, for I loved my job. My job, in fact, was part of the reason I died. But we'll get there later. Anyway, after The Bird Incident the morning was fairly uneventful, aside from the daily near-side-swipe incident, that is, which in itself is normal.

    I arrived at work, tired and disgruntled already, half an hour late, to the usual morning greetings and the occasional, ""Jeez man, had a rough morning?"" 

    If the bird hadn't convinced me to go home, the Laser Event should have. Before I get to that, however, I need to explain my job. I work, or at least, I did work, at a private university. Not teaching, haven't got the patience, but in the physics department. In my job, I used lasers on a daily basis, since much of my job required it. Today, however, I should have been nowhere near the laser laboratory, as I was currently trying, like so many others around the world, to prove String Theory. Most of you are probably wondering what String Theory is. Well Goodle it. Is that what they call it nowadays? Google? Anyway though, like I said I was working in the theoretical physics department on that day and shouldn't have been anywhere near that lab. However, an associate of mine assured me what he had to show me was worth seeing. As it turns out, he wanted to show  me he could heat up Ramen Noodles with the laser, something I'd been doing for years. Long story short, that intern was released that very day. After I ordered him out, I fiddled around with the laser, like I liked to do if work was slow. That, as it turns out, was a mistake.

    The second I turn on the laser I realised three things. First, the energy beam was on high, a rookie mistake, seeing as nothing but the most important of experiments require that much power. Also, that the intern had, for reasons unknown, placed a mirror just so the laser reflected it back exactly at the laser reactor. Finally, I realised that I had about five seconds to get out fast before that lab, and all the high powered reactors and lasers alike, went up in a fiery inferno. With a shout I dived for the door and had already dialed the ""9"" for ""911"" on the employee wall-phone before it happened. An explosion so powerful we got calls from five stories down that the geology department could feel the effects. And glass, so much glass. Test tubes, breakers, windows. Gone, vaporized, shattered. Five people were sent to the hospital, each only minor in their injuries. I, having dealt with explosions before, knew what to do to shield myself from damage, and was therefore not hurt, however, if that was not a sign to go home, I don't know what was.

    But I stayed, and that was my mistake. If I had left, he never could have snuck in during the commotion. He never could have gotten past security. And more than likely I would still be alive. He was nothing but a nuisance to me, John Oliver was. But to him, I was a rival. Oliver too was a physicist. But unlike me, he had never made even the remotest contributions to his field, while I had developed several theories and even a few laws. Recently, I had discovered something new in an atom, revolutionary it was. He knew it, yet did not know what I had discovered, though I can assure you it would have shunted all his work to the side. So, to him, it seemed he had no choice, he had to kill me and steal my proof. Unbeknownst to him, however, I hadn't yet written it down. Nevertheless, he still snuck in the lab, got in my office, no doubt through that uncanny lock-picking ability of his, and waited. When I walked through the door and closed it, I flipped on the lights, and there he was. Thin, pale, and short, especially to me. I never had time to scream as the thin silver blade was shoved roughly between my ribs. I dropped to the floor, croaked a little, bled a lot, and finally after what seemed like hours, a colleague entered and saw me there, dying. He was a large man, so he easily overpowered Oliver, but he was too late for me. The last thing I saw was his face, the face of a friend, staring helplessly at me, as he knelt to attempt CPR. 

    The slowing of an engine brought me back out of my stupor as an old pickup stopped on the shoulder of the road next to me. Gently lowering my still held out arm, I slowly dragged my mangled ankle into the truck, and saying many thanks to the driver, we drove off."

    ""Wait! Where are you going?"" Cried the man with a voice that all too much spoke of complete disappointment.
    ""Look,"" I said, patting him friend-like on the back, immediately regretting it as a finger fell off. ""If I'm able to walk and talk again, I may as well visit some friends. After all, who know how the world may have changed in the past fifteen years?""
    ""B..but,"" he began, practically begging now. ""You're supposed to do what I ask!""
    ""Look buddy, you seem like a perfectly nice, albeit creepy, guy. But I'm going home. Or at least, to what used to be my home... Man I'll bet it's changed. I wonder if they ever fixed that old creaky gate...  Anyway though, maybe some other time, but for now goodbye."" I said turning to head to the road again. When I hear a dry sob behind me, irritated, I turn on the spot, and say, ""Hey, cheer up. Maybe you can resurrect yourself a nice zombie girlfriend. This one, the one I'm pointing at, she used to be a real looker back in the day.""
    With that I began on my old route home for the first time in fifteen years.

                                      Chapter 2
                          Death can't get rid of scars.

    Unbelievable, I thought to myself, after fifteen years of death the place still aches. Remembering that eventful day, I stuck out my remaining thumb in the hope of hitch hiking, and thought back.
    The year was 1998, and, just like today, it was a cold, wet, foggy Monday. And, just like every other Monday, I was driving to work. I should have known, then and there, to turn around, for the day was not going to be a good one. On my way in, I hit a bird. Not just a sparrow or Blue Jay, but a hawk. A full grown, red-tail, idiotic hawk. And unlike those smaller ones, the hawk did some substantial damage to both itself and my car. So I spent half the morning cleaning bird feathers and blood out of the grill on my Mustang, time which should have been spent on the hour-long drive to work. 
    After what I'm going to call, ""The Bird Incident"" from now and on, I was already half an hour late. But I decided to go anyway, for I loved my job. My job, in fact, was part of the reason I died. But we'll get there later. Anyway, after The Bird Incident the morning was fairly uneventful, aside from the daily near-side-swipe incident, that is, which in itself is normal.
    I arrived at work, tired and disgruntled already, half an hour late, to the usual morning greetings and the occasional, ""Jeez man, had a rough morning?"" 
    If the bird hadn't convinced me to go home, the Laser Event should have. Before I get to that, however, I need to explain my job. I work, or at least, I did work, at a private university. Not teaching, haven't got the patience, but in the physics department. In my job, I used lasers on a daily basis, since much of my job required it. Today, however, I should have been nowhere near the laser laboratory, as I was currently trying, like so many others around the world, to prove String Theory. Most of you are probably wondering what String Theory is. Well Goodle it. Is that what they call it nowadays? Google? Anyway though, like I said I was working in the theoretical physics department on that day and shouldn't have been anywhere near that lab. However, an associate of mine assured me what he had to show me was worth seeing. As it turns out, he wanted to show  me he could heat up Ramen Noodles with the laser, something I'd been doing for years. Long story short, that intern was released that very day. After I ordered him out, I fiddled around with the laser, like I liked to do if work was slow. That, as it turns out, was a mistake.
    The second I turn on the laser I realised three things. First, the energy beam was on high, a rookie mistake, seeing as nothing but the most important of experiments require that much power. Also, that the intern had, for reasons unknown, placed a mirror just so the laser reflected it back exactly at the laser reactor. Finally, I realised that I had about five seconds to get out fast before that lab, and all the high powered reactors and lasers alike, went up in a fiery inferno. With a shout I dived for the door and had already dialed the ""9"" for ""911"" on the employee wall-phone before it happened. An explosion so powerful we got calls from five stories down that the geology department could feel the effects. And glass, so much glass. Test tubes, breakers, windows. Gone, vaporized, shattered. Five people were sent to the hospital, each only minor in their injuries. I, having dealt with explosions before, knew what to do to shield myself from damage, and was therefore not hurt, however, if that was not a sign to go home, I don't know what was.
    But I stayed, and that was my mistake. If I had left, he never could have snuck in during the commotion. He never could have gotten past security. And more than likely I would still be alive. He was nothing but a nuisance to me, John Oliver was. But to him, I was a rival. Oliver too was a physicist. But unlike me, he had never made even the remotest contributions to his field, while I had developed several theories and even a few laws. Recently, I had discovered something new in an atom, revolutionary it was. He knew it, yet did not know what I had discovered, though I can assure you it would have shunted all his work to the side. So, to him, it seemed he had no choice, he had to kill me and steal my proof. Unbeknownst to him, however, I hadn't yet written it down. Nevertheless, he still snuck in the lab, got in my office, no doubt through that uncanny lock-picking ability of his, and waited. When I walked through the door and closed it, I flipped on the lights, and there he was. Thin, pale, and short, especially to me. I never had time to scream as the thin silver blade was shoved roughly between my ribs. I dropped to the floor, croaked a little, bled a lot, and finally after what seemed like hours, a colleague entered and saw me there, dying. He was a large man, so he easily overpowered Oliver, but he was too late for me. The last thing I saw was his face, the face of a friend, staring helplessly at me, as he knelt to attempt CPR. 
    The slowing of an engine brought me back out of my stupor as an old pickup stopped on the shoulder of the road next to me. Gently lowering my still held out arm, I slowly dragged my mangled ankle into the truck, and saying many thanks to the driver, we drove off."

I wasn't able to get a job or an internship, so I spent the entirety of my summer just staying at home, working out and IMing my gf who was in another country for the summer. So I was pretty depressed throughout summer, but at least I knew in a couple months I would be back with my friends and girlfriend and I would be doing something productive.

My classes aren't really demanding a lot of time or energy, and I only have classes either very early in the morning or at night. So I'm always in class when my friends aren't and only really hang out with my roommates.
Aside from that within a week of being back with my girlfriend, she had been acting very distant and was not making much time for us to see each. She had a really busy schedule so it was understandable that we couldnt see each other all the time. However, after enough time of her being kinda bitchy to me, she apologized but broke up with me because she realized that she couldnt be in a relationship. Now I've spent the past month constantly thinking about her and how we had a really good thing going, but it was never given a chance to get off the ground.

So now I'm constantly alone, even on the weekends my roommates spend a lot of time doing things with their frats. I havent been able to make friends in any of my classes and I can't join any clubs or anything because of my night classes. I'm pretty shy, but once I start talking to people I can be charming and interesting, its just that I'm not meeting anybody that I would really care about getting to know. I tried going to parties but its ridiculously hard to get into them as a guy without any connections and I'm not really into that scene anyway.

I can't think of anything to do, and I constantly either feel lonely, bored or angry, and now my emotions are starting to affect my academics which is really the only thing I have going for me."

My issue: In high school I had two relationships (both over one year) and in college I dated two girls long term. After a trust-fallout with the previous girlfriend (she lied directly to my face about something very important). I am single now for the first time (for longer than a month) in many years

I have no idea how to get back into the game. I always would transition into another relationship shortly after getting out of one. I'm scared, nervous and anxious. I do very well in school, have a high-paying internship and I have a lot to offer as an individual (trying not to sound conceded).

I feel as if I've lost ""my game"". I'm unsure if ""my game"" is my self-esteem but whatever it is I don't know how to approach/advance with women anymore. I'm a college student for goodness sakes, but I'm a very emotional guy. I've only had sex with two women (both of which I was in a long term relationship with). I end up in the friend zone too easily. I'm considered just the nice guy now and I don't know how to take it further then that.

1oulsm,3,2013-10-20,Me [22 M] trying to work out some issues related to my perpetual singleness and whether I really want to change that or not. Also some venting. It's long and not that interesting.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oulsm/me_22_m_trying_to_work_out_some_issues_related_to/,"Okay, first of all, this is an edited crosspost from /r/foreveralone. I thought I'd post something here in the hopes of gettign advice from a more knowledgable audience. I'm using a throwaway because some of this stuff is a bit personal, and my regular account can be linked to my identity if you do enough research. This way, it's just between me and the NSA.

I'm bassically just trying to figure out a number of issues related to relationships, especially concerning my lack of them and attempting to determine if I really desire one, and what one I'd want might actually be like.

Some background: I'm in my early twenties, currently working a paid internship as a programmer. I'm done with my undergrad, looking at going back for a masters. I'm theoretically pansexual, but in practice the vast majority of people I'm attracted to end up being women. I think I'm maybe towards the upper end of the lower 30% by appearence, but one person has told me I'm closer to average, and that I just have dificulty imagining anyone else might find me physically attractive.

I'm pretty much completely inexperienced sexually and romanticly. The summer after highschool, I finally figuered out a friend was really in to me and decided to give a relationship a try. I didn't really have any feelings for her beyond enjoying her company and finding her a little attractive, but I figuered I might as well try it out and see if it worked out. It lasted about a month before we sort of drifted apart as I got closer to going to college. It never got farther than a little kissing and sort of makeing out. I never got less awkward at it. She had to walk me through bassically everything or I'd just stand there awkwardly not knowing what to do. It was kind of enjoyable at times, but looking back at it I feel like it was a mostly negative experience for me.

Fast forward a couple years. I was living at an occupy encampment for a while, and I ended up with a pretty serious crush on a girl who was sort of on the periphery of the local occupy. She was really nice and friendly, and she turned out to be the sort of person who is very physically affectionate with all of her friends but doesn't really mean anythign by it. Anyway, there were a few nights where we ended up cuddleing mostly to keep warm, or with the excuse that we were trying to keep warm. It was really nice. I sort of lost touch with her after the encampment broke up, but after that I've craved the chance to cuddle with someone again. I mostly try to deal with that with a body pillow. It works pretty well for the most part. Later on, I ended up going to the same conference as her and hangeing out. By that point, I was bassically over my crush on her, but I still let her know that I had had feelings for her at one point. She told me that she didn't recipricate, but it didn't get awkward at all and things bassically immediately went back to the way things were. She's been pretty friendly the handful of times I've seen her after that.

Fast forward another year or two. I met a girl who eventually became a pretty good frined for a while. She decided to pretty much take me on as a project, and offered to teach me about all things sexual. I never took her up on much of that because it just didn't really seem appealing for whatever reason. I found her reasonably attractive, but I guess I was mostly content with dealing with my sexual needs through copious masturbation. The farthest any of that ever got was a little kissing when she was a bit drunk at a party and a few times I saw her in a state of partial or (once) total undress when I was crashing at her place for a while between more permanent housing. We've sort of drifted apart recently because of somethign unrelated.

That brings you more or less up to date on my background. At the moment, I live with two roomates, both of whom are very good friends. One is a late twenties conventional FA type, minus the fact that he has plenty of female friends who he mostly sees as just friends. The other is in her mid to late twenties and seems to be pretty successful romanticly, with a mixture of fairly frequent hookups and some dateing in the past.

I have a few good friends and several circles of people I am sort of friends with. Aside from my roomates and schedualed events with the local hackerspace or the radical political organization I'm part of, I don't do much of anything that isn't solitary. I'm not always sure how fine with that I am. Usually, I don't have any desire to be more social, but sometimes I go through lonely phases where I want to spend more time with people but don't.

I'm going through one of those lonely phases right now. At the moment, I'd kind of like more friends and maybe even a relationship of some sort. The problem is, these aren't things I want to want. I ought to be content with my current situation. I have a good life overall. I have some good friends, I can more or less satisfy my typical social needs just by going through my day to day routine, masturbation is pretty much completely sufficient for dealing with my sexual needs and hugging my body pillow more or less addresses my unfortuante desire for human contact. For some reason, though, I go through these phases where I'm not really satisfied with all that.

I can't even really figure out what a relationship I'd enjoy would even look like. I value my free time too much to want a time commitment much beyond a few hours a week, and even that might become a problem. I have little or no interest in sex with another person and have no interest in all the steriotypical dateing stuff. I'm not sure what exactly it is that I find myself wanting. Maybe just a good friend, plus a bit more of an emotional connection and some occasional cuddleing? I have no idea. I suppose I could be okay with some sex if they wanted, but it just seems like it would be a lot less convenient and more awkward than masturbation, and I'm kind of worried that I'd end up liking it too much and would be worse off when I was next single.

In some ways, I'm pretty flexable about potential partners, but in other ways I'm not at all. I don't care very much about appearence, for one thing. Fairly consistenly, I start to find people moderately attractive right around where other people would normally put 3 on the typical bullshit 1 to 10 scale. From maybe 5 to 8 I actually have difficulty judgeing how attractive most people are likely to find them. Even if someone isn't at all atractive to me, I don't think that would be a problem, especially since I'm already fulfilling my sexual needs by myself. During one past lonely phase, I actually tried to condition myself to lower my standards by fapping to steadilly less attractive people. I think it mostly worked. I now find I have much weaker prefferences about things like weight, gender and overall appearence, though I've been unable to overcome some hangups about age and would probably have dificulty dealing with someone more than perhaps 15 or 20 years older than me. On the other hand, I don't think I could ever have a relationship with someone who wasn't of above average inteilligence, with enough similar interests that we'd have things to talk about, a genuine desire to make the world a better place, a more or less rationalist worldview and political viewpoints bassically compatible with mine. Pretty much a slightly stricter version of the requirements I hold potential friends to. If I can't get along with them, I don't really see the point.

Unlike a lot of more typical FAs, I can work around most of my social awkwardness and I don't really care enough about what others think of me to get much social anxiety. I can usually talk to people reasonably well once I get going, though I'm sometimes a bit strange in the way I go about it. I have no dificulty in particular talking with people I'm attracted to. I don't really have a firm grasp of how to turn a friendly aquaintence into a friend, but I seem to manage despite myself. I have no understanding whatsoever of how to flirt, or for that matter how to let someone know I am interested in a relationship with them beyond litterally just telling them that bluntly. Fortunately, I've only ever had that one serious crush and a handful of much weaker ones, so I haven't had much occassion for practice.

This whole thing just feels kind of rediculous and pathetic. It's like every so often some primative somethign or other evolution put in my brain millions of years ago tries to convince me I want something that I shouldn't actually want and have no idea how to get. I'd really like to make it stop. I've done a little research, but haven't found evidence on the internet of a way to turn off that need through some sort of medication or by down-regulating some region of the brain with TDCS or somtheing. For that matter, I suppose I'd kind of like to get rid of my sex drive too so I could save the time I spend on masturbation. I'd also be open to trying to address my occaional desire for a relationship (or whatever it actually is) by giving it what it wants, if I could figure out how to do that, especially in a way that would work for me. I don't really see that happening, though.

What does everyone think? What should I do?

1oukdu,1,2013-10-20,"Help me help a friend. 9 months ago, he [21 M] and his gf of 1 year ended things on a bad note, he's still not comfortable being in large group social situations with her and our mutual friends.",HelpingAFriend321,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oukdu/help_me_help_a_friend_9_months_ago_he_21_m_and/,"Two of my friends dated for about a year, but things ended on bad terms. I am much closer friends with the guy (I'll call him Nick) than I am with the girl (I'll call her Rachel), so I'm looking for advice to give to him.

We are all in college together, and we have many mutual friends that enjoy large group social situations (going out to dinner, throwing parties, going camping, etc). I say ""large"" because there are usually at least 15 people involved when we do something together. None of us really drink much alcohol, in case that means anything for your advice.

Rachel is intelligent and kind, but she is very awkward person. It's actually a group joke (that she's well aware of) that she's just ridiculously awkward, but that's perfectly fine. We're all nerds. Nick is a pretty cool guy; he's athletic, intelligent, and very sweet and caring.

They ended things on pretty bad terms. Basically, it was mutual and their life goals just weren't going to ever be similar, so they called it off, but things just weren't happy or even okay, they were both pretty down about it. Not angry, just sad/upset.

Things were awkward at first, since Nick and Rachel shared so many mutual friends (and because Rachel is so awkward anyway), but eventually our big group events seemed to be back to normal. What we didn't notice was that Nick wouldn't show up to an event if Rachel was going. His excuses always seemed valid, so we didn't put two and two together.

Before we could realize this, summer break happened. Everybody went back home or out of town to an internship. No more big dinners or parties happened until everyone returned in the fall. 

This fall, we've all gotten back together to celebrate birthdays, holidays, etc. on several occasions. I planned a group camping trip. Nick told me not to mention this to the others, but that he wouldn't be going if Rachel was going. That's when it hit me - Nick was avoiding events that involved Rachel. This has happened a few other times in the past two months. Nick gets excited about an upcoming event, but then backs out of going once Rachel decides to join us. 

If for some reason Rachel shows up and Nick is already there, he gets very quiet and shys away from any conversations or interactions with Rachel.

Every year, one of my friends and I throw a big Halloween party at our apartment. This year, as we suspected, Nick told us he wasn't going after he found out that Rachel had told us she was going.

I want to talk to Nick about this - it's been a really long time since they broke up, and our group just isn't the same without him. He's being the awkward one, which is kind of comical since Rachel is inherently way more awkward than he is, but she's fine with being places with him and all of us. 

I want to let him know that I understand his reluctance to hang out with Rachel, but that skipping these events isn't helping him get over it. It would be very easy for him to hang out with us and never have to say a word to her, since there are usually so many of us. I don't want him to feel like he has to miss out on things to avoid an awkward ""hello"" or some other interaction with Rachel. 

Rachel is graduating this December and starting a 2-year-long job rotation in Europe. Once she's gone, this won't be an issue anymore... but it's an issue right now.

I think he'd be fine with things if he started dating someone else, but that hasn't happened. He's not necessarily avoiding meeting new people, but we're pretty busy with school in general and we're graduating soon, so it's hard.

I just don't know how to start a conversation like that. Any ideas? 

**tl;dr**: Friend and his girlfriend ended things on bad terms a long time ago, he's still not comfortable attending large parties/group events if she'll be there."

I didn't really have any feelings for her beyond enjoying her company and finding her a little attractive, but I figuered I might as well try it out and see if it worked out. It lasted about a month before we sort of drifted apart as I got closer to going to college. It never got farther than a little kissing and sort of makeing out. I never got less awkward at it. She had to walk me through bassically everything or I'd just stand there awkwardly not knowing what to do. It was kind of enjoyable at times, but looking back at it I feel like it was a mostly negative experience for me.

Fast forward a couple years. I was living at an occupy encampment for a while, and I ended up with a pretty serious crush on a girl who was sort of on the periphery of the local occupy. She was really nice and friendly, and she turned out to be the sort of person who is very physically affectionate with all of her friends but doesn't really mean anythign by it. Anyway, there were a few nights where we ended up cuddleing mostly to keep warm, or with the excuse that we were trying to keep warm. It was really nice. I sort of lost touch with her after the encampment broke up, but after that I've craved the chance to cuddle with someone again. I mostly try to deal with that with a body pillow. It works pretty well for the most part. Later on, I ended up going to the same conference as her and hangeing out. By that point, I was bassically over my crush on her, but I still let her know that I had had feelings for her at one point. She told me that she didn't recipricate, but it didn't get awkward at all and things bassically immediately went back to the way things were. She's been pretty friendly the handful of times I've seen her after that.

Fast forward another year or two. I met a girl who eventually became a pretty good frined for a while. She decided to pretty much take me on as a project, and offered to teach me about all things sexual. I never took her up on much of that because it just didn't really seem appealing for whatever reason. I found her reasonably attractive, but I guess I was mostly content with dealing with my sexual needs through copious masturbation. The farthest any of that ever got was a little kissing when she was a bit drunk at a party and a few times I saw her in a state of partial or (once) total undress when I was crashing at her place for a while between more permanent housing. We've sort of drifted apart recently because of somethign unrelated.

That brings you more or less up to date on my background. At the moment, I live with two roomates, both of whom are very good friends. One is a late twenties conventional FA type, minus the fact that he has plenty of female friends who he mostly sees as just friends. The other is in her mid to late twenties and seems to be pretty successful romanticly, with a mixture of fairly frequent hookups and some dateing in the past.

I have a few good friends and several circles of people I am sort of friends with. Aside from my roomates and schedualed events with the local hackerspace or the radical political organization I'm part of, I don't do much of anything that isn't solitary. I'm not always sure how fine with that I am. Usually, I don't have any desire to be more social, but sometimes I go through lonely phases where I want to spend more time with people but don't.

I'm going through one of those lonely phases right now. At the moment, I'd kind of like more friends and maybe even a relationship of some sort. The problem is, these aren't things I want to want. I ought to be content with my current situation. I have a good life overall. I have some good friends, I can more or less satisfy my typical social needs just by going through my day to day routine, masturbation is pretty much completely sufficient for dealing with my sexual needs and hugging my body pillow more or less addresses my unfortuante desire for human contact. For some reason, though, I go through these phases where I'm not really satisfied with all that.

I can't even really figure out what a relationship I'd enjoy would even look like. I value my free time too much to want a time commitment much beyond a few hours a week, and even that might become a problem. I have little or no interest in sex with another person and have no interest in all the steriotypical dateing stuff. I'm not sure what exactly it is that I find myself wanting. Maybe just a good friend, plus a bit more of an emotional connection and some occasional cuddleing? I have no idea. I suppose I could be okay with some sex if they wanted, but it just seems like it would be a lot less convenient and more awkward than masturbation, and I'm kind of worried that I'd end up liking it too much and would be worse off when I was next single.

In some ways, I'm pretty flexable about potential partners, but in other ways I'm not at all. I don't care very much about appearence, for one thing. Fairly consistenly, I start to find people moderately attractive right around where other people would normally put 3 on the typical bullshit 1 to 10 scale. From maybe 5 to 8 I actually have difficulty judgeing how attractive most people are likely to find them. Even if someone isn't at all atractive to me, I don't think that would be a problem, especially since I'm already fulfilling my sexual needs by myself. During one past lonely phase, I actually tried to condition myself to lower my standards by fapping to steadilly less attractive people. I think it mostly worked. I now find I  have much weaker prefferences about things like weight, gender and overall appearence, though I've been unable to overcome some hangups about age and would probably have dificulty dealing with someone more than perhaps 15 or 20 years older than me. On the other hand, I don't think I could ever have a relationship with someone who wasn't of above average inteilligence, with enough similar interests that we'd have things to talk about, a genuine desire to make the world a better place, a more or less rationalist worldview and political viewpoints bassically compatible with mine. Pretty much a slightly stricter version of the requirements I hold potential friends to. If I can't get along with them, I don't really see the point.

Unlike a lot of more typical FAs, I can work around most of my social awkwardness and I don't really care enough about what others think of me to get much social anxiety. I can usually talk to people reasonably well once I get going, though I'm sometimes a bit strange in the way I go about it. I have no dificulty in particular talking with people I'm attracted to. I don't really have a firm grasp of how to turn a friendly aquaintence into a friend, but I seem to manage despite myself. I have no understanding whatsoever of how to flirt, or for that matter how to let someone know I am interested in a relationship with them beyond litterally just telling them that bluntly. Fortunately, I've only ever had that one serious crush and a handful of much weaker ones, so I haven't had much occassion for practice.

This whole thing just feels kind of rediculous and pathetic. It's like every so often some primative somethign or other evolution put in my brain millions of years ago tries to convince me I want something that I shouldn't actually want and have no idea how to get. I'd really like to make it stop. I've done a little research, but haven't found evidence on the internet of a way to turn off that need through some sort of medication or by down-regulating some region of the brain with TDCS or somtheing. If any of you has found somethign that works, please let me know. For that matter, I suppose I'd kind of like to get rid of my sex drive too so I could save the time I spend on masturbation. I'd also be open to trying to address it by giving it what it wants, if I could figure out how to do that, especially in a way that would work for me. I don't really see that happening, though.

What does everyone think? What should I do?"

While waiting, I met a very nice young man, and we got to talking. We shared a bit of information about our respective backgrounds, what we were doing in the city, etc.- it was very enjoyable!

So, /r/brussels, in the hopes that one of you might recognize this guy and I can talk to him again, here is what I know about him (without being too specific, I don't want to be THAT weird):

* He's originally from Paris, but recently got his Master's degree from a university in Berlin
* He has a patch of white hair on the back of his head
* He's doing an internship at the European commission

1oua5k,0,2013-10-20,Processing Operation: A microcosm of how Gaijin Continues to Mismanage Game Development,TomCollins7,Warthunder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1oua5k/processing_operation_a_microcosm_of_how_gaijin/,"Sunday morning for Americans, Sunday night for European players, 55,000 online. Everyone is having a good time. And suddenly, we're not. We're unable to connect to queue. We're unable to get out of queue. So we disconnect from the game and reconnect. Now we can't even get back into the game! 

After waiting for 30 minutes, we're finally back in the game, but now we're not connected to chat, and we're being kicked out of the queue. 

And Gaijin has recently stated it wants to add 5,000 planes to the game? That it's going to have multiplatform gaming--computer players with PS4 players? We are less than a month from the launch of the PS4 and Gaijin is living in a dreamworld. 

After what happened today, can there be any doubts as to the seriousness of the problem of how this game is being developed? It seems woefully under-funded--both in terms of in game development, aka introducing proper flight models, public relations with the community base--aka Soon.TM, and with the infrastructure of the servers--aka what happened today.

And Gaijin's attitude is so blaise about all of these issues. They don't see any problem with it.  It doesn't seem to matter to them that FMs take so much time to develop-aka ""Arado is over-performing,"" ""Dora will be fixed in one week,"" ""Sabre F model largely finished,"" or that their servers continually crash, but it does matter to the player base and it will matter to the wave of new players that will come aboard with the PS4 launch. 

People who read this and say: ""But the game is still fun."" Yep. It's awesome, I love it, i'm addicted to it. But the problem here is the opportunity cost: Imagine how much better it could be if the devs took these issues seriously, if they hired the proper amount of people to work on the mechanics of the game and of the server. 

People may also read this and say: You and your crazy conspiracy theories, how can you possibly back up any of the assertions you make in the post? And that's largely correct, but here's the problem: Gaijin could alleviate all of this. They could silence curmudgeons like me from constantly complaining by showing their work. How hard is it to update the stats on the hangar interface? That's something an intern can do in a month. And yet it hasn't been done. And I believe it's because the arrogance of Gaijin has left this game underfunded and poorly developed. "

A pair of siblings from London (Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey) purchase a surprisingly affordable, lonely cliff-top house in Cornwall, only to discover that it actually carries a ghostly price—and soon they’re caught up in a bizarre romantic triangle from beyond the grave. Rich in atmosphere, The Uninvited, directed by Lewis Allen, was groundbreaking for the seriousness with which it treated the haunted-house genre, and it remains an elegant and eerie experience, featuring a classic score by Victor Young.

John Cassavetes was a genius, a visionary, and the progenitor of American independent film, but that doesn’t begin to get at the generosity of his art. A former theater actor fascinated by the power of improvisation, Cassavetes brought his search for truth in performance to the screen. The five films in this collection—all of which the director maintained total control over by financing them himself and making them outside the studio system—are electrifying and compassionate creations, populated by all manner of humanity: beatniks, hippies, businessmen, actors, housewives, strippers, club owners, gangsters, children. Cassavetes has often been called an actor’s director, but this body of work—even greater than the sum of its extraordinary parts—shows him to be an audience’s director in [John Cassavetes: Five Films](http://www.criterion.com/boxsets/558-john-cassavetes-five-films).

A fellow classmate of mine helped me get setup with an internship as of the beginning of september.  The problem was I had a warrant out due to missing a court date for stealing alcohol.  this all happened when i was not doing well at all mentally.  I had a previous weed possession thing happen and had a really bad experience with the court which is why i pretty much had a panick attack when contemplating this court date i had to deal with

I ended up missing court - made another appointment and did the same damn thing again.  The internship i was about to have with Gallo winery fell through after they did their background check ofcourse.  I've since went to court to try and take care of this.  from the looks of it i'm always going to have this petty theft on my record.

at the time i was tryin to steal alcohol - it was when i had a major problem with painkillers and was withdrawling.  ever since losing this job opportunity i've been gettin pressured everyday to get some shitty part time job at mcdonalds or something similiar.  i have about 45 grand in student loans due this november.  The thought of working at a fast food place - the shame i feel from fucking up and missing my earlier court date from years ago - the fact that i truly feel that i have totally killed every single opportunity i've ever had - makes me wanna just off myself. 

i pretty much have it set in my head that if nothing comes through within the next couple months i'm either gonna drive the 90 min. to the golden gate bridge and jump off or take my gpa's gune and shoot myself.   i can't see myself living with this sort of anxiety and shame for the rest of my life.  all i can think about everyday is how muc i've fucked up everything.  

i feel like there is no other way out - despite how hopellesss, anxious, and hatefull i feel towards myself.  i will absolutely not deal with being in default on my student loans and working at a place like Mc. Donalds the rest of my life.  I couldn't live with myself knowning i fucked up such an opportunity.  If nothing shows up in the next few weeks  I will gladly off myself.  Like i said...i couldn't live with myself otherwise.   Anyone else dealt with similiar thoughts?

edit: 

i should make clear - this previous petty theft was from almost 4 years ago now.  i wish i'd just taken care of it now after the consequences that have hit me but that's just wishful thinking.  i had a major problem with smoking weed everyday plus opiates which ajorly affected my quality of life.  as of today i've been off the opiates (morphine pretty much) for 6 weeks and been off the pot for about 8 weeks.  i finally went to court and have started to take care of this petty theft business from my previous stupidity.  but still.  i can't get rid of this shame, regret, and hatred i feel everyday towards my stupidity and fucking  up my life pretty much.  i'm sure you all can understand wanting to off yourself under such a situation. like i said it still scares me -- but the amount of self hatred i feel even more eclipses that fear.  i pretty much made a promise to myself that if no one hires me in the next couple months that i might as well kill myself 0 and jumpin off the golden gate feels like the least painful option i have. after losing this internship with gallo winery i really feel hopeless. i'm kinda drunk right now so i just felt like sharing my thoughts with this subreddit.  meditation helps somewhat - but i still have this sense of hopelessness and self-hatred everyday when i wake up

i just wish i could do it all over again"

1oxdgt,42,2013-10-21,Thoughts on UGA’s injuries and “bad luck” from another perspective.,AlphaMarshan,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1oxdgt/thoughts_on_ugas_injuries_and_bad_luck_from/,"This will probably be lengthy, so bear with me. I wanted to chime in from a different perspective on what I’ve seen the past several seasons regarding your team, you faithful UGA fans.
So I live in Georgia, and most of my friends are UGA fans, so I’m always watching the games with them even though I’m mostly unbiased. One of the things that has been consistent with UGA the past several years, anyone will tell you, is the injuries. Season after season, UGA comes in with a top 10 caliber team, only to lose what feels like half its starters on either side of the ball due to injuries. 

Sure, football is a collision sport, there are bound to be injuries. But really? 2 RBs, 4 starting WRs and how many on the OL? And it's half way through the season? What about the year Stafford came back and a pre-season #1 ranked UGA lost, what was it, 3-4 starters on the OL? Malcolm Mitchell tore his ACL celebrating a TD? Anyone remember the Boise State game? No way those kids could hang with UGA right? In the 2nd quarter UGA players were cramping. In the first game of the season. In a DOME. If it's always bad luck after bad luck, how come LSU or Alabama doesn't suffer injuries to the same extent UGA does? I have truly never seen a team, regardless of conference, suffer injuries year after year the way that UGA does, and I think most UGA fans would agree. I don’t have the time to do all the research on it, but if I would be willing to bet that UGA’s multi-game, season, and career-ending injuries are statistically higher when compared to at least the other teams in the SEC. How many times is UGA going to lose key player after key player before we stop attributing it to just ""bad luck""? Now, keep that in mind as I segue into another topic.
I am a certified strength and conditioning specialist (the CSCS is a standard certification most athletic HR programs look for when they are hiring a strength &amp; conditioning (S&amp;C) coach), and I’ve had the privilege of working as an intern with UMiami’s (you know Richt is an alum right?) basketball and soccer teams, among others. The SEC is, in general, one of the most difficult S&amp;C jobs to land because of its reputation in sports and the expectations they have. You need to have a strong educational background in exercise science (most jobs list “bachelor’s required, master’s preferred – which generally means you better have a master’s, which I do) as well as 3 key certifications: you must be a Certified Strength &amp; Conditioning Specialist by the NSCA, Strength and Conditioning Coach Certified by the CSCCa, and a USA Weightlifting Certified Sports Performance Coach. 

For years, Dave Van Halanger was the director of strength and conditioning at UGA. I'm pretty sure kinesiology/exercise science degrees and research in strength and conditioning probably didn't even exist while he was coaching, but it does now. After being fed up with the conditioning, Van Halanger was moved to ""Director of Player Welfare"" (whatever that is) in 2011 and Joe Tereshinski Jr. was promoted to Director of S&amp;C. The Tereshinski name is engrained at UGA – Something like 4 generations of players have now come through the program. Tereshinski Jr. graduated in 1977 and had been working as an assistant strength coach at UGA since 1982, and he learned everything he knows from whom? You guessed it, Van Halanger. So the UGA administration ditched Van Halanger and instead of hiring a qualified strength and conditioning coach, promoted Tereshinski in-house to director when he wouldn’t have even been looked at as an ASSISTANT based on his lack of appropriate education and/or certifications related to S&amp;C. So now you have a guy running the strength and conditioning program with no background in exercise science/physiology, whose assistants are more educated than he is in proper S&amp;C programming and protocols, and whom have to shut up and do what they’re told because he’s running the program. They brought over John Thomas from Penn State who is a “Master-level strength coach” as deemed by the CSCCa and has to work as an assistant under Tereshinski.

The point is this: something's fishy here and if I were a betting man I'd put money on it that UGA's S&amp;C program bench presses and curls too much, doesn't train sport specifically enough, lacks any sort of mobility screening (FMS maybe?), is dominantly sagittal-planed, programs exercises out of order and in the improper energy systems, and lacks any sort of oversight into auditing the programming. There is a host of S&amp;C protocols that any person formally educated in this field knows by heart and uses in their programming to protect and strengthen the knee and surrounding ligaments to reduce the risk of injury. However, strength and conditioning has always been a ""good ol' boy"" type network, and since the Tereshinski family is literally generational in the UGA system, I don't see him leaving anytime soon, especially with Richt's loyalty to his coaches. I'm not saying that all of the injuries are anyone's fault, but UGA loses WAY more key players when compared to their SEC counterparts like LSU or Alabama, season after season. At some point you have to address your S&amp;C and athletic training programs and figure out if it they are at least contributing to the problem, rather than throw up your hands and saying, “Whelp, bad luck again guys. UGA is just cursed, huh?”

I bet if you put Oregon's S&amp;C coach (Radcliffe) at UGA you would get phenomenal results: better conditioned players, faster, more explosive, and fewer injuries. Oregon doesn't come close to getting the caliber athletes that UGA does, but they've made a NAME for themselves based on their speed and conditioning, and Radcliffe is formally educated and in many ways is a pioneer in S&amp;C, and routinely addresses S&amp;C conferences around the country. 

It’s hard to “prove” anything as anecdotal as improper programming in workouts = more injuries for UGA, but as an unbiased observer I think Tereshinski is part of the problem for why UGA seems to suffer so many injuries and have poor conditioning year after year. If there’s anyone you should be calling to replace, it’s him. Fatigued players are always more susceptible to non-contact knee and hamstring injuries. 
Just my thoughts, thanks for reading.

1ox7uh,15,2013-10-21,Me [24 M] and my girlfriend [23 F] of just over a year broke up yesterday and I have no idea how to deal with this.,Ineedsomeadvice1111,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ox7uh/me_24_m_and_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_just_over_a/,"I'm using a throw away simply because some of my friends figured out my reddit account from a couple stories in previous threads. This happened yesterday, and I've talked to a few friends about it, but I am really not ready to have to repeat the story so many times when people ask what happened.

I used to absolutely love being single.

I could do whatever I wanted, sleep and mess around with whoever I wanted. I had a girlfriend my freshman year of college, and didn't have another one until after I graduated. I never felt lonely or even alone.

But then I met the woman I was in a relationship with until yesterday. I didn't feel trapped like I did in other relationships, there wasn't a girlfriend who was preventing me from living my life the way I wanted, but who made me want to live my life in a way that would make our relationship work. And I loved it. We had the strongest, most supportive, and most loving relationship that I've ever had in my life. For real, about as perfect as any relationship can get.

She moved across the country in late July for an opportunity that was really too good to pass up. We thought we could make the distance thing work, but ended up breaking up about a month and a half in. And I was the one who initiated it, it was just too hard. I think she'd have liked to have tried a little bit longer before we calling it off, but it was about as mutual as a break up can get.

We stayed in contact though. We'd constantly be texting each other, calling each other multiple times through out the day just to talk for a minute and tell each other we loved one another, continued sending letters and gifts to another.

Then she came home to visit last weekend. We spent the entire weekend together, and it was, without a doubt, the best weekend I have had since she moved away. Since the last time I saw her. We spent most of Monday before I drove her back to airport talking very seriously and at a great length about being together again. We didn't start dating, but we agreed to cut off all other people and be exclusive with one another until we figured out whether or not I'd be able to manage to move across the country to be with her. For one of the first times in my life I actually tried my best to make something I wanted to happen happen. Last week, I did my best not to spend any money I didn't have to, put the large majority of my paycheck into savings, applied to several jobs and several paid internships in the city she lives in, called around about apartments. I was going to make this happen because as much as I'd miss my life here, I couldn't imagine missing anyone or anything where I love now more than I've missed her while she has been away.

This past weekend, we both went out with our friends in our respective cities, sending each other the occasional text to say I love you or just talk a little bit about something.

I wake up Saturday morning to a text that we needed to talk.

I call her, she cheated on me.

She said she started to doubt whether or not we were making the right decision, and she was scared about taking this next step in our relationship. Moving for one another, moving in together. So with the nervousness she felt, she made a very terrible and very hurtful mistake. 

I believe that's what happened, and she just didn't think it through. I believe, still, that she is a good person but she did a very bad thing to me, and I can't forgive her.

She tried to send me texts and phone calls through the day on Saturday apologizing and trying to start making conversation. I'd either ignore them or just send back a couple words. I did ignore all the calls, though.

Now, I called her yesterday, which was Sunday. And told her that she ruined what was between us, and that I went from getting mail, phone calls, packages, texts, and hoping it was her and being unable to prevent a smile when it was. Know, those same things, hearing from her just makes me some sort of crazy combination of sad, depressed, betrayed, and angry.

So I told her that I couldn't have her in my life anymore, not even as friends, and not even to try to fix this. Maybe I'd consider it if we were in the same place, but this isn't something I think we can fix from a distance. I want her in my life, so badly, but it's not good for me. As long as she is in my life, I'm going to be in love with her, but our relationship will never be the same again and I need to get over her. And need her out of my life, at least for now, to do that.

But it's so hard. I want to call her and hear her voice, but so far have refrained. In the time I was with her, I went operating great as a single man, to relying so heavily on her always being there and helping me, supporting me, loving, hugging, kissing me. I know this is something I have to go through alone, but it's the first thing I've had to alone in so long that I don't know how to do it. 

I just want someone there to cuddle with and talk to while I fall asleep, someone to call when I have good news, or bad news.

I don't want to be alone anymore, and I don't know what to do.

Sorry for the wall of text, I wrote this hoping to ask for advice. Maybe I just wanted the catharsis of typing it out and letting anyone and everyone read it, because I don't even know what to ask for, any support or advice, or insight into how I'm supposed to do this?

1ox55p,16,2013-10-21,[HALLOWEEN THANKS] to swiftieatheart for the most amazing box ever!,riotcoming,PolishGauntlet,https://www.reddit.com/r/PolishGauntlet/comments/1ox55p/halloween_thanks_to_swiftieatheart_for_the_most/,"[the entire gallery is available for viewing [here](http://postimg.org/gallery/b4864whk/); fair warning, this is going to be long. TL;DR: I got spoiled rotten.]

So I'm an intern here at Walt Disney World, and let me tell you, kittens, it is not sunshine and rainbows and happy cartoon characters all the time. It is hot, it is humid, and we interns work the crappy shifts for mere peanuts. On top of that, NO NAIL POLISH ALLOWED unless it's super boring and conservative. Think nudes and pale pinks. UGH. BORING.

I still have toes, though, so I can indulge in a little bit of lacquery fun.

ANYWAY. Halloween is the greatest holiday ever, because the day after is the best regular day ever. (Hello, half-off Halloween candy? Get in my basket, then in my belly.) So of course I jumped at the chance to be a part of this exchange.. partly to spoil someone, and partly to get spoiled. And boy, did I get spoiled.

But first, let me tell you a little story. Since I'm an intern I live in Disney housing, which *some people* refer to as Mauschwitz. There are rules upon rules upon rules. No candles, no incense, no posters, no stickers, no deliveries, no moving the furniture around, no toy weapons including lightsabers (we can buy them at the parks but we can't bring them home), no streaming or copyright infringing of anything, etc. The no deliveries part is where our story begins. All mail gets dropped off at the front desk of our complex, and we're emailed to pick up our packages. My giftee told me on Sunday that my package had arrived Friday, and after some mild hair-tearing frustration, my package was found. The guy behind the desk was like ""um, riotcoming? Is that you?""

Yes, that's me. Would you like an autograph? I always have time for my biggest fans.

""Next time have them send the package with your real name. We almost returned it. We've been trying to contact you all weekend.""

Which explains why my roommate and I both had approximately 0 e-mail notifications that a package for our apartment had been delivered. 

SO. I had the package, and I had 20 minutes before I had to hustle off to work. I rushed back to my apartment and opened it, and saw [this](http://s23.postimg.org/hhqo7x64b/image_9.jpg) waiting for me. Such a cute decorated box, and look! Candy!

I pull the box out and it's been [decorated](http://s23.postimg.org/vhsq027uj/image_17.jpg)  [on](http://s23.postimg.org/e9m6uvjuj/image_15.jpg) [all](http://s23.postimg.org/mzeohzby3/image_11.jpg) [sides](http://s23.postimg.org/hf277cd2z/image_8.jpg). So cute!

I open it up and.. what's this? [More candy?](http://s23.postimg.org/b3wzqxbuj/image_7.jpg)

[Everything out of the box](http://s23.postimg.org/gi0dc7qyj/image_12.jpg).

I had to know who spoiled me first, so I opened [the](http://s23.postimg.org/z15gydvsr/image_3.jpg) [card](http://s23.postimg.org/xu0pxnkfv/image_16.jpg) and discovered that /u/riotcomingtrickster is /u/swiftieatheart !!!

So let's see the haul, shall we?

First up, the two delightful jars. She was sweet enough to remember that 1) I LOVE pumpkin everything, and 2) I really like for my gifters to send a little piece of home with them. I try to do the same for my gift packages, to give a little piece of me with every gift. Behold, [pumpkin butter](http://s23.postimg.org/ga851yqm3/image_10.jpg) and [apple butter](http://s23.postimg.org/uzsz6gsvv/image_1.jpg)! I love pumpkin and apple butter, and could not have been a more perfect gift. My roommate was jealous until I told her I'd share the apple butter.

As for the nail polish haul:

Just then, one of the lead programmers steps forward...""Yeah, sir...we have a...uh...small problem. None of the guys were going to say anything about it, but I think it's time we came clean.""

""See, some of the guys...to be honest, it was just Dave...thought it would be funny to throw in this stupid mural on Mt Chiliad. It has a stick figure of a guy with a jetpack on it.""

""So, what's the problem?""

""Well, sir, this one stupid picture has sparked an internet witchhunt which has taken on Machiavellan proportions. People are spending hundreds of gameplay hours looking for some jetpack now, but there's not really any jetpack in the game.""

As the exectutive dismisses the rest of the team, a few coders stay behind and open up /r/chiliadmystery to show their boss. The coders are then asked to leave while the boss begins to read the posts.

Cut to 24 hours later, the executive reconvenes the staff for a new meeting.

""Ok guys, new topic...I haven't slept in 20 hours. I've driven the Space Docker to every place I can think of and honked every custom horn. One of you assholes better come clean right now and tell me how to find this jetpack.""

""Sir, that's just it...there IS no jetpack. We never thought it would become this...""

""YOU SHUT YOUR GODDAMN PIEHOLE JOHNSON! IT's RIGHT THERE ON THE FUCKING PICTURE! NOW, I SAY AGAIN, ONE OF YOU ASSHOLES START SPITTING OUT THE ANSWER...I'M GOING TO COUNT TO 5....1, 2, 3...""

""Sir, but there's really...""

""THE NEXT WORDS YOU SAY WILL BE YOUR LAST HERE, JOHNSON, I'm WARNING YOU...""

As the camera fades out, we faintly hear Zach, the intern, as he chuckles to himself....""Classic fucking Dave."""

Looking for any type of IT internship for the coming summer. I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking to do in the industry so hands on experience seems like a ideal solution. OKC jobs preferred but willing to travel some.
1owlp4,1,2013-10-21,[25/f] I want a career and he [30/m] is offering me what any girl should want.,ihearditinalullaby,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1owlp4/25f_i_want_a_career_and_he_30m_is_offering_me/,"I have known him for years but we only went on two dates a year apart - but then somehow we started talking on the phone/skype all the time and I found I missed him if we didn't talk. But still I felt we were in the getting to know each other phase when he flew across the Pacific to visit me where I have relocated for work.

We had a great time spending a weekend exploring a new city neither of us had ever visited. If we lived in the same city (or um, continent) I would be hoping for a lot more dates :)

He wants me to move back to N. America with him at the end of my internship where he will comfortably take care of us and I would ""only have to work if I want to."" We made lists of the parts of the world we want to visit with promises to see them all. He loves me and is willing to wait for me until my contract ends in June.

I thought I needed a career to feel financially stable enough to reach my eventual goal of starting a family. Now here I am at this internship with a very high chance of being offered a full-time, two-year contract... and all of a sudden I realize I actually LOVE my work.

I could look for work in his city but the language difference would be a disadvantage for me. Not impossible - but here I am very likely to get that really nice ""2 years full-time experience"" added on my resume... which would probably then find me a job back in his city afterwards, or at least into a masters degree at school there.

I see a lot of potential with this guy but the reality is that it isn't there yet - he says he loves me and I cannot genuinely return the feelings, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. I can still look for a job when I'm with him its just going to be a much harder search there.

Contracts come up in a month for next year and I am SO torn.

tl;dr Do I renew my contract and take the stable job or move home for a man who loves me and will allow me to live a life of luxury except that I'm not sure yet how I feel about him?

...well now that I say that it seems rather clear, doesn't it."

Gaming? Photoshop? Web browsing? etc. If you need a Workstation, be specific on the programs you'll be using. Try to list as many games/applications that you'll be using as you can, as well as your performance goals for those programs.

Mostly gaming and general PC use, I'd be playing mostly RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas but I would like to be able to run BF4 on decent settings. 

&gt;What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?

450 Euros is the max I'd like to spend, but I'd prefer to stay around 400 if at all possible, if not I can try to expand my budget.

&gt;When do you plan on building/buying the PC? (note: if you're planning on buying more than 2 weeks from now, it's very much recommended you wait and come back then, to ensure you get the most recent and accurate price data)

I'd like to buy and build within the next couple weeks, however I can wait as long as December and then I need the machine for a class.

&gt;What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? ""Everything"" is not specific enough. Tower, Operating System, peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, and monitor(s), wifi adapter, speakers/headphones, etc. are all relevant.

I would need a keyboard and I'd like Windows 7, but 8 is ok with me.

&gt;Which country will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in the US, are you near a Microcenter store?

Germany, in the area near Stuttgart

&gt;If reusing any parts, what parts will you be reusing? Please be especially specific about the power supply. List make and model. If you have a monitor, list the size/resolution.

None

&gt;Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

Nix

&gt;If there's any specific features you want/need from the rig, please list them. Examples might include rear and/or front-panel USB 3.0, a RAID setup, etc.

Front panel USB 3.0 would be a plus, possibly 3.5mm jacks for audio/mic but those can be on the back if need be.

&gt;Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?

A window would be useful as I intend to rebuild/build the computer with a class at school, I can be flexible to maintain price. Also I'd like to avoid a full size tower as I have to either bring this with me on the plane or ship it back to the United States.

&gt;Do you already have a legit and reusable/transferable OS key/license? If yes, what OS?

No

&gt;Extra info or specifics:

I'll need to take this computer back with me to the USA so light weight mid size components would be awesome but not entirely necessary, I'm on an internship in Germany until July and I aim to teach a  class how to build a computer. "
1owf2m,1,2013-10-21,Understanding Education Leadership,mohangohade,news,https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1owf2m/understanding_education_leadership/,"There are many who claim to be leading education service providers specialize in offering unique programs for those aspiring to build bright careers. In fact, it is these claims that lead to a mad rush during admissions to MBA.  Claiming to be the best business school and being unable to offer a business management degree that justifies this stance, is often a case of betrayal that students face in several management colleges. The MBA in India has evolved from being just an extension of graduation programs to the much coveted management degree that allows students to realize their dreams of making big careers. However, in this long history of evolution it is a challenging task to find those who have truly established their legacy of education leadership. This becomes an even more challenging role when you shift focus to a relatively niche degree like the MBA IT Specialization. 
In fact, this concern is replicated in the industry as well. When Steve jobs started his career, people questioned his qualification and abilities. Today, he is almost a demigod for anyone who is an IT fan. His thought leadership was not the result of an overnight transformation. It takes effort, dedication and a lot of hard work even for management colleges to prove their education leadership. By claiming to be education leaders, the management colleges promise students an academic infrastructure that is at par with world class academic training. In fact, for niche programs like MBA IT specialization, the education leadership for management colleges can be established only by proving their mettle in terms of giving students internship opportunities and features like project management training. After all, it is these features that are pivotal to a student’s differentiation in the regular IT crowd. 
Now that we have told you about the various parameters that go into deciding the education leadership of even the best business school, ask yourself how many of the candidates actually fulfill these criteria? There are many PGDM colleges in Pune but how many of them are able to justify their claim of providing proper academic training and industry exposure. When you start this probe, you will realize how the PGDM in pune is a very generic search and is rarely able to give the student an opportunity to realize their dream. However, the situation is not all that grim. There are colleges like Symbiosis Center for Information Technology located in the IT hub of Pune that have been silently continuing their pursuit of academic excellence by providing world class academic training to the MBA IT specialization students. 
Yes! SCIT is recognized as one of the best business schools in the country for the IT specialization. In fact, recently SCIT was recognized for its pioneering contribution when it received the Dainik Bhaskar National Education Leadership Award. This is an addition to the existing list of accolades that SCIT has earned in its pursuit of academic excellence. So, if you think that the MBA In IT is your call than SCIT can be your golden ticket to transform your future. http://www.scit.edu

Info about [Anamanaguchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamanaguchi):

Anamanaguchi is an American chiptune rock band from New York City, that ""makes loud, fast music with a NES from 1985."" The band has four members: lead songwriter and guitarist Peter Berkman, bassist James DeVito, guitarist Ary Warnaar and drummer Luke Silas.

The name ""Anamanaguchi"" came about from a member in one of Berkman's former bands pronouncing gibberish in the style of Jabba the Hutt; the band has also explained it as coming from the members' internships at Armani (Berkman and DeVito), Prada (Warnaar), and Gucci (Silas) while studying fashion at Parsons School of Design, though three of the four majored in Music Technology at New York University.

Like other chiptune artists, Anamanaguchi creates music using video game hardware from the mid-to-late 1980s: namely an NES and a Game Boy. Berkman has stated that their music isn't just based around video game music and that much of it is inspired by ""[s]imple pop stuff, like Weezer and the Beach Boys.""

The band composed music for the video game adaptation of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game. The soundtrack for the game was released on Amazon and iTunes by ABKCO Records on August 24, 2010. The soundtrack debuted at No. 3 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart (aka Soundscan's New Artist Chart). Two tracks from Dawn Metropolis (""Blackout City"" and ""Mermaid"") were also used for the Bit.Trip Runner soundtrack. In October 2010 it was announced that Anamanaguchi would appear in the music video game, Rock Band, with the track ""Airbrushed"". The band's song ""Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues"" is the current theme to Chris Hardwick's The Nerdist Podcast. Anamanaguchi's second LP Endless Fantasy came out on May 14, 2013 and debuted at No. 1 on the aforementioned Heatseekers chart. 

On May 3, 2013, Anamanaguchi provided a Kickstarter project for their album Endless Fantasy. In just 11 hours, their funding goal of $50,000 was reached. At the end of its run, the project was backed by 7,253 people who contributed to raising a grand total of $277,399, making it the second most-successful music project to be funded on Kickstarter at the time, behind that of singer Amanda Palmer.

I'm a Junior in college right now, and I know I dont have real problems like a lot of other people here, but I do want to vent.

I'm supposed to go home in November for thanksgiving and that's okay, but after that I'm supposed to go home for two months in the winter and I just don't want to. I want to stay here or I want to go somewhere else. I feel like I'm drawn home by default because there's no better option. I wish there was; I wish I had a good plan to get out and experience something completely unfamiliar, but I don't. I have an internship and class and then I go home, but I want to have something else that keeps me here, or puts me somewhere new.

I know what's waiting for me at home. It's not bad by any means. I'll hang out with all my friends from the first 20 years of my life. I'll spend christmas with my family. I'll have awkward encounters with my ex-gf, and I'll go to bed at 4am every night and wake up at noon. I'll have some great times and then I'll come back here and wait until the summer where hopefully I'll stay and work. 

But I don't want that and I'm worried that things are taking me in that direction. I don't want to go back to New York City, I want to start my own life. I just have no idea how to start. I know my parents would probably support me if I had a good plan, but I don't.

I want to remove myself before I'm the last person asking where everyone else went. I want to leave before everyone leaves me. Fuck, I don't want this to be about anybody, but I don't want to be bailed on once I'm not an everyday aspect of someone's life. I don't want to let anybody treat me like my ex-gf and my best friend have been.

I need a fucking plan to bust out and really drop off of everyone's radar for awhile. Learn about who I am and who I can be. Sorry for the rant."

I know these posts get old, but I don't have a bunch of time to research my best options so I wanted to ask for some help. I'm looking to get the most bang for my buck, but I'll toss out a 'soft' limit of $1700. 

I do know the benefits of solid state over HDD, but if you're going to advocate that, could you at least give me an idea of what to do with a pretty big stash of movies/music I have?

My requirements:

-A Windows partition to learn VisualBasic on for an upcoming internship.

-MatLab

-A suite of CAD programs

I use Spotify a lot, so I guess that could help with the music issue. Then it becomes an issue of the TV shows and movies I have. I don't think I'll run in to hard drive space with the technical stuff I'll be doing on my laptop as code takes up hardly any space.

rMBP? old cMBP? Any engineers here that can chime in?

Just knowing you are not alone brings so much motivation and commitment to excel. Now let me share with you my personal changes and success over the past 8 months.


Background info (you can skip this if you want): I am a 20 year old full time college student. I began NoFap in March of this year and it took me five months before I was able to get past those first two weeks of NoFap. I have come a long ways, relapses for me were often but now I will never go back.


**My success**


* Right now I am doing the best I ever have in school. I have an increase in energy, concentration and a strong drive for success. My mind is clear and I feel fully in control of my life.


* I have been LIVING. By that I mean I have been going out and enjoying new experiences. I have picked up new hobbies such as skateboarding, longboarding, flirting with new girls, working out, meeting new people, going out to concerts and other events. I use to avoid social situations as much as possible, but now I genuinely enjoy surrounding myself with new people.


* I have improved myself, achieved a true sense of happiness and set incredible goals for my future. Last week I landed a highly competitive internship for this upcoming summer. Without having the mindset I have now, there is not the slightest chance I would have been able to do so. I got the internship entirely through networking, which was the result of surrounding myself with new people.


* During all this I have started a small business. I would consider it more of a hobby, but it is my sole source of income as of right now. It's a great feeling being able to support yourself, especially when your parents are struggling financially.


* This brings me to my final point, sex. **My ED is completely gone** and I have enjoyed intimate encounters with beautiful women of different types. This is what we all started for, and I can tell you that YES this is the cure.


I am truly living for the first time in my life. I am full of happiness and energy. I bring others up with me as much as I can. I have stopped smoking weed (previous daily smoker), improved my health and physical attractiveness. I have made more friends in the past three months than I have in my entire life, especially lady friends ;)


With that being said, I hope this motivates you to stick to your goal. KEEP GOING NEVER GIVE UP. Remember, it took me five months before I passed day 14. The moment I did I told myself I would never go back. I am now on day 71. I would consider myself fully recovered and in the best physical and mental health of my life.



One of my favorite quotes that would keep me going: ""If you can dream it, you can do it."" - Walt Disney.


Best of luck to you all!"

Official league games will start on the weekend of November 23rd. Coordinators should finalize recruiting their teams and rosters for their Division 1 teams and Division 2 teams. Be sure that each member of your team has a valid university email address to be verified as a student. Any exceptions to registration will be handled on a case by case basis and should be submitted to admin@cstarleague.com. Teams are expected to commit to the entire season of games, and some teams may be penalized if they forfeit excessively after registering for the league.

Teams will be sorted into groups determined by their region (we will do our best to accommodate). Games will be played once a week over the course of the season, and the top teams in each group will advance to the playoff bracket which will be played through the final portion of the season. Number of groups and who advances will be determined by the number of teams that register for each game.

We are aiming to have the CSL Finals be played live at the end of May, or in June, pending venue availability and locations!

**Regional LANs**

Yes! Regional LAN events are back! We have two Regional LANs lined up for this season.
*Late January, 2014* - West Coast Regional @ San Jose State University
*Early March, 2014* - East Coast Regional @ University of Maryland, College Park
We'll be announcing exact details in the next month or two for how you can register to attend, prize information, and stipend applications.

**FAQ**

*What's new this season?* We'll be offering **Division 1** and **Division 2** play. Division 1 will be for teams who are more competitive, Division 2 will be for casual play. The choice to enter Division 1 is voluntary, there will be no up-downs, or anything of the sort. Anyone who wants to field a competitive team can do so. Teams can have both a Division 1 and Division 2 team in the league (players can't swap between teams)!
*What are scrims?* Think 1 match a week of collegiate action isn't enough for you? We can solve your problem! You will be able to challenge any team to a scrimmage (either ranked or unranked) to get your fix. Ranked scrims will count for a team's ELO and may qualify teams for additional tournaments and prizes. Unranked are purely for fun - teams can also have some flexibility in choosing their own formats.

*What's taking so long?* We're trying to build a website that doesn't exist anywhere in eSports. We're not running off a template - everything on our site is custom built, and specially designed. The scope of the project is pretty large, and unfortunately, we lack the funds to pay a development team to work full time. Our dev team consists of two interns who are also full time students and have to balance their work on the CSL website with their own school and work. This means that we haven't been able to finish as quickly as expected - but we are working hard! If you are an experienced Ruby developer looking for an internship or interesting career opportunity - please email duran@cstarleague.com for info!

*What's the prize pool?* CSL is no longer working under a corporate entity (Azubu), and as such, will be funding the season ourselves. This means we are currently raising money to host all the events and fund all the prizes that we can. When we have funding confirmed, we will announce prizes for the year. Currently, we have earmarked budgets for each of the Regional LAN events and are looking for sponsors to be able to fund a live finals and prize pool for the season. Stay tuned for more updates as 2014 rolls around. We won't announce anything until we have the funds fully confirmed because we want to avoid the headache of delayed prize payouts and uncertainty.

Please note, our goal here is transparency. We want to be honest with the community about where we stand, what we're doing, and what we want to contribute to the community. We hope that this will be the best year yet for CSL and our amazing staff will be working hard to put on a show for everyone.

Stay tuned to our social media channels and website for updates on the process and stand by with your teams.

Graduating Senior seeking post graduate advice",hrunge,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1p02xd/hello_raccounting_graduating_senior_seeking_post/,"My dilemma began with interviewing with a small yet lucrative CPA/Consulting firm here in FL for a full time gig after graduating in this December, and after completing various assessments based on personality, excel, quickbooks, and basic accounting knowledge, luncheons and after a weekend excursion they decided to hire me on with one condition- I needed to be more confident.

As my first day began, I completed compilations for quarter year financials, sent checks within QuickBooks, filed both corporate and personal tax returns and asked as many questions as I could to further gain insight into the field. They were really big on asking questsion- ""You can't get fired for asking questions"" is their working motto...

After three weeks of 'interning' I was let go due to lack of experience. Throughout the interview process they picked my brain and asked me as many questions as they could and I was honest with them about my lack of practical experience, but they seemed all about personality. I was devasted when they told me the news. And whilst beginning what I thought was my real, post-graduate career I missed a HUGE (I cannot stress this enough) Career Fair at my University where all the major firms were set up. This being said I missed all networking opportunities and did not apply to these firms on the school's career website.

So here I am, 2 months until graduation, with three internships under my belt with a 3.1/4 dual major in Accounting and Finance, and it looks as if I have no hope to score any type of internship or entry-level position with a Big 4 firm or any larger regional firms in my area.

I applied online to Deloitte, with the hopes of writing a large essay in the Additional Information section this could help me score some points with the reviewer, but that is where I currently set.

Reddit, do I have any hope pursuing a full-time gig with the top companies, or should I focus on the CPA or MST and stay in academics for a year longer? 
I am in knots about this. I hope you great people can provide some hope and insight!

TL;DR: /b/ lost potential career opportunity two months before graduation. Missed all networking possibilities this recruiting season 


Thanks again,

This December I plan to quit my job, finally take some solid time off for once, travel back to London to see my girlfriend, and also achieve my dreams by interning in one of the worlds best restaurants.  I already had a taste of it not too long ago, built the connection, now I am OK'd to go back and continue for how ever long I want.  This is both beneficial to me, and my resume/CV.

The thing is, I don't have much time to save up for it to really make a good impact.  The longer I stay working, the better it'll be.  I'll only have  around $2900 after money is spent on the ticket, some of that has to go to my hostel lodging which will be the cheapest, anywhere from $4-600.  

I'll also need some money reserved for when I get back, since I'll need a job once I return.  I plan to be free in the summer when the girlfriend comes to visit, which I'll need money for, as soon as she leaves after two months I've planned another internship that's an 8 month commitment in another worlds best restaurant in Spain.  

How do I go about achieving this with such limited funds?  I'm afraid I'll have to sell some things, maybe my father may be able to help but I'm not counting on it.  I'm 25 in May, is this time to pull out my first loan to be able to accomplish my dreams for my career? A lot of accomplished Chefs say it's better to pull out a loan to do exactly what I'm doing rather than 40,000 to go to a culinary school that doesn't matter.  My moms credit isn't too hot, I don't think she'd co sign.  My father has never been in my life until I went to internship a few months back, he helped out with that.  So I doubt he'd co sign either.  

I'm kind of lost, but I need this.  It's time.  I can't be interning when I'm a couple years older.  Especially if I plan to propose to my girlfriend in the year coming, and by the time a couple years passes, I'll need solid income coming in to be able to pay for all the visa processing fees. 

I bet you're thinking to just not quit my job, and cancel on this? What are my options do you think? I'd appreciate any input!

1ozykn,3,2013-10-22,CSL Registration begins November 2nd!,jadedshock,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ozykn/csl_registration_begins_november_2nd/,"Registration for the Collegiate Starleague will be open on November 2nd for League of Legends, as well as our other supported titles. Official league games will start on the weekend of November 23rd. Coordinators should finalize recruiting their teams and rosters for their Division 1 teams and Division 2 teams. Be sure that each member of your team has a valid university email address to be verified as a student. Any exceptions to registration will be handled on a case by case basis and should be submitted to admin@cstarleague.com. Teams are expected to commit to the entire season of games, and some teams may be penalized if they forfeit excessively after registering for the league. 


Teams will be sorted into groups determined by their region (we will do our best to accommodate). Games will be played once a week over the course of the season, and the top teams in each group will advance to the playoff bracket which will be played through the final portion of the season. Number of groups and who advances will be determined by the number of teams that register for each game.

**Regional LANs**


Yes! Regional LAN events are back! We have two Regional LANs lined up for this season. 


*Late January, 2014* - West Coast Regional @ San Jose State University 


*Early March, 2014* - East Coast Regional @ University of Maryland, College Park


We'll be announcing exact details in the next month or two for how you can register to attend, prize information, and stipend applications. 


**FAQ**


*What's new this season?* We'll be offering **Division 1** and **Division 2** play. Division 1 will be for teams who are more competitive, Division 2 will be for casual play. The choice to enter Division 1 is voluntary, there will be no up-downs, or anything of the sort. Anyone who wants to field a competitive team can do so. Teams can have both a Division 1 and Division 2 team in the league (players can't swap between teams)! 


*What are scrims?* Think 1 match a week of collegiate action isn't enough for you? We can solve your problem! You will be able to challenge any team to a scrimmage (either ranked or unranked) to get your fix. Ranked scrims will count for a team's ELO and may qualify teams for additional tournaments and prizes. Unranked are purely for fun - teams can also have some flexibility in choosing their own formats. 


*What's taking so long?* We're trying to build a website that doesn't exist anywhere in eSports. We're not running off a template - everything on our site is custom built, and specially designed. The scope of the project is pretty large, and unfortunately, we lack the funds to pay a development team to work full time. Our dev team consists of two interns who are also full time students and have to balance their work on the CSL website with their own school and work. This means that we haven't been able to finish as quickly as expected - but we are working hard! If you are an experienced Ruby developer looking for an internship or interesting career opportunity - please email duran@cstarleague.com for info! 


*What's the prize pool?* CSL is no longer working under a corporate entity (Azubu), and as such, will be funding the season ourselves. This means we are currently raising money to host all the events and fund all the prizes that we can. When we have funding confirmed, we will announce prizes for the year. Currently, we have earmarked budgets for each of the Regional LAN events and are looking for sponsors to be able to fund a live finals and prize pool for the season. Stay tuned for more updates as 2014 rolls around. We won't announce anything until we have the funds fully confirmed because we want to avoid the headache of delayed prize payouts and uncertainty. 


Please note, our goal here is transparency. We want to be honest with the community about where we stand, what we're doing, and what we want to contribute to the community. We hope that this will be the best year yet for CSL and our amazing staff will be working hard to put on a show for everyone. 


Stay tuned to our social media channels and website for updates on the process and stand by with your teams.

1ozju8,2,2013-10-22,"I think unpaid internships are mere idiocy by the ""interns"" and that they need to look no farther than a mirror to assign blame. CMV",[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ozju8/i_think_unpaid_internships_are_mere_idiocy_by_the/,"I'm a senior graduating from college this year with a degree in computer science.  I've never had an unpaid internship.  I've never even had a ""real"" internship - I basically worked at summer camps for the fun of it during the summer.  I have multiple job offers at high salaries from top companies.

1. Unpaid internships are often in fields where there are more people looking for jobs than jobs.  Many many many more people.  To be honest, you should have studied something else in college.

2. Unpaid internships really don't mean shit on your resume unless they are from one of the very top employers in your field.  Seriously, your academics achievements and your interviews are SO SO SO SO much more important.

3. When you accept unpaid internships, you sometimes take a job away from a paid employee.  You're 20 year old self creates the problems you have at 25.

In short, this is my rant.  Just stop taking unpaid internships.  Value your last few summers before having a real job and do something fun like camp."
1ozhj3,1,2013-10-22,Any direction seems hopeless.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ozhj3/any_direction_seems_hopeless/,"My position is in no way life threatening. However, let me just vent.

I am in school for a second bachelors, but I am slowly failing out.

My last degree was in animation, but I never went further because the options were either get further away from actual animation for take yet another internship. 

Lastly, while at university, I also studied abroad, fell for a broad, and now she is teaching in Japan. All I can think about is how to get over there. We are just friends, but I fell for the country as well. There are programs I can go for. 

Currently, I am doing a programming project last minute.
Let me just add that I hate my college. Being a freshman for a second time may seem like joy to others, but I don't want to be messing with kids. Even though, I am a pretty much a kid myself. 

So I guess the question is, ""Where should a mid twenties student go to find some peace of mind?""

So far, I think I am done with education even though it is mid semester."
1oz26x,7,2013-10-22,"I am a fresh postgrad based in Kent, UK. I am confused about what I want to do with my life, afraid of the future, I don't know what job I want to do (never really knew), I don't have any relevant experiences on my CV and generally I am starting to feel depressed because of this...",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oz26x/i_am_a_fresh_postgrad_based_in_kent_uk_i_am/,"Sorry for the wall of text, but I feel I really need to get this off my chest and this sub has it in its name so...


I feel an incredible confusion, a mixture of feelings, fear and uncertainty... I don't know what to do. I might be writing this in a non-chronological order as my mind is currently flying around the place... It is raining outside, I am sitting here, writing this, listening to some music and I have to remark, I did not cry for some time... I believe I did not cry for a year, but now I am....

This month, I graduated and obtained my Masters degree at the University of Kent in American Studies. My bachelor's degree is from History with International relations. I have always lacked this kind of force which would drive me forward towards something concrete I would like to do. This was going on I think since primary school. At the end when we had to choose the direction of our secondary education/college (this was in the different country - I came to the UK for my university studies). I did not know what direction to go so I took a generally aimed course of study, doing a bit of everything, which would in the end provided me with more time while I discover what I'd like to do. Apart from classic teenage thoughts of doing this and that (never really a good idea when you only think you know how the world works, but you actually don't), the feeling of being certain in doing something concrete, having a strong interest in something I like, it has never come to me. Thus I have learned the truth, that is, I don't know what to do with my life really. I always liked History stuff, so I wanted to study history. My father rightly told me to take something else with it, so I decided for International relations as well. I liked what I was doing, the course was really interesting and I actually enjoyed it for the most part. In the third year of my undergrad I discovered a hidden interest for Cuba and Latin American affairs... The overall American reality got me hooked and based on it, as I again had to make that decision what to do. I have decided for American Studies to be able to explore further the realities of the Americas, mostly Cuban - US relations, and the historical perspective of Latin America.... Also I did not want to continue directly in political sciences because of all that theory. This probably is not even important, sorry for writing it... 


The point is, I am confused and scared, afraid of what is to come... I am trying to think about my possibilities and what I want to do in the future. I know for certain that I want to stay in the UK cos I love the country, the culture, the people and almost everything about the UK. I always had.. that also was the reason why I chose to come here for studies. This is not a problem though, as I can legally stay as long as I want (EU stuff), at least for now...

Throughout my studies and even before, I was always very introverted, quiet and shy out of my comfort zone. The UK studies were not an exception. When I came, the first year, I have barely came out of my room and did not talk when I did not have to. I don't know why, I am not like that anymore, I have changed and thoughts about this make me sad as I know I have missed a lot probably. This was better in the second year, although not perfect at all as well. You see, the problem is that because of this, simultaneously with perhaps meeting new friends, I have also missed the opportunities to socialize and get a job back then, to volunteer, being a part of some student entrepreneur groups and so on... This is what makes me desperate the most, the stupidity of this. 


Eventually, during the third year, I started to speak with more and more people, my English has improved substantially, I have became a volunteer for London 2012 Olympic ceremonies, and got a proper part-time job as a cleaner. I have this job till now, in August after a series of rounds in an interview I managed to be able to switch to full-time. I also have to mention that I managed to have some small jobs like Christmas casual in 2010 as a till assistant, and in 2011 in Royal Mail as a mail sorter. These things lasted from one to two weeks respectively. Not that much experience gotten from them. 

I was always handing around some CVs in town when I could before I found the work as a cleaner... no that I did not try. I don't know I tried to do my best, not having an experience on the CV and maybe those people in the shops knew I am not confident. I tried to look like that but, somehow they might have seen through me... but I tried.


I think I live in an unhealthy environment as well. I live with people I can consider friends and good friends both... Mostly colleagues from work actually. One my supervisor... the point is, they are all older then me, I am 24 and they are all 29 and more. They don't have any goals in life as it seems... They just go to work, earn money and live on. I don't want to do that... I want to do something, I just want an opportunity to be able to achieve something. I just don't know what to do... It is all so confusing... looking through those jobs, opportunities, volunteerings internships, there is always something what makes me unsuitable or some restrictions I have like some good stuff appears but it is located too far for me to be able to go there. I am afraid to just go and risk everything for an opportunity I don't know THAT much about. I need my job, I need to support myself, and it took me almost three years to find an income. I don't want to lose it again, especially when I see how stupidly hard it is to get even volunteering.... I have applied for an offer on a page offering volunteerings and they wrote me back that I need SKILLS and EXPERIENCE to be able to even register with them. How the fuck am I supposed to get an experience when I need some even for a volunteering???


How can I get out of this vicious circle? I have already caused too much pain to my parents because of my recklessness and despite them always supporting me, I cannot ask them for any financial support because of my stupidity couple of years ago... It pains me so much because I have to give them the money they spent on me previously back, but for that I need a good job and an opportunity to earn money but I don't see how now... 


Because of this I have decided to do this... to keep the job I have now no matter how much money it brings (around £1000) and at the same time, to try to get a volunteering or an internship and earn money while improving my CV... The job starts in the evenings, at 5pm, so I have all mornings and afternoons to do something else. That was the plan when I applied for a full-time position there. So I am constrained to this place, I need money to survive but as it seems, it does not provide me with opportunities to improve chances for a better living. I want to buy a cheap car to be more mobile and increase chances to find some opportunities... but I don't really have money for it either.. I need to save as much as possible. 

That is also a plan. To save as much as I can and then try to move somewhere else, bigger place, maybe Brighton or something where I can do something... but still? Is this the right way out? To do the same in the bigger city? I want to be able to get experiences now... and then move somewhere bigger already with them on the paper and get a proper entry level job there... 

Speaking about Brighton, I believe that was the kicker... you see, this past weekend I went there to visit my friend who studies there. I loved the place and for some reason it has opened my eyes in terms of handling my life. I realised how stuck I am here and that I need to do something immediately to improve it... 

That's how I really got into this mess. I planned to look for internships or volunteering for a long time and did start even before going to Brighton, but it really struck me in the face for some reason... I don't know what to do, I want an experience to be able to experience my life... 

In the past I have been doing summer jobs since 2007. I have also managed to organise several student parties with various themes with my friends... I have organisational experiences and many other skills, and I have no problem adapting to new environments anymore... I actually never had... I just had one problem, that was being shy, but I am not anymore... and with this, all other problems disappeared. I know I can handle almost any kind of work when properly instructed about it... When I know what is expected from me to do, I'll do my best to do it... but these things don't seem to bother any of those ""potential employers"".... 

I actually realised this random rant helped me to feel slightly better... not that I am actually better now or anything... I just don't cry anymore... cos my eyes hurt... and my head as well... Maybe I'll do something more productive tomorrow... but time is getting short and I need to find something soon.... I don't want to lose any more time.... I need experiences and get on with my life to be able to fix things, to experience things, to return favours and to be able to live as free-spirited person who wants to explore the world...


One of my dreams is to go and visit Latin America and Cuba... to travel around the continent, seeing places, meeting people, to help in communities, to engage and to know the harsh realities of life there... These petty problems I have are nothing compare to those in there... but to be even able to reach to such places I need to overcome these and to save enough money to get me there.... I hope I will be able to do that... sometimes... 


Please, if you know anybody about something which might help me out of this mess, please let me know... I'd be forever thankful.... Any opportunities in East Kent....

I don't know whether anyone will be interested in what I wrote that much that they will get up to this point... but if yes, thanks stranger for hearing me out... "
1oz03e,4,2013-10-22,Looking for c/c++ library capable of scanning header files,asxa86,cpp_questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/1oz03e/looking_for_cc_library_capable_of_scanning_header/,"Hello,

I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of a c/c++ library that is capable of parsing a c++ header file into a data structure.

My end goal is to write a program that scans my teams' project directory for every header file and parse out the setters and getters for each class.

Then write unit tests for each class using the parsed setters and getters.


Edit: Adding more detail.

Lets say my teams' solution consists of 70+ project which have over 200 classes (probably a lot more).  Instead of going through and writing up a CMakeList.txt for each project and then writing a *test.cpp file for each class and then inside that test file creating the object to test every set and get for the class...

I will have a program that will scan every class, check if it has any pairs of sets + gets, and then generate an autogen.test.cpp file for the project that will contain a test block for each class that belongs to the project.

I'm almost done with this project.  I'm able to parse out the sets and gets and such but it's not pretty. 
Was just hoping for a library where someone has already solved this problem and I can just load a data structure with the parsed data and access the functions i want to test.

Also,  i am an intern at this company currently and don't have a choice on whether this is a waste of time or not.  
Boss says write a program that generates unit tests for sets and gets.  Boss gets a program that writes unit tests for sets and gets. :)"
1oyvfi,5,2013-10-22,I've ruined myself.,cawcawcawCrow,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oyvfi/ive_ruined_myself/,"It's 3am on the 2nd day that I've been awake, fueled off caffeine and nicotine, and I part of me realizes I'll probably rest better if I get this off my chest.



I think I've ruined myself. A few weeks ago I broke up with my long-time girlfriend (going on 5 years). The sad part? I cheated on her because the first 4 times I tried to break up with her, I failed. I took her back because I'm a sucker for tears and sad faces. Therefore, I resolved to do the one act that I knew she wouldn't come back to me for: cheating. It worked. I don't feel too bad about that, until 2 weeks later, I realized, I may have made a mistake.

Here I sit, rethinking my endeavor, and I realize: by Odin's beard I am lonely. I never realized, until it was too late, that my only friends were her friends. My only friends I've honestly only met on the internet (a few people I've played WoW with since raiding Zul'Gurub was a big deal), and we all live on separate sides of the country anyways. So here I am, back in my parents house, feeling lonely as I suppose lonely can be.

My story seems to compile onto itself, and the more I type it out, the more I feel like I may be in the Sims and my creator has a twisted sense of humor. 

I'm 102 applications deep, in 2 weeks, and not a call back. I just came back from an out of state job that took up a good part of the year. I'm okay financially, but those funds aren't growing on themselves. I'm back in my parents house because they literally begged me to: the eldest male of an Asian-American family I feel compelled to help. That was a mistake. 10k later I feel like I should have left my family in the dust, but I'm too stupid to learn from my own mistake (this is not the first time I've saved up money and had to bail my parents out of debt and pay off things that were really needed. Like cars, health check-ups for both family and pets, and getting my sister the things I never had in high school (financial support to do after school activities)). 

I do have a bachelor's under my belt, so there's that. Except the fact that not only do I not have my masters to get some work (yay, Criminology!), but the wait-list for relative internships is over a year long. Do I want to go back to school? Of course! I do not have the money, and my parents refuse to let me take a loan out (and my stubborn Asian upbringing makes it really, really hard to defy my parents. There's no logic behind it, there's just being Asian). 

I'm also back home, as I mentioned, to help my sister get things I never got while growing up. I also do the same for my brother. They were lucky: my dad finally got a decent job before they understood that we were poor. Except the fact in doing so, I'm not moving forward in my future. I want to do go do things, I want to become a teacher, I want to move out of my house, I want to go to a bar with some friends and bullshit about, at this point, whatever.

I think I'm rambling at this point, but I feel sort of better. It's not like I'm not friendly, it's just my habits kind of lead me into solidarity: online gaming, reading, and biking. I'm not the most interesting man in the world, but I'm not also the most boring, I think. That coupled with a minor level of social awkwardness (I still, at 26, get mildly nervous at cash registers and over-think the littlest conversations I have with people, when I do).


Where was I? Right. I feel bloody alone, like I'm going nowhere, and like a prisoner to my own stupid choices throughout life. At this point I swear all I can do is laugh at my own misfortune. I can't even begin to blame others: I know 99% of my problems would dissolve if I had half the gumption to do actually do anything about them. I should just go out and meet people (how ever you do that), I should just tell my parents to stop messing with my money, I should let my parents take care of their children, I should move forward with my own life, but, I just can't seem to. I feel sad and pathetic, and even doubly so for realizing and still doing nothing. I have no idea what I'm afraid of, but by the heavens I am scared to do anything."

One of the people I had to save today received employee of the month last month. (I've been thinking of quitting but I just don't have time to search for something else until school's out.)

I helped get somebody at school an internship because I wanted to network with some of his family members who work in my industry. He needed the internship badly because he was late in getting one for school. He skipped out on the internship after a few weeks because someone gave him a better one, made me look bad, and never bothered to introduce me to any of his family, even though I made it obvious I wanted to network. He is close to our internship professor and she sent an e-mail to all of us about how great his current internship is and how we should model our internship efforts on his. She didn't do this for anyone but him this semester.

My whole life has been like this. As a kid, I don't know how many times I did something nice for someone and then they forgot me when they could clique up with someone ""better."" I always excelled in classes but it was the students who ""improved"" the most who received recognition.

I hate living on this inconsiderate planet. All the superficial people give each other awards, while people like me hold up society and get dirt kicked in their faces for it. What do I have for a future? More and more of this? I don't know how to long beyond it anymore. I have no one and nothing to show for my efforts, even when I try to be selfish and focus exclusively on myself."
1oyf0z,8,2013-10-22,Any tips for an Aussie engineering student to find an internship/vacation employment?,michaelbryan92,perth,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1oyf0z/any_tips_for_an_aussie_engineering_student_to/,"Hi /r/perth,

I am a student in my second-to-last year at UWA studying a bachelor of Chemical and Process Engineering. A requirement of the course is the completion of 12 weeks paid work experience (usually completed over the summer vacation period) before graduation can be achieved.

I am having difficulty finding this required employment, as most engineering firms are not hiring at the moment, let alone taking on interns. I would like to ask if anybody had any tips on applying for this type of work, I must have applied to 60+ companies in the past 3-4 months and not had a single response, not even a letter of rejection, which is quite disheartening! 

I have quite good marks, I believe my resume is quite well-written and I also am under the impression that I am better equipped with communication skills than a large number of my fellow students (a large portion speak and write in very broken english). I am also completing my thesis with relevance to methane rejection in LNG processing.

One of the main problems I am having is the impersonality of the application process; a single company will require you to fill out hours worth of questions regarding your work habits and job expectations however they will not list an email or a phone number that can be used to contact somebody. Another issue is the problem of finding a company which will take on chemical and process engineering interns in the first place!

So I guess my question is this: does anybody know any additional resources that I can use to further contact and apply for vacation work positions? Additionally, can anybody offer any advice in general about obtaining such a position, or even just finding and contacting engineering companies in general?

Thanks!"

I can't win.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1oyeah/fuck_the_cs_get_degrees_mantra_a_c_could_actually/,"Maybe I'm just being a college freshman here, but here are the facts, in mostly sequential order:

- I did well on the PSAT. Big whoop. Somehow whatever ungodly forces of nature that govern the world decided that I should go all the way up to the National Merit level for sitting in a gymnasium and filling in a few circles to the best of my ability.

- My mom gets diagnosed with breast cancer. Whatever, they caught it early, they can do plenty, but because we are so fortunate to live in the land of the free, the healthcare isn't.

- Most of my dad's paycheck already goes to care for my severely autistic little brother. It's chill, though - we're upper-middle class and we still make enough to live fairly comfortably. Hell, since he's this brilliant self-employed man of men, he can increase his paycheck whenever he needs to.

- Come FAFSA time, the government basically looks at my dad and says ""Oh, wow! Would you look at that fat paycheck. You could basically buy a whole wing of a university with that!"" and offers to flip a nickel or two my way for higher education.

- I end up looking for the biggest scholarship package I can. Here we go, University of Alabama. All I have to do is stay above a 3.0 GPA and graduate somewhere in the College of Engineering and tuition is something I can set equal to 0. Computer Science is even in there, so that's a big plus (never taking another Chemistry class - so clutch. AP Chemistry was hard, I worked more for that class than any other and was ecstatic for a 4 on the AP Test  and a B in the class. Smarter kids got to try half as hard for a 5 and an A. Fuck me, right?), I've always had an interest in programming but it's never been a priority for my time, never got past rudimentary stuff.

- Cue my dad basically telling me ""Look, I'm really happy for you. But I need you to stay above a 3.0, I seriously don't have the money that any piece of paper says I does."" Welp, looks like I'm not allowed to get below an 84% in any class if I want to guarantee that I have a job **four years from now**.

- And now everyone that ever existed says ""Hahaha Cs/Ds (major-dependent) get degrees, man. Turn up!"" and ""Your GPA doesn't even matter when you graduate. You need to network and get work experience.""

Well, I'm SO SORRY that I can't look for work because I'm terrified that any significant number of hours I spend away from a textbook will mean that whatever Dunkin' Donuts job I find to replace it may have to be a permanent replacement. Hell, let's be honest, I already blow too much time on Starcraft fandom, College Football, and Reddit, and I've cut back SIGNIFICANTLY on all 3 from my high-school years.

Did I mention that I was stupid enough to take the route where I'm also getting money for staying in the College of Engineering? As in, the fields (outside of Pre-Med) where your GPA is walking over a tightrope and getting shot at by a firing squad? You go, 17-year-old me. Shine on.

Oh, what about summer internships? After all, there's no coursework to worry about then! Remember the part where I said I only looked at programming as something that was cool from afar, and only went to a summer camp or two to learn the basics (which I'll be honest, have made Programming I a breeze. 3 weeks of mostly nonstop learning apparently == 1 semester of 6 hours/week learning)? Well, guess who's going to the hire the guy who still doesn't fully understand lamdba functions and classes and still hasn't gotten his laptop to dual-boot a Windows OS and Ubuntu like CS majors here are recommended to do? If you answered ""Maybe your local library"", you'd be wrong.

The sad part is I don't even want to be like my dad, making enough to cash to support 3 kids, one of which requires more per year than most do per four. A nice IT job, making sure everything in a company  that I can assist in is running properly, answering users and helping them - something I actually sort of enjoy, even if I am just telling them to do some power cycling - seems blissful for me. But I can't get that without work experience, which I can't get without sacrificing study time, which I can't get without losing everything.

Oh, and my mom walked out on my dad last week. So that's cool.


EDIT: TL;DR: Need a 3.0 to stay in school because of circumstances, need internships/jobs to have a career after school, need a 36-hour day to make it work, and I'm generally behind on life anyways. Woo.

EDIT2 before bedtime: Definitely forgot to add the causal connection between scholarship and the first bullet on the PSAT; part of the Alabama scholarship comes from being a National Merit Finalist, which stemmed from me doing well on one test on one day, so I don't even feel like I deserve to be lumped in with other people who have to maintain a 3.0 in terms of pure intellect/speed of grasping material."

1oy4n5,143,2013-10-21,Thoughts on UGA’s injuries and “bad luck” from another perspective. [X-Post from /r/UGA],AlphaMarshan,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1oy4n5/thoughts_on_ugas_injuries_and_bad_luck_from/,"This will probably be lengthy, so bear with me. I wanted to chime in from a different perspective on what I’ve seen the past several seasons regarding your team, you faithful UGA fans.

So I live in Georgia, and most of my friends are UGA fans, so I’m always watching the games with them even though I’m mostly unbiased. One of the things that has been consistent with UGA the past several years, anyone will tell you, is the injuries. Season after season, UGA comes in with a top 10 caliber team, only to lose what feels like half its starters on either side of the ball due to injuries. 

Sure, football is a collision sport, there are bound to be injuries. But really? 2 RBs, 4 starting WRs and how many on the OL? And it's half way through the season? What about the year Stafford came back and a pre-season #1 ranked UGA lost, what was it, 3-4 starters on the OL? Malcolm Mitchell tore his ACL celebrating a TD? Anyone remember the Boise State game? No way those kids could hang with UGA right? In the 2nd quarter UGA players were cramping. In the first game of the season. In a DOME. If it's always bad luck after bad luck, how come LSU or Alabama doesn't suffer injuries to the same extent UGA does? I have truly never seen a team, regardless of conference, suffer injuries year after year the way that UGA does, and I think most UGA fans would agree. I don’t have the time to do all the research on it, but if I would be willing to bet that UGA’s multi-game, season, and career-ending injuries are statistically higher when compared to at least the other teams in the SEC. How many times is UGA going to lose key player after key player before we stop attributing it to just ""bad luck""? Now, keep that in mind as I segue into another topic.

I am a certified strength and conditioning specialist (the CSCS is a standard certification most athletic HR programs look for when they are hiring a strength &amp; conditioning (S&amp;C) coach), and I’ve had the privilege of working as an intern with UMiami’s (you know Richt is an alum right?) basketball and soccer teams, among others. The SEC is, in general, one of the most difficult S&amp;C jobs to land because of its reputation in sports and the expectations they have. You need to have a strong educational background in exercise science (most jobs list “bachelor’s required, master’s preferred – which generally means you better have a master’s, which I do) as well as 3 key certifications: you must be a Certified Strength &amp; Conditioning Specialist by the NSCA, Strength and Conditioning Coach Certified by the CSCCa, and a USA Weightlifting Certified Sports Performance Coach. 

For years, Dave Van Halanger was the director of strength and conditioning at UGA. I'm pretty sure kinesiology/exercise science degrees and research in strength and conditioning probably didn't even exist while he was coaching, but it does now. After being fed up with the conditioning, Van Halanger was moved to ""Director of Player Welfare"" (whatever that is) in 2011 and Joe Tereshinski Jr. was promoted to Director of S&amp;C. The Tereshinski name is engrained at UGA – Something like 4 generations of players have now come through the program. Tereshinski Jr. graduated in 1977 and had been working as an assistant strength coach at UGA since 1982, and he learned everything he knows from whom? You guessed it, Van Halanger. So the UGA administration ditched Van Halanger and instead of hiring a qualified strength and conditioning coach, promoted Tereshinski in-house to director when he wouldn’t have even been looked at as an ASSISTANT based on his lack of appropriate education and/or certifications related to S&amp;C. So now you have a guy running the strength and conditioning program with no background in exercise science/physiology, whose assistants are more educated than he is in proper S&amp;C programming and protocols, and whom have to shut up and do what they’re told because he’s running the program. They brought over John Thomas from Penn State who is a “Master-level strength coach” as deemed by the CSCCa and has to work as an assistant under Tereshinski.

The point is this: something's fishy here and if I were a betting man I'd put money on it that UGA's S&amp;C program bench presses and curls too much, doesn't train sport specifically enough, lacks any sort of mobility screening (FMS maybe?), is dominantly sagittal-planed, programs exercises out of order and in the improper energy systems, and lacks any sort of oversight into auditing the programming. There is a host of S&amp;C protocols that any person formally educated in this field knows by heart and uses in their programming to protect and strengthen the knee and surrounding ligaments to reduce the risk of injury. However, strength and conditioning has always been a ""good ol' boy"" type network, and since the Tereshinski family is literally generational in the UGA system, I don't see him leaving anytime soon, especially with Richt's loyalty to his coaches. I'm not saying that all of the injuries are anyone's fault, but UGA loses WAY more key players when compared to their SEC counterparts like LSU or Alabama, season after season. At some point you have to address your S&amp;C and athletic training programs and figure out if it they are at least contributing to the problem, rather than throw up your hands and saying, “Whelp, bad luck again guys. UGA is just cursed, huh?”

I bet if you put Oregon's S&amp;C coach (Radcliffe) at UGA you would get phenomenal results: better conditioned players, faster, more explosive, and fewer injuries. Oregon doesn't come close to getting the caliber athletes that UGA does, but they've made a NAME for themselves based on their speed and conditioning, and Radcliffe is formally educated and in many ways is a pioneer in S&amp;C, and routinely addresses S&amp;C conferences around the country. 

It’s hard to “prove” anything as anecdotal as improper programming in workouts = more injuries for UGA, but as an unbiased observer I think Tereshinski is part of the problem for why UGA seems to suffer so many injuries and have poor conditioning year after year. If there’s anyone you should be calling to replace, it’s him. Fatigued players are always more susceptible to non-contact knee and hamstring injuries.
 
Just my thoughts, thanks for reading.

**EDIT 1:** Here is a video of one of UGA's workouts: http://youtu.be/p4_OWHufwDU. If we assume the editing is in proper order (which I'll admit, we don't know), they are trap-bar deadlifting towards the end of the work out (this particular exercise would tax the CNS way more than anything else and should be towards the front of the workout), and the workout is centered around chest and biceps (close-grip bench presses, curls, chain curls, chin ups, etc.). The only really good exercise I see is the trunk rotations with the bar, which unsurprisingly are clearly being led by John Thomas, the former director at Penn State, whom I mentioned earlier.

Assuming this is a winter 2013 workout (which the video says it is), that means they were just out of season in either January or February when they filmed this, which means they should have entered into asymmetrically-loaded and mostly unilateral work to strengthen the trunk and get rid of any imbalances as they transition into hypertrophy. However, it's mostly bilateral work and the players are using chains, which doesn't make any sense because chains would be better for strength/power/in-season workouts since the whole point is that they are heavier through the concentric portion of the lift, teaching the athlete to explode from the bottom of the lift. This is a glorified bodybuilding workout.

**EDIT 2:** I'd also like to point out that I'm not even saying it's necessarily appropriate for Tereshinski to be fired. I even said ""replaced"" in the original write up. As /u/epmatsw pointed out, I don't have the numbers to prove any of my claims, and in all honesty don't care enough to find 10 years worth of injuries for every school and compare them all. I'm just saying it's a hunch, and at the very least some auditing needs to be done into the program. If it turns out that it IS a confirmation bias and UGA's injuries are on par with the rest of the teams out there, I'll be the first to tell you that I was wrong. But it certainly offers an explanation as to why these injuries occur so often. "
1oxzzz,0,2013-10-21,I give up,[deleted],Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1oxzzz/i_give_up/,"I moved here almost 3 years ago, with an internship in place after school. Girlfriend, job, and an education, everything seemed to go right. Well after spending my savings to move, internship was not paid like I was told from my school. I get a retail job that led to no where, and finished out my internship. 

After years of working at my retail job they decided to stop my progress not from poor performance, but because I was moving too fast. My girlfriend cheated on me with someone she met through a friend at work. But there is always hope right.

Even after the internship I have tried getting a job, but most responses I have heard are your not qualified, freelance work does not count, your over qualified because of your military experience, or you will hear from us in a few days with no response, even after following up and my personal favorite, your not from Austin you will not understand the ""local"" aspect we are looking for. Almost 3 years of looking for a job in this city, and still nothing. Over 500 resumes and cover letters. 

Apparently being a vet was the wrong choice for my life because I have gotten nothing good from it career wise. Going to school did not matter because it is all about who you know. And Joe Schmo with daddy's friends and money gets him a job over me everyday. FUCK YOU AUSTIN. All I asked for was a chance, just one single chance to prove myself and I never got that. I give up."
1p34c7,4,2013-10-23,Going in for the kill. I need advice on what to say via a social media website.,[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1p34c7/going_in_for_the_kill_i_need_advice_on_what_to/,"Hello (sub)Seditors, this is my first thread ever on Reddit and I can not think of a better place to pop my cherry. You see, I really need some solid advice.

My girlfriend and I of two+ years broke up last October. I had to do an internship out of state, did long distance for 3 months, relationship fell apart. She met someone at her new job (being the needy bitch that she was). They got engaged in July. but enough of that..

Over the course of this past year the dating world has not been kind to me. Be it by the both of us not clicking, or whatnot. It's been miserably frustrating. In January I started going to a particular gym in my hometown (I had been away at school for 4+ years, so coming back home where most of my good friends who stayed behind are now married, it's not been easy.) Upon signing up for a membership, I notice a gorgeous raven haired receptionist. She looks like solid mix between Marisa Tomei &amp; Kristen Stewart. We exchange smiles and she compliments a (Brand New) band shirt that I'm wearing. Over the course of the past 8 months I have lost 25 lbs (started out 175, now 150, I'm 5'10) &amp; am in the best shape of my life at 27. I neglected my body in college, since I was more concerned with playing music and drinking beer. 

 My Dilemma: 
We have exchanged banter a multitude of times over the course of the past  6 months, whenever she is working. never kino because she's usually behind a desk when we flirt. Her name is Jess and now she is straight giving me the ""fuck eyes"". You know, when you see a girl across the bar making eyes at you, well yes those eyes. She seems to have low self-esteem for some reason. She remembers my name because she no longer looks at my membership card, and gives me the nod in. The problem at my gym is there are always like 3 or 4 employees behind the counter, so I can never really get her to myself. I don't want to embarrass her by asking her to go out for a coffee or beer, placing her on the spot with four Purple Shirts w/name-tags standing around her. 

I am quite the mix between an extrovert &amp; introvert (people person, but need my 'alone' time to properly function). My temperaments are Sanguine and Melancholic if that says anything. During weekends at the pub downtown, I have literally seen every younger personal trainer/receptionist who works at my gym and have been social with everyone of them. But Jess never goes with them. Ever.

I am at a breaking point of reaching out to her on Facebook (we have a few mutual friends, alot of mutual interests, she wouldn't be completely creeped out with me), problem is I know the stigma that goes w/ talking to a girl online before you really know them, and that a thousand Jobin's do it. However, the pro is that we have carried on conversation in person many times. I have put together a rough draft of sorts for a potential message I will be sending Jess tonight, please tell me what I am doing right, and more importantly what Im doing wrong.

""Hey Jess, Hope all is well with ya. I can never seem to catch you by yourself to ask you out for a coffee/drink. Ive seen everyone who works at PF downtown Winston except for you! I don't want to embarrass you by putting you on the spot (although I can imagine you've heard some great one-liners coming from some of Walkertowns finest) [[w-town is a local redneck county]] with all your co-workers around, however i definitely want to hang out. - are you available tomorrow night or Friday?
 ps. I'm very glad that you're the second 'Jess, Planet Fitness' that comes up in a fbook search. Made this alot easier for me :) ""

....alright, pros, cons, advantages, disadvantages, better-ways-to-communicate-things? I need all of the input I can get people. Thanks in advance. I want to go for the kill tonight.

1p2pff,2,2013-10-23,Canada Tax Question - Common Law Relationships,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1p2pff/canada_tax_question_common_law_relationships/,"I've been taking a tax course in university and I was thinking of ways to reduce my tax liability for the year. I had a good paid internship for most of the year so my income is fairly high and even though basic calculations have me receiving a refund for this tax year overall, it can still be increased.

My question is on common law relationships. Under my federal and provincial tax forms non-refundable credits can be claimed for a spouse or common law partner. For 2013 this will amount to 11,038 - the Net Income of said person. Technically I do not have a common law partner, just a long-term girlfriend who does not live with me (she lives at home and has very little income for 2013). If I were to claim her as a common law partner it would boost my refund by over 25% by my calculations. Would doing this be viable or is this something that can actually be audited by the CRA, what additional impact may this have on my return?

If you have any additional tax avoidance advice etc. for Canada that is also welcome! Especially thoughts that are not fairly obvious (like RRSP contributions).

Cheers,

Tl;Dr - Can I claim my girlfriend as a common law spouse for increased non-refundable credits even though she is not technically. What might the CRA say/do if they were to audit?"

But once I'm right at the cusp of experiencing success, I'll give up. Some examples are:

I did my degree *and* Masters, but I haven't found a job/position relating to either of those degrees. 

This year my goal was to learn coding, and I even found an internship where they would pay me to teach me the code I wanted to learn, but at the end of the internship when they were ready to offer me a job, I quit. 

I wanted to create jewellery and sell it online...so I bought all the equipment and made a ton of jewellery but never created an etsy account. (I sold some of my jewellery through my mom, since she wore some earrings I made and got many requests from others to buy some, so I know people liked it - I just thought it was shitty jewellery and didn't think I'd be good enough to sell online). 

Part of what stops me from pursuing these things is that my true love is writing. Since I could read and write, I've always wanted to be a writer. Every time I start putting effort into something I think, ""why put effort into this when I could be putting effort into something I actually like doing, like writing?"".

So for the past few months I've been writing like crazy. I have hundreds of thousands of words written, many short stories, even two novel-length stories. I'm currently enrolled in many online classes to make me a better writer so that I can improve my story-telling abilities. The problem is, just like with all the other things I've pursued, I've come to a point where I'm close to tasting the end but I'm sabotaging myself. 

My dad just sent me a position working in his office which matches up with my credentials perfectly (my Masters, my coding knowledge, etc). This is a pretty good job and would give me some security, but it would mean abandoning my writing (because I know if I'm working mon-fri 9-5, I wouldn't be as dedicated to this goal than if I kept my current job). Even in my heart I know I won't apply, because I don't even have the confidence to have an ""adult"" job and work with other people. It's the same reason I'm too hesitant to finally finish and start self-publishing the stories I write (or even let people read anything I write).

Can anyone here share some experiences or advice on how to get over that last little hump of having enough confidence to finish things we start? 

tl;dr: I'm disciplined enough to build good habits, but never to finish what I start. "

**Sunday:** I had been browsing TradeMe (our equivelant of eBay) for the last few weeks, focusing on small cars in the under 4k NZD region. I settled on checking out a 1998 Toyota Corsa 110k kms on Sunday at what turned out to be a ""private dealer"" (he owned a small corner of a larger dealer). It was in good condition, a scratch here and a small dent there, drove well, but was selling in an auction with an opening price of 3.5k NZD. 

That evening a 1997 Corolla II 98k kms was posted (the same car, just a different name essentially. Visually no different.) with an asking price of 3.3k and no exterior or interior damage at all. 

**Monday:** I texted the guy (Middle eastern or Eastern African mid 20s) and organised a test drive and personal check out, and it drove well. My checks showed everything ok bar rear and front seal leaks on the engine and the timing belt likely needing replacement in the next 10000km.

The original Corsa from Sunday had the auction Monday evening and no one bidded, so it was relisted the next day for the same starting price.

I called a mechanic to come and inspect the vehicle the next day, and he said to text the address.

**Tuesday:** I went out and checked it out again, after I accidentally texted the address to the wrong number (11 digit cellphone number, got one digit wrong, derp). Talked to the owner and we verbally agreed that if the mechanical check showed no issues above the ones I had found, I would be prepared to offer 3.1k for the car. He agreed.

**Wednesday:** The mechanic arrived at his house to check at the car at 4pm. I was unable to make it because I was at uni. He called me a half hour into the check to tell me the seals leaked and the spark plugs were worn, and asked if I wanted to continue with the check. I said yes.

When he finished the check, he spoke to his mother, and they agreed the car wouldn't be sold until she (or him) had talked to me.

**Wednesday evening:** The car guy texted me just after the mechanic left (~1730) asking if I was ready, I said that it would take a while for him to write up the report and get it to me. He texted me at 2016 saying the following:

""Sory mate gve you the chance. someone is coming to pick it up tmrw.""

The mechanical report arrived at 2028. Leaking seals, timing belt will need changing soon, sparks are worn. Everything else is fine.


I don't really know how I feel right now. Disappointed? Yes. Confused? A little. Faith in humanity? Reduced a little.

**TL;DR - Tested a 2nd hand car, checked it myself, verbally agreed to purchasing it on the outcome of a mechanical check, had the mechanical check done, mechanic verbally confirmed the car would not be sold until they talked to me about the report, car was sold two hours later to someone that wasn't me**"
1p120u,0,2013-10-23,How to deal with multiple interviews?,EVILteddie,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1p120u/how_to_deal_with_multiple_interviews/,"So I am a 3rd year, and I am looking to obtain an internship this summer in IT Audit/Advisory. I am an IS major, so I will not be getting a masters or going for CPA at the moment. As of now, I have been asked to do second, on-site interviews with 3 of the Big 4, Grant Thornton, and Protiviti. 

As far as university recruiting goes, is it in bad taste to interview with this many companies, knowing full well that I can only accept one offer? While I am not positive which position I will fit in with best, the worst case scenario is I have to decline 4 offers. I'm also concerned about not accepting an offer after the interview if I still have interviews remaining. Anybody else have similar experiences going through the recruiting process? 

Any insight is very much appreciated. Also, edited for some clarification."

My heaviest usage comes from Matlab and using a VPN to access some programs remotely. My thinking is that with the 512GB drive, I can install a Windows partition to locally run programs like Visual Studio, which I need to learn for an upcoming internship. 

That said, they'll be providing a laptop for me to use when I start.

1p0w1v,2,2013-10-22,MMFB Today has been a day,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1p0w1v/mmfb_today_has_been_a_day/,"I'm usually pretty happy. I try to find one thing to be happy about and focus on it. Maybe that makes me ridiculous, but I like to think it makes me hopeful. Saying that, today was a small dose of horrible I couldn't quite fathom nor happy thought my way out of. 

Everyone has one of those days where the things, whatever they are, whip at us. 

A couple of things: 

Ty is town complicated things with his sudden engagement and giving me a pet bunny. What am I to do with a pet rabbit? He beats at door at 4am
bringing songs, bunnies and donuts. I'm sick with the flu, but have to work. Ty rubs his love in my face and leaves me missing of the times we'd dance in the  parking lot in our hometown. Making Alaska permanent home with his new bride. That's the news my best friend gives me. No jokes about me being his communal bride. Just my bearded manly running off to be happy and marry and live in the wildness and have a ton of hairy babies that, in my head, look like bears. His fiancée is basically like a bear to me, even though I've never seen her. He slips me a number when I leave. Says not to call it unless I really want an adventure. I've no idea what that means Ty! 

My favorite pretzel shopped closed on one of the most important board of directors days of the year. They love pretzels and were less enthused my
offer of pastries during the presentation I've been working months on. It would be unfair to blame them hating my presentation on pretzels but it really threw me off my game. 

I've watched my grandfather dying. 
It really hit me today. I needed him most today. I sent him a text and then I remembered he couldn't check his phone now. 

I spent the morning receiving call after call about a missing company car that I'm no longer suppose to be responsible for since my promotion. Perhaps everyone was too wasted at the promotion party for me to hear the part about how that isn't something I'm responsible for starting three months ago. That seems trivial now. But it is frustrating. 

My cousin will her have baby next month. We got pregnant around the same time. If I hadn't gotten my first abortion I'd be having my baby around that time.  I hate the little updates she sends me. Stop it! I want to scream. But she doesn't know. I haven't told anyone really.

I was in the dressing room with a friend today and she noticed my nipple points in a strange way that I've never noticed before. Now I'm going to worry about that every time I have sex. 

I've a bunny now. I don't know what to do with a bunny. 

One of our new interns that started today is the girlfriend of an ex boyfriend. I recognize her from their happy Facebook page updates and happy photos.  I dumped him because he had a weirdly colored penis. You know the ones where the color is different from the rest of body. Not his fault but I could never have sex with him or look at it because it creeped me out. I dumped him a party one night after he told me loved me. I was 20 and I mentioned his penis to him. I regret now and feel really bad. 

I played a event reception tonight with a 102 fever. My boob popped out of my dress. All I could think when someone told me was that I really hoped it wasn't the boob with the oddly pointed nipple. I feel like the oddly pointed nipple should be something I tell penis guy to make him feel better. "" Hey, I've a weird thing too."" 

I've cried today over love and loss and the thoughts of everything in between.

Now I'm at home in the dark. Trying to desperately not to answer any calls or texts. People never stop. I guess it's better than no one caring. All I want though is for someone to come hold my hand while I sleep and tell me it'll all be okay in the morning. 


Hey, at least I've my health, right? I've a lot to be thankful for and I really hope tomorrow is a better day. "

1p0pp8,8,2013-10-22,[HIRING] Internship for candidate experienced in Python and SQL databases,hiring_throwaway2,SanDiegoJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiegoJobs/comments/1p0pp8/hiring_internship_for_candidate_experienced_in/,"The ideal candidate would be a college/university student with at least one year left in their current program and at least 20 hours available per week (schedules can be flexible for test periods or project due dates). Must have experience with Python, SQL experience is preferred but not necessary. I will immediately place anyone at the front of the line if they have personal side-projects in Python and can explain them in detail.

To give you an idea of the context:
This is a team-based internship in which the supervisor (me) has little time available to provide training. The last group of interns had a very good mix of skills and were thus able to train each other in their own specialties. When our two departing interns had their exit interviews, each intern mentioned that they learned more and much more was expected of them when compared with their peers' internships (the other two interns chose to remain throughout the school year). The pay reflects this level of expected output. This next group of interns will be set up slightly differently, so your experience may vary.


Duties and responsibilities:

* Automate repetitive or ad hoc tasks (data analysis, consolidation, warehousing; report generation; miscellaneous scripting requests)
* Miscellaneous duties as a result of my workload overflow, much of which can also be scripted if you're capable

Required skills:

* Ability to pause and change tasks at a moment's notice and to keep track of a large list of postponed tasks. Priorities tend to change quickly; the better you are at supporting my workload, the more forward-looking I can be and therefore the less firefighting you'll have to do.
* Ability to take a large number of tasks and handle them efficiently, with updates provided as your workload changes, and without much oversight. If you're good at delegation, then I may set you up to supervise other interns as well.

This is not an easy internship. You will be allowed to deal with an ever-increasing set of responsibilities if you can handle it. If you want time to browse Reddit (outside of the occasional rest break), then this is not the position for you.

If you're interested, PM your resume. I'll be conducting phone interviews with qualified candidates. If you pass this stage, you'll be required to submit a formal application through Taleo (HR's requirement, so you have my condolences) before we can have an in-person interview.

The official job description is also available on request. Sorry for the throwaway account; I don't want my career and my normal Reddit account to cross paths if they don't have to."
1p0mbw,1,2013-10-22,SO is two days late on period. How do I calm her down and keep her from stressing,wellshesfreakedout,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1p0mbw/so_is_two_days_late_on_period_how_do_i_calm_her/,"Hello,  
My girlfriend (21) is absolutely stressing out because she thinks she might be pregnant. A condom broke a few nights earlier because it was too small. I hadnt masturbated in the previous 24 hours and had urinated several times before sex so I believe my precum wasn't viable.  

I really believe its stress that's causing her to be late. She's had a lot on her plate recently with school, work, internships and her younger sister getting pregnant a few months back. This has in my opinion made her very paranoid. I of course won't tell her she's being paranoid because I don't want to hurt her feelings.  

I have suggested getting two home test kits (better safe then sorry with those false negatives) to ease her piece of mind.  

How would Sexxit suggest I ease her stress?"
1p59rh,139,2013-10-24,Petty revenge in the wonderful world of film,FilmYak,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1p59rh/petty_revenge_in_the_wonderful_world_of_film/,"When I first got out of school, I got a job freelancing as a PA on commercial shoots. A PA -- production assistant -- is the lowest rung on the ladder. It's a shitty job with crappy pay, but you get real-world experience on set. And by commercial shoot, I'm talking 35mm film, full crews, budgets ranging from $50k - $300k per shoot day. This was back in the mid 90's. 

So I get in with this one prodco (production company). They basically get the ad treatment from the agency, and put together a proposal. ""We will shoot it like this, for $x, with this director.""

This one company was a small but successful regional player, and they had lots of jobs, so I tended to work 3-5 days a week for them as a freelancer. I worked my ass off, doing tons of work I loathed, but I did it well and without complaining and they kept hiring me. Meanwhile, I was learning first hand about film shoots. 

The woman who hired me -- I don't remember her name, let's call her PC, because she was the production coordinator. She was a decent boss, no issues, and she liked my work so I was steadily employed. 

Until one day, something happened on set. I didn't do it, but I was there and I immediately fixed the problem. Not a big deal, but it ruined a single take as they were shooting when it happened.  Even though I had fixed the issue and not caused it, I was blamed for it by the director. He said I was a pain-in-the-ass overall because I was always around and trying to see what was going on.  Which is true, but I also stayed out of the way. 

Anyway, he told PC to stop hiring me based on the incident, and she said she would talk to him when I explained my side of the story. She never did, and my work dried up immediately.  Every time I called, she said she hadn't talked to him but would soon. In reality, she was done with me. 

Luckily, I got in with another director, who worked for the largest prodco in the city. I had interned for the prodco before my days as a PA, and they liked me, so now I was their pa. Director saw I was always hanging around and, instead of being pissed, took me under his wing. 

And then the head of the prodco left the company, and  the guy I used to intern for was promoted to head of the company.  He offered to train me to learn his previous job. That was a huge promotion, but he saw my potential and hard work and wanted to take a chance on me. Now it was suddenly my responsibility to bid on jobs, figure the budget, sell the company.... It was a massive learning opportunity and I stayed with them for three full years. 

Well guess what? About 6 months before I left, PC ended up getting a job there as a sales rep. She had to come to me to run budgets. That was my job, so I never screwed her over, but I was plain rude to her for the entire time. She told me I used to be much nicer. I replied that I was still nice to everyone else who didn't drop me for no good reason. 

I was rude to her until the day I left the company. Haven't seen her since.  And I'm still friends -- almost 20 years later -- with the director there, and the guy who hired me to take over his old job. 

Tl;dr. I got petty revenge on someone.

The problem I have is that now that I am not in a Java course, I don't know where to go. I am currently an Accounting Information Technology major but I like programming more and hope to get into financial software development.

So basically, I am not a beginner Java developer, but I am just confused and stuck on where to go from here to further my education in Java and algorithms and data structures. I have started reading a textbook called Into to Algorithms because I've heard a lot of people say you should understand data structures and algorithms when you hope to get an internship and actually mastering the specific language is not that important considering not all companies use Java.

Any tips on how I can get started at home and get into some stuff that I can do after school? I dont even have an IDE downloaded to my computer right now, but I plan on joining GitHub. My problem is I dont know how to start a project or just how to go about getting the wheels rolling considering I am not that great at Java yet.

1p570b,0,2013-10-24,"I believe people who can't get jobs after college didn't work hard enough, CMV",no-strings-attached,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1p570b/i_believe_people_who_cant_get_jobs_after_college/,"I believe that those people who complain about not being able to get jobs simply didn't work hard enough and/or made poor decisions regarding careers. While the economy is bad and it is not as easy for everyone today to get a job as it was for their parents, if someone really wants to be successful they can. 

The people who are having trouble finding jobs are those that did not go to top universities. This is likely due to the fact that they didn't work as hard in high school or were not smart enough to get top marks. Many top universities have generous financial aid packages so money should not be an issue. Some even offer full rides to students who are smart enough to make the cut but do not have the money. 

From there, if an individual majors in a lucrative field (think computer science or engineering) and works hard to get good grades while making the most of their college experience (ie: getting internships, participating in extra curricular activities, taking on leadership positions, networking, etc) they will almost certainly get a job. 

It is an entitled view that everybody that goes to any run of the mill college should get a job. If these people really wanted it they had the power to achieve it and were just lazy. There are also thousands upon thousands of jobs available and these people who complain are not tapping into all of the resources they could be to get hired. 

So while I agree that it is harder to get a good job today than in previous generations, it is the fault of the individual for not working hard enough/not being intelligent enough to get a job. 

I hold this view as someone who came from a very depressed area (ranked one of the poorest in the US) with uneducated parents (think grocery store workers) who has worked her ass off her entire life to get into a top university. I worked my ass off in college to make my resume awesome and have gotten many amazing job offers. CMV. 

Edit: Hey guys! Figured I should edit my post because a lot of people seem to misunderstand my argument (sorry if it's poorly written!). I agree that not *every* person can do these things and succeed because of the way the job market is today. My view is hinged around the individual. Any given individual, but just an individual rather than the whole collective. Though who knows what would happen if every individual did perform outstanding. Perhaps they would be able to create new markets of jobs that would actually benefit the entire collective and nobody would be unemployed? (Note: the last two sentences were musings that are not part of my view that needs changing)"
1p4yxg,9,2013-10-24,"[22f] We were better off as animals, right?! Long post",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p4yxg/22f_we_were_better_off_as_animals_right_long_post/,"I [22f] started dating my SO [22M] about 4 years ago.  I put a wedge between us when he started living with two girls that first year.  The summer was great but then Autumn arrived. He lives about 2 hours away wheres he attends college.  In my defense,, one of the girls was very strange and really pushed my buttons on purpose.  And my SO would harmlessly play along and he promised it was harmless, but it was enough to keep me awake at night and picture what weird advances she might be making.  This was the first problem in this new relationship.  His major also made him THE ONLY male in his classes.  We worked through a lot and stayed with each other even though we started the make-up/break-up cycle.  During this phase,   I understood that if he wanted to cheat on me he would have done it.  And I believed him when he told me nothing ever happened or ever would.

The next year he lived with his guy friend which definitely made me feel less threatened.  But he was still the only male in alllll of his classes.  Which also meant group projects and library meet ups, all of which pounded more insecurity into my head.  I should mention that this is the longest relationship I've had and the first time  I felt real love for a man romantically.  I am also very attractive and have been blessed with natural blonde hair and ice blue eyes.  There is no reason for me to be insecure with myself. I have come to understand that these are irrational feelings.  My past, more adolescent boyfriends (3) all cheated on me.. So I kept seeing it happen again with my current SO (i have since learned not to let my past control my present and future) So all this being away from him while he was going to class and meeting up with his fellow female students made me feel so extremely jealous. Especially after he told me his friends cousin (known to be promiscuous) was tutoring him.  I vocalized my feelings but it made it worse because he would get upset that I didn't trust him.  It dug the wedge further.  Another issue that came up was that he was diagnosed with HPV.  I was tested 3 times and still remain clean.  So i assumed he was cheating but he insisted that he has no idea why it surfaced because he has not been with anyone else..  I know that this disease can take a long time to surface so we worked through it together.

School ended and when summer came I was so excited to have him be in the neighborhood to hang out with, but what happened was that he felt like I was asking too much of him to hang out so much.  I would plan dates, but he would always bail if and when something came up with his friends who were also coming home from school.  I was a receptionist and he was a messenger and intern kinda at the same law firm.  We would commute to work and eat lunch together, but when I got home from work I still wanted to hang out, but he would want to go to his friends, saying that we hung out all day,, but I didn't see working together as hanging out.  He texted me one night and after a good text fight he finally texted "" I need time. Im sorry"" I didn't want to push it because any further texting would be crazy talk after someone tells me they need time..

I turned into an emotional wreck hanging out in his sweatshirt and crying about how the sky reminds me of my SO and eating my feelings.  

About a week and a half of always looking for him on the train to work or during lunch hour,, he caught me in the hallway and said ""Hey! My friend thats coming home is having a party.  Want to go?"" My eyes lit up and I cooly said ""sounds fun, call me"".   He never called.  Im a mess again. 

After that weekend he did call me and his choice of guilty phrases made me realize he did something with another woman.  I met up with him and sure enough he told me he was with someone.  He had sex with the girl that was tutoring him which is also his friends cousin which meant she would always be a part of his life. He also did not use protection which meant he could have given this girl HIS STD or she could have given him another one.  And also,  she could be pregnant.   Pulling out is not a sure thing.  Pre Cum is still Semen.  I was devastated because all my nightmares came true and I was one of those girls that couldn't have a fairytale relationship with this person I thought would never do this to me. I listened to all the gruesome details and how he was drunk and how they just ""fell"" on each other.  And how im so much better and that he wanted to see what was out there and he now realizes I am the one he wants in his life. But i kept remembering how this girl would always be his friends family and when his friend came home,  she would be there and so would my SO. I wanted to forgive him and we started working on it.  I had my fits of crying and questioning and then he stopped wanting to deal with it and wanted me to get over it.  So now the wedge was completely in and I was constantly questioning his behavior.  He said we were broken up at the time. but i know thats BS because all he texted me was that he needed time.  And he asked me to go to the same party he ended up cheating on me at.  And slept next to her after they had sex even though he insisted right after he came he regretted what he had done.   And when I questioned him about how much he drank I never got a straight answer. He admitted to making a conscious decision though.  

We stayed together going through more of the make-up/break-up cycle when I would get jealous and he would get fed up with a trustless relationship.  About 6 months ago he broke up with me (coincidently after a trip i wasnt invited to because it was a guy thing) In his defense I understand guys need their things, but we were going through a rough week  (and i had just lost a second uncle, both of whom had a courageous battle with cancer) and I didnt want his friends to bash our relationship.  And this girl he had sex with was my SO's friends smoosh and he didn't know about it!  And of course he came home and broke up with me.  That was it for me.  I completely stopped talking to him and about a month and a couple heartfelt emails we started texting and still fighting because I was so heartbroken.  

After hanging out and getting close quick.  I admitted that I was with someone because we were going to be intimate again. He asked questions and i told him I did have sex with this guy. I used protection and it was a very formal agreement I had with this guy that we dont exchange numbers and we both were tying to move on from an ex.  He wasn't from this country and we only saw each other one night.  My SO was so upset and jealous and sad that I didnt think I would be with my SO again.  He was so mean and his words were making me feel like a slut and he was comparing it to when he cheated.  But both times he broke up with me and we hadnt spoken in a month this time.  I explained how I never thought he would want to be with me and if I had known I would have made decisions differently. He got over it after time and we continued to get close again.  

We started to hook up after another month of odd texting and now he is home for 2 months so we are kind of picking things up again.  He told me about the vacation he took that i kept buggin him to take me on and I was mad but continued seeing him because I really love the kid,,  i asked if he had been with anyone and he said no.  I ask for health reasons not just jealousy,, jealousy did rear its ugly head when i invaded his privacy and trust and I snooped on his phone and found pics of 2 girls. 

I confronted him this morning and he told me that one was a friend from HS (dont know why she sent him pics still) and the other girl was from his trip with his friends.  I asked him about the girls and he admitted to making out with this girl on his trip but nothing else happened and that she texted him this pic.  I was devastated because I dont know if he's lying about doing anything else with her.  And after he grilled me for being honest about who I was with. I was afraid of the answer, but i am upset that he lied and grilled me when I was honest about who I was with.  

I am at my wits end with this relationship.  I dont want to give him up because I am so attracted to him mentally and physically,  i want to have his kids and be a supportive love in his life, but all these jealousy issues are dragging both of us down at such a young age.  Im almost waiting for him to be out of school , but i dont know what the real issute is,, my jealousy or the decisions he is making or has already made. 

Or should I learn to move on and stop making everything complicated and be happy with good sex and fun times? Or is my dignity being stepped on?  Please help.. I am going to be talking to him tonight and I don't know how I should approach because I don't know what I want.

Sincerely,
A jelly bean"

I have always known I was gay and I was never really confused on what I liked. That being said, growing up in a Hispanic culture I never really felt safe to come out for the obvious fears that we all share (becoming a paria, being rejected by loved ones, etc etc) But this last September I finally came out to one of my girl cousins and she couldn't have been more supportive, that first step was the hardest but it was an amazing feeling getting it off my chest. Just some background info, I don't live in my home town (El Paso, TX) any more. I live with my older brother in a small college town north of Dallas, now me and my bro have always been close we party together we have the same friends and we almost always get along, he even got me an internship at the company he works for. So for obvious reasons I have always thought he was the most important person I needed to tell, ironaclly I was scared to tell him the most. So fast forward two months and two other confessions to my close friends, about a week ago I finally told my brother.... And suprise surprise.... Turns out he knew, he didn't care and he said it never would change anything between us (he is a great brother), now all of our friends know since I had the support of my older bro to tell them, and everyone has been really awesome about the whole thing. Now my question to you bros is what's next? Obviously I still need to let my other family members know, but now im not alone on this and I'm pretty sure they are going to be just like my brother. But I don't know where to go from here, I've never been in a relationship and have messed around on the DL for being scared I might be outted. I'm tired of hookups and I want something more but I don't know how to approach the situation. Where do I go from here? All my life I've been pretending to be something in not and now that I don't have to, what's next?"
1p4p0u,28,2013-10-24,Too depressed to go to class...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p4p0u/too_depressed_to_go_to_class/,"A little background: I study laboratory sciences at a university, I am pretty smart, I'm very passionate about science and helping people.  I'm a 22 year old man with a substance abuse problem.  I also run a small business selling guitar equipment.  

About a week ago, my girlfriend started questioning my happiness and my sanity.  Her and I dated for about 7 and a half months.  We concluded that I was too busy with my school work, and I wasn't happy so we broke up.  

It all started when I was denied an internship at a hospital that I have worked for years to obtain.  My self esteem was crushed.  I have always been slightly sad for various reasons but this really hurt.  I have been drunk and on various substances pretty much the entire time since the moment I've received the letter saying I didn't get the internship. Now I am currently considering dropping out of my program and doing something completely different.  

Alcohol and I have an interesting relationship... I drink a lot and I try to be responsible by attending all my classes and whatnot.  I have been addicted to various substances since I was 15 years old.  Being sober is just boring to me.  Although I feel like if I had an awesome laboratory job, I would have a lot more motivation to be sober.  

 I am physically active, I go to the gym, ride my bike, run, ect.  Although I have been slacking a lot lately, I usually just don't have the energy to go to the gym.  

I'm also pretty good looking.  This super cute girl from one of my classes wants to hang out with me this weekend.  I just went through a break up but I'm hoping I can get a little action with this girl.  

I'm just sad,  I have had about 5-6 shots of vodka and it's not even noon.  I just failed a diagnostic microbiology exam.  I run a small business which is great but I am currently too depressed to leave my bed to go to the post office where I have to mail some business related items to the customers.  I have class in an hour which I'm not going to because I feel like junk.  (I've skipped less than 5 classes in my entire life)  

I feel stupider..  I have always considered myself pretty smart, but recently I have just felt super dull.  I'm just not acting like myself which is scary, I'm normally very mellow and easy going but now I'm super stressed, anxious and sad.  

I really hope I get out of this funk.  "
1p4mla,2,2013-10-24,Ex is depressed after dumping me. What should I do?,throwawilbur,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1p4mla/ex_is_depressed_after_dumping_me_what_should_i_do/,"Jack* and I were together for 10 months long distance and were each other's serious first time as a gay couple while he was still closeted. We were long distance because he had to withdraw from school for depression-related issues and spent the remainder of the year at an internship in another state. Meanwhile, I was one semester away from graduating and trying to figure out where to start ""the real world."" During our LDR he was re-enrolled and I founda job in a major city near our (now his) college town. 

Shortly after returning to school this fall Jack realized he wanted to have the ""college experience"" after all and, after waiting for a very long time to discuss this with me, he boxed me out for a week before letting me know his final decision. I was hurt that, after 10 months, we couldn't have an actual conversation about how he felt. It was also apparent that love wasn't being reciprocated as much from his end. I personally took the breakup rather well. Instead of severing ties with Jack I told him I'd be there for him as a support whenever he needed me-if at all-despite the way he hurt me.

Jack also has an avoidant personality where, the more you put pressure on him, the more he pushes you away and then blames you for the reason he's avoidant. This, too was a big part of our internal conflict, because I wanted him to be better at communication and reciprocation.

**Last week Jack posted on /r/depression about how he's backsliding into the same depression he felt last year, not doing well in school, and smoking cigarettes again.** I want to help him, but I don't want to appear desperate and continue driving him away through my persistence, and he already knows that I'm here for him if he wants to talk. A huge part of me still cares for him and I see his post as a cry for help. I'm afraid of the worst happening, but I feel powerless and that it's no longer my place or battle. 

What should I do? Should I try reaching out to him again or let him go and deal with it?

I am so worried money will ruin our lives. Please help!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p44xb/me_22f_with_my_husband_23m_of_4_months_marriage_4/,"He finished Uni last Spring, and we married shortly after. We are happy, and have the normal peaks and valleys of any long term relationship. If you need more background on this, please ask.





---





Since we married he has been job hunting. Before this offer the most he had was internships. This amount exceeds all our purposed budget sheets by 30k. We frankly have no idea what to even do with this much money, and plan on just getting a better flat and putting 2k in savings every month. We also will be giving 2.5% pre-tax to charity. Once I begin working after I finish my programme come May 2014, I plan on giving at least 10% of my salary to my parents. This part we shall figure out with time, but is this good? How do people who makes this much usually spend their money? This isn't our issue though- just asking for a bit of fiscal advise. 




---




***Our issue is how do we go from here socially.*** Most of our friends are dirt poor. The ones who aren't that bad, can most def not afford to put 2k per month towards savings. Should I hide how much my husband makes, and say we got a good deal on the flat we move to to lower that price as well? How do I go about doing that? His last internship was 13$ per hour, and my last job was 8$ per hour to put things into perspective. I'm almost scared, what if they stop being our friends? They mean so much to me, I love them almost like I love my husband. I'm so very lost.



How do we not let this go to our heads? How do we not waste this opportunity? Are they any how-to guides on going through such a big socio-eco increase launch thing? 




---




The biggest thing though is how can I be a good wife to him? He will be working so hard, and does not want him to work until I finish my programme now since we can afford that circumstance. I've never been a housewife before. Is that what I'll be? What do housewives do? How can I be there for him after he worked a 50-60 hour week? How can I learn to be without him for so many working hours?




I have my own life outside of my husband, at the moment we don't even live together as he was job hunting but will asap since we can afford it now, but I have never been in a situation where a partner pays for my rent+food+etc. It's such a big change. My husband has paid for my groceries before, but It's always been a give-and-take. These last 4 months I've been doing the lion-share of the spending because he was jobless. Now we'll be be at a point that I cannot pay back. I can't pay him back for forking over 2.5k in rent. I can't pay him back for buying ALL our food or anything. God, he'll be paying for my fucking mobile! I plan on getting a non-smartphone for him to pay because of that. I'll fine some old ""dumbphone"" to use, and save the smartphone for when I can pay for it. I'm not going to ask him for clothes unless I need something nice for an interview. I'm not going to ask for books or movies or stupid shit. I'm not a child who will be unappreciative. But.. the rent.. god the rent. Help me please. 



Please? How does this work?!




**tl;dr**: My husband and I just jumped from our working class circumstances where we debated for 2 hours if we could afford an 8$ date once a fortnight to him making 90k. I'm scared and do not know what to do. I just want to make this work. I have no friends to talk to since they're all fucking poor like I am, or was(?). How can we not let money affect our marriage, our friendships, or just our live in a detrimental way? How can I be a good housewife or whatever that shit is called? How can I get use to any of this? I'm scared. Summarize with a tldr!"

1p41k9,1,2013-10-24,Casually seeing this great guy (25M) but I (25F) feel our lack of communication might be a dealbreaker?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p41k9/casually_seeing_this_great_guy_25m_but_i_25f_feel/,"So before I start my posting, I'll throw out some bullet points (and sorry for the long ramble):

* I am an overthinker. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just insane.
* Yes, we've already had sex. I tend to be someone who rushes into things.
* We have opposite work schedules where I work Tues - Sat and he works Wed - Sun. (He'll wake up around 5:30 a.m. to go to work while I normally go to bed around 5 a.m.)

So I've been casually seeing this guy for about a little over a month now after meeting on OKC. But we've only seen each other once every two weeks. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if this works for me. Mostly because he is awful at responding to my text messages. So, it's really hard to feel any connection when I go so long without seeing him and without really talking to him. Even worse, when I don't get a response within a timely manner, I start to wonder things -- mostly if I sent the wrong thing, if he's out with someone, if he died, etc.

Thing is, even in the beginning, he was slow to get back to me. While trying to set up our first meeting, it took him six hours to respond. He claims he just isn't a big texter. He doesn't text at work (he works at a bakery/cafe) and he doesn't always have his phone with him. The three times we've hung out have always resulted in a sleepover and have actually gotten longer each time. So through that, I have observed that sometimes he'll leave his phone in his room and then go to the living room to watch TV or play video games with his roommates for a few hours, etc. He also once told me he feels that texting doesn't necessarily require immediate responses and that it seems people with iPhones (which I have and he does not) tend to be more responsive. 

I don't know why I'm so hung up over needing him to be more responsive with text messages -- I mean, I've been with guys who were great at responding but shitty people so, yeah. I guess it really doesn't mean much. The time we spend together is great. He's really sweet and funny, we get to know each other, joke around, etc. This past weekend, I spent 26 hours with him and he cooked us dinner. It was really nice. It feels like quality time. I know some people may assume he's just keeping me around for sex, but I really don't feel that's the case (then again, I'm posting here -- what do I know?). I've been with guys who were just in it for the sex and it feels different. Hell, if it were just for sex, I almost feel like we'd see each other more.

I did ask him how he felt about only seeing each other once every two weeks and he responded, ""I'm fine with it but it seems like you're not."" He talked about how he needed alone time sometimes, etc. And I get it. Sometimes it can be tough -- especially when you don't work a normal 9-5 Monday through Friday job -- to just find time for you. I guess, as he put it, he just wanted to keep things ""light and fluffy,"" which makes sense since we don't *really* know each other all that well. In the end, he just said, ""I like you. So stop worrying so much."" 

So I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm trying to handle this different than past relationships in the sense that I'm trying to be more patient and trying to just go with it. But yes, I do get that my first faux pas was probably sleeping with him but whatever, that's in the past now. I wanted it. He wanted it. I don't really regret it.

I've talked to him about the texting issue but it doesn't seem like much has changed. Not that he necessarily promised it would. He's going to D.C. this weekend for a family trip so I know I won't see him, which is fine. A part of me sort of wonders if I should, I don't know, just break it off or maybe see other people too? He is literally the best guy I've ever been with (he's made me breakfast, cooked me dinner, cuddles with me, etc.) but this lack of communication, of seeing each other, I just don't know if I can handle it because sometimes it just really stresses and bums me out. Then again, it's late, I had a bad day at work, maybe I'm just overthinking everything again. Maybe I should just learn to relax, get a hobby, and let everything fall into place?

Edit: I remember something he told me. A year ago, he was seeing this girl for a month or two and said it moved fast emotionally -- but then she moved out of the city for an internship and that was that. I don't know if that has anything to do with how he is now or what."
1p40ws,4,2013-10-24,M4M or M4F. 24. Another story...,throwthatawayboy44,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1p40ws/m4m_or_m4f_24_another_story/,"I recently posted a story about my first gay experience so I figured I would elaborate and tell the story of my first threesome...

So I was 19 and I had recently moved across the country for a work internship.  At the time I had been talking on and off with this girl but she was dating some guy and I did not want to get involved.  So after a few weeks of blowing her off I get this message saying she and her boyfriend want to go out for dinner and catch up.  

Fast forward and I show up for said dinner and they had set me up with a blind date.  Maybe if the girl was right it would have been more fun but the girl they chose was just...horrible.  A classically self obsessed sorority girl.  So we have dinner and blah blah blah...basically she fucking ruined my night.  I am sitting there pushing my food around thinking of good ideas to get out of dealing with her for one more minute...she was that bad.  Finally the dinner ends and I decide to be honest with her.  Turns out the feeling was mutual and we both happily go our separate ways.  At this point I have lost faith in humanity so I am ready to go home and smoke a bowl and flip on the good ole xbox and play my tears away...but thats when this girl and her boyfriend ask me to come back and chill.

At first I sitting there thinking...they are taking pity on me because I have no friends.  Then as we get in the cab, they start to get into it.  He is kissing her neck and she is wrapping her arms around him and back and forth...and I am sitting there going from six to midnight awkwardly thinking...""shoulda got another cab...So I kinda inch away from them and look out the window pretending its not happening...but its not working.  At this point I am basically losing my shit and we are about back to their apartment so as soon as we get there I hop out and tell them I will just take a cab home and to have a goodnight.  They get out and insist and plead for me to come upstairs and that is when I really started sweating bullets.  I could just tell, and the vibe was in the air.  

We head inside and after about 30 minutes of small talk and a few shots and a bong rip they are back at it on the couch.  Only this time he is really putting it on her.  He pushed her down and took off her shirt right in front of me and then they just layed there making out taking off clothing items...then there is me...I dont know what to do...deer in headlights...My cock is rock hard but I dont want to act...what if I piss him off and he wants to kill me?  What if I weird him out if I try to do something to his dick?  What if I weird them both out because I want him to fuck me while I fuck her?

Anyways...they get down to the last item of clothing each and she stands up and walks over to me and grabs me by the hand and takes my hand and puts it down her panties.  Fuck me.  I have never been so hard/confused at once.  Flustered to say the least.  I look at her and she is smiling...I look at him and he is now naked stroking his cock smiling looking at both of us...So i just figured, fuck it. 

She takes me and we follow her boyfriend into the bedroom and lay down.  She comes over, now completely naked and sits on my face.  At this point I am not thinking rationally so I just start to go to town on her.  After about a minute of doing it someone starts sucking my cock but I cant see because my tongue is buried inside this girls pussy/ass.  I finally get a glimpse and it is her boyfriend.  He is gripping my thighs and taking my cock tip to base like it was a fucking ring pop.  It was amazing.  I smile and close my eyes and continue to eat her out while he blows me.  Then I start to want a juicy dick in my mouth.  I get out from under her and switch with him.  He sildes under and I come out and get his dick all to myself.  

I take my time and kiss it all over and lick and suck on his balls gently.  Then I licked his dick (a solid 7 inch perfection) up and down teasing him before deep throating it all the way to the base so i could lick his balls with his cock down my throat.  I go faster and faster using one hand to jack him off and with the other I slide a finger against his ass and he willingly gestures his hole to my finger so I slide it in and continue to blow him.  

He gets out from under her and  pushes me off.  We all laugh and touch each other and talk dirty for a little and then he asks how we should fuck...I didnt want to upset anyone and I am a go with the flow type of guy so I said I will do whatever you want.  He asked if I had ever been fucked before and I told him yes :).  I imagine I was beaming with happiness...just thinking of a dick in my ass makes my mouth water and my cock hard...So I lay down on top of his girl and spread her legs wide and prop them up with my arms.   I move my legs forward and push up against her and spread my legs so my ass is nice and open.  I slide inside her first and get nice and comfortable.  Then he had to work my ass a little to get his big dick in there but he did of course ;).  Then we had to figure out how to fuck and basically he just got to pound my ass from behind while I was bent over inside his girl fucking her.  He fucked me so hard I came in like 5 minutes.  He was DRILLING my prostate.  Like over and over and over and when I came it felt like a bucket full...I filled his girl up so much I could feel it leaking on my balls before I even finished cumming in her.  Then he fucked me until he came in my ass and then it was a funny cigarette after.  "
1p3zsd,0,2013-10-24,Some thoughts about my unemployed sister which have been killing me for a while.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p3zsd/some_thoughts_about_my_unemployed_sister_which/,"I have an older sister, she went off to an out of state college right out of highschool and after her first year she transferred and Moved back to the city where we lived. She first lived in a apartment away from us as she didn't want to move back from reasons, she had a nice pad with some financial assistance to help her pay for the apartment. She managed to get a job while being in school and constantly spoke about how hard she had it, a year or so pass and she moves back with us claiming that the rent was too expensive. *Before I go any further, anyone who lives in New York City knows how expensive rent is and would be awfully glad to get one for a few hundred bucks with no roommate*. She moves back and takes over the house and is upset to have moved back with the family(I'd be pist off too). When she moved back I find out more about her, turns out she went to school about 4 days a week and went from the morning to night. She manages to find a more better job which pays well and stays there for a while, like all people she gets tired and my father tells her that he will support her if she decides to quit. One thing I learned in my life is that my father can never be relied on and he always exaggerates his claims, after she quits that great job she struggles with money angry at my dad who claimed he would help her.

 Fast forward a few months, I never saw her study very much and always struggled to do her homework. I didn't think much of it since I too am easily distracted and procrastinate with my work(I was in high school at this time). She later on starts to find a large amount of friends around her late Sophomore Year, I found out that she's had an extravagant social life and had many ""friends"". She goes out to eat with them every night and would have get togethers, she would often take out money from my dad and take some from me but I assumed she mainly got by on financial aid and some loans. During her third year I discover that she is largely in debt because of college, I of course assume that his to do with the tuition and she starts nagging at my father for help. She made it seem like he had to help her financially and always gave a story about how her friends parents helped them financially, I tried to stay out of it. I also wanted to mention that she doesn't go out and get chinese food or anything no! her daily outing including a plate of chicken and rice for close to $20 with some hookah. She didn't have a job at this time, yet she continued to spend wildly and wouldn't stop. Her Senior Year comes and I found out that her debt has reached about 20k, I wasn't surprised at all but still I assumed that about 95% of it came from the tuition. After her graduation she was unable to find a job, she wanted to go into law but didn't have the money for it and of course my father couldn't be relied on. She went without a job for close to 2 years and finally managed to get a small job in customer service, she however quit within two weeks claiming it was to hard and the pay wasn't great.


 During my time in high school I grew awfully worried about my sister at times and wondered how I would pay for College, I was going under the college transition stress and didn't wanna end up like her. I then started speaking to my sister about things like the tuition, I was planning on going to the same university program and was worried on how I would pay. To then she laughs and says that it's free with the financial aid and low cost tuition, I was flabbergasted, it appears as though the 20k in loans was taken out for her daily outing and events with friends. Some of which she described to be terrible and not even fun. She claims that she never went through any kind of internships to better help her Resume and that he grades weren't very great. At this point I couldn't believe it, I knew she spent a lot going out but 20k in just loans for eating out. She got married close to a year ago and is currently pregnant, she still to this day does not have a job and relies on her husbands measly income. I also found out that she was taking a while to graduate because she kept on taking remedials and never payed attention in some classes. I also forgot to mention that she thought she needed a vacation so spend a few thousand dollars going to Europe and had to beg my dad for money(she resorted to her friends)

Suddenly everything I thought of her changes, I hated her with a passion. When she lived in my home, she made it worse then hell. She the kind of person who would watch TV at night and when you politely ask her to turn it down, she turns it up and opens the door all the way for you to hear. She also disregards everyones privacy, argued constantly and was very abusive. But yet I still felt bad after what *I thought* she was going through, when I found out out about the free tuition, the loans she took and her terrible credit, I honestly wanted to smack the hell out of her. Her stupidity has made me more angry than anything and I still haven't got over it. She can get a job today if she wants but she not even trying and what gets me even angrier is that she only applies to one job per month and acts like no one wants to hire her. All the time she spent at UNi was just for clubs and socializing with friends, she rarely studied.


I currently begun college with free tuition(Grateful for Financial Aid), am not taking any remedials. I'm nothing special but I'm actually trying to get my stuff done and am as frugal as can be(I get buyers remorse when I buy mcdonalds). With my financial aid I actually get a surplus amount of money that can actually last me the whole semester spending moderately as well if I wanted to. I know see that my father had also knew about the free tuition and that is one of the reasons why he never helped her, all those times I wondered why he couldn't just help the *poor* girl out and the answer was right in front of me. I never thought to see how much the tuition was, I never asked anything like that because I thought it would be rude and it just didn't come up. I don't know why I spoke about this, it just really bothered me, I had been so depressed about college all throughout high school and her abuse really took a toll on the whole family, I know I need to move on. I've learned from her mistakes I just hope all of you do too.


**TLDR:Please do not take out thousands of dollars in loans just for expensive restaurants, don't be an asshole to anyone. Don't start smashing silverware when you don't get what you want. If you're taking remedials for a long time, study up and get serious! Take internships during college, don't rely completely on your parents even if they claim they can help you financially. Don't just apply to one position a month and think that no one wants to hire you. Do not take a vacation if you don't have any money and you haven't worked hard for one and if you are a college student you should definitely not be eating at an expensive restaurant(I should be seeing you in burger kind of at most eating Chinese food).If you are unable to find a job, don't be afraid to get some help from programs,*my sister denied getting food stamps because she was too embarrassed*(forgot to mention that).

My boyfriend and I met in college when I was a freshman and he was a sophomore (both age 19). We immediately fell head over heels for each other and started dating about 3 months after we initially met. Things were absolutely incredible and we clicked on so many levels. After a few months, we were even talking about moving in together/marriage (which now, looking back, seems foolish). The fall semester of my Junior year/his senior year, we unofficially lived together. Everything was smooth sailing, and we got along fabulously. 

For a little background that will be important later: we both live in the same state where we went to school, (our homes are about 4 hours apart), and we would always visit each other over the summer &amp; christmas breaks. He is very close with his family, all of which live in the same town where he grew up, but I am not really close with my family. As a child, I lived all over the world and don't see it as a big deal to be apart from my family. 

In January of 2012 (the spring semester of my Junior year &amp; his last semester as a senior), I moved about 9 hours away for an 8-month internship with a fabulous company in my field. We knew we could work through the long distance, and we visited each other as often as possible (Between every 3-6 weeks, so quite often!). Every time he would come to visit me, he would always say how much he absolutely loved the area and that he would definitely move there with me if I ended up getting a full-time job there after I graduated. 

When he graduated, he took a job in a city located ~3 hours from school, ~5 hours from where I had my internship, and ~1.5 hrs from his hometown. Everything was still great, I felt like we had the best relationship in the world, he constantly talked about wanting to propose, move in together, get married, the whole 9 yards.

Enter March of this year. I was offered a full time job with the company I did the internship for (even though I don't graduate until December of this year), and he and I talked everything over. It was an incredible offer (I would make ~12K more than he currently makes), and he said I should absolutely take it and he would absolutely move down with me. So I excitedly accepted the offer.

Not even a week after I accepted the offer, he told me he was unsure about moving down. It's about a 6/7 hour drive to his hometown, and he wasn't sure if he would want to be that far away from family. I told him we could easily afford to buy plane tickets whenever since we'd be making 6 figures combined. I tried to assure him that everything would be fine. But he kept waffling - one week he'd be fine with moving down, the next week he'd say he wasn't ready. Then he would ask me if I'd go back and turn down my offer and look for a job in the city he already lived in. I told him it would be career suicide to do that, and I would never go back on an offer that I've already signed paperwork for. He admitted after a while that he was changing his mind because he had started to really enjoy his job and really didn't want to leave. All of this flip-flopping on his part led to some absolutely horrible fights. After a while, he finally agreed that he would leave his job and move down with me once I graduated in December.

Things were OK for a while over the summer, but towards the end of the summer we started arguing like crazy again because I brought up the idea of possibly wanting to move across the country in the future (We live on the east coast, but the majority of the best jobs in my field are on the west coast). He said he just wasn't ready for that kind of move since he doesn't want to be that far from his family, and that he pretty much sees himself staying on the east coast forever. I agreed and said that I'm not sure where life is going to lead me in terms of my career, so it is foolish for me to be making plans to move while I don't even have anything that would warrant a move. However, after that conversation we just ended up bickering a lot (about when he was going to move down, how I feel like he doesn't put enough effort into our relationship, how he hasn't visited my family since April but i've seen his family ~20 times since then).

After all of the fighting, he told me about 3 weeks ago that he no longer feels comfortable making plans to move down with me. He says if he is going to give up a job he loves and move away from family, he wants to make sure that I am the girl he wants to marry (he would want to get engaged soon after moving in together). And he said with all of the fighting going on, he just isn't sure if he feels that way about me now. He doesn't want to break up, but he wants to figure out how he feels before he makes plans to move down. So now I am at a complete loss for what to do. I had to look for an apartment on my own, make all the plans to move down on my own, and now we always talk about what ""I"" am going to do once ""Im"" down there, not what ""we"" are going to do once ""we"" are down there. 

We always talked about how awesome this stage of our life would be (making plans for moving in together and making plans for the future together), and now that it's here and it's not going the way we planned, it has just been really hard for me to deal with. Every time I try to talk about it with him, he gets frustrated and says we should just pretend like everything is normal so we can try to get back to the way things used to be. 

So my question to you, Reddit, is what do I do? Do I wait around for him to make up his mind? Should I realize that it probably isn't a good sign that he doesn't know how he feels about me 3.5 years into the relationship when we're only a few months away from moving in together? How do I deal with all of the sadness from feeling like everything I ever wanted/planned for with him is now all of a sudden slipping through my fingers?

**tl;dr**: Long distance boyfriend and I have always made plans for moving in together. Have slowly realized that we want different things but wanted to stay together anyway. Started fighting a lot because of long distance/wanting different things and now boyfriend says he doesn't know if he wants to move in together/start a life together anymore. I don't know what to do :("
1p3hb4,4,2013-10-23,(Yet another) Need help with (deciding on and) accepting an offer!,NizardkingOffspring,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1p3hb4/yet_another_need_help_with_deciding_on_and/,"I recently completed my office visits and was given job offers for my top two choices.

Background: I am a senior seeking a spring internship in tax. I would then go back and finish one class in the summer and start the Macc program in the fall. I have already had a summer internship in industry and think public is the logical next step in my progression. My plan is to open my own tax firm someday, or do tax work for a corporation. I don't see myself staying with public accounting forever, but if opportunities arise management wise, I would definitely consider it. There is a chance that I transfer to something more related to IT, as this interests me a bit more than taxes, and is my concentration in college.

One of the firms is the #1 firm in my region (top 15 overall) (around 200m profit above the second place firm in the region). I am led to believe that I would get exposure to at least four different sectors of tax work (non-profit, fraud, health care, financial services) here - if not more. It is located in a great city, in a different state than I currently live in. I loved the people, and the office seemed a bit more laid back than the following firm. I would have to pay for housing here (for 4 short months), but I am not too worried about availability, or the cost (considering what I will be making). Again, the city was great and I think I would love living here for a short period of time (maybe even longer, I'd prefer to start a family here rather than the later city).

The other firm is big 4.  It is in a ""bigger"" city, but still small enough to only have an office of ~110 as a big four. I like the international aspect here (although I want to stay in the U.S.) and the bigger clients that they have. I think that for my future, the bigger city experience would give me more opportunities and a better chance at having success on my own. I think that I would not be as specialized as I have heard with most big 4 professionals (especially since I am just interning) -- but I would not get the 4+ sector rotation that I would get at the previous firm. I also loved the people here, and the office was cleaner, newer, and seemed more professional than the previous firm. (I am not sure if the more professional, less laid-back office culture is ideal to me, but it does not make or break the deal). I would get one last chance to live at home here, and save on housing along with some meals. The commute to work would be around 40 minutes.

Both offices are of similar size (~110), the pay is very close to the same (along with the study programs and incentives to get my CPA within a year).

I apologize for the novel, but I guess my main question is:

Is having big 4 experience THAT much more important? I just can't seem to justify turning down an offer from a big 4 firm. I prefer the city of the smaller firm, but the pay, people, office, and experience (maybe), seem very similar to me. And..I can do anything for 4 months, even if I hate it (which I don't think I will come close to either way I go with this decision). I don't believe I am going to do public accounting forever, so will I wish I had big 4 experience (and big 4 on my resume) for the future?.

I have two days to decide, and am stressing over this decision. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!"

The CGM allows me to track my blood glucose levels throughout the day, and I plan on following some LG principles for a few of the days. I'll keep a food log with meals and times and should be able to provide graphs showing how my blood glucose changes during the fast, feed, and during exercise. The study is blind so I won't be able to upload results until after the trial ends on Tuesday. Here's a picture of the sensor. http://i.imgur.com/fvfJGd3.jpg

**Update**

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

we need help locating internship oppotunities that accept students from overseas, similar to Fermilab and DESY and Caltech's SURF. we don't have a country of preference, the length of the internship doesn,t matter, as long as we get paid (i'm poor, dunno what his reasons are).

my research interests are mathematical physics, and theortical mechanics. my friend seems to like parrticles and computational methods. we're from the philippines, and we have one year left in undergrad."

Honestly, I know it's stupid but I secretly want some sort of closure.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p79hy/25f_meeting_with_an_exfling_28m_while_hes_in_town/,"I aware this is silly and I know (from countless of advice from friends) that closure doesn't really exist, but I find myself in this predicament and I want advice from people who are not my friends. I met him about 5 years ago when I recently ended a long relationship and I was ready and excited to be single during my last year in campus before I have to leave for my full year internship. We actually met at a Bon Voyage BBQ and we flirted a bit but that was it. He left the party because he was getting sick and I didn't expect to see again.

It wasn't until I was studying abroad when he messaged me on Facebook. At first it took me a while to realise that it was him but afterwards we would crack jokes and talk about the complexities of time-zones. A month later I returned home and the FB conversations continued. We agreed to meet up and later on that night I had the best make-out session in my life. I might be exaggerating but I really liked it. 

After that we continued to meet up and hook up. I thought it was a nice summer fling since he was leaving for med-school in a month and I wanted to be single, but I did fall madly in love for him. After a year of long conversations, texts, skype calls, awkward/hilarious phone sex, and hooking up whenever he visits I decided to fly to him and confess I loved him. I visited him 2 weeks prior to my internship. I wasn't expecting a relationship and I was just hoping that maybe he felt the same way I felt. I told him I loved him and he told me he doesn't feel the same way and said ""I can't love someone who's 1,200 miles away."" I flew home crying. 

I left for my internship and was pretty excited to be in a new city and hoped to get over him. During that time he would call me to check up on me and sometimes he would drunk call me saying, ""You hate me."" I would tell him, ""I can't hate you."" 

The phone calls became less frequent and I was dating my current [29/m] boyfriend. The last time I saw the ex-fling was when I went home for the Holidays. He embarrassed me in front of my friends saying that my current boyfriend was not good enough for me. I was so embarrassed that I started crying and he was very sorry and that he was drunk. After that we just didn't really talk and for 3 years he would randomly text me and I would reply but he wouldn't really text back. Honestly I did the same thing too. 0_0

When I went back home for a wedding he told me was going to be in town too. I asked if he wanted to catch up. He said yes, but he stood me up and messaged me a day after saying he couldn't leave the hospital on time. I was sad and decided that was my closure. It was painful to accept. That was 5 months ago.

And this morning randomly he texted me saying he'll be in town this weekend because he has an interview at a very fancy hospital and asked ""Did you want to meet up for lunch on Saturday or dinner on Sunday?"" I told him to pick which the date and he chose Sunday. 

I have this stupid game plan in my head of how I should behave during Sunday. 1) Be sober, maybe one drink. 2) Have realistic expectation. 3) Quick good bye. 4) Maybe nothing will happen and he'll bail out again.
My friends tell me I should cut of ties since he's just stringing me along. I know he's dating someone so he has moved on. But a part of me wants to know he does he randomly contact me then leave me hanging. 

Sorry that this post is long. 
Tl;dr for 4 years ex-fling randomly texts me and it messes with  my heart string. Now he'll be in town and wants to meet and catch up.

1p762v,1,2013-10-25,Accept internship offer from regional firm or wait for Big 4?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1p762v/accept_internship_offer_from_regional_firm_or/,"I'll give a run-down on both opportunities first:

Regional Firm: Received an offer. Technically, this is a busy season internship (January-May) but they say they are looking for a long-term relationship and wouldn't hire someone who is committed to another firm after May.  The firm is great, the people are nice and the pay is above average. However, the firm conducted their second interviews before I had a chance to do many first round interviews. Therefore, they are asking for an answer fairly early on in the process.

Big 4: I had my second interview earlier this week with a big 4 and I thought it went extremely well. 12 people interviewed for about 7-8 intern positions, and I feel like I have a great chance. That being said, I didn't think my first interview with them went so well and I ended up with a second interview anyways. This internship begins in June. I won't find out if I have an offer until after I have to reply to the regional firm about my offer from them. Big 4 is my top choice due to the difference in professionalism, and obviously better career opportunities. 

Any advice on what I should do? The way I look at it is, if I get the big 4 offer I can accept both offers and do both internships. The only issue with this is I would be leaving the regional firm after my internship and breaking this ""long-term relationship"" they want with me. However, they aren't promising me anything so I don't believe I have the responsibility to fully commit to them. Plus, how bad can burning a bridge really be if I move on to a big 4?

This is for an internship, so to say the least my experience in programming in general is also very thin, but what is irking me is that there are a bunch of steps I'm supposed to follow to reimport assets.

One is going to some StreamingAssets menu and importing from submodule, which then takes like 5-10 minutes.

Then another is another custom menu -&gt; regenerate asset database.

I frankly don't have a good idea what any of these really do and none of my coworkers can explain it well enough, or just accept that that's just the way its being done. I've only worked with Unity for around 3 weeks now, yet I spent 2-3 hours per day struggling with things like random null exception errors during startup and have to relaunch the loading scene and ""pray"" it gets through the loading screen without freezing (luckily it works 3 out of 4 times), then when I change to older commits (git) the assets get regenerated or reimported and I have no idea what's going on and if it works, great, if it doesn't work, I have to do the reimport thing which takes 10 minutes. Least to say, by afternoon I'm extremely burnt out and want to go back to developing my own 2D game where I know that my image is just a file that I move, instead of dealing with prefabs which names aren't in the C# code, animations not appearing but have no idea why, and why some problems appear on iOS but not Android, and Android but not iOS, or both but not on the computer running Unity.

Any tips for how to get through these hurdles better?"

I'm a 21 year old male in my last year of undergrad in Canada. I've known my girlfriend for about seven years, and I've dated her for a little over two years now. I'm completely in love with her. I love everything about her, I want to wake up next to her every day, I want to laugh with her, and I want a future with her. She wants the same things. We're on the same page for almost every aspect of our life. 


I want to attend graduate school on the other side of the country (5 hour flight). She's going to be attending graduate school in the same province. To do this graduate program, I'll be away from her for at least two years, with a third year away from her if my internship is not in the same city she lives in. 


I want to attend graduate school because I want to study something that I enjoy, and because I want to make money. I grew up in an extremely poor family. We barely scraped by every month - I've seen what a lack of money and dead end jobs do to a marriage. I know what no vacations or time away from your kids for 21 years can do to a relationship. I don't want to end up like my parents. I'm scared of being like them. 

---

As good as we are, I dont think we can survive apart for that long, and that scares me. I've been thinking about just applying to another graduate school(not as good) in order to stay with her. But, I'm worried that I will resent her if my career does not turn out the way I want it to. I feel selfish, and I feel worried. I care about her a lot. 

---

I've brought up going away for school, and she told me that if this is what I want to do, then I should do it. But she's also told me that she would much prefer if I were to stay here. I'm torn.

1p6cjz,14,2013-10-25,I can't seem to sort out my feelings for this boy,[deleted],gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1p6cjz/i_cant_seem_to_sort_out_my_feelings_for_this_boy/,"Right now, I am halfway across the country from my home/school on an internship in a big city where I only know less than a handful of people that came here from my school as well. I've been spending a lot of time with one of these guys, I barely knew him before starting this semester, but in the last two months, we've become pretty good friends. I know he's gay, he knows I'm gay, and we've both acknowledged that a lot of the times we spend hanging out, exploring the city get awfully close to feeling like dates. This all came to a head about a month ago when I got drunk and kissed him, and fell asleep together in my bed. We've acknowledged it happened, but we haven't brought it up much. He's slept in my bed at least twice (and will tomorrow), but both times have been strictly platonic. He definitely is interested in me, he's not so subtly implied it, but he's left the ball in my court to make a move on him or not. 

I don't know if I want this to progress to a relationship. He has a lot of qualities I don't particularly care for, he's missing some of the things that I really want in a boyfriend, and while he's kind of cute, he's not so attractive that I feel weak at the knees and forgive all his faults. His interests and mine have only a little bit of overlap, he doesn't play video games, he doesn't follow politics other than major LGBT news, and he doesn't get my nerdy references, so I have to stop and explain half of the things I say, and that gets mentally frustrating after a while.

And yet, when I wake up to an empty bed I wish he was around. He's nice, and sweet, he has a pretty good sense of humor, I like spending time with him. He's genuinely trying to get into things that I like, I've hooked him on Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, he likes listening to my music, he watches me play Pokemon since he used to play it up to SoulSilver, and tonight when I was explaining how I was starting to get into Magic: the Gathering, he was flipping through my cards after I gave him (the briefest of) an explanation. Sometimes I want him, and when he's around I'm glad he is.

But it's like a switch that flips off and on repeatedly in my head over whether or not I like him or not, and it never stays in one position very long. I broke up with my last ex eight months ago, and since then, I haven't so much as kissed anyone else. I've only been on one official date since then. I have no options that appeal to me but date this boy, and if things go wrong, lose a friend (my only friend I have out here), or stay friends and continue feeling lonely. I'll be back in school in January, Ill see my crush again and a bunch of other guys I might connect with better (my school has a decently sized LGBT community, but between being out for a semester and taking summer classes when no one was around, and now being away on internship, I've been away from it for a while). On the other hand, I know I'm indecisive, and more than once I've let perfect be the enemy of good, but I've been in more than one one-sided relationships where I couldn't get emotionally invested that I just want to find someone where the feelings run both ways.

Guys, can you give me any advice or anything to mull over? Should I give him a chance, or am I just desperate? Am I just an asshole? We've been stuck in this grey area and I think both of us are just waiting for me to decide what I want to do.

**TL;DR**: Away from home for two more months with a boy who has me saying ""I like him, I like him not..."" until I go insane. Wat do?"

Need help :/,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pa9ik/i22m_am_really_into_this_girl21f_but_i_think_her/,"I met the sisters about a year ago at a college party and I instantly hit it off with the older sister (Mary/21) and then she introduces me to her sister (Stacy/18). Mary gives me her number without me even asking and Im super excited because she is probably one of the most gorgeous girls I've ever met and I've never been good talking to girls. Stacy is cool too but definitely didn't get the genetics of her older sister. We start hanging out in groups for a few weeks and Mary keeps up the flirting but she always seemed to back off when Stacy was around. Few months go by and Mary stops talking to me and Im super bummed out but Stacy is always bugging me to hang out and the only reason I go is in hope that Mary will be there. I eventually realize that Mary is a huge flirt with every guy she meets and I can tell she really likes the attention. Later that semester Mary moved away for 6 months to do an internship and I was even more bummed out. I think Im actually in love with Mary because I always find myself missing her even though we dont get a lot of time to hang out I really have a thing for her. Finally after the internship is over Mary returns and all three of us start hanging out again. Mary always smiles and laughs at my jokes still but I haven't seen as much flirtatious behavior and I think its because shes trying to respect Stacys interest in me. I hate it but I have zero interest in Stacy and I really want to ask Mary out, I need help with how to approach the situation. Altogether its something thats been bothering me because I dont want to hurt Stacys feelings.
Also while Mary was away during her internship I actually became good friends with her best friend and she's always asking me which sister I like. I never know how to answer and just deflect the question.
Anyhow Ive been putting this off too long, how do yall think I should approach the situation of asking Mary out and addressing the issue of Stacy?"

Sorry for the wall of text, but this is my life.

I am very stressed and worried about my future. When I think of it, it is incredibly difficult. I don’t know how I will manage to succeed in more difficult classes than I currently have. In addition to the increased course load, I have this obligation from my parents, family and friends that I have to find a good job in the summer; a job that will pave the way for my future career. I feel extremely alone, like there is no one to help me. I find it very difficult to talk to people (mainly my parents) about my concerns. When I tell my Dad anything negative about school, it feels like he is looking down on me and that he is disappointed. I can hardly talk to him about anything anymore, and it seems like he disagrees with everything that I do. I can’t even look him in the eyes out of shame.

It honestly feels like I let him down all the time, and that I am such a disappointment. I am not popular like he was or wants me to be; I am not into sports or physical activities like he is/was. I don’t find enjoyment in just being in society like he does. I am not the social butterfly that he wants me to be. I don’t like putting myself out there, for example talking to someone or dancing with a girl.  I don’t work as hard as he does. I make excuses, I’m lazy, and I don’t deserve what I have. I always quit when things get difficult and never stick them through like a man. This is everything that I feel from him lately. It just makes me sad that I feel like he is disappointed with me.

They just don’t understand this weight I have on me right now. I feel like I’m going through this alone. No one is there to help me. I can’t study and no one can help me with what I don’t understand, so I just get frustrated. Teachers have like 2 hours a week to help a student, this is not near enough. There are no TA’s or tutors from the school that can help with this level of study. I don’t feel like I am smart, I don’t feel like I am ready for more courses next semester, I don’t think I will be able to pass them all.  I don’t feel like I can pass my Intro to Energy class right now.

I just want to quit everything like I always have.  I quit my first pizza job. I quit my first relationship with an ex. I gave up during my second year of school when it got difficult. I quit classes in the summer and gave up then, causing me to fail Sociology for not dropping it in time. I got a bad grade in the other summer course I took. I did not look for a job and simply worked for my Dad that summer. I dropped Fluids because I thought it was too hard; I failed Thermodynamics and didn’t fight for the passing grade, I just accepted the Fail.  I took 3 classes first semester of third year and did very poorly in all of them. I took four classes in second semester of 3rd year and did better (I think because I had people to work with). I quit another relationship because I didn’t think it would last while I was gone for the summer. I then went tree planting the summer after third year and quit that job because I couldn’t handle it emotionally, it was extremely difficult
. 
It is now my Fourth year of school, I am 1 year behind. I took 4 classes this first semester and already dropped one elective of it. So I have three classes now and I’ve been skipping all the lectures and assignments of one of them. The midterm for that class (Intro to Energy) is in two days, and I am procrastinating from studying and writing this. I have wasted my entire week. I had three assignments and a lab due this week and I skipped all three, but did the lab.
All I do is sit in my room when I’m home. I say hi to my parents then head to my room in the basement. For the occasional dinner I will sit in the kitchen and eat with them and say a few words. But for the majority of time, I spend little, only necessary, time outside of my room.

I feel weak and helpless right now. I feel so alone and don’t have the ambition to do much.  I’m moving soon too, out of my home town for the last 16 years, into the outskirts of my city. I literally won’t be near anyone I know, there isn’t even much where I am moving that will incline me to be social. If anything, I’m going to be alone in my room even more.

I have told my parents I hate my program and school so much. I told them it’s not what I want to do. The problem is the time and money that I have invested, and I have over a year and a half left before I graduate. I have told them I want to go to college or switch into something I would enjoy. I would rather be happy in a program I enjoy, with people to help me than be alone in this program that I am finding unbearable. 
My whole life I’ve been very attentive to detail, I’m great at visualizing things, building things, following instructions, and I’m fairly creative but a tad indecisive. If I could go back in time, I would go to college for a more hands-on program. Maybe tool-and-dye, some UGS NX CAD designing program, maybe architecture, I don’t know. 

The problem with this is that my parents only think money is important, not whether or not I am happy. My mom wants me to finish university because of her pride; she wants to compete with her sister’s wonder son (whom is getting top grades, has an internship). This seems to apply to my Dad too. They want me to ‘make a lot of money’ and think that will make me happy. I am just sick of this. Every person I’ve told that I hate my program/school, that I want to do something else has told me to ‘stick with it’ and that ‘I only have a year left after this’. They have no idea the amount of stress I am going to have, and the accompanying depression/worry that I will no doubt have. 
There is also a massive amount of risk involved if I decide to stay. Perhaps I fail a course next semester or even next year; that would put me FURTHER back, I’m already 1 year behind from failing Thermodynamics. All my peers have passed me already and I’m stuck with a younger generation that wants nothing to do with me in the classroom.

This amount of shame, worry, anxiety, depression and uncertainty that I am undergoing is going to break me and I really need help.

1p9h7n,9,2013-10-26,My parents make me want to kill myself.,[deleted],Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1p9h7n/my_parents_make_me_want_to_kill_myself/,"I've been waiting a long time to share my story and I'm not sure if I will get everything, but I will try.

I am a 22/f, my parents are both in their mid 60's.

Currently, I am a senior in college graduating in June. To say the least, the later years of high school and my college career have been the worst.

I am the middle child and I have always been very social and independent. I began college planning in 10th grade and got into my first choice university in their honor's program and could not wait to leave home. Somewhere along the way senior year, my relationship with my parents really started going south. I always had lots of friends in school and was very involved and worked at McDonald's part time, but for some reason it always seemed like my parents, Mom specifically, really hated me for what I was. At parent teacher conferences when my teachers would tell them how much they enjoyed me in class she would say things like, ""Well, if you only saw her at home"" and weird things like that.

I never really got to hang out with friends outside of school because I was suppose to be home helping around the house. I hated this, but I could understand. Except that my siblings were always encouraged to go have fun and my parents just loved all their friends.

I tried to not let it bother me-I only had a year left.

I went off to college on shaky ground with my parents, but I didn't care I was finally out of that house. I made great friends and loved life. 

I also failed my classes. To this day I can't tell you why-I think I just always felt like I had more time to get my grades up later. I didn't party and I wasn't depressed. I worked part time on the weekends and I just hung out with people and did minimal work.

I also barely kept in contact with my parents. I didn't want to talk to the because I felt like they hated me. They were footing the bill of my education though, so I should have been in more communication with them. They were pissed when I was on academic probation, but somehow I was allowed to go back in the winter. My grades got better, but not enough to stay in honors and I knew I wasn't coming back.

So, then next year I stayed at home and went to a community college. My friends from HS were still there and it wasn't that bad. Except that I was living at home with my parents who were still pissed at me. It was a really hard year of uncomfortable interactions and me getting yelled at a lot.

I still worked part time and was going to school full time. I was ""never home"" and not helping around the house enough. I hated being home because I was always in trouble and I felt like I was missing out on my college experience. I saw all my friends posting about how much fun they were having and I was stuck home crying because my parents were always yelling at me.

Somewhere along the way, things got better. I love my parents, I do, but I just don't think that they really like me as a person.

I've been commuting my junior and senior year now to a nearby university. My grades are great and I have great relationships with my professors and some classmates. But I still feel like I'm missing out and I am always waiting for my parents to be made at me for something. 

My major requires three internships totaling 1,000 hours. Two of the ones I did were not paid. So my parents paid $900 for me to work for free. I tried explaining the requirements but all they see is  waste of money.

It's really hard to balance school full time, an internship, a part time job and then being home to help with chores. My siblings are away at school living on campus so I am the only one home to help.

I'm always in trouble for not doing enough and it's taking its toll on me. I'm 22, and very successful to everyone but my parents. My Mom has even told me that people should know ""what a bad person I really am"".

I know I should just move out, but they pay for everything and I am so close to leaving anyway. 

It's just really hard to stay positive. I think about killing myself a lot.

So, to all you parents, I'm just looking for advice.

tl;dr My parents hate me and I don't want to live anymore.

Gonna try and make this brief so you get the idea.

I'm in my twenties, graduated with a BS in engineering, and worked extremely hard in my field for a good two years. That's where the good ends.


I was basically paid an internship's hourly wage (which I can tell you is a considerably small amount) at my company even though I had my degree (and did fairly well in a good university) and did some great work for them as well. Then it all just kept on going downhill from there.


With the combining forces of a high rental rate, bad spending habits, struggling with depression, and the eventual quitting of my job and moving back to my hometown I am left with a TON OF DEBT (in my eyes at least).

Fortunately I do NOT have student debts to pay, though I have: two credit cards both with thousands overdue debt, car payments, money owed to lenders, some friends, my old rental management company, and more. And my credit score is below 500 mainly due to all those accounts. Basically if just under 15k magically appeared I'll call it a day... 

AND to top it all off I basically had zero liquid cash up until just recently. 

Fortunately at the moment I am living rent free, got a new retail job as I was unsuccessful in my area search for engineering jobs, and make extra money on the side doing design work. 


If you took the time to read all that... **thank you**! but here is my actual question:

ALL I fucking really want at the moment is a way to consolidate my debt (I guess with another loan for the amount of everything I owe, some of which is not actual credit lenders). That way I have them all off my back, am able to actually rent somewhere soon, and my credit doesn't look absolutely terrible. (AND I don't feel so damn bad) At the moment I know I am able to save safely the amount extra to pay this hypothetical loan (assuming it's over a relatively longer period), but I have no WAY of quickly getting everything off my back without fucking myself much deeper into the hole. 

What can I do? Is there anyway I can get a loan? 

(family or other friends are not an option at the moment)

Am I being too selfish or naive about this? I want to improve my personal finance skills as much as I can."

Like I feel an awesome stretch of time is coming.,metroidprimee,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1p8rgz/super_excited_like_i_feel_an_awesome_stretch_of/,"A week ago I walked into my apartment's bathroom to- do the usual shower and shave, and I couldn't help notice that my gut was a bit bigger than I remembered it being. Now I don't consider myself out of shape, I still try somewhat to keep myself relatively healthy, but seeing this made me realize how lazy I have been lately. My future profession will be a 3D artist, so I inevitably am going to be spending a large amount of time on my ass in front of a computer, making the importance of keeping active all the more there, and it made me realize I've been doing nothing but eating and working the past two months. That one little sight of my growing belly make something flicker on my mind. The next morning I got up an hour earlier, readying myself for the big internship fair in an hour and a half, took a shower, which I never do in the morning, walked to the market across the street and bought an apple, instead of getting a waffle, and headed to meet a friend on our way to the fair. I just have to point out that on my way to the market that morning, I felt better than I had in MONTHS. Both physically and emotionally. I was ready to kill it. I decided to also start working out at least every other day, start the days healthier just like I did then, and be up an hour earlier than I usually am, every day. On days that I have a few hours before class, I work instead of firing up or Skyrim or something like that. To top all of that, my last resolution was probably hat you guessed, I don't fap anymore. Even better than that, I'm suprised how easy it is now! I didn't actually try since I've been in school, which now makes my schedule pretty packed. I don't even have any urges, aside form some fantasies every now and again, which were tough to resist, and still can be to be honest, I actually really did want to tonight, almost did in fact, and I remembered back to all those sad sad points where i'm pathetically jizzing onto whatever medium it was that time to catch it, and realized ""damn, I'm not going back to that again!"", and resisted. Tomorrow's a Halloween party i'm hitting up with my friends, and I'm gonna try and flirt a bit there, though I don't think anything will really happen at that point though :P, and then in about a month I'm going home for a week, which I'm really looking forward to, cause I finally have my own wheels, and can actually go out whenever i want, and I plan on trying to hook up with someone while I'm there. Overall my piece of advice on this long post for all of you great people is to just start with a few simple things, a cold shower in the morning, healthy food to get your brain pumping properly wight off the bat, and run for like 30 minutes a day, or even every other day, all the good stuff will fall in hand!

1pbvew,1,2013-10-27,"My girlfriend of a few years just learned she didn't get her ""dream job."" She's terribly depressed. What can I do to make her feel better?",Overheadsprinkler,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pbvew/my_girlfriend_of_a_few_years_just_learned_she/,"Hi, /r/depression. This post isn't like what you might used to be seeing around here; it isn't for me, but for my girlfriend of a few years. She has a long history of depression, sometime bi-polar issues, has contemplated suicide, has been on anti-depressants and has been to therapists. I've helped pull her up and she's been in a much better place since she and I met. She's told me that I am what keeps her going, and I love her very much and would do anything for her. But now... she's spiraling downward, and I don't know where to turn. So I'm hoping you guys can help me out.

**The setup:**

About a year ago, she took a year-long internship at her ""dream job"" on the other side of the country. After several months of doing long distance, I packed up and decided to relocate and join her. She and I both left our jobs back home, along with our family and friends, to try something new and exciting. And while the first few months were hard on both of us while we settled in, I found a great new job while she loved interning with her ""dream"" company.

**The problem:**

As the internship came to a close, she interviewed for a full-time position. There were quite a few other interns applying for the same position, and she felt like she ""bombed"" the interview (which for her, is surprising because she's so good with people). She just found out that she wasn't offered the position, and has hit a depression I've never seen her in.

The first reaction was crying. She bawled into my arms, and still does when she thinks about it. There are times when she just lays there, in silence, staring at nothing. Then there are times where she will get extremely angry, yelling at me for even trying to give her words of advice. She then goes back to crying, or laying in bed in the dark for hours, it seems.

**A little more info:**

Her whole reason to move here was to work for this company. This company specializes in a very particular market, one which doesn't have many competitors (or at least, doesn't have many competitors that do as 'good' of a job as this company). She misses her family and friends back home constantly, and she hears about all their good news all the time (""Soandso got a new job!"" or ""Soandso got engaged!""). Even I recently got a great new job at a company I really admire.

She feels like moving here was a mistake. She feels like she's let everyone down (including me), by having us move here and leave everything and everyone behind. She feels incredibly alone, even when I go to console her. And I feel terrible because I simply don't know what to say.

**What I need from you, Reddit:**

I need to know what to say or do in this situation. Regardless if moving here for her ""dream job"" was a good or bad decision, I need to know what to tell her. What should I do? How can I lift her spirits and give her confidence? I want her to feel like there's always another way to reach her dreams, even if it isn't with this company. *(Note: I did just find that there are some part-time jobs her ""dream"" company offers, so I could pitch that idea to her. But they pay significantly less and don't have much in the way of benefits.)*

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

-----

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I moved across the country for an internship with her ""dream job."" Meanwhile, all her friends got hired at great new jobs (even I got hired by a great company). So my girlfriend also wants to be a part of everyone's good news, and make her friends and family proud. Her internship with Dream Co. ended, she interviewed for a full-time slot, and didn't get it. Now she feels like crap for having moved all the way here, only to not get the job she was so passionate about. She feels like she's let everyone down and has made a big mistake by betting everything on this. Regardless if that is true, what can I say or do to help her?

I think everyone is still proud of her, I know I am. But what else can I do or say to cheer her up?

Thanks."
1pavjr,0,2013-10-27,Thoughts,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1pavjr/thoughts/,"I've been feeling down recently, this will probably just turn out to be rambling but w/e.

I'm a first year college student in the US, grades haven't been too bad (except Calc II, tough class).  I'm not worried about paying off college or having to take out a student loan, most of that's covered for between money from parents, my internship, scholarships, etc.  I'm not worried about being able to find a job or what I want to do once I graduate college.  I'm a Com Sci major, I enjoy programming along with music production/audio so something along those lines.

I'm an awkward person I tend to think, never had a girlfriend, haven't even kissed a girl.  Had a couple prom dates and whatnot from high school, even had a girl tell me she liked me and wanted to go out.  That didn't end up working out, even though I was all for it.  Later found out she thought I only wanted to date her because I wanted a ""first kiss"".

I'm really into music, songwriting, etc.  Played in a band with friends that split up because of everyone going to different colleges.  We played a couple of local places here and there, nothing too big.  I made some music on my own that I want to play around campus once I find a couple of other people willing to play with me.  I've been to a local music festival here, a student club for ""musicians"", and a couple of open mic nights around town but haven't found anyone yet.

Would love it to be able to find a girl who's into the same kind of music, or at least devotion to music, that I could strike up a conversation with.  I did meet a girl who is also a DJ for the student radio station here and I (somewhat awkwardly) invited her to come along to the local music festival going on that weekend.  She said she was most likely busy with homework.  Via after friending her on facebook I found out she has a boyfriend.  I still talk with her weekly when I go in to do my radio show, there's laughing and smiling so I'm not concerned with coming off as creepy or weird.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  I'm surprised if you're still reading this, I don't think i'm too exciting.

I guess why I've been feeling down recently is I just want to love someone.  In high school and before I've been able to push aside the fact of not having a girlfriend easily because relationships really aren't too serious then.  Now people I know from school are getting married, finding the love of their life.  I feel pressured.  I feel like an antisocial loser.  I'd like to think I maintain good hygiene, dress somewhat decently (pretty normal).  Clean shaven, skin fairly clear, ordinary haircut.  I am a bit shorter and look a little young for my age, which has actually bit me in the ass a couple of times.  I've had a girl I liked a while back tell me she just wanted to be friends because she didn't date guys shorter than her.

Not looking for advice really, just wanted to say what was on my mind.  Been pretty lonely, and I guess more so this weekend.  Lots of video games alone in my room after hanging out with the usual guys for a little bit today."

The job is alright, although the income is pretty low. But I'm not complaining since I was getting really depressed for not working, and feeling sick for being a parasite, but I digress.
I consider my self a hard work employee, and I admit that's because work it's the only thing that keeps me distracted by this awful disease.
Anyway, I wasn't hired to be a sysadmin, but instead a service desk/technician on site, which I don't mind since I don't have the proper skills to be a sysadmin.
So my job consists of changing workstations, laptops, resetting some AD user accounts, configure some VoIP phones, etc...
But I consider myself a pretty hard worker and an achiever, and I was looking for some advices, tips, to automate my work and being more productive. I would be very thankful to you guys.

I started my transformation back on April 29th, after I had gotten home from my one month internship that was required to graduate my college program.  6 months in and I feel like a brand new person!

I started off by using the treadmill we had at home (conveniently in my room none the less).  I would start off by running for as long as I could, which usually got me to the 8-10 minute mark, then I would take a few minute break and walk until I got up to half an hour total.  I did that for the first month and a half or so until the treadmill broke, and then I was forced to run outside, which I hated.  Not only was it a little embarrassing to be jiggling my way around outside, it's also a lot harder to run outside than it is on a treadmill!

After running for about 2 or 3 weeks, I decided to get a gym membership so I could stick to cardio equipment.  I used the elliptical and treadmills, with the occasional stop on the stair masters.  I tried for an hour a day, 7 days a week, but there was the odd day when I really wasn't feeling it and cut my workouts short.  3 months or so later I added weight lifting to my workouts, so now on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I'll warm up with 20-30 minutes of cardio, followed by lifting. Then on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends I'll do an hour of cardio.

I used myfitnesspal for the first few months, but I haven't really used it the last month and a half or so.  I cut wayyyy back on snacking, which was my biggest problem before.  I haven't drank much pop for almost 2 years now, I stopped eating fast food this year as a New Years resolution, and after a few bad weeks of gaining a little bit of weight because of drinking alcohol, I told myself I'm not going to drink again until I hit the 100 pound lost mark. 

It's pretty crazy what you can do in a few months if you just put your mind to it. A year ago if you told me I'd be able to run 5K on a treadmill without stopping or run around my subdivision (nearly 5K) in 28 and a half minutes, I would have said you're insane.  And yet here I am, sweating my ass off 7 days a week in the gym, smiling weekly every time I step on that scale and see that my hard work has been paying off.

I've been offered a software development internship at Epic and wanted to get some locals' opinions on the company, and, ideally, the internship itself. I'll be moving in from out of town for the summer. I have heard loads of good things about Epic, namely that the campus is fantastic and they are one of the industry leaders in HealthIT. However, I have heard a few negative things too, such as the high turnover rate, the sometimes unreasonable hours, and the lack of industry standards in some aspects of their systems (cache, Visual Basic). I think some of the negatives won't apply to me as I'll only be there for the summer. Can anyone provide any additional input or comment on what I've said? Much appreciated"

I want to discover which parameters (if any) show characteristic changes before a heart attack happened. 

So basically, I want to be able to do some test that will allow me to say, ""The period directly before a heart attack is associated with an increase in parameter X and a decrease in parameters Y and Z"".

Can anyone help me select a good test (or set of tests) to perform this analysis? Also, how would I be able to extend these tests to account for possible interactions between parameters (something like, ""an increase in parameter X was associated with impending heart attack, but only if there was also a decrease in parameter Y""?)

1pda0h,18,2013-10-28,Feeling Crushed by the Market and my SO's Success,AVDisco,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pda0h/feeling_crushed_by_the_market_and_my_sos_success/,"Hi Ladies,

I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, but I know you are a beautiful group of people and I feel comfortable asking for your advice...

I know that this is probably a story that sounds familiar, but I have had a hard time since graduating with my MA and hitting a market that just didn't have a lot to offer. In my case, that led to months of depression living with my family. But, then I got an internship! Joy! Unfortunately, it was far enough away that I needed to find another place to live. That place ended up being my SO's parents' house. If that not bad enough, I needed an income and still couldn't find a job. Through a series of circumstances, that job ended up being for his mother at a new business she was starting with an investor as a sort of business affiliated with his non-profit org. (While I do like the idea of non-profit work, they are only tangentially connected. The work is extremely basic, boring, and not what I wanted to do for the next year, let alone the rest of my life. But, I was happy that I had something.)

Now, fast forward a year and a half later. The internship is long over and I have been working for just a bit over minimum wage all this time, still living with his parents. (We have been sleeping separately, I should mention. He gave up his bed and has been sleeping on the couch, a fact which compounds my guilt.) I have networked and interviewed, but things have gone nowhere. On the other hand, just recently my SO has started a new job. Less than a month after taking the bar exam, he applied to some blind postings online and was offered a job as an associate attorney.

I am here for advice because what should be just a joyous situation is leaving me feeling completely crushed, depressed, and filled with anxiety. I worked so hard in school and have never had a problem when I put my mind to something - good grades, research grants, etc. But, now I feel like a complete failure who can't even start my career, while my SO barely tries and gets an incredible job offer. I am stuck doing something I don't enjoy, but I can't really quit because I need the money and I don't want to piss off his mother. (Our relationship has been strained enough due to some bad things going on at work and frustrations carrying over into the personal life, which I can't escape because of our current living situation, which, if you can't tell, I am miserable about... As much as I appreciate what they have done for me, the household is extremely dysfunctional and can be an extremely stressful place to be.)

Ladies, pardon my language but I feel like a royal fuck up. I am completely depressed and anxious and I can't seem to make anything happen for myself. I feel like it is going to affect our relationship, and that it will very possibly ruin my relationship with his parents. I am at a loss here about what I can do differently and how to improve things for us and save these relationships. He had another call for an interview over the weekend, and I couldn't hide my frustration... (This isn't even everything that is going on regarding my relationship with these people, but this is what is currently at the forefront, causing me constant stress.) We are hopefully going to move out soon, and I know I'm not going to be able to pull my weight.

Do I just need to suck it up and be patient? Is there anything else I can do to improve my chances at finding a career or where my skills might be attractive....? I've talked to my SO about my feelings... is there anything else I can do that will help me not to dump my depressed feelings onto him when he should be happy? Does anyone have a personal story about experiencing something similar so I don't feel so alone? (I know other people have been in bad employment situations... I just feel like all this other relationship shit has made it worse.)

Sorry for rambling... Thanks to those of you who read this far.


TL;DR I am a fuck up when it comes to starting my career, I'm starting to hate my SO's family, and I am having a hard time being happy for his success. "

The 'next step' that I want to take, a PhD, won't happen for nearly a year at the earliest. Besides that, my other opportunities won't start for another 4 months at the earliest (other degrees, internship opportunities, anything related to my career). 

Why should this matter? Because I'm living in my personal hell. I'm living in the same residence, in the same fucking bedroom, where I was a shut-in for part of my 5 year isolation. I could move out, closer to where I work, but I'm not getting paid because of the fucking shutdown and my secondary job hunt isn't going well.

The second one is as follows:

&gt;2.Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.

These are my two paragraphs. They will be separated with 1 &amp; 2 to show the two different prompts. 

Prompt #1 Response:

&gt; 1.In the future I would like to be a successful software engineer. The PENCIL Fellowship Programs allows students to create bonds with a variety of corporations. Through these bonds interns have a chance to gain expand their knowledge and at the same time have a chance to make money for their projects and work. If I have a chance to participate in the Pencil Fellowship Program I believe that it will allow me to enlarge my knowledge on many topics as well as create connections and ties with these corporations. In the fast paced world that we live in, connections and ties are a must have essential. Not only do these help you enter college but they assist in landing a job in further fields.  The PENCIL program will place me into job learning environments in which I can gain experience, software engineering requires a lot of experience as it is field highly sought for and many companies search for the best of the best engineers to partake in their projects. Having this experience will teach me how to act in a real job like environment and help me become one of the best interviewee.

Prompt #2 Response:

&gt; Something that has helped shape my identity is being my older brother’s shadow.  My older brother has always done exceptional in school, graduating high school in 11th grade and achieving all the possible scholarships and merits that he could obtain, while  achieving the highest grades in his class. Being the younger brother, I am expected to meet up to his standards.  Having these expectations set upon me, I would like to shine and surpass my older brother in ways that he could not at his time. This motive keeps me in search of new opportunities that are available to me and utilizing all the time and materials I am given. My parents have always tried comparing me to my older brother in many ways and this is one of my other motives, to finally be praised upon. With this drive it has made me do many things that my older brother hadn’t done during his time, such as community service and extracurricular activities. Without this my identity would never be the man I am, instead this has shaped to be better.

I started smoking on a handful of social occasions my senior year of high school. Most of my friends had started smoking, and so I willing tried it. I didn't like it at first... But when I went to college my freshman year, my roommate and I began to smoke heavily. Vaping in our dorm room and smoking in parking garages were stupid, high-risk ways we got high.

At first, smoking was amazing. There were a number of occasions I literally laughed crazily for 15 minutes straight. It made music better. It made food better. It made movies and video games better. I went from smoking on Friday nights, to day baking, and smoking before class. The outcome after 1 year of this was that I had not met many new people after starting smoking, I had got a little out of shape, and had earned mediocre grades.

Looking forward to a fresh start that summer, I hoped to quit smoking. Luck would have it that the roommate I was assigned to at my internship was a frat guy &amp; big smoker. We smoked hard, and, while I let it, it lowered my social ambition, causing me to lose out on some experiences.

Going into the Fall, I had had a great summer. But, I moved in with 2 heavy drug abusers (more than just pot -- like popping ex multiple times a week), and it was awful. Our drug dealer &amp; tons of their random friends were always over (I had become friends with them less and less). After earning a 2.6 GPA, my parents found out I smoked, and I had to move home for a semester.

I stopped smoking for about 6-8 weeks over winter break. It felt great! After a week I felt noticeably more articulate, and my drive to do other things came back after 2 weeks. I can still picture some of the crazy vivid dreams I had... However, I slowly but surely sank back into the pattern of daily smoking. I did, however, stick with my goals and earned a 3.9, exercised more, met people, etc. I convinced myself I could smoke all the time and meet these goals -- but really this was a lie since most of what I accomplished happened in the first few months when I wasn't blazing.

Anyways, over this last summer I interned in WA, where trees are legal. Thus, I smoked heavily -- this whole time I had settled in at about the rate of 1-1.5oz/month, which was running me $250-400 bucks a month. I really began to notice an effect on my job performance -- as I would forget certain key things, or go blank in the middle of a conversation. Given that the internship was at a top tech company, I couldn't afford to be off my game. Overall, the cloudiness in my mind made the internship more stressful than it needed to be.. I took a week long break near the end, but was jolted out of it when I was pressured by a friend to smoke joints at this concert.

Weed has exacerbated some of the problems I face. I have withdrawn from my family &amp; parents. I don't really like college and feel that I am wasting my time. I have gained a bit of weight and really hate the way I look b/c of it. I need to exercise and play soccer more. I can feel myself going down the 2.6 path again (smoking all day, playing LoL, watching TV, not studying, skipping class, etc), and have to turn things around right now. 

I smoked the last of my stash, and one of my best ent pals has also been abstaining for the last 4 days (as he needs to pass a drug test). I want to quit weed this time for good. I duct taped my smoke box &amp; bong up and hid them in the attic, and am now looking forward to life without weed.

For the first time in my life I don't feel in control. I am so afraid I am going to fail, waste my life smoking, and let down my friends and family members. I am ashamed by these flaws that I constantly hide from everyone. I am sick of being a lazy stoner."

I'm 27 and an only child. When I was about 4 years old, my parents and I moved out of our home and into my (dad's mom) grandmother's to help take care of my grandpa who was dying from cancer. 

Eventually my grandpa died. At my grandmother's insistence, my parents and I stayed at her house because she did not want to live there alone. My parents were bad off financially anyway, so it really worked out for my family.

I grew up around this old bitch. She constantly promised me things then never did them. I guess it was my first dose of reality as a little girl. It still sucks to be promised a puppy when you're five years old and it never comes to fruition. Not a ""we'll see"" type thing, but she would actually say ""we'll go down to the shelter on Friday and pick out a dog."" She was always extremely specific in her promises so it made you feel like she would actually follow through. 

I've dealt with her shit my whole life. She would constantly accuse me of stealing things (I never once did and gave her no reason to). She always made me run her errands and do everything aside from wiping her ass for her. 

I got a job after high school and took some time off before going to college. I really jerked around in college but finally got my shit together and got my Bachelor's with honors. This year I'm finishing up a double Master's degree. Every year I've had a 3.5 GPA or higher - I've genuinely worked my ass off in school and in my internships. 

Every time I've tried to move out of the house, my parents begged me to stay. My dad is a high-stress kind of guy and he gets really upset when I tell him I'm leaving. I don't want to cause my wonderful father undue stress. 

They actually need me to stay because my mom works two jobs so she's gone all day and my dad works day-times. My internship is in the morning before he leaves and my classes are in the evening by the time he gets home. Basically, they need someone to stay at home and make sure my 90 year old bitch grandma doesn't set the house on fire (this has almost happened on more than one occasion) or fall down (when she falls she can't get up, then requires two people to lift her because she weighs a million pounds and won't help herself up at all). 

Basically, I'm stuck here. She's a disgusting old bitch. Any time there's a cake, she sticks her finger in it and licks the frosting. Any time someone brings home some food, she takes bites off of it and ruins it for everyone else. She leaves perishables like milk out on the counter instead of the fridge. If I'm cooking something on the stove, she takes a spoon and eats out of it and puts the spoon back in. She constantly leaves messes for everyone else to clean. I have to hide food in my own house if I want it to be uncontaminated. 

She feeds my dog poisonous things no matter how much I ask her not to - I count my lucky stars he hasn't died yet. When she actually does decide to wash her clothes she uses all the detergent. She's constantly telling my boyfriend to do things for her then treats him like complete shit and excludes him from everything.

She's my dad's mom. She only has one other child, my dad's sister. I'm my dad's only child. His sister (let's call her Lora) has three kids. Grandmother basically forced Lora into a marriage for money. Grandmother has always shown preference to Lora and her kids, yet didn't ask them to come live with her when her husband was dying. Any time we do something to slight her that we're completely unaware of, she goes running and crying to them to make us jealous(?). 

Thing is, Lora and her kids are worthless and treat her like shit. None of them have amounted to anything besides having multiple abortions or going to jail. They only call Grandmother when they need money, and she gladly gives it to them. For example, every year we have Thanksgiving at my mom's sister's and invite Grandmother. She decided she didn't want to go anymore, so Lora tells Grandmother that she'll come get her and take her to her house and have Thanksgiving. Doesn't happen. Last year we have Thanksgiving at our house and I cook EVERYTHING, Grandmother decides she doesn't want to come out of her room and sits there and pouts all day after I did all the work and invited Lora's shitstain family. This bitch couldn't turn sunlight into drama. 

I'm financially in a shitty situation. My internship is unpaid and I'm in the last few months of my classes. I owe my school $800 that I don't have, at all. I was going to try to figure something out, try to wedge in some work around my hectic schedule to pay this balance off. I happened to be ranting about it one day (about three weeks ago) when Grandmother heard me ranting. She offered to give me $1,000 to help and for Christmas. I DID NOT ASK HER FOR HELP. She offered. I told her she didn't have to that I would be okay. She insisted that I always come to her when I have a problem and that she'd be so glad to help me.

This really made me happy. I have two sisters on my mom's side of the family (I wasn't raised with them). Sadly, these two sisters haven't done much with their lives and are extremely poor. Between them, they have five kids. Every year I try to make their Christmas a good one since no one else will - their fathers aren't in their lives. One of the children was sexually abused by one of the fathers, the other has had several medical problems. As an educator, I pick out toys and activities that will enrich them and that they'll enjoy, not just silly knickknacks. I love making them happy with books, dough, craft sets, coloring supplies, etc. I was upset that I wouldn't be able to give them such a good Christmas this year because of my situation, but my Grandmother was going to be my ray of sunshine so I could do it this year.

Apparently two days ago while I was gone, she berated my parents about my financial situation. She asked them how much they planned on helping and told them I wasn't her only grandkid. My parents didn't even know about my situation because I didn't want to drop that on them, ugh. 

Today she broke me. She asked me when I needed the money by and how much it was again. I told her I needed it by the first, and that it was $800. She tells me all of the sudden that one of Lora's kids need help too because he's in college. First of all, he gets a free ride to college because his dad was in the military. Second of all, his yearly tuition is $7,000 compared to my $24,000. Third of all, his parents are financially much better off than my parents. Lora's kids have come to her needing bail money that never got repaid, abortion money, house/car payments, furniture money, cell phone money, etc. They CONSTANTLY need money from her. While yes my parents and I live with my grandmother, we don't ask for money at all. We cook, clean, run all her errands, pick up her medication, etc in exchange for a place to live. We're collectively live-in servants that get paid in-place for a home to live in. 

I mean yeah, you could argue need based versus fairness. If she were just trying to be fair that would be fine too, I guess. But the point is, she promised me $1,000 to help me by the first. She backpedaled and said she couldn't do it anymore at all because Lora's kid needs beer money or something. I snapped and just told her I never even asked for her help, that I didn't want it at all.

I don't know what to do in this situation anymore. She's constantly pissing me the fuck off and it's not healthy for me. My boyfriend and another friend have both offered me a place to live. But she also needs basically round-the-clock care and my dad really needs me to stay. 

I'm so stressed out that I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I just want to punch the old bitch in her fat wrinkled face. "
1ph8yi,118,2013-10-29,What do you mean I can't double discount?,rugbygirl24,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ph8yi/what_do_you_mean_i_cant_double_discount/,"**Background:** I work the front desk at a high end hair salon in the USA. Whenever the company hires a new person they put them through a roughly 9 month long paid internship program to get them up to the ""standard of excellence"" expected from each technician. During this time they are referred to as junior stylists/colorist. The juniors are able to take appointments during this time but the prices are about half of what the least expensive full price haircut/color would cost with a full priced technician. The salon operates on a level system, meaning the longer a tech has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level. The salon is also departmentalized so stylists only cut hair and colorist only color.


So seeing a junior for a service is a great deal. You get high quality work done for half or more than half the price of full priced services (most juniors have worked in other salons so they have experience and they are also supervised by a mentor who checks their work before the juniors guest leaves). Also anytime a new guest comes in they receive a thank you packet of coupons for being new to the salon and to give them and incentive to come back. These coupons do not apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted, although it does not expressly state that in the fine print on the coupons, people frequently give us a hard time about this. 


**Story:** When I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally 3 mins before we close (10pm). I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting, get no greeting in return, just a ""yeah, I want to see a junior colorist."" I asked what kind of color service she needed to get done and told her the days the junior worked. That was the first problem, the days the junior worked weren't good for her schedule or someone had already booked an appointment at the time she wanted. 


I'm doing everything I can to make this work somehow but she is getting more and more frustrated with me. She then tells me she wants to book a time 30 mins before close, not a time I offered as available. I calmly try to explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time because it will take 30 mins to apply the color and another 45mins to an hour for it to process. By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried that would be about an hour and half past close and we simply do not book color appointments that way.


This is when she lost her damn mind. She starts yelling at me, saying ""So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close? This is ridiculous! I'm trying to come in and give you my money, I've been on the phone with you for 15 mins (it had been 5 or 6mins max) and you can't seem to work the computer!"" I once again calmly tried to explain that no, we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments in a way that allows for them to end before or right as we are closing. She then proceeds to go on a huge rant about how she'll have to miss her grandsons baseball game and he'll be so upset and blah blah blah. All I'm thinking is I don't care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go home!


She finally gave me her name, I put her down for an appointment that would allow her to leave halfway through her grandsons game and before getting off the phone she says ""oh wait, I have one of those new guest coupons!"" My heart sinks because I know exactly which coupon she's talking about and I was also fairly certain it would not apply to a junior service. The coupon is for $20 off color which would make the $31 service she wanted $11, a service that at its cheapest full price is $60! I tell her that I am pretty sure the coupon would not apply as the junior services are already heavily discounted and she starts to read me the fine print on the coupon in a snarky voice, saying it says nothing about junior technicians. My voice starts to shake as I once again try to explain that I am almost positive the coupon will not apply and she loses it again, this time attacking my personally saying I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with, she can't afford it she can't use the coupon, she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah you suck blah blah. When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning. She tells me one more time how incompetent I am and hangs up.


I called my manager immediately on the verge of tears and still semi shocked at what just happened, I had worked customer service before but never had someone treat me that poorly. My manager is able to calm me down, tells me I didn't do anything wrong, and that I was absolutely right, this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior service. I will never understand why people think it is ok to be so rude to customer service employees. 


**Edit:** Sorry I'm such a noob at this! Hopefully this formatting is better and I tried to cut some of the fat from the story.


**TL;DR** Woman wanted to use coupon on an already heavily discounted service and called me the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with."
1pgr4h,10,2013-10-29,First time home purchase looking for advice on fundamental real estate practices.,returnthebomb1,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1pgr4h/first_time_home_purchase_looking_for_advice_on/,"I'll try to make this short and sweet. First lets take a look at my current financial situation:

-I make 57k a year

-I have 30k in savings

-I have 8k in debt.

-I have little job security at the moment, which makes this tricky.

To elaborate on my last point, I went to a two year college for electronic engineering. While there I landed a pretty sick internship, which after I graduated turned into a full time job in the computer science field. I had to have 3 VP signatures to bypass HRs education requirements for that job since it required a bachlors degree. I would like to purchase my first home, but if I were to be laid off in the next year, which given the companies recent performance is very possible, I will take roughly a 50 percent pay cut going back to my actual field.

My question is what price range is considered fundamentally sound given these circumstances. My parents are pushing me to buy a nicer house which in my area they are considering 100-125k. I may have found a nice starter home for 55k that needs some maintenance including siding, but overall was well taken care of. I dont know whats a better practice. On one hand I would much prefer the nicer home, but on the other that much debt scares the absolute shit out of me.

EDIT: I know there are tools to determine your affordable price range, but I don't trust them. It seems that they overestimate your range a bit.

That's the number of hours I got to spend with her and realized I love her, and it's breaking my heart.

When I was an intern, I saw this girl I have a crush on at school. She graduated one year before I would have, and not really expecting her to be my supervisor for my 486 hours required to pass my on the job training course.

A couple years later, she was the senior web developer and server admin at [office] and she was the one in charge of the OJTs.

I got to know her as the hours went on. We chat and talk at lunch and any downtime. We had the same likes and dislikes, and we got along better than most of her co-workers did with her.

Then it got awkward for me.

She likes to wear dresses to work, and I have a thing for shapely white legs. I would blush when her leg brushes mine when she wants to point out something on my PC. When I accidentally dropped my fork between her toes and I instinctively grabbed it, my right cheek brushing her leg.

I would blush and curse myself when I try to take a peek of her on my monitor or just glance her way. I felt guilty.

But the thing is, as the hours grew on I was not looking at the physical side anymore, but her heart. The way she smiles and complement me when I did a great job. The gratitude she gives whenever I do little things for her. 

Since I'm the only one with a car, I let my coworkers carpool. At the end, it would only be the two of us, talking and chatting.

When I went home, before I get our of the car, I always look the passenger seat and there's an ache in my chest because even though we are very compatible, we will never be with each other.

My 486 hours are up, and we talk and text and message eachother, but she doesn't see me get depressed at the fact that I'm in love with her and it's breaking my heart.

I've been looking around, commenting and such on /r/longdistance for a while and I've decided to post my story here. I live in the Netherlands, and she in Sydney, Australia
My name is Harm.


**Pre-dating**


Let me start at the beginning. When I was 16 I was kind of lonely and I was addicted to a game called FlyFF. I played this a lot and I had so much fun. I was in a guild(a group of players) and after a while I got kicked out which made me sad and mad, I didn't have that much friends at school nor in my town (none actually) so the game was basicly all I had. A few days later I joined another guild and the persons in that guild were really nice to me there was 1 person that was in particular nice and she invited me over to help and borrowed me a lot of expensive stuff right away. After I was done with helping we hanged around on Skype for a while and we had a lot of fun playing http://omgpop.com/ the next day I talked to her more and more and I found out her name was Lin and she lived in Sydney, Australia. 

This all happened somewhere in early September in the end of September I headed to Paris with school and I brought my iPad along to talk to her (we weren't dating at this point) because I was in love with her. During a trip through Paris all I could think about was getting back to the hotel to swing on my iPad and talk to her... 


**Dating**


A few days later, in one of the nights I stayed up till 2AM just to talk to her (duo to the time difference and we were screwing around, and we ended up dating on the 5th of October, 2 days before my birthday. After a while we stopped playing FlyFF because it just sucked and we started playing other games, first S4League then some Left4Dead2 and later /r/leagueoflegends together. 
We skyped for hours and hours, even slept with the headsets on just so we could wake up and hear eachtother, our record was 28 hours and it only ended because Skype disconnected.  
After roughly half a year I decided I really liked her and I really wanted to visit her and I told my parents that I wanted to go to Sydney, So I went to Sydney for 4 weeks. It was the first time I fly, first time I leave Europe and I went alone. 



**The first trip**


I was leaving the Netherlands from Amsterdam to Singapore and then through Adelaide to Sydney. The trip took 34 hours and I was so tired when I landed because I couldn't sleep on the plane. All these thoughts rushed through my head, how tall will she be? Will she be excited? What will she smell like? 

When I landed I rushed through the airport, through the customs and through a black tunnel. At the end were a few desks and a hallway that goes around the corner to the arrival hall. I walked around the corner and I took a quick look through the hall and I saw her jump up and run towards the point where I would exit the hall. I calmly walked through, trying to act cool (and I was tired), and when I saw her I hugged her and I fell a tear rolling down my eyes, I remember the smell of her shampoo and I had this weird feeling, this unreal but familair feeling. *It was amazing!* We walked to the trainstation and I remember hearing her voice and noticing it was different from what I heard on skype we went on the train towards her house. When we arrived I fell down on her bed and she laid next to me as we cuddled for about 2 hours, I was so happy I could finally touch her.

The strangest thing is that everything felt so familiar I knew this girl but yet it was so new and refreshing! This feeling is the best and I LOVE it!

These 4 weeks ended up in a lot of "" firsts "" , the first date, the first movie, the first kiss, the first time on the beach, the first time shopping, the first time McDonalds together. All the things we usually couldn't do. 
Its so strange to do all these things, I mean, watching a movie together without having trouble with the sync or sharing the chips... Its amazing. 
(I wrote a blog about it, It is in Dutch but hey, http://harminaustralie.blogspot.com/ 

After those weeks I had to head back to the Netherlands for an internship. I headed back while it was winter (what they call winter in Sydney) in Sydney and I headed back in September to the Netherlands, which means the Winter in the Netherlands.... This was so depressing. I had an internship for half a year and then a half year school. This was a bad period we missed each other a lot and after months we started fighting an awful lot, I don't really know why but I knew that I couldn't do this much longer. 

After the half year school, and the next half year, starting august 2013 till January 2014 I would have to have another internship and I could do this abroad. I started organizing an internship to Sydney 6 as soon as my internship mentioned earlier ended. I ended up paying an agency to get my internship and I booked my ticket to go to Sydney. I was so happy, I told everyone and I couldn't sleep. I would be able to have my first Christmas, first anniversary together and New years eve in Sydney, TOGETHER!


**The second trip**


I would leave at 8AM and my parents would drop me off at the airport I couldn't sleep... We left at 12AM where I would fly to Paris -&gt; Canton(China) -&gt; Sydney with 24 hours travel time this time and I flew over. 

When I landed in Sydney I knew where to walk where to go and I went through the customs really fast thats when I noticed I had a missed call, she couldn't get a train ticket to the airport because the fares changed since the last time. She was at a station and called me, I told her to calm down, she called her mom to pick her up and drive her to the airport but I waited 10 minutes before she came and picked me up. I was so happy again. I was looking forward to time we are going to have together. 

Later when we were going somewhere we came across the very same station where she called her mom to pick her up. She told me earlier that there was a guy that was comforting her and even offered her to buy a ticket for her because she couldn't afford the ticket. We saw this same guy and he remembered her he told me in an indian accent "" This girl loves you very much! she cry and cry and worry! "" this was so heartwarming, she cared so much about me... I love her

No I am in for 3 months and a bit and I will be heading back on 17 January to the Netherlands. I live with her in her moms house, I work 40 hours a week for free, its an internship... 

I am planning to emigrate to Australia, I love it here! people are awesome and the weather is nice and last but certainly not least /u/Linsky is here :)

Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to write a story. I realise its all over the place but thats just because I wrote this with the emotions I felt/feel. 

Gday from Australia,

Harm."

I just want to share it with someone who gets the struggle, and if no one replies, it still feels better to type it all out. WALL OF TEXT INCOMING:


Im a college junior. After some pretty good success after finding r/Seduction last year, I've been in a rut for the past 6 months…this pussy drought is as dry as the Sahara. To make a long back story short, one of my good friends and old boss needed 2 interns to replace me when I left, and he wanted two cuties. So I found him 2 sorority girls through a mutual friend. He hired one immediately, but the other he did not have the time to train and put it off. I felt bad for her since she quit her old job for this internship, so I offered her another job working under me with my friend, Jake, who owns a small business (I also work with him doing his financials). I know, I know, don't shit where you sleep; however, this was before I was interested in her.


Fast forward to last Friday: I pick her up to meet Jake to discuss how she can help us. Afterwards I invite her to dinner, which I made into a small mini-date. I thought she seemed very interested. Our convos never died, we people-watched and made elaborate stories, the convo turned sexual, and she seemed to get along with me. We even joked she's going to be my intern: cleaning my car, grabbing me coffee, etc. I let her drive my car in steptronic for her first time (great kino) and she even mentioned that she wanted to do some of our shared interests or adventures together and when I'm 21 we are going out drinking. Seemed like she had a good time and dropped hints of interest. I dropped her off afterwards and realized that I was really into her, and assumed she was into me. We were going to meet with Jake again in exactly one week too.


Texted her today to jokingly grab me a coffee and meet up and chat. Turns out she still bought me a coffee to be a good ""intern."" I figured I'd ask her out to do something and turn it into a date. Pretty much what happened after some generic conversation and inside jokes:


Me: ""What's going no this weekend, just napping and netflix like you always do?""

Her: ""haha no, on Saturday I have this sorority thing for 5 hours, it's really long..""

Me: ""Then clear your schedule Friday after meeting with Jake, we are going out.""

Her: *kind of looked down and mumbled* ""you need a fake ID then""
(She just turned 21, i have 4 months to go""

Me: ""Well lets just go do something more fun that doesn't need one""

Her: ""Maybe…""


It got kind of awkward towards the end, but while we were leaving she seemed normal as if nothing happened. She said she'll see me at Jake's this Friday and then left.


So I'm still not really sure what happened…I made some rookie mistakes: responded poorly to the Fake ID shit test, didn't push the idea of the date more, didn't escalate the first time, putting the pussy on a pedestal, going for a girl I now work with, etc, etc, etc. 


Feels good to just get this confusing, awkward situation out. But I don't really know what to do now…act like nothing happened, brush this off and try again but more assertive, or confront her about working with each other if I want to bang her. Oh well, on to the next one! 
I appreciate any advice, insight, or criticism or the read!


TL;DR: Hired a girl and became attracted to her. Decided fuck it, asked her out, got rejected, don't know what to do next.

1pfu19,3,2013-10-28,I've been shafted by my employer.,Hibiki_D,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pfu19/ive_been_shafted_by_my_employer/,"A small backstory:

I have been a devoted employee of a cable access television station for over 6 years. 5 of those years I have been part time mainly just due to the structure of the company. Then, after the departure of my superior, our department was reorganized into having 2 production coordinators and a field producer (20hrs PT) instead of a production manager, a production assistant (me 30hrs PT) and a field producer (10hrs PT). Exactly one year ago I was hired as one of those production coordinators along with the field producer at the time. I had a good offer of $28k with benefits and the potential of adding and additional $2k after 6 months.

I am happily married with my wife of 5 years and we also have a 2 year old son. We've done our best to live life comfortably with what we have. My wife makes considerably more than me working as a sales rep for a cell phone company. It doesn't bother me that she makes more money than I do, and it never has.

The other production coordinator was a great guy to work with. He's about 5 years younger than myself and about a month ago he left work to live with his long time girlfriend and intern at an ad agency. This will become relevant in a moment...

My job as a production coordinator is pretty straightforward. We mainly cover live school and government board meetings in our coverage area, we teach and guide our new and current volunteer producers on how to properly create a show to be aired on our channels, and we also loan out equipment to those same people. We are considered a very vital and respected service in our town.

For the past month or so, my work load has been exceptionally heavier than before. Not only am I doing the work of 2 people but we have also been concerned with finding a new production coordinator which easily takes up half of any work day due to meeting with my executive director to organize interview questions, look over resumes and meet with potential candidates.

We have been in the process of updating our equipment including new work computers for myself and our new production coordinator that will be starting in a couple weeks. I decided some time ago that I wanted to change desks since I've been in the same spot ever since I was first hired and felt like I needed a change of view. I spent the entire day today setting up and downloading software for our new computers as well as cleaning out and organizing necessary items from my old desk. Once I was finished cleaning out mine, I then proceeded to look though my old coworkers desk to see if anything needed to be cleaned. That was when I found his offer letter...

He was hired a week after me for the other position. To be perfectly clear, we both have the exact same job and was hired at almost the exact same time and I have been working here longer than he was. If you recall back to earlier in my post, the salary offered for my position was $28k with the potential of becoming $30k after 6 months. My coworker was offered the exact same position for $31,200 (exactly $15 an hour).

I have been under the impression this whole time that myself and my coworker were going to be equals and share responsibility since the former structure didn't work. I have been happily doing my job for over 6 years. I have always been under the impression that this place was a great place to work. There was never a time where I woke up and went ""Crap, I have to go to work..."" Myself and everyone else get along great and there has never been a hint of hostility.

Do they not have enough faith in my talent? Have I not proven myself to be an excellent employee over the past 6 years? While my wife and I pay bills, keep our son happy and keep a roof over our heads, my coworker has had and extra $3k to spend on a DSLR camera and a monthly subscription to a cloud service for Adobe Creative Suite while living with his parents. I couldn't possibly afford that any point while I was employed without putting a strain on my family's budget. HOW IS THIS FAIR!?

I have never felt so depressed, enraged and betrayed before in my life. This honestly makes me wonder why are they keeping me around since it certainly feels like they aren't appreciating my services. If it looked like I was under performing, why haven't they mentioned that at all to me? Now I honestly doubt I will ever get that extra $2k to help my family.

I just really don't know what to think..."
1pfsr5,4,2013-10-28,"""If we would have met later I mightve proposed, but were too young now"" Post-breakup from (21M) to me (20F) (2 years)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pfsr5/if_we_would_have_met_later_i_mightve_proposed_but/,"pre-TL;DR: This isn't a post asking how to win my ex back. Just venting and maybe wondering what outside perspective thinks.


My boyfriend and I dated for almost 2 years, from my freshman to the start of my junior year. Other than having rough spots during long distance over the summer we were an awesome couple, very loving and always having fun doing the normal college scene of partying plus I got him to do fun things like restaurants and museums. We broke up a month ago. I stupidly tried to do the friend thing, in a thinly veiled from myself attempt that maybe, he would want to get back together with me. Wrong. I'm depressed, suicidal and according to my counselor socially isolated so it was a shit show without him. I rationalized to myself I would rather be friends with him, friends with benefits, then not have him at all.


This hasn't worked. I'm sad all of the time, every time he leaves I just automatically want to say ""I love you"". I still love him. He told me when he broke up with me that he felt like he was too young to be in a relationship with me, that he did not know where his life is going (he is a senior at the university we both go too) and that he is not mature enough to make a decision like this and that he hates the responsibility of making potentially life-changing decisions. Keep in mind I never once said anything about marriage, though we did talk long-term in moving in together after he graduated, but he always seemed on board. 

Until all of his pig-headed newly single roommates moved in. He wanted to live his last year in college in the typical party-style that MTV shoves down idiots throats as ""teh real college XXXperience WWOOW!"" Of course, you can only have a real college experience without a girlfriend, so I was kicked to the curb like a dog. Even though I explained to him that, yes, this may be long term, this may just be a college relationship, why throw away what beautiful thing he had now, he defends his choices by saying he's too immature to decide and then gets annoyed when I say that his reasons are moronic. While dating I never mentioned marriage or any of that bullshit-- the closest I ever got was saying that every girl has a wedding board pinterest, and even adding that that doesn't mean I am ready to get married ANYTIME soon. He admitted to me that he was going through almost a 'mid-life crisis'.


But the whole spiel was ended with a, ""I see you as a long term girl."" He's said that to me multiple times post-breakup. I asked him drunk last weekend and he hit me with the title. The next day he said he was drunk, that he didn't mean it like that, but he's told me a hell of a lot of truths while drunk. It just hurts me so much that he could think that way, that apparently I'm worth a long term relationship, but he's so fucking stupid he CHOOSES to be immature and thinks that it's a valid excuse.


I fucking hate his guts and want to ruin his college career. There's a tiny dead spot in my heart that is telling me to call his internship and tell them to drug test their interns or send his mother a heartfelt letter begging to get their son help and offering them the list of illegal drugs he does. I want him to get run over by a car when he comes back from a bar coked up and drunk. And I love him too. I want him to come to my dorm with a corgi and a heartfelt apology begging for forgiveness.


I know it's not going to happen. I gave myself today to text him. He barely replies anyway, though he said multiple times that he wanted to be friends. But I realized he's shit at being friends anyway, and I don't want him as a friend. I want him as a boyfriend. So I'm not going to text him anymore, I'm not going to contact him. I deleted his facebook, removed his number... it hurts a lot. I feel like I am being punished for something I didn't do. I'm still so confused how someone so loving and sweet could turn such a 180, still say I'm a long term girl, but still refuse to want to be with me. Next to the tiny spiteful spot in my heart is a spot that says maybe if I don't talk to him for a while, he will come crawling back after his liver fails and he realizes his hairline is way too high for his age bracket. But I realize too that if someone prefers to drink themselves comatose every weekend and defend their choices because they're too immature to make decisions, then fuck them.


tl;dr ExBF explains we are not together because he is too immature for a relationship, drops a huge ass bomb on me. i blocked his fb, deleted his cell, I'm not going to contact anymore, I deserve better."
1pfnzw,1,2013-10-28,I feel like my memories are going to haunt me for the rest of my life.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pfnzw/i_feel_like_my_memories_are_going_to_haunt_me_for/,"Background: I started dating a girl last December. She had just gotten out of a four year long relationship and we fell in love extremely quickly. I had never been in a real, serious relationship before and I didn't know what to expect. Everything moved so quickly. By the time May came around we were basically living together. 

I never told her I had a history of depression or anxiety because I was never sure how committed I was to being in a relationship with her long-term. We always worked really well together when we were together but when we were apart things got pretty difficult at times. I'm not pretending we had the greatest relationship but I thought things were going well.

When I graduated in May and moved an hour away for an internship my depression came back and I have never felt anything like it. It started like something I had gone through in the best but it got progressively worse as the summer went on. I knew it was causing my relationship to fail but I couldn't work up the nerve to tell her what I was going through. By the end of the summer, I had only managed to make myself visit her one time and she had spent nearly every weekend coming to visit me. As the summer progressed I fell so far into my routine that I never left my apartment except to go to work or to the gym. I broke up with her on Labor Day because I thought our relationship was too far gone to salvage. I managed to cry when it happened and that's something I haven't done in years. The next day when I woke up was the first time I felt anything for over 3 months and I realized I had made the biggest mistake of my life. I turned down a job to leave the state because I wanted to try to get back with her. She was the only reason I made it through this summer. We talked almost every day for 3 weeks after we broke up when I told her I wanted to get back together with her.

She recounted what I put her through over the summer. How I didn't say I loved her for over a month. How she used to save texts and reread them to make sure they were interesting enough for me to respond back to. How I didn't talk to her for days at a time. All those things she told me are going to haunt me for a long, long time. I confessed to her my depression and she told me that if I had said something a week before or if I had come back the night we broke up, she would have said yes. She told me she wasn't sure and that she kissed one of her friends the night before but she told him she wouldn't be able to date him until she was over me (according to her she didn't enjoy it either). We talked and she said we could get back together and she spent the night. The next day after she had gone home she said that it was a mistake to get back together and she wasn't sure. For the next 2 weeks, we talked every day and went out a couple of times and I thought things were improving. I took her out on a picnic as a surprise and afterward she told me she didn't think she could ever date me again. I told her I couldn't speak with her anymore. 2 days later she texted me and told me she missed me so we started talking again. Again, we talked every day for the next 2 weeks and went out on a couple dates. 

She then called me after she got back from vacation and told me she was over me for real this time. We still talked almost every day since then but a week ago she refused to see me because it ""would be too hard and hurt too much"". We stopped talking and again she texted me to say that she missed talking to me. We talked every day again and she texted me on Friday to tell me that she was sorry about what happened over the summer and that she didn't know what I was going through.

On Sunday, my childhood dog passed away and I talked to her the entire day today. I found out from a friend tonight that she seemed really close to that guy friend she had been talking to since things started getting really bad in July. I called her and asked if she wanted to tell me anything and she said no. So, we started talking about my dog and a little about feelings. She said she thought I was doing okay and I told her that I missed her. She said I'm sorry. I then asked her about her weekend and she talked about it a bit but wouldn't mention who she was with so I asked her about it. She said.. oh I was with ""him"". So I asked her if she had anything to tell me and she said is this what you wanted to know? She forced me to ask her precisely if they were dating or not and she said yes so I told her thanks, that's what I needed to hear.

And now I'm here. I just feel lost. I feel hurt that she wouldn't tell me this without forcing it out of her. I'm disappointed she wouldn't give me a chance to show her that I could be the man she always wanted. I'm not looking for pity. I'm not looking for sympathy. I just needed to say this. I don't have anybody to talk to and I'm not a very good writer. I skipped over some of the details because there was a lot of sad stuff I don't want to think about. I'm just so confused.

I should have seen this coming because it's the exact same thing that happened when we started to date. I don't even have anything bad to say about her really. I knew she had low self esteem. I knew she needed someone to put in effort. I knew she didn't handle her emotions well but I wish I could have been the guy to do that for her.

I'm scared to go to sleep because I've had nightmares of this since we broke up. I'm scared my depression is going to come back worse than before and I don't have her to be my guiding light. I was always so sure she would come home to me.

Sorry for the wall. Thanks for reading. :\"
1pfems,13,2013-10-28,Advice appreciated: weighing financial stability vs. travel/life experience,PooPatrol,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1pfems/advice_appreciated_weighing_financial_stability/,"Hi r/personalfinance!

Quick background: I am 29 years old. 2 1/2 years ago I had about 15k left in student loans and absolutely no money whatsoever. No emergency fund, no credit cards and was doing anything and everything I could to just pay my rent each month. It was tough.  This situation wasn't due to a lack of education or skills, it was due to the loss of my job in the non-profit sector as a result of the economy crashing. 

Fast forward to today. I've transitioned into the tech/startup world and have done well for myself moving from an intern to the operations lead of a great company over two years. I make decent money, have great benefits and if I wanted I could probably move to another company and do even better for myself. Financially things now look like this:

***Salary = 60k*** 

**Assets**

Emergency Fund = $12k

401k = $18k

Roth IRA = $8 k

Car paid in cash = $3k

**Debts** 

Student Loan = $7k left

CC debt (paid in full every month) = $1.2k 

***Net worth = $33k***

***Credit Score = 800+***

So here is my dilemma. I am 29, am in a very serious relationship (with someone who has over $120k in student loans) and really want to spend 6-12 months traveling utilizing a work study visa in AU and NZ before I turn 31 (the cutoff for this type of visa). I feel like now is the time (maybe the last time) ill be able to travel like this as later we will need to really buckle down, pay off her debt (hopefully in a few years with our combined income) and then start thinking about kids/home/etc. Additionally, I've got a chronic health condition that will not get better and later in life I maybe limited in my physical ability to do certain things, will need insurance and an organ transplant. Thats assuming I am able to stay relatively healthy and stress free over the next couple of decades to avoid kicking the bucket early :)

At the same time, I feel like her debt, my current success and the future are also reasons to stay and keep working and maintain as much financial stability as possible. I am afraid that if I leave the current trajectory of my career and have a big gap in my resume that I might not be able to pick up where I left off in my early 30's. I find it very difficult to balance my desire to pursue extended travel with my desire for a stable financial future.  I could pursue my career and I am quite sure be making much more than I am now or I could pursue my life and have my financial security in the future become more of an unknown. I've got a year and a half until I am no longer eligible for the visa, so I could plan accordingly....that said, not having stability freaks me out. 

I guess what im trying to ask is whether there is a way to have both? Has anyone ever had the same experience? Were you able to both live your dreams and be financially stable?
 
Thanks in advance for any input. /r/personalfinance rocks and has seriously gotten me this far. Without this subreddit id be totally lost. 

**TLDR:** I want to travel/work/live abroad for 6-12 month, but am afraid of how this will impact my career, financial stability and job prospects in the future (big gap in my resume)."
1pks3q,72,2013-10-30,"Found out the girl I've been seeing is a prostitute , don't know to do.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1pks3q/found_out_the_girl_ive_been_seeing_is_a/,"I met this girl on the beach in late August. She was all I wanted in a partner, completely beautiful, educated, and determined and just an all around great person to be around.

Certain things about her made me a little weary, she grew up in an awful neighborhood, dated guys in gangs, had a sibling who was high up in a particular gang, and got murdered rather brutally. She seemed to have gotten away from that lifestyle, being one of the few people from her community to finish his school, then she left for college to get away from it all.

To put it simply; I don't know if anyone here is familiar with the term, but she was what they call a ""hoodrat"" when she was younger. 

I mean that's fine, everyone has a past, and as long as you move on from it and better yourself, good for you. I'm not really the type of person to let that get in the way of what could be a good thing.

I noticed that for the past couple of weeks she has been aloof and distant, and has not even wanted to spend a night with me, I tried to talk to her and ask about it but all she would say is she needs space, etc, etc. Fair enough, I could understand that. We got close rather quickly and maybe she was pulling back a but because she got scared.

Yesterday we agreed to meet up for dinner after she got out of her internship. We have a couple of drinks afterward, and when it comes time to part I ask her if she'd like the night, she says yes.

We get to m place, I try to initiate some fun, she denies me and goes to sleep.

I think it's worth noting at this point, that about a month into seeing her, I noticed she had two cellphones. One of them was mostly off all the time, and she said she carried it around because she recently got a new phone and still had a bunch of contacts in the old one... Why not just boot it up and sync your old data to the new one I thought, but whatever.

Anyway I'm not proud of this, and I've never done something like it before, but I went into her purse and looked through that phone. I just had some sort of feeling that something was off.

All kinds of messages from johns, apparently she has ads up on various sites. What in the fucking fuck?

At first I was livid, I wanted to wake her up and throw her out of my apartment. This was like 5 30 am and she had to be up by 7. I managed to compose myself and kind of just sat in a stupor on my couch till she had to leave.

I did not say anything to her; I don't even know what I could say. I think I should just eliminate her from my life entirely and get tested ASAP.

In retrospect, and maybe this is wishful thinking, but maybe she was pulling away in the last few weeks because she felt guilty and wanted to come clean to me? She would always say how much she liked me and loved being around me, but maybe the guilt got the best of her.

What do you guys think is the proper course of action here? I freelance for a living and luckily did not have much to do today, ended up polishing off half a bottle of whiskey so far. Feeling sorry for myself all day. I've had plenty of trysts and flings but this was the first girl I actually felt something real for since I split with my fiancé two years ago.

tl;dr: found out girl I've been seeing, who I liked a lot and wanted to turn into a serious thing is actually a hooker.

I am going through the fall recruiting process as a junior in Portland, and I just got an offer yesterday from Deloitte to be an audit intern over the summer of 2014. Today I also interviewed with Moss Adams in Medford, and think I have a pretty good chance for that as well (I am one of the few if not the only one interviewing for summer, this office mostly does winter).

I'm really leaning toward Deloitte, but I live in Medford which is why I originally was considering Moss Adams. Does anyone have some input on this? Here are a few things I'm trying to weigh out.

-How significant is starting out in the Big 4? Would it likely pan out with a better long term career, or would I have similar prospects with Moss Adams? 

-Does anyone know what the pay would be like? Money is not my only concern, but if I take the Portland internship I would have to pay for rent/food and transportation would be pricier, whereas in my hometown I could live at home. Would Deloitte probably offer significantly more than Moss Adams?

-Related to the above question: I'm doing an office visit at Deloitte this week, would it be inappropriate to ask about $ at that time? 

If anyone has any other things to weigh in about, it would be welcome. 

Thanks!

1pkhaa,3,2013-10-30,"I need to get this off my chest. First sincere commitment to quitting, Day 2",wasteofpaint88,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pkhaa/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_first_sincere/,"I’m a 23 year old female. I have a bachelor’s degree and recently finished the internship program necessary to get certified in my field, which is related to healthcare. I’ve been looking for a job for 2 months with no luck. I only work at a restaurant in the evenings, Friday through Sunday. Naturally, I have a lot of free time on my hands. Even on the days I do work, I get out early enough to partake in the typical weekend festivities anyway.  I’m ashamed of how I spend my time. I sleep 12 hours a day, and I’m basically anhedonic  except when I drink. 

For the past month I started to seriously keep track of my alcohol intake and the results were slightly shocking to me. At least 5 days out of the week I drink, I’d say on average 4 drinks each time. Sometimes I can keep this down to 2 drinks, but those are the days I specifically set out not to drink. Two drinks really don’t bring me the feeling of enjoyment I’d like, and 4 drinks seems to be my “sweet spot” so to speak. But on nights when I tell myself it is okay to get to that level (ie parties), I go way past it to 7-8 drinks. So as it is, I ALWAYS drink more than I intended to.  

I’m normally a very anxious person. Waking up from a morning of drinking, even if I’m “lucky” enough to not have any physical symptoms, I’m filled with a tremendous feeling of dread. Even when (I think) I can recall all the interactions I had, and none of them are that embarrassing, I still feel terribly ashamed. What I’ve realized through self reflection is in my sober life I have a wall up, a barrier that keeps me from expressing my feelings to people. I drink because I like the conversations that can develop in that environment, the heart-to-hearts. When I’m intoxicated I feel I can finally say all the things I’ve been dying to say. But I wake up and feel embarrassed for having said them, because sober me doesn’t feel any benefit of that self-disclosure. Either my friend forgot what we talked about, or now judges me for it. Hell, even if they do remember I still don’t feel any better.

Having moved back home after living away from college, my social circle has dwindled. It consists of two high school friends, and whoever I happen to be dating and their friends. This leads to a lot of nights spent at home, where I live with my parents. Even if the day starts with me telling myself I will have a good day at home alone, by 9 pm I’m itching to make plans to distract me from the anxious thoughts that creep in, the restlessness. I don’t always drink on these nights but at least 1/3 of the time I find myself at the grocery store at 11 pm, buying a bottle of wine and putting it in my purse so my parents don’t see it as I walk in. 

I’ve done tons of stupid stuff when drinking, but not anywhere near the worst. I don’t want it to get to that point. These past few months I’ve been wishing for a job so I can get back to helping people; if I was doing something meaningful with my time I’d save myself from drinking. However, I know if I had a full time job and lived away from my parents I’d be drinking way more than I currently am. 

So that’s it, I didn’t drink yesterday. I am not drinking today. Maybe one day I might, but if I’ve learned anything from lurking this sub intermittently for 1.5 years I’d be doing myself the biggest favor to never drink alcohol again. Made an appointment with my therapist I haven’t seen in a year, but that appointment is over a month away. Counting on you guys and my close friends to support me through this.

1pkb49,0,2013-10-30,My story,throwout1707,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pkb49/my_story/,"Let me start this with a preface, I have summarised most areas to try and shorten it:

Up until I was 17, I was active every day. Football, climbing, running, scuba diving, swimming, scouts, hiking, anything I could do I did. I was an A grade student and had a great circle of friends and was just starting my last years of school. I had never been in trouble and was generally thought of (looking back) of a very promising human being.
I had just started going out with a girl when I turned 17, she was 1.5 years younger and really cute. She lived in the village next to me so we would walk to each others houses after school and hang out, our parents got along well and everything seemed to be great. We were getting a little more serious and emotionally attached, then after 7 months of happiness she turns around and tells me she is ending it. 

Nothing else, all finished in 5 seconds. 

Now you may think, come on, you are 17 and it was just 7 months relationship, get over it. I tried and I couldn't - I was absolutely and irreversibly destroyed. I ended up missing school, got straight E's on the last exam's I took and quit all my activities. Each time I tried climbing I was scared shitless after 5 meters. I didn't go out with my friend's anymore and grew apart from all of them, I stopped eating and at my smallest I was 42kg - pretty low for 177cm. I stayed in my room on the computer the whole time, for almost a year. In short, my confidence had been thrown into the deepest trench of my mind and was not in any hurry to move.

During the time I started at another school and dropped out again after 1 month, I took a desk job for 6 months and then stopped going. After a year I started  another course in IT (as by now I was pretty good with computers) but I had almost 0 motivation and after 2 years I scrapped through with the lowest grade and 1 friend.

I then worked for a year in a woodwork factory doing manual labour to earn some money. None of the people were within 15 years of my age and I talked to about 3 of them the whole time. After that time I saved a lot and flew to a random place on the map which happened to be Italy. I travelled solo for almost 3 months, trying new things, meeting lots of people and visiting new places. I saw the whole of Western Europe and ended up flying home when my money started to diminish. 

Through an old school friend I got an internship when I was back, I didnt like the job but I didn't have much choice. Here I met Kelly. She was so bright, beautiful, smart and kind. I almost instantly fell for her and would talk to her for ages about anything and everything, 2 weeks later we were going out and I was actually full of happiness. After 5 years I was not hating myself everyday, instead I was quick to wake up to see more of her and go outside exploring and experiencing. After 6 months her internship finished and she was going back home to Germany, I talked to my parents and 1.5 months later I too was in Germany living with her and everything was going perfectly.

Which brings me to the present time.

It has been 1.5 years since I moved to Germany. I had one job working from home but then the company went bankrupt and I had to find something new, the first thing that came up was another internship at an ancient, dying website. I am still here 9 months later.

I hate going to 'work', the tasks are dull. No one in the company has any motivation or wants to be there. My colleagues are nice, but I am the only native English speaker and it gets really tiring when they are more interested in finding the correct word, than asking how I am or anything about me. I am smart, and I am not trying to sound arrogant. I was always told at school that I am often bored by assignments and lose focus because it is all too easy.

I am actively searching for jobs, I have a decent CV in regards to experience and skill set. But because I never went to University/obtained a degree, I am certain that they never even properly get seen, people just see no degree and throw it in the trash. After so many bullshit generic emails along the lines of; ""We are sorry to tell you that another candidate has proved a better fit, but with your skills we are sure you will find something soon"" I am totally losing the will to even bother.

I am falling (if not already) back into the abyss I was already in before. I don't want to sleep so I stay up late, then I dont want to get up so I make the alarm snooze for 30mins. I am always tired no matter if 4 hours or 12 hours sleep. I have no energy and no motivation to do anything. 

I am still in the flat with Kelly and she is the only reason that I actually bother to do anything. But I know it is seriously straining our relationship and I don't know how much longer it can last. I often think she is better without me, I am holding her back because I am such a liability. She has a great, well-paid job and wants to see the world, to move to a nicer flat, to go away for weekends while I am barely earning enough to have €50 spare at the end of each month after expenses. I want to do things too, each time I tell her that I cannot, the expression in her eyes kills me, it really hurts deeply to deny something to the person you love.

I don't want to be like this, I want an aim, a purpose, a goal, a dream, something to head towards. I was asked where I see myself in 2 years time at an interview and I made up an answer. In reality, I don't see anything, nothing at all. I try and think of anything I would like to do and I really struggle.

When I walk to the train to and from 'work' I often wonder what I am doing with myself. Is the world and the few people I am connected with better off without me? Should I just disappear and let everyone else get on with their lives, after all what do I have to offer to anyone. But I know it will probably never happen because I don't have the cojones to actually do anything.

I try and change, to be more pro-active and resourceful, to workout and achieve something. I always stop after a few weeks (sometimes I don't even get to 1 week). It has been so long that I actually finished anything that I don't even remember what success feels like. I buy computer games and stop 3/4 of the way through even if I enjoy them. I buy model figures to assemble and paint which I havent touched for a year even though I was doing really nicely. I bought a playstation 1 and some old childhood games and havent played it at all. I cannot face to go back to anything I enjoy without the fear of it hurting me again - even concerning inanimate objects.

I know I am depressed, and I hate myself for failing again. For not being able to keep myself above ground.

I just want to feel driven and motivated. To feel like I am doing something good and that there is a future for me...

I just want someone to share this with. Thank you for reading.

1pk38e,6,2013-10-30,Questions about C'roo and Bonnaroo in general,Teddy_Raptor,bonnaroo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1pk38e/questions_about_croo_and_bonnaroo_in_general/,"Hey /r/bonnaroo! 

First off I will start by saying I have never been to Bonnaroo. I'm am obsessed with live music and the culture that surrounds it and one day hope to fuel that love for others! 

 I am a freshman in college and have never attended a festival before. I have heard nothing but amazing things about them and especially Bonnaroo! I love the outdoors. I love people. I love music. I can think of no better place! The past few years I have not attended for a few reasons, but that's for another story. 

Because of my interest for the entertainment industry and management of festivals or venues, I have been looking into internship opportunities. I read about C'Roo, but have a few questions. They say that you can learn a lot about the industry working behind the scenes

I definitely want to get the festival experience. My worries about C'Roo is that I will be working so much over the weekend that I won't be able to,
especially because they cannot stay in GA (to sleep). I have read of some potential internships but do not know of the likelihood I would receive them, although it would be an incredible opportunity. 

Do any of y'all have advice or past experiences that can help guide me? Thanks in advance! "
1pjz12,0,2013-10-30,"[QUESTION] Can I get some advice about nutrition? Specifically, how to know if you are under-eating",michellexmary,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1pjz12/question_can_i_get_some_advice_about_nutrition/,"First off, yes. I have read the FAQ! :)


I have been lifting weights seriously for about 1.5 months or so. I had started before the summer with the Bodybuilding.com Live Fit program, and had completed 4 weeks of that before basically tanking and hardly doing anything the 3 months of summer (working an internship plus $$ = tired and lots of eating out!). Since being back on campus, I have been good about getting to the gym 5-6 days a week. For about 4/5 weeks I've been loosely following the Live Fit program to get my strength back up and my lifts back to where they used to be. I'm now more strictly following the program (Phase 2, lifting and cardio), including the nutrition. 

My real question I guess, is how do I know if I am eating too little? I always used to assume I overate (obviously, as I have put on quite a few pounds). But now, starting this week I've changed up my eating and starting tracking calories with the Lose it! app. I calculated my BMR and TDEE with the link in the side bar, and with exercising 5-6 days a week and trying to lose weight (20% deficit) I should eat around 2450 calories.  Problem is, what I am now eating with this program is waaaaay below that calories wise. I'm talking, *maybe* 1800. 

**Any advice?** For reference, I am 5'7, female, weigh 246 lbs and am 30 years old. I can give an example of what I am eating if that helps too. This is already too long. 

Thanks for reading - this is my first time submitting but I read this sub regularly... like, every night. :)"
1pjmpa,8,2013-10-30,"Where do I go if I have public accounting experience, but despise auditing? Third-life career crisis.",asletk,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1pjmpa/where_do_i_go_if_i_have_public_accounting/,"Apologies for the upcoming rant/wordvomit...

Experience/credentials: 

* BS in Accounting, MAccy in Financial Accounting
* Two internships; internal audit in industry (retail &amp; consumer) and ""business consulting"" firm
* Two busy seasons in financial auditing (mainly private issuers) &gt; transferred to IT audit &gt; currently in the middle of second busy season in IT auditing (public issuer); Big 4 firm
* Licensed CPA in NJ
* CISA examination passed - waiting out two-year IS auditing experience requirement (three years waived due to financial auditing experience + advanced degree) for licensure
 
I think it's time that I get out of public accounting - the recent few years' worth of PCAOB regulations and subsequent documentation standards, toxic work culture, and lack of personal time outside of work is really starting to wear me down. I may have gone into Big 4 as a Type A, ""do or die"" go-getter, but I'm rapidly spiraling down the road to apathy and lack of motivation. As a whole, I find auditing (internal and external) unfulfilling, with little-to-no value apart from earning the partners a few extra bucks toward their third yacht.

I originally got into accounting because I was halfway decent at it in high school/college, and felt that it was a stable career that would allow me to finance my hobbies/interests. At this point, I &gt;*tolerate*&lt; accounting and could see myself doing it for the rest of my career, although it would be somewhat unsatisfying.

What I'm more interested in, and would be potentially more risky as it's not as ""concrete"" of a career path, is work related to financial systems implementation/project management - basically, a bridge between the end/business users and the IT department in an industry setting. I think it complements my interest in IT/information systems/general geekery better in the long run. However, I'm not entirely sure if my skillset is properly aligned, or where to even start to work towards achieving said skillset. This was one of the main reasons I transferred out of financial audit to IT audit - I thought that the transfer would help me build this potential skillset, but in hindsight have been pretty disappointed. ITGC testing is the pits.

Ultimately, I feel that barring unlikely-but-yet-realistic nervous/emotional breakdowns as my anchor client is easily one of the worst in this group, I'm going to stick out the rest of this busy season and then start looking outside of the firm for opportunities. Perhaps internal audit in an industry role for a year or two, and then segue into a lateral shift into a more technical/appealing role.

Any thoughts/advice?

tl;dr: I hate auditing and want to get out of public accounting quite badly, but don't know what opportunities are out there for me."

03:20 - The guy with the twisted ankle comes back, 6 hours later. He has finally had his head scanned, and has been sitting there for hours waiting for someone to check the result. He’s fine. They put a backslab on the ankle and leave him for the bone doctors. 

03:30 - Man comes in with scalp lacerations. He is extremely confused and abusive, but is it because of the alcohol or because of a brain injury? We aren’t sure, scan him. 

03:40 - Same story. Scan him. 

03:45 – Same fucking story. A woman this time. 

04:20 - I walk out into the pit; “Dooooctor” a man lying in the stretcher moans. I tell him I’m not a doctor. “Man, the pain is too much”. I pick up his notes to see if he has been given any pain relief. I get a tiny splinter of glass through my finger from the broken windshield he went through. My finger is bleeding, not good. I squeeze the glass out and pour alcohol disinfectant over the wound. I ask the senior if it’s ok, is it an HIV risk, and she reassures me its not. I double check he is HIV negative anyway.  

04:50 - The drunks have filled the pit. They all need a special mix of what they call “Rocket Fuel”, and so everyone is working together to get the drips up. My guy is shouting abuse at me as I talk to him. He pisses his pants and laughs at me. I try and get the needle in, but he thrashes around and starts hitting me. I back off, breathe, and come back in for another go. This time he grabs me tries to bite a chunk out of my cheek, only barely missing. I explode. JUST FUCK OFF I yell, and slam him to the bed angrily. The other doctors see I’ve lost it and jump in to help. With two on the legs, two on the arms and one on the chest and head, they eventually get the line in. After it’s all over one of them comes over to me, pats me on the shoulder. “Don’t worry about it man. It happens.” I’m gutted. 

05:00 – 07:00 – I only recall bits and pieces. I remember at one stage just standing there freezing cold, trying to unclog the blood from my zipper so I could zip up my hoodie. I remember a guy who had been pistol whipped, and the end of his nose was hanging off. They told me to sew it back on, but I was saved by the plastic surgeon who thought it was a bit beyond me. I remember trying to sneak a nap in the bereavement room – the place where they tell bad news to the family. They have the nicest couches in there. I got interrupted by a bereaving family. “I’m sorry” I mumble as I stumble out. 

07:00 – End of the night. I’m falling asleep on my feet, but I still need to go and help on the wards. I walk around in a daze, listening to chests, taking blood and filling out forms, checking blood results.  

08:30 – Middle of ward round, one of the interns gets called away. A heavily pregnant lady had gotten 30% burns the night before and had been admitted. Now it sounds like she might be having contractions. “Can you cover for me, just hope that it’s Braxton-Hicks!” Turns out they are, and she ends up delivering a few days later on the ward. [When I left the unit they were still treating her burns.]

11:30 - A little boy of 10 years old is on the ward. He is deaf-mute with no family, just a concerned passerby who brought him here because he had been having seizures on the street. No one has any idea what is wrong, so Trauma take his care over. Over the next few days he gets put through the medical wringer with everything investigation they can do, many of them painful and invasive. He sits there in the corner of the ward, drooling, staring at you as you walk past with nothing behind his eyes. It’s heartbreaking and unsettling. Today it’s a lumbar puncture. We give him some panadol and ketamine, then one of the interns hold him while I put the needle in.

13:00 – I finally walk out the front doors, blinking in the crisp sunlight. Somehow I make it to the shuttle bus, and 30 minutes later I am shaken awake by the driver. “You are home now, you sleep at home, not here” he smiles.

I am in my dietetic internship and the hospital I am working in is letting me wear a CGM through Tuesday morning. The CGM allows me to track my blood glucose levels throughout the day, and I plan on following some LG principles for a few of the days. I'll keep a food log with meals and times and should be able to provide graphs showing how my blood glucose changes during the fast, feed, and during exercise. The study is blind so I won't be able to upload results until after the trial ends on Tuesday. Here's a picture of the sensor. http://i.imgur.com/fvfJGd3.jpg

**Update**

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

&gt; **Workout B from 31minutes guide**
&gt; 
&gt; Had some nasty shoulder pain after the bench press, but overall it was a good workout.

&gt; **Bench Press** 

&gt; * 135lbs 1x12
&gt; *  225lbs 1x8 
&gt; * 205lbs 1x9

&gt; **Incline DB** 
&gt; 
&gt; * 65's 1x8
&gt; * 60's 1x10
&gt; 
&gt; **BB bicep curl**
&gt;  
&gt; * 80lbs 1x10
&gt; 
&gt; * 70lbs 1x12
&gt; 
&gt; **Tricep pulldown** 
&gt; 
&gt; * 130lbs 1x6

&gt; I felt the burn in all the wrong places so I ended the workout and did light theraband shoulder work.

**10/27** Day 2 overall went well packed 200g of carbs into a 15 minute window so I'm interested to see if I have any kind of spike on Tuesday. Had to rely on whey quite a bit today but my body seemed to tolerate it well.

&gt;**Workout A** 
&gt; Shoulder pain continues

&gt;**Deads**

&gt; * 225lbs 1x5
&gt; * 405lbs 1x2
&gt; * 365lbs 1x3
&gt; 
&gt;**OHP** ***DB due to no spotter***

&gt; * 50's 1x10
&gt; * 75's 1x6
&gt; * 70's 1x8

&gt;**Chin Ups at bodyweight**

&gt; * 1x10
&gt; * 1x7

&gt;**Bent Over Row**

&gt; * 135lbs 1x10
&gt; * 185lbs 1x8
&gt; * 165lbs 1X10

&gt;**CG Chins**

&gt; * 1x6 



**Well the data has been compiled and drum roll... My pancreas doesn't wait to make insulin/my liver thinks it is cool if I run a little lean. I have many images with diets overlaid and some with average data. I was slightly hypoglycemic (&lt;70mg/dL) almost nightly which probably has something to do with hormone levels changing during sleep and my large evening meals. Monday was a rest day/low carb day and my blood glucose dropped below 70 on 8 occasions 3-4 of which occurred after my first meal.**

1pi7qy,108,2013-10-29,A student's diary of a 30 hour shift in the ER of a major hospital in a developing country - PART 1,vaime,talesfrommedicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfrommedicine/comments/1pi7qy/a_students_diary_of_a_30_hour_shift_in_the_er_of/,"*This tale from medicine was sent in to our student magazine by a student fresh back from an elective in Africa - upon finding this subreddit I had to share it. It is exactly as recieved, but with any identifying details removed to ensure anonymity of the hospital, the student and the student's university. Enjoy.*

Having been originally sucker-punched into medicine during high school by reading the romantic and adrenaline-laced tales of war doctors, I wanted to get my own taste of trauma during my elective. I chose to go to [a very large hospital in a developing country].

It was mental. As an overseas student, you essentially function as a doctor because of the huge patient load. 
During one of my 30 hour shifts, I tried to chronicle events, the patients I saw and helped resuscitate, as best I could. 

07:00 - I walk through the front doors. The scent of the Pit hits me – old foot sweat, fetid pus and a special ingredient I still haven’t been able to identify. I walk through the resus bay on my way to the doctor’s room, past a young child half inside a morgue bag, still warm from dying of burn injuries. The relatives are grieving around him, while arguing with hospital staff about whether they can harvest the organs. 

07:01 - “There you are, get some gloves on and get this guy stitched up.” He has been stabbed in the face with a broken bottle, big deep cuts across his forehead and face. “You sure?” I ask – pretty sure this guy would be sent straight to Plastic Surgery at home. “Yeah it’s fine, just make sure to stay away from his eye when you do the eyelid, and line up his ear and eyebrow properly.” I grab the suture pack and get to it. The scissors don’t cut, the forceps don’t grab. It’s like knitting with a knife and fork. 

07:45 - 6 year old boy has been hit by a car on his way to school. His left thigh is swollen to the size of a party balloon – he has broken his thigh bone. He comes in gritting his teeth, not a sound. “What a brave little kid” I think as I help cut off his school uniform, to reveal a worn-out Batman costume he was wearing underneath. It’s only when we have to cut that off too that he starts to cry. 

08:20 - A taxi has gone through the wall of a house, killing the girl sleeping inside. The front passenger died on the scene. The driver is comatose. We rush him to the resuscitation room, put a tube down his throat to let him breath. We put a catheter in – he is urinating blood. The FAST scan of his chest and abdomen shows large amounts of free fluid inside. We take him to theatre, but it’s too much, his liver, spleen and kidneys are in pieces. He dies on the table. 

10:00 - I come back to the Pit, and there is a bit of calm. One of the interns tells me that when I was in theatre a lady came in who had mangled her hand in a kitchen sink waste disposal “Mate her hand was hanging onto her wrist by nothing but biltong”. I start to see some non-urgent patients.

10:05 - a chap with headaches after being beaten in the head with an iron pole 3 days before. I ask the important questions, examine him to rule out the serious things, then tell him that a few headaches probably are to be expected, and send him home with pain relief. 

10:30 - A man with a wedding ring trapped on his sausage size swollen digit after being cut on the finger 5 days before. I anaesthetize his finger and slice off the ring with the nifty tool. 

11:00 - A guy with a swollen left eye and a bleeding eyebrow. I ask what happened. “My girlfriend tried to bite off my eyebrow.” The mind boggles. I probe the story further – turns out the same girlfriend bit off his ear in 2009, he had to have a new one reconstructed. Human bites are notoriously filthy, so he needs antibiotics for a while. As I’m cannulating him I tell him that the relationship might not be too healthy and its time to move on. 

11:30 - A lady has spilled acid all over her lap, with deep dry burns across her thighs and buttock, maybe 15-20% total body surface area. Nasty, but not life-threatening. Not much we can do for her until the chemicals wear themselves out – they don’t have any neutralizing stuff here. I send her to the ward. 

12:15 - A middle aged man who has sliced his palm and fingers with a circular saw. I test all his nerves and tendons – his hand is still working fine, it’s just bleeding and a little mangled. I stitch him up carefully, and it looks nice afterwards. He is happy. “I’m glad I got white doctor” he grins. I tell him for the umpteenth time that no, I’m still a student. He is still glowing.
 
13:15 - Lunch. A treasured 15 minutes. 

13:30 – A man comes in after being dragged behind a car by an angry horde after being caught in the act of a crime – #mobjustice. He has degloving injuries to his thighs &amp; buttocks, and his scrotum has been torn away, leaving his testicles completely exposed. 

14:15 - I’m walking to the radiology room to follow up some scan results. I am stopped by a man in the waiting room. “Hey doctor” he calls. Look friend, I’m busy. And I’m not a doctor, sorry. “Quick boss, quick.” Ok fine, what is it? “I’ll trade you gun for your stethoscope.” [Gestures towards butt of gun sticking from his belt.] I hurry away.  

15:30 – The pit is busy. I’m trying to help out seeing the non-urgent cases, and notice the homeless man I noticed a little earlier is still here. He has wet gangrene of both his legs, he stinks, and he is drunk. No-one in general surgery wants anything to do with him. The waiting line is long, there are other patients to see. He eventually gets bored, drops his pants, and starts playing with himself vigorously. STILL no-one bats an eyelid, and he is left there vigorously jacking it for at least half an hour before a nurse decides to step in. 


16:30 - A young man with the first gunshot of the night. The first shot grazed his arm, the second went through his thigh, in-and-out. He is stable and not bleeding much, so we x-ray him. The bullet has smashed his thigh bone apart, he will need surgery. We put him into traction and pass him onto the orthopaedic surgeons. 

17:15 - A 16 year old kid trapped in a house fire. Many people living  here have rudimentary shacks for homes, and rely on open fires for warmth. Winter is just kicking in, which means more and more fires, and more accidents. This poor lad had 60% partial-full thickness burns. As we do the immediate resuscitation, I can hear the senior doctor talking angrily with the Burns Unit over the phone. They won’t take him – 60% is their cut-off. She slams the phone down. “Cover up the burns, keep him warm, and then move on” she sighs. He died later in the evening. 

18:00 - Old guy with a massive inguinal hernia comes in with burns all over his football-sized scrotum. Another open fire. This time the Burns Unit take him. 
 
18:50 – A man stabbed in the temple region a few hours before. He has a sore neck, severe headaches and has lost consciousness a couple of times. This is bad. I can’t feel a fracture in the skull, but he is tender over the c-spine. Neck collar him, and order the brain scan. 

19:40 - A middle aged guy who got kicked in the nuts a couple of weeks ago now comes in with pain and swelling in his scrotum. I can get above it, it’s not a hernia. He gets an ultrasound scan, which shows the testicle has died and is now festering. I call the surgeons and they book him in to cut it out. 

20:40 - I’m eating dinner, and watching the news with some other docs. Nelson Mandela is still sick in hospital, and the whole nation waits - everyone is hoping he hangs in there until his 95th birthday. 

21:15 - A guy who got knocked over by a car, twisting his ankle and hit his head. Can’t remember the incident, remembers waking up to his concerned mates standing over him. Scan the brain. I fill out the forms and go to talk to the radiologist, who sighs, signs, and says “Ok sure we can scan him, but he’s gonna be waiting for a while.”

22:00 - A car hijacking. The three assailants chucked a rock through his window, and then forced opened the door. Guy comes in with stab wounds to his palms from where he tried to defend himself from their knife. He gets yanked out of the car and yelled at while he’s on the ground. He manages to get up and start sprinting away, but they catch him and put the boot in. He has his front teeth kicked in, a sore neck, painful ribs and spine. His ankle is badly swollen. His head is fine and pupils are reactive. My clinical discernment out the window, I just order him a whole bunch of xrays for wherever he is hurting.

22:40 – A guy comes in who has been taken an axe to the face. His parotid gland is handing out, and is squirting arterial blood. “Asher, put some stitches in there quickly to stop the bleeding, I’ll be there soon.” I put one in. That bleeder stops, but it starts up two more; it’s like a Hydra. I eventually give up and get the registrar, he gives it a shot, but no luck. By now he has lost about a litre of blood, and his whole face has swollen up to the size of a grapefruit. “Ok let’s get him to theatre.” We go and quickly write the forms, do the phone calls, and come back. He has gone, just up and left to no-one knows where. He almost certainly died on the streets just outside the hospital.  

23:30: “STAB CHEST, LETS GO”. A man has been stabbed just above his heart, and he is deteriorating fast. Everyone runs in. Get the airway, get intravenous access, take an ABG, put in a catheter. He’s still crashing, his oxygen saturation is going down. His neck veins are distended, his heart sounds are distant, and his blood pressure is in his boots. Unwavering, the consultant steps up, grabs the scalpel and slices open the chest; with what looks to be a hammer and chisel he cracks open the ribs. Blood splashes out all over the doctor’s scrubs as the pressure is released, and there it is; the man’s beating heart is laid open to the air. I’m dumbstruck, it’s unreal. I can see the purple lung pumping up and down on the other side. They start giving him blood but it’s for nothing, there is a hole in the heart and it’s all leaking out. They book him for theatre but it’s academic. I hold the heart between my hands as it beats slower and weaker. He dies. 

00:05: “GUNSHOT CHEST”. It’s a young guy covered in blood, brought in by the paramedics. I drop what I’m doing and run over with the other students and doctors. Looks like it has gone straight through front to back and out through his shoulder blade. The bullet has torn through his right lung, deflating it, but aside from that he is ok. He is struggling to breath so they give him morphine to calm him down, and pump him full of oxygen. “Your first chest drain for the night.”  

00:30: “GUNSHOT CHEST”. Almost a carbon copy of the previous guy, shot front to back through the right lung. Same drill, put in the chest tube. He does well, too. There is a row of stationary bikes on the ward where the guys with chest drains all do their time in the next few days after their injuries, an they usually go home in a a day or two if their injuries are uncomplicated. 

01:20 - The drunk people start rolling in. Young lady was in the back seat during a car accident, and is in serious pain. She is making a big fuss as the paramedics pull her from the stretcher to the bed; obviously stressed out and frustrated at the endless stream of intoxicated people they have seen tonight, they are shouting at her to keep calm and cooperate. She gets put on the bed, and I look at her legs – one of them is shorter than the other and rotated inwards. “Stop pulling her hip, I think it’s dislocated!” I urge. They back off, and wait for the xrays. Sure enough, the hip joint ball has popped out and is buried somewhere in her buttock. “Good spotting” says the doc working with me, and I mentally high-five myself. 

01:45 - A guy in his mid teens has been clocked in the face with a brick. His whole side of the face is mashed, and he is struggling to breathe. They decide to intubate but they are struggling because there is something in the guy’s mouth. After some poking and prodding they realise what is happening – the brick broke the eye socket so badly that the orbit has fallen through the bottom into his oropharynx, and is blocking the doctor’s view of the throat.

I am going to school in Minnesota, but I would be willing and able to relocate to anywhere in the US.  I have found and applied for a few internships, but have not heard back from them, and would rather keep searching than sit and wait.

I have taken classes in computer and network forensics, and used tools such as SIFT, FTK, EnCase, ProDiscover, Nessus, Backtrack / Kali, and Helix.  I have earned the ACE and AME certifications from AccessData, and I am currently on phase 2 of the EnCE.  Next spring, I will be working on my Certified Ethical Hacker Cert.

I would be grateful for any leads anyone can provide for me, as well as any helpful advice for where to look for jobs or what I can do to make myself more appealing to recruiting.  Thanks in advance for the help."

I am in my dietetic internship and the hospital I am working in is letting me wear a CGM through Tuesday morning. The CGM allows me to track my blood glucose levels throughout the day, and I plan on following some LG principles for a few of the days. I'll keep a food log with meals and times and should be able to provide graphs showing how my blood glucose changes during the fast, feed, and during exercise. The study is blind so I won't be able to upload results until after the trial ends on Tuesday. Here's a picture of the sensor. http://i.imgur.com/fvfJGd3.jpg

**Update**

**10/26**
So after 1 day finger sticks have showed a range of 20 points(70-90 mg/dL) so not too exiting, but all testing occurred at least 2 hrs after meals/during the fast. I'm using these tests to calibrate the CGM, so I probably won't do finger sticks when blood glucose might be changing rapidly. Diet was a little weird today due to a family party. Ill go into the details and meal timing once I have the graphs from cgm.

&gt; **Workout B from 31minutes guide**
&gt; 
&gt; Had some nasty shoulder pain after the bench press, but overall it was a good workout.

&gt; I felt the burn in all the wrong places so I ended the workout and did light theraband shoulder work.

**10/27** Day 2 overall went well packed 200g of carbs into a 15 minute window so I'm interested to see if I have any kind of spike on Tuesday. Had to rely on whey quite a bit today but my body seemed to tolerate it well.

**Well the data has been compiled and drum roll... My pancreas doesn't wait to make insulin/my liver thinks it is cool if I run a little lean. I have many images with diets overlaid and some with average data. I was slightly hypoglycemic (&lt;70mg/dL) almost nightly which probably has something to do with hormone levels changing during sleep and my large evening meals. Monday was a rest day/low carb day and my blood glucose dropped below 70 on 8 occasions 3-4 of which occurred after my first meal.**

1pn6eb,12,2013-10-31,"Its my birthday, I don't think I have ever been this down before.",throwawayhalloween24,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pn6eb/its_my_birthday_i_dont_think_i_have_ever_been/,"I dont usually do things like this (posting online) but I am reaching the point of having very few options. 

Almost 6 months ago life was really good. I was about to marry the love of my life, I had a dream job lined up (DSP/Electrical Engineer, I was about to get payed to do something I loved. 

I was really proud of the person I had become. I treated my SO really well. I was there for her, I took her out as much as I could. I cooked all the time (huge hobby), I loved making her food. I was always there for my friends. Even the ones who were only needy. 

My then fiancee had a lot of problems. Her parents and her had a huge split, I was the catalyst (they are racist, hyper-controlling, etc.). She was also molested by her brother, and they didnt really do anything about it. She leaned on my a lot in those times. I was always there. She got emotional almost every day. I knew she could get better though. She just needed someone to believe in her. So I comforted her and never gave up. I loved her. I mean I really loved her. 

We ended up meeting up with her parents and a counselor to talk through things about a month before the wedding. She felt like she needed to. I thought it was a bad idea. I told her, but she was pretty set. So I supported her. I figured there were some pros, she could get better at facing her fears, could come out stronger, etc.

Afterwards, I was so shocked that she thought I did a bad job in the meeting. 

Soon after she broke up with me. I was so shocked. I fought for her with everything I had. Each minute lasted hours, I really just cant describe how long life was. It was a lifetime of horror trying to sleep. I didnt eat. I simply stopped. I am pretty skinny, I lost 20 lbs. That sucked, I could barely climb the stairs. I was athletic before that. I did everything I could to get her back. But she moved really soon after that. Wanted no contact. 

I started working out, got fit. I kept waiting for that job to start. I did my best to push through it. I succeed at almost everything I really try at. I was doing ok. Given the circumstances I was doing great. But I knew I was on thin ice. If that job fell through I would be screwed. But in my mind then, I didnt see that as a possibility. 

Then the impossible happened. They said that they didnt want me. Crushed doesnt even begin to explain. All the feelings I fought off came back. I became loneliness. I became depression. Worst of all I became hopelessness. I didnt even know I was hopeful on a daily basis when things were good. But you know when you become hopeless. It changes everything. 

Now I am stuck. I still see her everywhere. I had the worst dream last night. I dreamt we were happy together. 

I think about suicide every day. Every hour. I dont tell my friends except one. I sorta told my best friend. He lives 4 hrs away. But I knew based on how I brought it up his instinct would be to relate instead of being shocked since he was suicidal once. 

If you are worried, I wont do it. I had an acquaintance who committed suicide. It really hurt me for months. And he was only some guy I played Ultimate with ever fortnight or so. Albeit I did kinda teach him how. So I have no desire to go through with it. I just lust after it, because at least then I wouldnt be in pain. Its kinda tied into the hopelessness part. 

I dont know what to do. I think if I got a job and moved I could solve a lot of these problems. I apply to jobs online, I have probably sent out about 300 applications. No luck. In January I will have been out of work for 1 year and I hear I will ""expire"" because of it. I stress out about it every second Im awake. 

Its odd because I have a great resume (2 yrs of internships, 4.0 in grad school, some research). One weird thing I have noticed, if I was happy I would be optimistic because of this. Thinking I would have a better chance at a job. But now I just think/feel that the universe hates me and confirms that I really am hopeless.

Do you all have any advice? "

1pmotu,7,2013-10-31,Best sativa on Sheep? Your favorite strains (with vendor)?,walfex,SheepMarketplace,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheepMarketplace/comments/1pmotu/best_sativa_on_sheep_your_favorite_strains_with/,"Okay so I have placed orders in the past on SR with NorCalKing and another vendor.  NorCalKing's sour diesel was really nice for me and I'm looking for another bomb strain like that.  I understand OGBryan has some dank weed but his is OG Kush and I'm afraid it will knock me out after a bit.  I placed an order with WeedGirlz last night for their XJ-13 strain because I hear XJ-13 is potent as hell and high in THC.  Also waiting on orders from BudCentral (In transit since 21st) of his NY Sour D and White Widow.

I'm pretty new to weed, just really starting in April, I loved my indicas during summer when I had nothing to do but watch Netflix but now I'm in school with upcoming internship and I need some sativas in my life.  

So I guess I've got a few questions:

1. What are your guys' favorite indica strains? sativa strains? hybrids?
2. What vendors have had your favorites? Which have them now?
3. What grade bud do you usually go for? and at what price is it usually for about an oz?
4. How do you take your meds?
Extra Credit: Post pictures of your meds cause I love weed pics :)

For me my top was Northern Lights for Indica and Sour D for sativa.  I tried some GSC and I didn't like it as much as the Sour D but it was of lower quality so who knows.

I use a vape for my meds in case that helps anyone.  Like I said I am super new to the science and everything of weed but it really does fascinate me.  I tried to search first and didn't really come up with exactly what I was looking for so I thought I would post it up and see what people thought.

Thanks guys and have a great day!"

1pm8qt,5,2013-10-31,"Me [22 M] with my ex [20 F], anxiety attacks when I see her on campus",oneeightydigi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pm8qt/me_22_m_with_my_ex_20_f_anxiety_attacks_when_i/,"Hello. This is my first time posting here. My ex and I dated for five months. She was a truly wonderful woman. Aside from being extremely academically talented(both college seniors despite her age), a gifted mathematician and a programming sorceress, we also shared the same values and interests(punk rock being a major one, both Jewish, both dedicated to hard work). She did what she said she would do, and would be where she said she would be. It was a kind of commitment I had never had before from someone. We went on an adventure to NYC to see my favorite band, and going to shows was one of our favorite things to do. She met my parents and they liked her very much. She is a unique and very special woman. I felt so grateful and honored to be her boyfriend. 



I have a history of depression, and when we first started dating I was in remission, calm, self-assured, and confident. But as time wore on and I was unable to find an internship, I began to relapse. I slept too much, was irritable, and said thoughtless things. Even though she'd overcome some adversity herself, I acted as though she were inherently better than I, and that my problems could not be solved. I was convinced that I'd never be able to afford the tattoo I always wanted and that I wouldn't be successful once I got out of school, things that were simply irrational. She felt unloved and was did not confident enough to communicate that I wasn't being good to her(I don't blame her for this, as we're both very young people). It took me a month or two to realize it, but my relapse was the likely cause of this relationship ending. She had to leave because she didn't want to go back down that terrible road again. I am doing my best to become a healthy, self-actualized person with high self esteem, and I never want to be depressed again. I am seeing therapists, reading self help books on self esteem, doing breathing exercises to stop ruminating, trying to eat and sleep well, and doing my best to graduate from school and find work afterward. I believe I am a good person, very attractive, passionate, loyal, sincere, and that I deserve to be loved and feel happy. 



I believe that I completely fell in love with this woman. Not the idea of her, not the idea of being in a relationship, but her. However, my mental illness made a healthy relationship improbable. Despite the fact that she is in another relationship right now(and she should be, and I'm happy for her), I still have feelings for her, and I have anxiety attacks when I see her walking the other way down the street. She's very triggering to me, but because we are in the same program, I will continue to see her several times a week until we graduate. Therefore, I have to talk to her and try to normalize things so that I don't panic when I see her. It's destroying my ability to cope with my problems and make progress. I want to be friendly acquaintances and nod or wave to her when I see her somewhere, although I'm very scared of not being forgiven. Maybe one day, when I'm a healthier person(and I WILL be a healthier person), I'd like to come back into her life again. I acknowledge the fact that this may or may never happen.



My questions are: 
1) Do you have any advice as to how I can explain myself, and ask for some kind of reconciliation?
2) Is there any way to stop feeling such pain and anxiety when I see her casually walking around? My breathing exercises only work to a point, and while I'm working on this at therapy, I'd like to hear your advice.
3) Have you ever lost someone you really loved or were a great match for just because of one or the other's mental health problems? How can I feel better about it? 


---

**tl;dr**: I met a wonderful woman who I was an excellent match for. My mental health got in the way, and now I'd like to reconcile so that seeing her on campus does not interfere with my progress. I also struggle with the idea that I could have prevented this, although I forgive myself for what I did and didn't do. I really need to feel better about things."
1plgzx,5,2013-10-31,Breaking up long distance with my 23[m] boyfriend; am I [21m] doing it right?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1plgzx/breaking_up_long_distance_with_my_23m_boyfriend/,"So I broke up with him after months of churning it over in my head. A part of me can see us together in the future, whereas a part of me had a few minor, but recurring doubts about our relationship. We have nothing in common, he isn't as thoughtful as I like sometimes, and our sex life is sometimes a little one-sided. Other than that, he is kind, affectionate, handsome, and wonderful to be around. He sees me as a life partner, whereas in my internship in another city I must admit that I was finding myself looking at other men. 

The part of me that wasn't sure wasn't willing to wait another year to find out if he was right for me - without even seeing him - and so I have ended it.

Understandably, he is confused and upset, because to him this appeared completely out of the blue. I told him that the distance had made me doubt my feelings for him, and that I am very confused (because I am) and need some time to think about this. 

I've asked him to give me some space, but he is messaging me every day asking to Skype and he is looking to me for comfort in the break up. He says that he just wants to see my face, and it makes me very upset that I am hurting him in this way. How do I communicate to him that I want a clean break without hurting him?

A further complication is that we're going to see one another at Christmas. It may be possible that my feelings have simply been waning due to 6 months distance and shoddy communication - there is a chance that we'll get back together when I return...but then I have to leave again for another 6 months. 

Should I cut off all ties now, and forget about that possibility because it would put him through even more emotional anguish if it didn't work out?

Thank you for your time,
your sincerely,
a very stressed man

**tl;dr**: Long distance relationship ended because of distance/poor communication and lack of confidence in feelings on my behalf. He isn't taking it well and still wants to speak to me daily. We're seeing one another at Christmas. How do I end this in a dignified way, without hurting him too much?"

when I got to know my current gf about 2 years ago, she was a happy and funny girl, with a pretty good self confidence. We had a lot of fun together and the sex was really good. 

But now the situation is quite the opposite. She isn't that confident anymore, and the sex became totaly boring and we don't have as often sex as we used to have in the beginning. Not even close to that amount. 

I am a guy who needs his free time. Where I am alone and can enjoy being alone, I mostly play some video games, or read a book then. While my gf would be all the time around me if she just could do it. Happily, we are both studying at the moment, but in the little free time I have, I have to study... I am also now in an internship, where we can only see us every second Weekend. She is pretty sad about that, but I am surprisingly happy with that. We skype nearly every day and are chatting the rest of the day. It's okay for me, but not at all for her.

The worst thing about our relationship is, that she gets pissed pretty easy. Really, really easy. At first we fool around together, then I say something against her (while the fooling before was just against me)
and she is pissed. Totally. (Just an example, there are so lot more scenarios where she got pissed and I didn't even know why...)

When she is pissed, I cant argue with her. I can't talk with her. I don't even know if she is listening to me. She is totally blocking. Worst of all: In every argument it's my fault. No matter what. It doesn't matter if it was nobodys fault or even hers! No, I am always guilty that she is just feeling bad and that we have a conflict now. 

On top of that, when we go out with some friends, she thinks she can do whatever she wants. She hates when I talk to another girl for more than 5 minutes (super jealous!). But its okay for her to talk to other guys for hours, even touching their sixpacks (I don't have a sixpack, but she likes it) in front of my eyes. If I am pissed then, it is... yeah you are right: my fault. I didn't get her points at that evening, but it was totally my fault...

You know there are not always these bad moments. We still have fun together, and i like to be around her. But when we have a dispute again I just don't know what to do... At these exact moments I'm always saying myself: ""Just breakup with her, and this ends now and forever!"". 

Somehow I can't breakup with her. And I don't know why exactly. If I think about it, I always imagine her, crying, and feeling really bad. And this makes me sad. So I always ask myself: Am I still in love with her? Or do I just don't want her to be in that hell of a situation? We are also planning a trip together with some friends, I don't know if I just don't want to make it comlicated for everyone who is involved.

I'm totally aware of the fact that I won't get an answer here. But maybe some of you were in a similar situation and maybe you have some advices for me then. At least I wrote this down to maybe feel a bit better now.

At least I want to say sorry for my english. I hope you get my points, but feel free to ask if something isn't clear. Thank you for reading through my boring problem. 
---

**tl;dr**: She wants to be always with me, while I need some free time. She gets pissed really, really easy. And I totally can't argue with her, due to her blocking any communication making me guilty for everything. There are good times though. I don't know if I still love her, or if I just don't want to breakup with her, because it would break her heart. 

(Was this tldr too long?)"
