I'm a college student in a state where there aren't many gun laws (Yet....). I was recently offered an internship in Newport Beach, southern California for the summer. The experience I would gain from this internship would be great for my career and the pay is awesome. One of my biggest concerns right now is the gun laws in California. Is it illegal for me to take my guns to California for the summer? I plan on taking my Remington 11-87 and AR15. I also have several standard capacity magazines that I would be brining for my AR. Are there any laws that forbid me from taking my guns into the state? I have been doing research but haven't found much.

Any help or advice you guys can offer will be greatly appreciated!

I was at a community college at that time, so it was ok. I am currently a senior at a 4-year school living away from home and about to graduate in May. My moms always said things to make me feel guilty such as telling me to come home more often. I'd like to catch up on homework some weekends, and visit my boyfriend who goes to school 2 hours away sometimes. 

Well the time has come where I'm going to go to graduate school in September and want to move in with my boyfriend. I know she will not be happy about this because she's asked me to apply to a graduate school closer to home and she's even mentioned that as a teacher I will not be earning a lot of money so I should move back home. This kills me because I just feel so bad that I'm growing up and I don't know how to deal with a mother that will be so disappointed that her daughter will possibly be moving out. 

What's also annoying is that I have a sister who is a year younger. She never visits home (""because her back hurts when she drives"" and she ""has too much homework""). My sister is applying to internships for the summer and if she gets one, will be allowed to move out.

I'm seriously stuck in a hole where I don't know what to do. I want to make my mom happy, but I can't keep being her little girl anymore."
19gveh,24,2013-03-01,Life changing career descision,Pooryid,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/19gveh/life_changing_career_descision/,"I have recently come across a life changing career opportunity and have no idea which route to take. Currently, I am a 23 years old and have recently graduated with an accounting degree. I work for McGladrey in their tax services for two months now and I hate it. I’ve done an internship at KPMG last year in their international tax department and it was a bit more interesting.  I’ve also done 3 other accounting internships for various companies. 

The opportunity I have in front of me is through my first accounting job. I worked for this guy who owned a business selling computer and electronic related hardware online. They now selling pretty much everything and have grown from a $4 million dollars in revenue a year company when I left 3 years ago to a $24 million dollar company. I left that company because I needed to focus on school and also get different experience within accounting. 

Now the McGladrey position is a good job. It has good salary, good benefits, it’s safe, and there is growth. But my god, it is boring and not something I have passion for at all. I met with my old boss from the old company and he wants me back. Essentially, he wants to bring me up to a position that acts like a CFO. He never had a great accounting system going on. When he hired me, I was his first accountant and I set up quickbooks for him. Now he wants me back and have me take on roles that oversee the finances, accounting, and investments of the firm. This is something I’ve always wanted to do and is a great opportunity. The salary will be paying more than my current job after the first 90 days and the potential to make a lot more quickly along possible with equity in the firm. The biggest benefit and what I want most out of a job is to take ownership of my work and be part of something where I can help make it grow. I want that passion where I can wake up every morning with a purpose and I feel like this new career will take me to that place. 

The problem is that I have is that if I do make this switch, I can’t go back to McGladrey or the big corporate world. No one will want to see that I’ve only worked for McGladrey for two months on my resume and then see some company no one has heard of. Few will hire me and hire me to a position and salary I deserve. This new company though isn’t some 5 year job or 10 year job, it is a lifelong commitment that I will be part of and benefit from. I am friends with the owner and have known him for 5 years. In addition, I am not that experienced. I may have had two tax jobs and some other accounting internships but I will make a lot of mistakes. My old boss knows this and says he will bring me up to be where I need to be because he sees potential in me.

What do you think Reddit? Should I stick with McGladrey through this storm or should I make that life-changing and risky career decision that can leader to a happier life and potentially more $$?

19fy28,2,2013-02-28,Child of drug addicts trying to become whole. ,zefside_inc,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19fy28/child_of_drug_addicts_trying_to_become_whole/,"There are many things I would like to get off of my chest. 

Growing up is an extremely beautiful and deeply painful thing to experience. When I was a kid, I thought growing up meant having your own car, no one to tell you what to do, you know.... But as a 22 year old female, the aforementioned barely scratches the surface of what it feels like to be grown. 

Being grown means that my grandmother who saved me from my drug addict parents when I was 12 and raised me is getting older and not getting any healthier. She could die any day and I never see her. I always say I don't have time... but I do. I spend a lot of time doing things that add no value to my life (facebook, tv, etc.) but I can't seem to break away and go see her. She sacrificed so much for me... I was her first grandchild and the first girl she raised (she had 3 sons). Living with my grandma after being in a horrible home for the first 12 years of my life were rough. My grandma and I never saw eye to eye. I broke her trust when I was 13 and it devastated me. Finally, I earned it back. She paid for me to be in marching band in high school... those were the best times of my life. She always made sure I had everything I needed. She was a single mom for most of her life and didn't have much... still doesn't... But she gave to me what she could. I wish I could of had a closer relationship with her when I lived in her house. I moved out shortly after my 21st birthday. I think of her often and wonder how she is doing. I only live 20 minutes from her but I only see her once or twice a month. She is always so happy to see me and she always beams and glows when I tell her about my accomplishments. I've come pretty damn far from a drug addicts daughter. I'm the first person to go to college (will graduate in may '13), I have an internship at a company that will possibly lead to full time after graduation. I've done so much for myself and she is so proud. She always brags on me to others. I love her so much and am scared that she will die without me taking the time to really tell her how I feel. I can't tell her how I feel... can't tell her how much I love her, how incredibly thankful I am for her sacrifices, how much I admire her and how much I miss her. I can't tell her cause I can't bear to see her cry... even if it is tears of happiness. I would break down and cry. I shouldn't be scared. I will tell her. I have to tell her so that when she dies, she will know how I truly feel about her. But when she is gone, who will I have to go visit on the weekends? Who can I tell my hopes and dreams to? Who will beam when I tell them how great I've been doing? It surely can't be my drug addict parents. 

My parents did meth for most of my childhood and teen years. They stopped it a few years ago but are now addicted to methodone and xanax. They try so hard to be good parents. They tell me (when they're sober) that they are sorry for the past. They know what they've done wrong. They want to be good parents to my younger brother and sister who still live with them. Some days they are good and we make dinner together and create good memories. Later that same week, they take too many pills and act like the most annoying and sad drunk person you've met. I don't feel like they are my parents. They are strangers... my siblings are strangers, too. My brother and sister have taken the same sad path as my parents. my little brother dabbles in marijuana and my little sister goes from man to man, trying to be loved. It's all too sad to take. Who are these people? Why are they in my life? I want to help them and have been trying. I used to be mad and angry and blame all my problems on them. I'm not angry anymore. I love them and forgive them for everything theyve done. They aren't bad people. Theyve made bad choices and sadly had children too young. They were sad, broken people before kids, and they raised sad, broken children. 

How do you become a whole person when you had a partial, misguided, and horrible childhood? How do you create, build, maintain interpersonal relationships when you are the child of an addict? You're expected to be normal like everyone else. But how? No one taught you how to love in a romantic way. no one instilled values or morals in you. You are half a person trying to become whole with very little direction. And by you I mean me. 

Some days it's way too hard to take. Others I think I'll be fine. Some days, I have wanted to die. Some day, I thought I could change the world. Today, I am somewhere in between. 

There is so much more I want to say, but I've ran out of energy for the night. Thank you for being here and listening to what I have to say.

19jqdk,5,2013-03-02,"Relationship - career goals, age difference?",Phoencopterus,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/19jqdk/relationship_career_goals_age_difference/,"Hey TwoX,

First post on this sub, and I hope it's okay to post a question about my relationship. I'd really appreciate some perspective from you ladies because I'm having a bit of a ""gender role"" / woman-in-hardcore-career issue and I feel like you guys always give great advice about that sort of thing.

Boyfriend and I have been together for two years. A year ago and got a job across the country so we've been long distance since then. The plan was that I would finish my degree this May and try to get a job in his city. He's an incredible man and we're planning on a future together, and just so there's no misunderstanding, he absolutely wants me to do what is right for me, not just move to his city because it's easy for him.

In any case, I'm a bit unsure about what I want right now. Turns out I don't like his city and really don't want to live there. I've been working at an internship at a great company in my area, and I'd want to stay if they offered me a full time job. I'm also starting to entertain the possibility of grad school, and I'd want to go to a top-notch school, so I'd have to move. I'm itching to travel, maybe live in a different area, just be open to all the possibilities that are available to me at this age (22).

The thing is, I'm conflicted because of my relationship. I feel like I can't pursue all the things I want to do because I don't know how we would work it out. Take the job here instead of moving to his area? That's another year long distance until he can move back here (which he is willing to do). Want to go to really good grad school? There's a few more years long distance, unless he wants to abandon his career to up-and-move with me for a few years. I don't feel like I can explore all the job opportunities available to me because it wouldn't be just me moving to some weird area of the country, Boyfriend would need to find a good job there too.

Boyfriend is 100% supportive of me looking at any possibility I want. He doesn't want to limit me to choosing jobs and grad schools in His City or My City. But at the same time, I don't want to be in a long distance relationship forever while he and I pursue different things... we'll have to live in the same place eventually, and to do that, we'll need to compromise.

I am afraid that being in this relationship will make it harder for me to achieve my education and career goals, and that I'll compromise and regret it later. Not because he wants me to compromise, but because I'll just have to make decisions with another person instead of by myself. He's 30 and he's already got a good idea of what he wants. He doesn't have the same financial freedom I do to move all around the country and try new things with me. He's got an established career, so he's more tied down than I am.

I love him, but I don't want to be the girl who lets his career dictate our life together just because he's older and more established. I've worked just as hard as he has, I should have the same right to choose a career in a new city or an awesome grad school in a new place... but at the same time, when does this become so much that it's not worth it? It feels like our paths will just diverge and we'll never be able to live in the same place and not have one of us compromise on our career or education or whatever.

I think part of it is the age difference - he's 8 years older so he's a little more in touch with what he wants out of life. I'm only 22 and I still want to look at a bunch of different things. But I don't know how to balance this relationship and my desire to figure out what I want as an independent woman?

Not sure if this made sense, but I'd really appreciate any advice you guys have to offer about balancing a career with a relationship or dating with a decent sized age gap.

TL;DR - I'm 22 and wanting to look at all my opportunities for a career and grad school. I'm afraid I'll limit myself to make my relationship with my 30 year old boyfriend work. Help?

Thanks everyone!"
19irqn,11,2013-03-02,I think I might be depressed...Input? (LOOOONG READ - THIS IS A HARDCORE VENT),Throwaway2823916,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/19irqn/i_think_i_might_be_depressedinput_loooong_read/,"OK, so as the title said, I'm kind of trying to figure out whether or not how I feel is normal or if I should be seeking some kind of help. It'd be great if people who actually know about depression (either from being diagnosed with it or just having some kind of experience with it) could give me some input as to whether or not I might need to do something about this. Anyway, here's the situation, arranged by general topic:

I wish I was dead, or better yet, had never been born. I have felt this way for a while - the first time I can really remember feeling this way was around the beginning of high school. I mean, sometimes on a nice sunny day when I'm in a reasonably good mood, I'll think to myself ""I'm actually kind of glad that I'm alive today,"" but the feeling passes before long. The only time in the past several years that I can remember being truly happy was when I was with my then-girlfriend, but I'm pretty sure that was mostly because of the hormonal rush. Anyway, this mentality kind of shows up in some of the things I say - I often joke about death and don't take it very seriously. Not because I don't find the idea of dying to be intimidating, but because I view it as a respite. I feel like life is kind of a dumb game that I got forced to play and really don't see the point of. From how other people talk about and treat death, I gather that this is not a normal way of viewing things. Now, before going on, I should clarify that I am not suicidal, because suicide is against my beliefs and frankly I'm not sure I could ""pull the trigger"" even if I decided to. I have never attempted suicide, and I don't plan on it, although I have thought about it before (not thought about it as in considered doing it, but more like fantasized about it...if that makes sense).

I'm a 20-year-old male in college, and I just don't feel like the future looks promising. I'm a pretty smart guy (that's really the only big asset I have, honestly, because I'm not outgoing or athletic or handsome or even a particularly pleasant person to be around once you know me). I make great grades in school, but I have no idea what to do with my life. I don't know what I want to do for a career, and I'm getting to the point where I can't afford to be indecisive anymore. I feel like I could get somewhere if I could just get pointed in the right direction, but right now, I'm just treading water in a dull and fairly-common major that I have no passion for but at the very least has some decent job utility. I'm thinking of going to law school after I graduate (almost everyone I know swears I'd be a great lawyer), but I don't know if I'll be able to afford it or even if it's a good idea.

I haven't had any jobs yet, ever, and that's causing problems in multiple areas. First off, my parents have obviously been trying to get me to get a job for the past few summers. At first I just didn't want to and that was kind of OK because I was still young enough that it wasn't a huge issue and I didn't really need the money (my college costs are covered mostly by scholarship and the rest is paid by my family - my parents make a decent income and they view it as their responsibility to pay for the education of their children - and yes, I do realize how lucky I am to have parents that do that for me). But obviously, a 20 year old who's never been employed is not attractive on paper, so every passing year I become less employable. Add this to my social awkwardness, and you've got a recipe for unemployment. I couldn't get a summer job the past summer, and now my mother has told me that I am not allowed home this summer until I've gotten a job (a fair move on her part - I don't resent it). The problem is that I go to school out of state, so I can't really get a job at home without actually being there to get it. So I'm kind of freaking out about the fact that I may very well be homeless this summer if I don't work something out. Maybe it'd be good for me, who knows. Anyway, there's the pressure from home about the job. But there's also the pressure of my finances. I have had enough money saved up to cover random college costs (going out with my friends for pizza or whatever) up until now, but that's starting to run out. Then, there's the pressure of my own self-esteem. For quite a while, I didn't really understand when people talked about how a man's occupation is really a big deal for his self esteem. Now I do. Being a jobless parent-leech has had a much bigger impact on my self-esteem than I ever could have guessed. So I feel like shit for that. My university has a great employment network (internships and the like) that I could really use to my advantage, but since I don't actually know where I'm trying to go with a career, internships are kind of pointless until I figure out what the fuck I'm doing.

Oh, and while we're on the topic of jobs: in addition to feeling very pessimistic about my chances of being able to land a job in the first place, I also feel really pessimistic about my ability to perform well in whatever job I get. I mean, I'm academically-smart, but in the ""real world,"" I'm an idiot. I have no common sense at all. I feel like if I did get a job, I'd just make so many stupid mistakes and be so worthless as a thinking employee that I'd be fired. Basically, I don't consider myself a ""skilled"" or ""competent"" person. Also, I don't do well under pressure, so any kind of job with high risk for messing up is just a recipe for disaster as I'd panic from the risk, mess up, and the world would explode.

Moving on: girlfriend. As I said, I've had one serious relationship so far in my life. It was a 2-year-long, long-distance relationship, and during that relationship, I learned a ton about myself. The biggest thing that I learned was that I am a shitty boyfriend. I was absurdly controlling, over-protective, and paranoid. I suspect that the distance gap had something to do with that, and I know that my own insecurity had a huge role in it. I'm not trying to make excuses - I hold myself responsible for my actions, but I'm pretty sure that I would have been a lot better if I genuinely believed I was worth her love. Anyway, that relationship eventually ended in a mutual breakup, although after we broke up things went a bit south (but that's not too relevant so I'm not going into it). I know that in many ways I was a really awesome boyfriend, but like I said, I was insanely controlling and protective, and my strengths in other areas really don't compensate for that. So I don't feel very confident in my partner value. This feeling is compounded by my lack of job (as described previously) and my lack of any real plan for the future. The thing is, I really want someone to go through life with, but I really don't feel it'd be fair of me to get involved with someone in my current state. Like, emotionally, I really want a relationship, but mentally, I don't. I don't have the money to get into that right now, and I just don't feel like I have my act together enough as a person. Once I have a job and some form of career plan and have worked through my own personal flaws (some form of mental/emotional issue being among them, I suspect), then I'll seek out a relationship, but until then, no. The problem is that I don't see myself getting to the point as a person where I feel ready for a relationship any time soon, and that makes me really sad. I mean, especially in college, I see everyone around me being happy with their SOs, and it breaks my heart knowing I can't have that. I genuinely believe I could get a girlfriend if I tried, but again, I just don't think it'd be right to get involved with a girl knowing that I'm not even close to being to the point where I would be ready for a serious, long-term relationship. But that lack of girlfriend is just another straw on the camel's back, and that camel is starting to look mighty strained.

Friends: I would say I have 4 friends here at school (many more at home, but that's not that meaningful since I'm away from them 3/4 of the year with a big enough distance gap that I can't visit). We spend a lot of time together and I'm thankful to have them. My freshman year, I literally sat in my room by myself almost all day every day - even my roommate, who I get along reasonably well with, was gone most of the time, and that was possibly the most miserable year of my life. I'm not someone that likes to have a lot of friends (I prefer a few close friends to a lot), but having literally no friends that year was absolute hell. The problem with my friends, though, is that they are kind of assholes. We're all kind of assholes to each other (that's just how it is with a group of guys), but I feel like this goes a bit beyond the norm. Any time someone in the group says something that is even slightly wrong or against the opinion of the rest, a piranha-like frenzy occurs and they are verbally beaten down to a pulp. This happens to everyone in the group, not just me. Basically, we're very unforgiving of any kind of stupidity or wrong-ness (we're all pretty smart guys). Now, that's all reasonably forgivable, because we all do it to each other and it's never really taken too personally. But the thing is, the older brother of the friend I hang out with the most (who also goes to our university and is therefore around a lot) is a MAJOR asshole. Literally 90% of everything I say, he will either directly mock or argue about. Him and my friend are very close, so whenever I disagree with either of them, the other will immediately jump in. So while my friend is fun to be around when his brother isn't there, they both become an asshole tag-team when they're together. And this is only with me - they rarely pick on anyone else, which is why with this guy (the older brother who mocks me at every chance and is then joined by his brother, my friend), I take it personally. Now, I assume the reasonable thing to say here is ""I should just find new friends that don't treat me like shit."" The thing is, I'm a pretty shy guy. I don't make friends easily, so the last thing I want to do is ditch these guys and end up back where I started with no friends at all.

I don't really have any hobbies to speak of, aside from reddit (duh) and a few online games. While this isn't directly a bad thing (I'm never bored), it does make me kind of a dull person.

Finally, I have a variety of fun character flaws that I don't like about myself. I'm very whiny (the irony of saying that in a post on /r/depression is not lost on me), I'm lazy, I have a hard time motivating myself to do anything, I occasionally get really arrogant about my intelligence (I think this is me latching onto the one trait I like about myself because that's all I've got), and I seem to have an addictive personality. Currently, the only thing I'd say I'm addicted to is porn, but that's a really big deal to me. I feel like shit because of it. It's against my beliefs and I just feel like dirt when I look at it. I also consider it another detriment to my value as a spouse/partner. Note that I'm not trying to make anyone else feel judged or whatever - your actions are your business - but it does make a difference in how I view myself. If nothing else, I don't like that I don't have the strength to overcome my addiction.

I guess that basically sums up all the shit that weighs me down. So the point of all this is that I just feel absolutely miserable. About myself, about my future, about life itself. Some of these issues are more recent, obviously, but the general unhappiness has been around for a while. I walk around with a frown on my face all the time, not even intentionally but just because my face seems to have adopted that as its default position. On occasion, I've had people walk up randomly and ask me what was wrong because they thought I looked upset when nothing was out of the ordinary. Like I said at the beginning, I'm just not happy to be here (or anywhere). So my question to everyone who's somehow made it through that monstrosity of a post is this: am I just going through growing pains? Is this a normal way to feel at my age? Or do I need to think about seeking some kind of help? I was laying in bed crying the other night and I realized (not sure why it took so long for this to occur to me) that I may actually have some kind of emotional problem that needs to be addressed...after all, I'm pretty sure everyone around me doesn't feel this way. If they do, they're doing a damn good job of hiding it. Anyway, sorry for the seriously insane post you just read (or maybe skimmed - I don't blame you). Thanks so much for taking the time to read it, and I really appreciate any input you guys have.

**TL;DR: I wish I was dead. Am I depressed?** Seriously though, since the point of this post is that I'm asking if my thoughts/attitude are somewhat normal because I might need to get help if they aren't, please don't try to give any advice if you won't at least skim through and read what's going on. I more than understand if you don't want to read it all, but you can't make an informed suggestion without actually having some idea of what's going on."

This has become more prevalent recently because I live alone now I moved for an internship which I've been working at for 2 months and still know no one in the area.  recently my mind has been filled with negative thoughts.  I believe part of the reason I have been depressed lately may be because I have  a co-dependent personality.  for the last 5 or 6 years I have felt like there has been something missing from my life, and I honestly believed that it was because I was single.  I thought that if i had someone who i could love and would love me then it would be okay.  but I had the realization that I could get a girlfriend by some miracle and I may still feel this way.

19hu2r,2,2013-03-01,I never thought I would be here,Askmeaboutmybutt,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/19hu2r/i_never_thought_i_would_be_here/,"I (20f) started dating him (20m) 3 months ago. Things went unusually fast and within a week we said I love you. It started off as long distance but within a month I went to visit to him, it was perfect. We would talk all day every day. Almost 1000 texts to him every day. 


We had little ups and downs but it's normal. Then two weeks ago he gets busy because midterms are coming up. We go from texting all day to an hour a night. Then this week hits...I don't hear from him for hours at a time. Thursday comes and we talk and we come to the agreement of taking a break. He says he is too busy for me and wants me to be happy. I agree. 

Today hits and....he says all of his feelings for me are gone. He says his friend kissed him last night and he will be taking spring break to explore the option of being with her. The girl he assured me he had no feelings for. 

It sounds ridiculous because it was long distance and we were together for three months, but I loved him so much. We had plans..so many plans. Plans to have him take an internship by me so we could spend the summer together. We talked about goofy things we would do at our wedding. He was so loving and never showed signs of apathy until two weeks ago. 

I don't know if this is common or what... I should mention that I was his first girlfriend, he had never even been kissed. He was sweet and caring and never mean to me. This is all so sudden. Everything hurts. I can only think of the times that he told me I was his perfect girl, and that we were going to get a dog together some day. 

I want to hate him, I almost do, but at the same time I want him to be happy because up until this point he has been a good hearted person. 

Maybe I was wrong..maybe I didn't know him like I thought I did. But those memories won't go away..."

I'll never be strong enough to take the daily shit that you put me through. 

Mom, why can't you see that I'm trying? Why can't you see that... I want to be a star in your eyes like Z and K, but I can't... I can't. Everytime you look at me, I can see the look of sheer pity and disappointment. I know you want a thin, pretty, athletic daughter that you can put on a pedestal and have everyone bow down to worship. Yet you have a daughter that is obese, that is as ugly as a shit stain, and extremely antisocial. The things I like to do are things that you disapprove of. I don't join sports because A) I don't find joy in them, sure I'll run on my own time when we're not as busy here, but you ridicule me for it. B) If I did, it'd cost you hundreds of dollars for equiptment, and you wouldn't be able to pick me up or come to any of my games. I saw the way that you almost never went to any of Z's games because you were busy. Only once your fucking boytoy came into the picture did you even start going.

Mom, I hate him. He's evil, he has harmed my animals more than once, he's harmed the horses THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO SELL, he's harmed me. He's harmed my brother and sister. But do you see it? No. ""Oh, well him taking it out on your brother that way is much better than what your father is doing by making him pay 1700 dollars to fix his car that is almost exactly the same damage."" Mom. Wake the fuck up. 

Abuse:  Physical, sexual and/or emotional maltreatment. Child abuse and neglect is defined as any recent act or failure to act resulting in imminent risk of serious harm, death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child

That is what you had divorced your last husband for, and every single boyfriend thereafter has been abusive. Do you ever learn? No. YOu don't. You never do. When he puts me and my sister down, you say ""He's just trying to fit in."" Nope. He's being a circlejerk. I have put up with the mental and physical abuse for the past year and a half, and you do nothing because ""I love him"". Well then, if you love him tell him to move his lazy, jobless, collecting unneeded unemployment, son of a bitch ass out of my house. His son is graduating high school this year, and that kid is moving as far from him as possible, and will break all contact with him after. Mom, LOOK AT THE DAMN SIGNS! He treats you like shit, he acts like it's normal and so do you. Please, for petes sake stop it while you can. 

Z, stop telling me to ""Join sports."" I know I'm fat. No, I don't like interacting with people. If I could, I'd move to Nome Alaska to never talk to anyone again aside for Reddit. I know you want what's best for me, but you need to stop. I can look out for myself, I know you're turning 18 this summer and I'll be turning only 16, but please, respect my wishes. I'm over harming myself, I'm doing okay. Call mom more often, and tell her you love her, or call me even. I miss you living here, and I hate that you live with dad. I want you to come home.

K, I hate that you're little miss perfect. Everything you do mom loves, and when I was your age, I was thinking of ways to save mom's money, but you get to join everything you wish. Oh, want a new horse? Let mom get you a new one. New saddle? Sureee! New boots? Let's go! If I ask for something like that she'll be like, ""No, buy it yourself."" I envy how you have friends who come over, I envy how you're mom's favorite. You can do whatever you so desire and I get blamed for all repercussions. I want to be special too.

AJ, I miss how you don't talk to me anymore. You used to laugh and have fun with me, what happened? Just because you have a new step sister that you're dating, or maybe even engaged to, doesn't mean to cut all ties with your sister. Are you cleaning up the past before you move on? I don't want to be the past, I want to be part of your present. I miss how you would come over almost every weekend and stay until late Sunday night, how you'd chug my entire mountain dew and let me paint your face juggalo style. I miss my big brothers.

A few confessions while I'm at it:

* I'm scared to death to start driving, the responsibility and everything that comes with it is daunting and yet... everyone's still psyched to get their permit. I want to drive and not worry about it, but I do. I'm scared of everything to do with driving. And I don't want to be.

*  I've been going onto Thinspiration again, even though I know it's bad for me mentally, I still go on there and wonder what else I can do to help me. 

* I want to be pretty, attractive but... I know I'll never be even close. I'll never be good enough for anything. 

Well that's all for now reddit, thank you for listening. 

EDIT: Even more that I wanted to add:

Why do we need interns mom? Seriously, with just 3 we did fine, I mean even that was pushing it. But no, you need 7. We can't afford that. We run through groceries like water, live off of spaghetti, and have no room. It's no a boarding house! They're running through stuff we were saving and demanding more, and you can't keep it up. It's like a damn sorority, (I don't have anything against sororities It's just a likeness) It's pissing me off. I'm just one intern away from having my sister move into my room because we need more space. Hell, why don't we furnish the basement and stack it high with bunkbeds! That'll probably be the next step. I'm sick of having all these faces pass through, of having to keep them strangers because if I become friends with them they get ripped away. There's nothing solid, and it's hard growing up like that. We have to go and make nightly trips to walmart because hey, they've run through an entire pack of toilet paper. I want summer to come so that they'll all just go away and I can breathe again. I hate internships. Yet mom still fells the need to fill up 2 more for every one that decides that she doesn't want to this. 

I'm not happy, I can't live like this anymore. I want to cry so badly... I hate it here. I want to move away. I want to go to college just so that I won't bother anyone here anymore. Hell maybe she can get more interns.

I am on the second year of Computer Science ( in Brazil this course takes 4,5 years, the first cycle laurea), and I have worked for 2,5 years as a Delphi Programmer and 6 months as a web developer. All my courses are in C++, so I know how to program in it aswell. 

I am going to try and get into a Computer Science college or a Software Engineer college there.

Anyway, all that info because of this question: How bad is the job market for I.T. workers? I will probally move to Bologna, is it a good place to go, I.T. job wise?

Second thing, how internships work in Italy? I will have to find some work while I am in college, in Brazil internships are  a reasonable way to earn a bit of money, I wonder how it is in Italy.

Oh, and if anyone is looking to hire someone with mine profile, please sent me an message =P.

She goes to school in Vancouver and I go to school in Calgary. Originally the plan was that I would finish school in a year and move in with her in vancouver. But then plans started changing. I realized due to many reasons, I have to do 2 more years of school. Then very recently, I got a one year internship which will means it will take 3 years at the earliest. Looking into the future, if I get a job offer from my company, I know that I wont be able to turn it down and I wont move away. I talked it over with my girlfriend and she just cried while I laid this all out to her. I asked her, but I know that she will not be able to move for me just from how she reacted when I asked her if she would. I love her so much, but I dont know how I can keep myself going if I can't see an end in sight to the long distance. 

My questions are , how do I get through this without destroying everything we've built? What are ways you guys have coped with not knowing when/if your LDR will end?

However, I noticed this same lab is offering summer internship for graduate students in my exact area of research (computational sciences).

I remember when signing the RA contract that it said no outside employment was permissible while receiving a stipend.  I don't know if internships count as ""outside employment"" though.  I never did an internship in my undergrad (which was a mistake), but I think this could be really useful to my research and good for a resume.

I will ask my advisor about it Monday, but I don't want to ask if this is something that could offend the department (i.e., you're already being paid to do research on such-and-such; what do you want an internship for?)  So that's why I'm asking Reddit first."

Even managing to get on the director's list. Since the start, we haven't been meeting regularly, about 4 times a month for dates.

Is it normal to be only meeting 4 times a month for such a young relationship?

Sometime. He hasn't taken any initiative in planning...just a ""whatever you pick will be fine."" Ugh.

We kind of live together at my parents house. Kind of. He part-time lives here.

Anyway, I am heading to Asia for 6 months this year for an internship.  During this time, I'd love if he could show a little independence and perhaps find some roommates or a place to stay closer to where he's working...and then maybe discuss when we get back.

He wants to sit there, presumably at my parents house, waiting for me to get back so I can come along and find us a place to live and take care of everything. 

The thing is: I don't know what I want. I want to live in a house with awesome friends as roommates. I don't know if I'm ready for this, I mean, what happens next? If we move in together, the only way it can go is breaking up or ...getting married? So I'd never be able to try it on my own?
Perhaps I'm just romanticizing the whole ""living with roommates"" thing. Maybe I just watch too much TV. I just don't want to miss out on anything or have to make choices for my own life in the context of how it will affect someone else. Will I be able to pick up and teach in Korea like I want to after graduation? What if my career takes me to another part of the country?

Our relationship has a ton of ups and downs. I get so frustrated with him and his purposely-enraging behaviour on a daily basis, but we also sometimes have fun together. He shuts down a lot, can't really speak what he's feeling. Contempt. I think the point is that I'm totally confused and I don't want to agree to this plan. Our families and lives are so intertwined, my group of friends from my hometown includes his relatives. What do I do? 

I'm sorry this is so ridiculous. This post..what a mess. 
I don't have a ton of close girlfriends, and the ones I do are very close with him as well so I can't talk to them. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend wants to wait until I get back from Asia to move in together, refuses to show independence, will most likely mooch of my parents for a place to stay while I'm gone. I don't know what I want.

I asked her why and she replied that it would allow ourselves to miss each other and evaluate our love for each other. 

I try to talk to her but realize and just tell her that I'm for whatever she wants. She then tells me that she feels like thinking that way was a mistake. I asked her if we are ""together"" to which she replies yes. 

I understand that she has been under a lot of pressure (school, work, trying to land an internship) and she had to move a bit further from me due to some family circumstances. However, whereas she used to cry and tell me how much she missed me, now she doesn't really tell me much about the relationship. When I asked, she said that she has said it so many times that saying it doesn't matter anymore. I make the effort to hang out it seems. 

Any help guys? I love her, I really do. I want her to feel comfortable but I can't spend every day second guessing a relationship I have invested a lot into. 

TL;DR After a suggested break, I am confused what to think.

**EDIT**: I realized after re-reading the post that it is slightly vague and would benefit from better explanation. I will proceed to do that.

Our relationship until this point has been great, we have been pretty much inseparable so far as to be called the ""cute"" couple of our friend group. We have also lasted the longest until this point (3.5 years, as stated above). Were both commuters in college but commute in different directions to different schools. We both hold down part time jobs to supplement the costs of college and to buy nice things like tacos and sweaters when it gets cold. 

Still living with parents takes its own toll on the relationship, but its mostly things we deal with. She has a mental block about having sex with people in the house, which I could totally understand. We lost our virginities to each other and being that we have been on this journey together, I have been very considerate and supportive of her sexuality and what makes her comfortable and what doesn't. We also have family obligations and since we both have rather large families, this can come up quite frequently. 

When Hurricane Sandy hit, we both had to relocate but found places with our families in opposing directions. This has taken a toll on us and has successfully limited our interactions to once a week or so. She calls me whenever she can, usually when in the car, in the morning, and before bed to mention a few. We text, but it tends to go stale because it seems very impersonal. I must confess that lately I have been planning much of the hangouts. That kind of bothers me. It's temporary, though, as we are both having our houses rebuilt and will be moving back into the same town to again be five minutes from each other. 

We are both very driven academically, but are in different fields so the way we express this is different. I, being an aspiring educator, take my field experience seriously and tend to spend much of my time reading and planning lessons. She's on the accounting track, and her idea of pushing towards her goals is trying to apply for internships. We are supportive of each other and have said that its education first and relationship second. With that mutual understanding, we have moved forward comfortably.

What she exactly told me wasn't, ""We need a break"" but more along the lines of ""I think we need a break because we've been apart and I feel like the flame is gone. When I'm with you, its there but I am just really lonely,"". She is in a town with no friends, and really doesn't have many school friends. After we talked (twice) and the idea of going through with the break has come up, she tells me that she hates everyone but me and that she doesn't want to break up. She gets stressed VERY easily, and with the loss of her home as well as the tough classes at school and a demanding work schedule I don't blame her. I am a bit more emotionally resilient than she is, so I am usually ""the rock"". 

I would say I believe that she is fooling around if I didn't truly know her and felt that all of this has been a product of her loneliness and her inability to deal with much stress. She has never stopped saying ""I love you"" and got mad recently when I said that, ""If you really value the relationship, a break wouldn't help anything. What matters is how much you give to this relationship and depending on that will depend on whether it will work or not,"". I also trust this girl, and know her policy on cheating. She pays for most of her stuff herself, so she needs the hours at work. 

TL;DR #2 : Explanation of the situation in a bit more depth.

Before going to school I had no relevant work experience in my field. During the summer before I graduated I did a 4 month full-time internship with the government, where I gained significant experience. 

I've been putting out resume after cover letter after resume. I've gone to job fairs. I'm trying to learn extra skills at home through coursera and duolingo. I don't know what else to do. I'm thinking of maybe volunteering in my respective field, but it's difficult to do considering volunteer positions go to high school students here (they must fulfill a certain amount of volunteer hours before graduating), and I feel people would see that I have my Masters and pass me up. 

Every job I look at asks for minimum 2yr experience, 5 yr experience, 10 yr experience, etc. So when applying to these, it seems I'm being passed up for more experienced veterans.

When I apply to lower level jobs (e.g. data entry or the like) I feel like my ""Masters"" label causes employers to pass me up because I'm over-qualified. In reality, I just want *something* to help me start sharpening my skills. (Before working for my internship, I had only ever worked minimum-wage jobs. Even now I'm working part-time in a brainless job where I interact with no-one... so my social skills are going downhill and I have no busy-brain work to keep me going).

I'm feeling a little deflated... especially since throughout Grad school my professors hyped up the fact that I would be employed with a 6 figure salary straight out of school.  I was also told not to sell myself short by working for free.

What else could I do while I sit and re-write my resume everyday to make myself more appealing to employers?"

I was an intern at Valve a little while ago. It's the best place to work even if I didn't get paid. I've followed my dad's footsteps in the gaming industry and he eventually got my foot in the door.

I was fresh out of college and still green to the world. This would eventually get me in trouble at Valve. So college was a blast and pretty easy for me since I've been studying game design and have been an active gamer for pretty much my whole life.

So I happened to be on /r/gaming when I get a beep that says I got a new e-mail. I got called in for a 1 on 1 with my boss. Ugh..

I guess I was in trouble for browsing the internet too much (we're allowed to take intermittent breaks during the day so we can ""freshen up our minds"") So I hesitantly walk over to the office and knock on the door. Lo and behold Gabe is sitting in the chair. Now I see him every once and a while around the building but it's only a little hi and bye so this was scary and exciting.

He sits me down and the first thing he says to me as he turns the monitor around, ""So is this what the internet thinks of me?""

Apparently they saw some Gabe meme from monitoring my net usage. My voice cracked and I whispered, ""um, I guess..""

Gabe bursts out laughing so hard and I let out biggest sigh of relief. Well then he told me to keep on the project we were working on and try not to ""take breaks"" as often.

So now every once and a while I get an email from him with some meme about him and it kind of became our inside joke. I'm pretty sure he's a Redditor now since he would always send me stuff that I just saw earlier that day. And I thought I only had to deal with this on FB.

By the way, Gabe gets the 3 jokes. 3/3/13"

From at least week 37, I was dilated to 3 cm and 60% effaced.  I stayed like that for another two weeks, then went in for my 39 week check-up and my doctor told me I was 4 cm and 70%.  She was fully on board with me waiting until 42 weeks to be induced because I wanted to avoid it, but my blood pressure was a TINY, and I mean TINY, bit high (140/82), so she had me go to the hospital to be monitored.  The other doctor in her practice couldn't believe she was sending me and everything ended up being fine at the hospital so I got the hell out of there fast because I didn't want to be induced.

At 40 +6 weeks, I went in for my normal check-up with my doctor.  I was having weekly NST tests, so she hooked me up and checked me for dilation.  I was 5 cm and 70% with bulging waters. I couldn't believe it! Keep in mind, I hadn't had any discernable contractions at this point, just some minor period like cramping.  She said she would be okay with letting me go into labor on my own, but Olivia's heart rate was dropping every time I had a ""contraction"" that they could see on the NST test.  Queue my panic, then  queue me being told I had to go to the hospital and get induced.  I freaked out. I talked to the other doctor to make sure this was really something I had to do. She agreed. 

I stopped at my parents house to get my hospital bag and have some food before I went in. I was freaking out. I called my SO and he started freaking out and couldn't believe I was going to have the baby that day. Everybody was freaking out! I was the type of person who just wanted her to stay in there forever-I was extremely afraid of labor. Sadly, that was not a choice. haha

We got to the hospital at around 2 pm. They asked if I wanted to go straight to my room or if I wanted to stop in at check-in. I said I would go to check-in because I wanted a few extra minutes to process what was happening. That took 20 minutes, then we were on our way upstairs. We got to the room (which was a LDRP suite so I never had to change rooms during the entire hospital stay) which was nice and big and had a nice bathroom. It didn't feel too medical at all.  I changed into my gown but refused to take my underwear off until I absolutely had to, and the nurses thought it was hilarious. I am a really modest person. They hooked me up to the monitors and of course, Olivia was registering fine, so I really didn't need to be induced, but at this point, apparently my doctor made the decision and wouldn't let me leave easily.  I was extremely pissed at her for that.

I was GBS+ so they hooked me up to antibiotics and took some blood.  I sat around for about an hour to see if anything progressed, but nothing really was.  I agreed that they could break my water.  It took her what seemed like forever to break it, and then she told me the sac was really thick so she doubted that it would have broken on its own.  I hated that part.  The constant gush of water every time I moved or got up was disgusting to me. I'm also squeamish about bodily fluids. At this point it was about 4 pm.  They let me sit around like that until 6, then started talking about pitocin.  I was extremely against this because I wanted to avoid and epidural and knew that pitocin made contractions almost unbearable, but since they broke my water I really had no choice.  The nurse promised she would put me on the lowest drip and not move it up unless I agreed. 

She started pitocin and about 20 minutes later I was having TERRIBLE back labor that was almost constant.  It was basically a contraction that lasted at least a minute every 30 seconds.  I have never been in so much pain.  At one point I went to the bathroom and pooped (DO THIS IF YOU CAN, sorry TMI) which made me feel a lot better. Also, use counter pressure on your back! Make your SO or your labor support (I had my mother and my boyfriend both there) massaging my back as hard as they could and someone was holding my hands. At one point I told my boyfriend I thought I would die if he stopped massaging my back.    

At 8:30 pm I started thinking about pain medication.  I wanted to have a natural birth and I really really didn't want an epidural, but I was to the point where I didn't think I could handle it anymore.  I told the nurse I was thinking about IV pain meds, but she wanted to check me before she gave me anything.  I was 9.5 cm! Thats where shit got intense.  She literally said ""Holy shit I have to go call your doctor right now."" and ran out of the room. I had no option for pain meds at this point and was very thankful for that.  I knew that I could make it without it at that point.  What I have been told I found was true-when you get to the point where you just don't think you can do it anymore, you're probably almost to the point of being fully dilated.  I tolerate pain pretty well, though.

At this point I'm laying there freaking out.  I yelled at my mom she had to go get the nurse because I was feeling like pushing and couldn't not push.  It seemed like she was gone for an hour but it was really only a few minutes.  The nurse came back and luckily my doctor was with her.  At this point I really hated my doctor.  She walked in the room and had the audacity to start chit-chatting with the nurse about her kids! I was like BITCH I NEED TO PUSH WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU! It was like nobody was taking me seriously and I was pissed.  She kept telling me to work through contractions with my eyes open. I just said no. I'm laboring the way I want to! I couldn't believe she walked in and tried to tell me how I should work through the pain. At that point I knew how to handle it. 

At 8:45 I started pushing.  That shit was HARD. My mom was holding one of my legs up, my boyfriend was holding the other one, I had a sheet draped over my legs (yes, I still wanted to be as modest as possible), and I had to grab my thighs every time I needed to push.  I am fairly certain I said ""I can't do this"" about a million times, but I did.  It literally feels like you just took the best dump of your life. It's so hard because every time you push near the end it makes things hurt worse because you are stretching, but you just have to work through it and know it's only temporary.  At 9:30 on the dot I pushed her head and then the rest of her body out.  The put her on top of me and I was in shock. I couldn't believe that I just pushed that little girl out of me! The doctor stitched up (what I think, since my doctor is a bitch and wouldn't answer any of my questions) was one first degree tear that was going towards my urethra.  I then pushed out the placenta which was hilarious-it came out in two pieces and the first piece shot out at my doctor and splashed her, the nurse, and the intern that were there.  I did delayed cord clamping, so after placental delivery my boyfriend cut the cord. 

There is much more to the story but I have to get back to my LO, so I will be posting later about my experience after birth and all the things I've learned in the past two and a half weeks. Thanks for reading, ladies!

**TL;DR: Olivia born on Valentines day at 9:30 pm after 4 hours of labor, ~45 minutes of pushing; 6 lbs 14 oz, 9/9 APGAR.  Pitocin and broken water, no pain medication. First degree tear, just a few stitches.**"

Here are some general tips to find things you might want to automate:

1. What are some things that take up a lot of your time? 

2. Do you have any tasks that require following sequences of clear steps that you have to repeat over and over again? Maybe moving in between programs, or manipulating a file, or making changes to several files? Or maybe repeating a series of steps in one program? Better yet, in a program for which a python API exists (like maybe excel)?

3. Do you have any menial labor that you were considering outsrourcing to temp labor or interns? Like manual data entry, web scraping, simple report building, or client emailing?

These kinds of projects are the kinds of things that should raise red flags that, hey, maybe there's at least some element of this that I could streamline or automate via programming. It might ultimately be more trouble than it's worth but hey, it might pay out.

19mytb,1,2013-03-04,"Aspiring Film-maker, Failed by government",[deleted],Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/19mytb/aspiring_filmmaker_failed_by_government/,"New to reddit so forgive any usage errors.

My name is Matt. For the last year I have been working in the voluntary sector making films for charities, community groups and social enterprise organisations in my city. Prior to this I mainly made short fictional films while studying, although I still do this in my spare time.

This last year I have been unemployed but volunteering full-time in some very rewarding and worthwhile roles in deprived areas of the city. I originally worked in the wonderful establishment of Subway while looking for work in film or tv. Of course there was none that I could get and regardless of my experience it was made even more difficult that I did an Audio/Video electronics degree rather than something with media in the name.

The transition into voluntary work was the best thing I ever did and came at a time when I feared for my physical and mental health working night shifts in Subway. The projects I have worked on up until now have been fantastic for gaining experience and doing something positive with my life that helps others. Of course I have had to move back in with my parents and can only afford a fairly meagre existence.

My current position is with a small charity organisation that has an even smaller studio to produce media for the events and projects the charity runs. After volunteering full-time for the last 6 months, a government funded internship within the company was secured to give me paid, professional experience for 3 months. - a reward almost for my hard work - After this I would be established and experienced enough to gain stable employment in my area of expertise.

But the madness comes in with the controversial work programme that we have here in the UK. I have been referred to this programme recently and although I have not actually started it, I am considered to have done so because the work programme partners have received their fee from the government. This has been done despite being in a full-time voluntary position and notifying them of my intention to secure this internship.

So instead of continuing my important work in a full-time paid internship that will set me up as a professional, my employment agency will have me writing CVs/resumes and no doubt make me work for peanuts in Tesco.

Why?

Because of money.

The work programme is run by private organisations that are goverment funded and receive additional money if they can stuff me in a basic job for a few months. Although I have not started it yet, they have had their money and the government will not fund the internship now. Nor will they simply cancel the work program that I will gain nothing from, because the private partners would sue them.

Although this internship has been in planning for months, you are secretly ineligible to do it if the unemployment agency signs you up to the work programme. It should be noted that at no point during the application and organisation process of this internship is the work programme even mentioned. And so right at the culmination of all my work and experience leading up to this point, I have been sent back to square one by the government.

The nature of my work requires constant involvement to progress and as such I have severely neglected family involvement to focus on my career. To be involved with the work programme now would completely remove me from the game and I could not face, or afford, starting all over again.

I am at a loss with what to do just now. Having to leave my voluntary position and seeing my placement go to someone else will be heart-breaking. Needless to say my enthusiasm for the work programme will be tough to muster.

Any questions about my situation just ask."
19mdad,1,2013-03-03,I try to avoid my problems by simply not going to university and failing most of my classes ,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19mdad/i_try_to_avoid_my_problems_by_simply_not_going_to/,"(English is my second language so I apologize in advance).

It all started when I got into a very good university here where I live, to study Economics. I've always enjoyed the subject, and I'm now very confident that this is what I want to do for my life. However, I've failed a bunch of classes, mostly because I don't show up in class. I don't know what gets to me, I hate myself for doing this, but I think I have a tendency to try to escape from my problems, besides being ridiculously lazy. It all started when I got in university and from the very beginning I didn't get along with my classmates. I don't know, most of them are nice people but I was never able to make a connection. And this was strange to me, because I'm not an antisocial person, I have a ton of friends from high school and a girlfriend for 2 years and I'm very happy with these relationships. For some reason though, I didn't make any friends in my university, started to get really isolated, and I felt really bad about it. My first semester I did ok, passed all my classes, but the second semester I failed the two most important classes. I just didn't enjoy going to class, and felt really bad. On the third semester, I decided I wanted to change schools, but I mistakenly thought I should also change majors. So I went to study Marketing in another school. That was also very bad for me, and at this point I was feeling miserable. I felt really depressed about life, but I mistakenly never saw a psychologist or something. I also don't have a good relationship with my mother, and she didn't help me. I live with her (it's the norm here in my country), and she got really mad at me, so I didn't feel supported. 

Well, I decided to come back to economics, and things started to get better (this was early 2011). I was enjoying more my classes, I started dating my current girlfriend, and was taking courses and stuff. I also started an internship which I really like, and I'm still there and people really enjoy my work. But I don't know what gets to me, I simply started to skip classes again, and said fuck it. So now I'm here, the semester starts tomorrow morning, I'm retaking a bunch of classes I had failed, and I'm having trouble sleeping. What's worst for me is what people will say about me still taking classes from the 2nd semester, and my graduation is going to be 3 years late, and only if I pass basically all my classes now. I'm very confident this semester I'm gonna change it all, and I HAVE to. I'm retaking 3 of my classes for the 5th time, and if I fail them, I get expelled. I'm very worried about it, but I'm with the right frame of mind and I want so bad to do it. I know I can. I just hope I don't get away again.

Thank you very much for reading this, I feel better already. I'm nervous, but confident. Also, what's been terrible for me is that every morning I get up, hit the snooze button and go back to sleep. I do this kind of unconsciously, and any tips for getting up would be much appreciated. Thanks again."
19ma6y,17,2013-03-03,Paralegal Work &amp; Education: Frequently Asked Questions (USA only),Namtara,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/19ma6y/paralegal_work_education_frequently_asked/,"This post is mostly in response to the high number of inquiries this subreddit gets in regard to paralegals. With the legal job market the way it is, the interest is skyrocketing and many firms are hiring to increase caseloads without hiring additional attorneys.   

----   

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  

* **What is a paralegal? What about a legal assistant? Legal secretary?**  

They are all pretty much the same thing, with different levels of reverence depending on the title.  

A paralegal is a lawyer's right hand. Because of the insane amount of overhead in most law firms, lawyers often have to focus on efficiency as their #1 priority when handling a case. In order to avoid spending their own time on the more menial work, they assign any simpler or repetitive work to paralegals.  

This may seem demeaning, but it's far from it. Paralegals are the backbone for good lawyering. Attorneys with shitty paralegals or no paralegal are often overworked, don't make much money, or have generally unhappy clients. Attorneys with good paralegals learn to be grateful, because a paralegal that doesn't feel appreciated for excellent work will make it known or just leave.   

*  **So what exactly can paralegals do?**  

In general, paralegals can do just about everything a lawyer can do except...  
1) represent clients in court;  
2) negotiate fees;   
3) enter attorney-client relationships;   
4) offer legal advice; and  
5) join the state bar.     

*IMPORTANT QUALIFIER*: The above list varies by state, but is generally a good rule of thumb. For example, some states (like WA) allow for paralegals to represent clients in very limited circumstances or to even join the state bar after apprenticeships, without law school degrees. However, there are also specific RPCs (Rules of Professional Conduct) that explicitly state what a paralegal *can't* do, because it's anything a non-lawyer can't do.   

In short, don't do something stupid after reading this and try to blame me for getting in trouble with the law. Do your goddamn research for your state. If you can't handle that, you'll be a shitty paralegal anyway. I won't even pity you.  

* **What do paralegals do in every day work?**  

It totally depends on the size of the firm and the lawyer you work for.   

In large firms, you may work for several attorneys and have only a few specific jobs. Perhaps you'll specialize in research and spend most of your time on Westlaw, LexisNexis, or hitting the books. You could also be a drafting monkey. At worst, you could be stuck scanning and copying files, but at least you'd have a full time job.  

In a small firm, you're likely to be the glue holding everything together. You'll do intake calls, schedule meetings, draft pleadings and letters, take dictations, communicate with the courts, research, deal with calling the government, cover reception, and just about everything the lawyer needs except talking to the judge and giving advice to the client.  

The personality of the lawyer matters too of course. The more trusting and busy, the more work you get to do. The more paranoid or lax, the more the lawyer will likely take on.  

* **Do I need a license to be a paralegal?**  

To do a paralegal's work, there is no such license necessary. A license is permission from the government or an organization to do or have something.  

That said, some states are increasing their control over the industry by implementing regulations regarding the titles. These regulations are typically done through standardized tests and education requirements. *They are completely unnecessary to beginning a career.*  

That said, there are also unnecessary tests and titles you can get to make your resume better.  

* **What is a paralegal certificate?**  

A paralegal certificate is a professional degree from any higher education institution that has a paralegal program. They are usually 6 month to 4 year programs that offer training for paralegal work.  

The only programs that are reputable are ABA approved programs. There are no guarantees for any other programs whatsoever. The firm hiring you has no idea what your education included unless you have an ABA approved certificate.   

ABA approved programs train you in legal theory, legal research &amp; writing, and civil procedure. Those three are the backbone to paralegal work. If you can excel in those classes, you will be a good paralegal. ABA approved programs tend to be hands on and very thorough. They also require a few electives.  

The length of the education is not that important. ABA approved programs are typically 2 years if you don't have a 4 year degree. If you have a 4 year degree, you'll have the option to take a short program (Advanced Paralegal Certificate) since you'll have covered the general education requirements. The only difference between the two is how many electives you take. The core is exactly the same.  

The cost of your education is unimportant. I took a 3 quarter program that I could have finished in 2 quarters had I gone full time. It cost me ~$5,000 at a community college since I didn't get any scholarships. I was trained with Westlaw, was trained at a public law school library, and every single one of my teachers was an attorney teaching his or her own field. Most of the attorneys were part-time teachers because they still had their own practice. I was employed 2 months after completing the program, mostly because I procrastinated for 1 and a half months due to moving. You don't need to go to some hoity toity private school to get good training or a job.   

* **What is a Certified Paralegal?**   

If you have a paralegal certificate, you are a *certificated paralegal*. Nothing more.  

After you complete your paralegal education, you'll have the opportunity to take locally, state-wide, and national-level exams that test your knowledge regarding paralegal practices. The incentive for these exams is the ability to call yourself a particular title, such as a Certified Paralegal, Registered Paralegal, etc.  

These exams are not necessary to starting a career, and most of them require experience in order to even take the exams. However, they are good for beefing up your resume and to use as leverage for pay increases. They reflect your skill, experience, and knowledge.    

* **How to I start my paralegal career?**  

While a paralegal education and the exams for titles are great for a running start, they are not necessary to start. Look for job ads for legal assistants, legal secretaries, and receptionists. In many smaller firms, these are the exact same job as a paralegal, though receptionists obviously will also be running a front desk and in charge of the phones. The receptionist in my firm did more than I did for two months before my training was on par with hers, and only then did I start learning things she had no clue about. They will have lower pay than many paralegal positions, but they'll have room for growth and more responsibilities, especially in medium size firms in large cities. Big city jobs also tend to have great benefits from the start.  

Look high and low. Check craigslist, job websites, linked in, and ask attorneys working at paralegal programs. Network. Ask paralegals and legal assistants to lunch so you can ask them where they found work in your city. Apply for things you're under-qualified for (within reason). If they ask for 1-2 years experience in a specific field, apply anyway and learn quickly. Intern and ask questions whenever you get the chance.  

The paralegal job market is expanding, but it's still a crappy economy. Do not allow yourself to think it's easy to get a job. Work your ass off, sell your skills, and never stop learning. Learn every kind of word processor, learn Excel and spreadsheet programs, know Adobe PDF backwards and forwards, and study your state and local government. You will learn a ridiculous amount in your first two months in a paralegal job, but if you learn that stuff ahead of time, it will give you an edge.   

* **Are there any more resources you can give me?**

The [National Federation of Paralegals](http://www.paralegals.org/)  (NFPA) hosts the Paralegal CORE Competency Exam, which gives the title CORE Registered Paralegal. Their test has education minimums, but no significant experience minimums. The less experience you have, the more education required to qualify for the exam.  

The [National Association of Legal Assistants](http://www.nala.org/) (NALA), which offers the Certified Paralegal exam, granting the same title. You need either education as a paralegal, a 4 year degree and 1 year experience as a paralegal, or high school education and 7 years experience as a paralegal.  

There are other professional paralegal associations, and many states have their own associations as well. They typically offer networking, career advice and opportunities, Continuing Legal Education (impresses the boss and helps you learn a field you lack experience in), and resources if you've been swindled in the job. All of the associations typically offer membership perks and lobby for paralegals, so they're worth looking in to.  

* **This all sounds kind of boring, and this is a huge wall of text...**  

Congratulations, you'd be a shitty paralegal. If you can't handle reading this little with at least minimal formatting, you can't handle the legal profession. Apply to be a receptionist or find another career path. Go away.    

--------

**NITPICKY DETAILS**  

Because if there was a profession for bureaucrats, it'd be the legal profession.  

* **What is the point of an ABA Approved paralegal program? Lawyers don't seem to like the ABA that much.**  

An ABA approved program meets certain requirements. Those requirements are listed in the process guide on the [ABA site](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/legalservices/paralegals/downloads/paralegalguidelines2008.authcheckdam.pdf) (WARNING: PDF).  Important requirements include:   
1) Paralegals *and* lawyers must be included on the committee overseeing the program.  
2) Any electives covering a specific legal field must teach current substantive law, not theoretical or philosophical law only.   
3) Legal research training must include electronic resources, whether online or paid legal services such as Westlaw or LexisNexis.   
4) The school must have a law library that is sufficient to teach the fundamentals of research and civil procedure. Specific requirements include up-to-date and complete state statutes, state caselaw, a legal encyclopedia, practice manuals, form books, local and state bar journals, legal dictionaries, and other relevant legal texts.   

In brutal honesty, the ABA requirements are very general and very easy to meet. The costs incurred in qualifying are often due to growing the program, since the program must have graduated students for two years, must be an independent department with a full-time head and some full-time faculty, and the school must offer financial aid services to those applying to the program. That is where the money comes in.  

Any school not willing to spend money on the program to meet those requirements is not going to spend the money on resources, faculty, or refining the paralegal curriculum. It's not a matter of ""well, they didn't pay the ABA off to get the approval, so they must have spent it on the program!"". It's that they didn't want to improve the program to meet the ABA's standards.  

* **All these job postings want 5 years experience in X field, and I don't even have a certificate yet. Why bother going to school?**  

You don't need the experience to get started. You see those ads more than any other because experienced paralegals can be picky about their job. If they want to move and have more than 5 years experience in any field under their belt, they can move to any big city in the US and find a job in less than a month. Firms may also be looking to hire another paralegal so they can expand their caseload, and paralegals are much more cost-efficient than attorneys as new hires.  

Look for jobs requiring 0-2 years experience and little to no education. They exist. Hiring rises and falls depending on a legal field's busy time during the calendar year. Don't get discouraged because the economy is crappy, but also don't get overly optimistic because paralegals are finding jobs.  

* **Why should I bother with the associations' exams and titles? Why bother with CLE?**  

Associations like NFPA and NALA are icing on the cake. They make you look better and they make your career a bit easier by letting you know what the current environment is like for paralegals. They keep you in the loop on hot topics, like the new WA law that allows paralegals to do some legal work directly for clients in family law matters. They offer CLE courses to help you learn about new fields or something that may improve your work in your current field. They cost money, but if you're shrewd about which ones you take, they're worth it. Work for a PI lawyer? Take some CLE on discovery and investigations. Work for an IP lawyer? Take some CLE on copyright law.  

Lawyers love it whenever you learn how to do something for them that they think is tedious. They like when you do something for them that they'd rather not do. They will pay you money, give you benefits, and treat you well because they hate it that much. *Learn how to do as much of that shit as you can.*  

For every lawyer that is an ungrateful asshole about it, there's other lawyers who would think you're the best thing since IOLTAs. Never work for an ungrateful asshole. Find out which ones are ungrateful by seeing how they react when you take CLEs that make you better at your job. (Important: CLEs that have nothing to do with your job don't count.)

------

Do you have more questions? Ask away, I'll answer them as best I can and add general questions and responses to this thread. Same for anything other paralegals wish to add or have counterpoints to. "

19lyq9,0,2013-03-03,"/r/Frugal, my parents are going to buy me a new car.  Is this an okay choice as long as they completely pay it off?",[deleted],Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19lyq9/rfrugal_my_parents_are_going_to_buy_me_a_new_car/,"I'm an 18 year old college student and my lease on the car I got for my 16th birthday is up in 2 months (2011 Toyota Corolla).  My dad is a car enthusiast and has never driven a used car, so he is willing to pay cash for a brand new car in the next few weeks.

The cars we are considering are a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Outback, and a Toyota Highlander.  

I know that one of the ""cardinal sins"" of /r/frugal is buying a new car, but if they completely pay it off, is it that bad of a decision?  If it was up to me, I would take that money and buy a gently used Volvo XC70 but my dad is insisting on a brand new car with all the safety features 2013 has to offer.  

And obligatory comment, I know I am so grateful to have parents that are willing to buy me a car.  I'll be paying for my insurance with money that I make on an internship and co-op this summer/fall, but I know that this is an opportunity that most 18 year olds don't have.

Thanks in advance."

Doesn't matter, I'm officially addicted!",hello_toast,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/19ltw0/so_ive_been_on_okc_for_two_weeks_now_not_a_single/,"I really started out on OKC because I'm staying in a small town in Germany with nothing else around and not much chances of meeting people my own age, so why not see if I can get a few dates with someone from around if possible. 

Well like most guys here those high expectations were drowned out almost immediately, but then I started to talk to people who were no where near me, just to chat. 

This started off mostly with some American redditors who visited my page when I asked for a critique, messaging them when I'd catch them continually creeping my profile. Then I started talking to other people around Europe, because why not? 

Now I have conversations with a girl from Helsinki, and Vienna, Prague, Athens, 3 in Denmark, 2 people in the US (both redditors and both adorable and fun to talk to), one girl near where I'm from in Canada, and I just spent the night having an especially deep conversation exchanging WALLS of text with a Dutch girl in Utrecht. 

It's amazing simply knowing these people and I feel so open with them and from our conversations I feel that they're really relaxed when talking to me too. Hell, I even hooked up one girl with a possible internship with one of my previous bosses.

OKC has never given me a date, and even if it never does I still enjoy it immensely for the connections it's given me.

Just thought I'd share my little bit of happiness here as there seems to be a lot of negativity about the site."

She maintained no contact the whole time but I ran into her a few weeks ago. She was completely different with me, basically friendzoned me and it sucked. I didnt ask her but she said she wasnt with anyone and had no intention of being with someone. 

Now today randomly on facebook I see her with this guy at multiple date parties and they are obviously together. I dont know what I was expecting but I dont know what to do right now. I thought I was over her but this just brought so many feelings back. I forgot to say that I have been out of town this whole time doing an internship but I get back to school on Friday. Now I am seriously dreading running into her. I dont know for sure, I asked a couple of friends but they have no idea. I kinda want to ask her but I am sure that is wrong.

19q2j0,10,2013-03-05,My BF is living abroad. I am jealous and I don't know how to deal with this (not what you think at all),[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/19q2j0/my_bf_is_living_abroad_i_am_jealous_and_i_dont/,"My SO (m; 22) is studying abroad for one year (3100 miles away), and there is something that is a bit hard for me (f;22) sometimes. I could never admit it to him because it makes me feel like such a bad person... I get so jealous of him. Not jealous of him with other girls or anything, no, I am jealous OF HIM. 

He goes out, he has fun, he litteraly lives halfway across the world, he meets many people, he travels, he sees so many great things, he lives adventures, and he goes to places that I always DREAMT of seeing...

In the meanwhile, I am stuck at home, I had to go back to my parents' home (for some internship), I don't see my friends, I never go out, and I struggle a lot with my studies. I am living one of the worst year of my life so far (him being away not helping...), and he is probably living the best one of his. I am so jealous. I feel like I will never experience what he's living. I don't have enough money to travel, nor enough time. And I will never study abroad for a year like him. I am stuck here. I feel like a such loser compared to him... 


There is some other thing that I hate because of this... I also feel like him visiting all those wonderful places means that we will never go there... together. I mean, why would he spend 2000$ to go with me some place he already went? And I dream of us taking a trip there, discovering all those wonderful things at the same time. I am so sad that I won't ever have the chance to go there with him (there is a place in particular I have in mind, that I've always dreamt of seeing, and it's breaking my heart that I will never do that, not with him anyway)

He've noticed that I regret not being able to see the things he sees. But I joke a lot about it, I try not to make it such a big deal in front of him. I could never admit the truth. I should be so happy for him. Instead of that, I'm just being a huge selfcentred b*.tch who can't be happy for the person she loves. I feel so bad.. 

Can anyone relate to this ? How do I stop being jealous like this, and start be happy for him and mean it? I hate feeling this way, I almost feel like I don't deserve to be with him.

**TL;DR : I am jealous of my BF, who's abroad for the year, because of all the great things he is living, while I am stuck at my parents' house. I am jealous and I feel like a loser, I will never do anything that amazing in my life.**"
19puuc,3,2013-03-05,I'm beginning to regret all of my decisions...,throwawaynojob,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19puuc/im_beginning_to_regret_all_of_my_decisions/,"I studied music at University, graduated in the Summer but I'm struggling to find a related job, even though I graduated with above average grades.

I did an internship after graduating but I was clearly being exploited (working on expenses only) and not being developed in any way, so I left.

Whilst I was studying (and interning) I was involved in a band that got hired for a lot of corporate gigs and I made some money from that. I was relying on it to pay my rent once I graduated while I started up some other bands and dedicated the rest of my time to the reason I studied music in the first place: songwriting and performing my own material.
Turns out they decided I wasn't good enough, after helping the group achieve it's current high profile status by dedicating 4 years of my hard work (at least the first half of which unpaid!) to it. Now, I have nothing.

I can't teach in schools without spending money I don't have on getting a Teaching Qualification, so I started teaching from home. It was going great for the first week, but then the 2 students I had never came back or bothered telling me they weren't gonna come back. I get inquires all the time and I reply quickly. I have lowered my rates, which were previously on par with what others in my area charge, but that hasn't changed anything. And I haven't had a student since my first (and last) two. So I started applying for any jobs...

First, I'd apply to any part-time work I could do during the day, like coffee shops or sales positions. Occasionally I'd find a good music related position, that I am more than qualified to get, and apply for that too. As the time progressed I started applying to anything at all. Today I applied to a kitchen porter job (amongst others)... which I will no doubt never even hear anything back from. After countless ads replied, application forms filled, CVs sent, I have heard from a total amount of 1 company (mobile phones, sales position), who gave me a phone interview, called back to say I was still in the run, then never called back or replied my calls or emails.

I feel like I am the luckiest person when it comes to my incredible parents, who have been helping me out financially. I know I would be in a much worse situation if it wasn't for them, but I feel really, really terribly bad for putting them in this situation, as I know they are not having the best time (financially) either, even after working all their lives.
I also have the most loving and nurturing SO anyone could hope for and I feel it's unfair that he is the only earner in our household, especially when he often struggles to make ends meet as well.


I'm so sick of feeling trapped in this stupid situation. I am hard-working. I am competent. Or maybe not? Maybe I've been wrong all this time and I'm actually shit at everything I do?

I feel so hopeless and so powerless... I don't know what to do anymore. I'm beginning to regret my decision to follow my dreams instead of studying something that I would hate, but would get me a job. I find myself wishing I could just disappear...

You're my best friend...so much so that in my sad life, I'm creepily dependent on you. I don't hang out with people from school...I work with a bunch of people 20-30 years my senior, and my siblings all have friends and girlfriends they want to spend their time with.

I get it. You have a life. I, unfortunately, don't. Between work, school, an internship, a committee, grad requirements, social anxiety disorder, and relapsing depression, I can't seem to find time, energy, and enthusiasm for a life.

So when you say in January ""we should go to Cozumel for your last spring break!"" I got my hopes up. I did. I was genuinely excited for the first time in a while. And when you came to me two weeks later and said ""there's no way I can get a whole week off for work,"" I understood.

And time goes by. And in that time, I've covered bills for you, loaned you my car for the 2 hour drives to see your girlfriend because you ""couldn't afford the gas in your car."" I've bought you food, comforted you when you were depressed, supported you when you tried to quit smoking, didn't judge you when you started up again. I've tried to be a good friend.

Then we get to last week. Last week when you told me that ""everything sounds gay coming from [my] cock-sucking mouth."" I know, I know. You were joking. But considering that the last person who made some homophobic comment to me did it with a broken bottle in my face, while you were watching, I'd have though that you would have some sense of courtesy and avoid this bullshit.

And now, tonight. Tonight you cut me off in the middle of a story to tell me about your day, when you convinced your boss to give you a week off so you could go to Cozumel. In May. With your girlfriend.

This isn't about the fact that I just paid more bills for you. This isn't about the $60 I gave you so you could schlep out to the boonies to see your girl. This isn't even about the fact that you are taking the same girl on vacation that I have spent hours listening to you complain about, after her mind games, and her habit of talking to you about her past fuck buddies, or the fact that you think she thinks your ugly.

This is about the fact that I will be spending my last spring break working in the Midwest to undoubtedly buy you more shit, and in a few months, while I'm cramming for a test so I can get a job in a field I hate, you'll be laying in the sun next to ""the girl of your dreams.""

Sad thing is, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me. I don't even know why, but when I think about you and your fucking vacation, I hate myself a little bit more."
19pp02,8,2013-03-05,Soo.... what now?,SingleMaltDude,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/19pp02/soo_what_now/,"Bubble bursted, didn't get the job. Instead, I'll do the same thing I did the last six months (which essentially IS the job) for the same shitty pay. Great. ""You work is really great!"" Well, fuck you, give me the fucking job then. If it's so fucking great, it should be worth it, right?

I just don't know what to do now. I don't want to go to college and even if, I wouldn't even know what to study. And how. And when. And why.

And there's nothing else I can do. Nobody else is offering jobs and there's no sense doing stupid internships for ages... especially since I will definitely have to move this time and I can't fucking do that if I don't get paid... I don't have a lot of money and neither does anyone else in the family. I can only do this one thing - I jsut don't have the knowledge and encouragement to do anything else. And honestly, I suck at everything else. So, there's no alternative.

I'm stuck. I wanted to go and have this job so badly. It was the first step. I can't even date without it, just because I don't feel confident enough. Heck, what if the girl of my dreams suddenly does leave her boyfriend? I can't even try to date her, living at home, not earning money and all.

Wow, the money thing. I can't afford anything. I'll have to keep my shitty clothes, can't buy games, can't do anything, really. But worst of all, I'm not gonna live on my own. That's the worst. I just want my own place, where I can do what I want after I come home from work. Have my own furniture, decoration. Make the food I want to eat. Invite people. Invite girls. 

Have a life.

What the fuck should I do now?"
19ph75,1,2013-03-05,Engineering student here can I get some gory details about the design process you guys went through and maybe get you to answer a few other questions?,CivilJetHead,JETWaterPipes,https://www.reddit.com/r/JETWaterPipes/comments/19ph75/engineering_student_here_can_i_get_some_gory/,"I've been waiting for someone to take an engineering approach towards water pipes for  a long time. This piece has made me ecstatic, mine is hopefully shipping today. 

I'm curious about a few of your decisions and I'd love if you'd humor me with some insight. I was going to send this as an email on the website  but then I found this subreddit and made an account just because I hope other people are just as curious as I am. 


 I was going to try to organize some of these questions by category with a little explanation, but it got difficult to still make sense , So instead I'm just going to shoot a bunch of questions and hope for any answer.  



When do you realize you were going to design a waterpipe? 


From original concept to the first consumer ready product how many different designs did you go through? Especially with the computational fluid dynamics and designing the diffusion system.  Was there always a front runner design that preformed better that you were trying to perfect or was it just pure trial and error? 


I believe precision in manufacturing was the motivation for going with acetal in the base , but I'm curious though why not a glass tube? Was the motivation to go for durability in the whole piece after the base and other parts were made practically bullet proof?


Did you guys consider looking for the best way to create a piece out of glass using engineering ? This question is my big one and one that has been eating away at me for a while. I love seeing what glassblowers can do with new types of diffusion and new percolator designs. I always wonder but can never find any sort of documentation on what makes one diffusion method better then others or even the differences between the many different types of percolators.This has always made me wonder if there is any rhyme or reason beyond aesthetics in typical glass pieces and the types of percolators they have.



Final question: You guys need an intern this summer?  
  

P.S. I'll edit this with a review once mine comes in the mail. I can't decide if I'm more excited to disassemble it then reassemble it or to actually use it.   "

Hvordan å beskytte små bedrifter mot en Cyber-angrep cruse associates tips and reviews

Seattle hacker kjørte en svart Mercedes. Han eide en Rolex. Han likte å hyppig en sentrum vinbar. Mens det er lett å tenke på cyber kriminelle som ansiktsløs, digital lommetyver i fjerntliggende land, realiteten er at er de blant oss. I ett beryktet tilfelle kompromittert en banditt og hans gjeng cyber crooks minst 53 Seattle-området-små og mellomstore bedrifter mellom 2008 og 2010, stjele nok data til å forårsake $3 millioner i erstatning til selskapene, sine ansatte og deres kunder.
""Dette var ikke typen kriminalitet som vi forventet,"" sa tech selskap ansatt Alec Fishburne på en pressekonferanse (der Seattle ofrene avtalt å bli identifisert, men spurte at deres bedrifter være anonym). Gjengen hacket Fishburne firmaet fra en annen kontor i høyblokk. Han ble klar over brudd etter å merke noen uvanlige finansielle transaksjoner. ""Det var svært urovekkende for en liten bedrift... å lure på om det var noen interne misligheter eller underslag skjer, sier han til pressen.
	
En annen Seattle selskapet ble hacket etter sin gamle bærbare PC var stjålet i en office-innbrudd; om en måned senere, var det overførte midler gjennom falske lønnskontoer. Et tredje offer hadde identiteten til nesten alle sine ansatte stjålet når hacker gjengen sprakk selskapets nettverkssikkerhet. ""Det er enraging, fordi du tror du har et system som er til å fungere,"" sa selskapets president. ""Disse gutta er virkelig smart og ambisiøse, og det er en tøff kombinasjon.""Bo Smart.

På KrebsonSecurity.com tidligere Washington Post reporter Brian Krebs Blogger om utviklingen i online kriminalitet, sikkerhetsoppdateringer og data brudd. Ikke Les dette før sengetid; det vil gi deg mareritt.

OnGuardOnline

OnGuardOnline.gov, en e-nyhetsbrev og nettside administrert av Federal Trade Commission, er en stor ressurs for å finne måter å bo trygt. OnGuard forklare konsepter i termer som er lett å forstå, og har informasjon som er skreddersydd for små bedrifter.

Au!

Designet for den gjennomsnittlige computer brukeren, denne SANS Institute e-nyhetsbrev (Registrer deg på sans.org) fokuserer på en trussel per utgave og gir folk bør gjøre for å beskytte seg. Det er en utmerket arbeidstaker bevissthet verktøy.

På minst at selskapet hadde en network security plan. Mange andre ikke. Ifølge en 2012 landsomfattende studie av små bedrifter av digital sikkerhet har fast Symantec og National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), 83 prosent av små bedrifter ingen formell cyber sikkerhetsplan, mens 69 prosent mangel selv en uformell. I mellomtiden, 71 prosent er avhengig av Internett for daglige operasjoner, men nesten halvparten tror data hacks er isolerte hendelser som ikke vil ha innvirkning på sin virksomhet.

De kunne ikke være mer feil. Ifølge Symantec/NCSA forskning fra 2011 - den siste år med tilgjengelige--cyber-angrep koster små og mellomstore bedrifter et gjennomsnitt på $188,242, og nesten to tredjedeler av utsatt selskaper blir tvunget ut av business innen seks måneder for å bli angrepet.

Det trenger ikke å være på denne måten. Det beste forsvaret mot nettkriminalitet gjør hackere svette for sine Kandahar. Ifølge en Verizon studie av data brudd i 2011 var mer enn 80 prosent av ofrene mål av opportunity - noe som betyr at de ikke beskytte sine Wi-Fi-systemer med passord og ellers hadde dårlig sikkerhet, hvis noen i det hele tatt. Så gjør deg selv en vanskelig mål og sikre bedriften med disse seks trinn.
Å kryptere dataene.

Enten det er banken ruting sifrene, kredittkortkontoer eller Ansattes personnummer, er denne typen lang-gestating selskapet holdt informasjon hva hackere bruker å stjele penger. – Når som helst du lagrer viktige data, når dataene er i hvile - noe som betyr at det ikke er som overføres over Internett liksom--du ønsker det kryptert, sier Steve Cullen, chief administrerende direktør av worldwide markedsføring SMB og.Cloud på Symantec, som setter ut Norton anti-virus programvare.

Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på SANS Institute, en Baltimore-basert garanti forskning og utdanning firmaet, anbefaler å slå på full-disk krypteringsverktøy som kommer som standard på de fleste aktuelle operativsystemer. (På Windows-baserte PCer, funksjonen kalles BitLocker, på Macs det kalles FileVault.) Aktivere funksjonen tar bare et få minutter; en gang på, det vil kryptere hver fil og programmet på stasjonen med ingen merkbar ytelse lag. Men det er en catch: krypteringen gjelder bare når brukerne er logget ut av datamaskinen. Det betyr at hackere kan fortsatt angripe gjennom virus og malware mens systemet kjører. Innstillingen datamaskiner automatisk logger etter 15 minutter uten bruk hjelper håndheve dette tiltaket.

Verste fall hvis du ikke følger disse prosedyrene? Du kryptere ikke stasjoner, men en djevelsk hacker gjør. Ved å bryte inn i nettverk og kryptere bedrifter data, har noen cyber kriminelle holdt selskaper gissel nesten, krevende en løsepenge i bytte for passordet.

Sikre maskinvaren.

Av Seattle-området-selskaper som ble hacket, hadde mer enn 40 sine fysiske lokaler som er brutt opp av innbruddstyver som tok elektronisk utstyr. I ett tilfelle nappet gjengen mer enn $300.000 i servere, bærbare datamaskiner, mobiltelefoner og andre elementer. Overvåkningskamera registrert dem ved hjelp av Håndkjerrer for å hale massevis av utstyr til en van firetimers tildelingsperioden.

Tyver som ikke er skremt av av sikkerhetsalarmer og bevegelsesdetektorer, gjør fysisk låse ned datamaskiner jobben sin tøffere. Få folk mate en kabel gjennom datamaskinens Kensington lås porten (små metall loopen funnet på de fleste bærbare og stasjonære enheter) å sikre den til deres pulten. Jada, de er relativt enkelt for en tyv å omgå, men den ekstra innsatsen kan spissen oddsen i din favør. ""Som litt tid er noe kriminelle vanligvis ikke ønsker å ta,"" sier Cullen. ""Tid er fienden for noen bryte inn i en fysiske lokaler.""

Gjøre nettverkslagring tryggere ved hjelp av Kensington-låser eller ansette mer robust løsninger, som rack-montering maskinvare og holde serveren dørene lukket og låst. Vancouver, Wash.-basert CRU-DataPort gjør flere servere som kan være sikret med låser, USB-sikkerhetsnøkler og selv isenkram-basert krypteringen, sikrer at hvis stasjoner er stjålet, vil de være ubrukelig til tyvene.

Det er også sporingsprogramvare - viktig hvis bedriften din drives av mobile bærbare i-feltet. Sporing firmaet Prey bruker en rekke metoder for å finne alt fra en mobiltelefon til en server, passord-sikring maskinen hvis den går mangler og selv knipser og sende bilder av tyven hvis den stjålne enheten har et webkamera. Lav per måned priser gjør små, skjulte programmet en må-Installer for alle enheter som kan få tilgang til data og selskapet bedriftsnettverk.

Låse nettverket.

Mange hacking ofrene er kompromittert via Wi-Fi-nettverk, gjennom en teknikk som kalles ""wardriving."" I biler utstyrt med kraftige antenner, hacker gjenger kjøre rundt byer, skanning for ulåst eller dårlig beskyttet nettverk. Når en sårbar Wi-Fi-aktiveringspunktet er funnet, er skurkene så god som i selskapets inngangsdøren, scouring maskiner på nettverket for passord og økonomiske data.

Det beste forsvaret mot utnyttelser som wardriving er å ha ingen trådløsnettverk i det hele tatt. Kablede nettverk, mens mindre allsidig, er sikrere, fordi brukere har tilgang til dem ved enten koble til fysisk utsalg eller hacking modemporter. Men hvis firmaet må ha et trådløst nettverk, kan du deaktivere funksjonen service set identifier (SSID) kringkasting på den trådløse ruteren. Dette skaper et usynlig eller skjulte nettverk, usynlig for casual Wi-Fi snoops og tilgjengelig bare for brukere med det nøyaktige nettverksnavnet. Små bedrifter som kafeer kan også gjøre dette - bare periodisk nettverkets endringsinformasjon og plassere en liten sign nær registrere deg med gjeldende nettverksnavn og passord.

Hvis du bruker Wi-Fi, kan du oppdatere det til den for nyeste krypteringen. Noen Seattle wardriving ofrene hadde aktivert Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), en enkelt sprakk algoritme som falt i unåde nesten 10 år siden, og tenkte nettverkene var sikker. WPA2, den gjeldende standarden, har en lengre krypteringsnøkkelen som er vanskeligere å bryte seg inn i. For å gjøre dataene enda sikrere, kan du opprette en tull passord med store bokstaver, tall og spesialtegn. Sier Cullen, ""De ville trenger en datamaskin jobber med det for en million år å knekke koden.""

Installere anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse.

Når wardrivers er vellykket i cracking et trådløst nettverk, kan de logge inn og infisere tilkoblede datamaskiner med skadelig programvare eller virus. Men det tar ikke en Wi-Fi-tilkobling for å plante denne programvaren; spam e-post og skadelige nettsteder Skyv den til datamaskiner hele tiden, og hvis innsatsen er vellykket, malware kan installere kode som kjører i bakgrunnen, fange tastetrykk og påloggingsinformasjonen og videresending det for hackere. Ifølge Verizons studie, malware ble brukt i nesten halvparten av data brudd i 2010, og var ansvarlig for nesten 80 prosent av poster stjålet.

""Det er sannsynligvis nr. 1 money-generere teknikken skurkene bruke,"" sier SANS Institute's Spitzner. ""Hver gang du besøker alle typer nettsted som krever et brukernavn og passord - Facebook, banken din, lønn, uansett - malware vil høste din informasjon og sende den til slemmingen,"" sier han. ""Skurken vil ta til høyre rundt, Logg inn som du og gjøre alle hans onde ting.""

De fleste malware installeres gjennom nettverket sikkerhet hacks, men å være årvåken om cyberkriminalitet er like mye om å forutse trusler som det er å forsvare mot dagens. E-phishing, etterligning og apps som tilgang til sosiale medier-kontoer er dukker opp med økende regularitet. Lasting anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse på maskiner - som går for mobile enheter samt-- og kjører det etter hver software installert kan bidra til å sikre disse truslene ikke ta. Også, holde programmer og maskinvare oppdatert--fra oppgraderer til nyere rutere og datamaskiner å umiddelbart installere nettleseren oppdaterer--blokker skadelig ormer som trives i eldre utstyr og utdatert programvare.

Utdanne dine ansatte.

Hvis en datamaskin på nettverket blir svekket--om inntrenging kom fra en intern fantasy-fotball på e-post eller via en skammelige Facebook-app som administrator HR klikket på lunsj - er hele operasjonen i faresonen. ""Du ikke skal være eneste årvåken om å beskytte din og din kundenes opplysninger,"" sier Symantecs Cullen. ""Ansatte skal være på utkikk, og du som en small-business eier bør være der for å gi dem noen retningslinjer.""

Beholde ansatte informert om trusler gjennom kort e-post eller på periodiske møter ledet av IT-ekspert. Det første trinnet, er imidlertid å skrive ut en formell company Internett policy, innstillingen akseptabel og forbudt nettbaserte aktiviteter for ansatte, en øvelse som en distressingly liten 10 prosent av selskapene følger, i henhold til Symantec/NCSA. For eksempel forhindre ansatte fra åpne e-postvedlegg eller klikke på koblinger som ikke hører til Selskapets forretning. Eller begrense personlig e-posttilgang til personlig smartphones via den ansattes trådløs forbindelse, ikke selskapet Wi-Fi.

Leie sikkerhet.

Verve ekspert utenfor kan forbedre dine sjanser til å avlede et angrep. Selv om det kan virke counterintuitive, kan små bedrifter begrense sin eksponering til cyber kriminelle ved å signere på med Internett-basert datasikkerhet leverandører--spesielt som kvaliteten på skybaserte forretningstjenester utvikler seg. ""De kan avlaste mange av byrdene som en liten bedrift, ærlig, ikke vil håndtere,"" sier Cullen, som drev sitt eget selskap før han begynte i Symantec. ""Jeg vet det var ikke noe jeg ønsket å bruke to minutter tenker.""

Men gjør leksene dine: lese leverandørens vilkår og betingelser for å avgjøre hvem som er faktisk er ansvarlig for å beskytte dine data. For eksempel, med online kredittkort-prosessorer, kontroller at de overholder betaling kortet industrien Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) krav; ellers, du kunne være på kroken for kundenes skader hvis du få hacket.

På ekstreme slutten, kan du flytte ansvar for teknologiinfrastrukturen til en administrert tjenesteleverandør (MSP) som vil opprettholde og sikre selskapets systemer eksternt. MSP vil være ansvarlig for sikkerhetskopiering av filer på sine servere, oppdatere brannmurer, kryptere data og gjør at alt er knirkefritt.

Og når ting går dårlig, det vil ta hit for skader.

Tilbake i Seattle, politiet endelig nab gruppen bak utslett av cyber tyverier. Og de gjorde det gjennom gammeldags detektivarbeid. Ett medlem av gjengen ble fanget ved hjelp av en stjålet gavekort, løftet under en office-innbrudd. Han ble arrestert på en vinbar og førte politiet til en antenne montert Mercedes, og til slutt til hans to medskyldige. Dømt sist sommer, tre nå betjener et kombinert 22 år i fengsel, og vil måtte betale oppreisning til ofrene.

""Utover svindel og fysisk skade, er det kostnader uten en prislapp: brudd på følelse av sikkerhet for sine kunder, ansatte og eiere,"" bemerket rettsforfølge U.S. advokat Jenny Durkan. Ikke å nevne drømmene om de mange gründere som ble satt ut av business.

Du har blitt hacket. Nå hva?

Advarselen tegn er klart: Hvis du ser en stor pengeoverføring skal en konto i Russland eller et annet sted der du ikke har virksomhet (i ett Seattle tilfelle, var det North Dakota), ta kontakt med banken din umiddelbart. ""Jo tidligere du identifisere en hendelse, jo mer sannsynlig vil du få tilbake pengene dine eller minimere skaden,"" sier Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på Baltimore's SANS Institute.

Hvis selskapets datamaskiner er stjålet eller tuklet med, kan du ringe det lokale politiet. De kanskje vet om lignende hendelser, kan undersøke dypere og vil kontakte aktuelle myndigheter, inkludert FBI og Secret Service, som opprettholder en electronic kriminalitet task force. Men det viktigste, ved første tegn på alle forstyrrelse, endre din passord og hold et øye med din saldoer, fra business midler til ansatte og personlige kontoer.

19oup2,1,2013-03-05,Fuck you and your nice vacation...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19oup2/fuck_you_and_your_nice_vacation/,"Look, man. You're my best friend...so much so that in my sad life, I'm creepily dependent on you. I don't hang out with people from school...I work with a bunch of people 20-30 years my senior, and my siblings all have friends and girlfriends they want to spend their time with.

I get it. You have a life. I, unfortunately, don't. Between work, school, an internship, a committee, grad requirements, social anxiety disorder, and relapsing depression, I can't seem to find time, energy, and enthusiasm for a life.

So when you say in January ""we should go to Cozumel for your last spring break!"" I got my hopes up. I did. I was genuinely excited for the first time in a while. And when you came to me two weeks later and said ""there's no way I can get a whole week off for work,"" I understood.

And time goes by. And in that time, I've covered bills for you, loaned you my car for the 2 hour drives to see your girlfriend because you ""couldn't afford the gas in your car."" I've bought you food, comforted you when you were depressed, supported you when you tried to quit smoking, didn't judge you when you started up again. I've tried to be a good friend.

Then we get to last week. Last week when you told me that ""everything sounds gay coming from [my] cock-sucking mouth."" I know, I know. You were joking. But considering that the last person who made some homophobic comment to me did it with a broken bottle in my face, while you were watching, I'd have though that you would have some sense of courtesy and avoid this bullshit.

And now, tonight. Tonight you cut me off in the middle of a story to tell me about your day, when you convinced your boss to give you a week off so you could go to Cozumel. In May. With your girlfriend.

This isn't about the fact that I just paid more bills for you. This isn't about the $60 I gave you so you could schlep out to the boonies to see your girl. This isn't even about the fact that you are taking the same girl on vacation that I have spent hours listening to you complain about, after her mind games, and her habit of talking to you about her past fuck buddies, or the fact that you think she thinks your ugly. 

This is about the fact that I will be spending my last spring break working in the Midwest to undoubtedly buy you more shit, and in a few months, while I'm cramming for a test so I can get a job in a field I hate, you'll be laying in the sun next to ""the girl of your dreams.""

Sad thing is, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me. I don't even know why, but when I think about you and your fucking vacation, I hate myself a little bit more.

19orl0,11,2013-03-04,It's not too late to join the (Send it In) Jerome pool and pick the winners of all 30 conference tourneys!,tummydoc2000,CollegeBasketball,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/19orl0/its_not_too_late_to_join_the_send_it_in_jerome/,"This pool is a big deal, over 200 people enter including some big name national sportswriters and stuff. It's all for fun and glory. For the details and how to enter, I'll copy you the email sent out by the coordinator:

Well, here we go again. It’s time to celebrate college basketball’s craziest stretch with the planet’s zaniest picks contest. For the 12th consecutive year (except the one we skipped), The Jerome is ready to take over your life.

What started as three guys picking games for beer money has grown to regularly include more than 200 folks. We've gone from the TAAC to Twitter, from Carmelo to Oladipo. Lifers could have picked TCU to win the WAC, Conference USA, the Mountain West, and now the Big XII.
Somehow, Rick Barnes has coached Texas this entire time.
 
How does this work? Glad you asked. The object of The Jerome is to select winners in 30 of the Division I men's college basketball conference tournaments contested between March 5 and March 17, 2013. You pick one team per league and earn points based on how far your squad advances. Again, please select ONE team for each league.
If your team reaches its tournament final, you earn two points. If it wins the tourney, you win three more points, for a total of five. There’s a chance for bonuses, too. Any selected winner that 1.) Entered its tourney seeded third or lower, AND 2.) Plays no more than two conference tourney games on its home court, gets you an extra two points. In the case of conferences that seed by division finish, all teams except the No. 1 seeds in each division will be eligible for the bonus. So, you can earn a maximum of seven points in some of the tournaments. Bonus points do not apply for teams that make the finals and lose.
Now, the hard part, especially for you deadline types:

By Tuesday, March 5 at 6 p.m. (EST), we need your selections for the America East, Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big South, Colonial Athletic, Horizon, Metro Atlantic, Missouri Valley, Northeast, Ohio Valley, Patriot, Southern, Summit, Sun Belt and West Coast.
 
Our Jerome interns have created an upgraded form to make your first-batch selections. You can access said form here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hqQaerckavIX5zzKFJ7pU4teTpfIDDwXvzGNkEChziA/viewform

Questions about or problems with the form can be addressed by writing to this e-mail address or tweeting at the interns (@SendIt_Interns).
 
By Monday, Mar. 11 at 6 p.m. (EST), I'll need picks for the remaining 15 leagues -- Atlantic Coast, Atlantic 10, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Big West, Conference USA, Mid-American, Mid-Eastern Athletic, Mountain West, Pac-12, Southeastern, Southland, Southwestern Athletic, and Western Athletic.

With the second batch of picks, we also need you to send us tiebreakers. Here’s what we need for that:
Tiebreaker No. 1: Total number of conference tourney wins for the following teams — Oklahoma, Michigan, Notre Dame, Miami, Fla.
Tiebreaker No. 2: Total number of conference tourney wins for the following teams — Tennessee, Arizona State, Colorado State, LaSalle
Tiebreaker No. 3: The leading individual scorer (most total points) in the 15 conference tournaments in the second batch of picks.
Please send one name, not one name per conference.
 
We will send another form soon for the second batch of picks and the tiebreakers.
Please send all questions and selections to me, Dave Curtis, at this e-mail address (senditinjerome@gmail.com). You can also get me on Twitter at @TheJeromeXII. All decisions I make in regards to any matters Jerome are final.
If you’re going to join us, please follow us on Twitter, as we will distribute most information through that medium.
Best of luck to all.

19ojlw,44,2013-03-04,Discussion on the Growing Need for a Masters Degree in Accounting,potatoriot,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/19ojlw/discussion_on_the_growing_need_for_a_masters/,"This is a long read, but for those of you currently in school, I feel this issue needs to be discussed with the extent of advice given here about how to achieve the 150 hours. As some of you know, I currently work in public accounting with a regional firm, but I also am very active with recruiting in the southeast. I work closely with recruiters from all of the Big 4, as well as the national and regional firms in my area. Being CPA eligible and becoming a CPA is beginning to no longer be enough anymore.

The consensus I have come to for my region (population over 5 million) is that some of the Big 4 are now starting to require Master degrees of an MTx/MPA/MAcc/IT Audit/Forensic Accounting for entry level positions in the Audit and Tax practices, while others are favoring those with these degrees. This is just starting to develop, however with the growing number of higher education students, Bachelor degrees are starting to lose their value and I have no doubt this situation will continue to rise. With the economy being weak the last several years, more students have been targeting degrees that give them financial security, which has created an influx in Accounting majors, making the field much more competitive.

That being said, with more Accounting students for the firms to pick from, they are able to increase their hiring standards. The Big 4 have begun to be able to set their standards of only accepting Graduate students for full-time positions and offering internships only to those intending to pursue Masters degrees while still being able to meet their hiring quotas.

**Here's the Pros and Cons I see with going the route of a Masters degree:**

***Pros***

* Allows for the highest level of recruitment opportunities. Firms target graduate programs harder than anywhere else and are focusing on hiring students with more education.

* Creates expert knowledge in your field, allowing you to jump-start your career with a higher knowledge base.

* MPA/MAcc Students - Prepares you for the CPA exam which greatly reduces study time necessary to pass each part.

* Increases promotion ability and demand for a higher salary, ends up paying for itself and more over time.

* Distinguishes your name, increasing your credibility and ability to promote yourself to employers and clients (You're not just John Doe, CPA...you're John Doe, CPA, MTx). Clients will feel extra secure as well as feeling they are receiving more value knowing your advanced education accomplishments.

* Networking opportunities - You will meet other highly devoted individuals in similar situations, work hard together through the program, and create long lasting professional connections in the field that can benefit you in the future.

***Cons***

* The cost.

There is a significant number of benefits towards doing a Masters program, and the only real factor I see against it is the cost. However, most people don't seem to realize that there are ways to fight the cost of Graduate school. If you are determined to be active on campus, particularly in the Accounting program, you can work your way into becoming a GRA or GA and have tuition waived by the school. There are tons of scholarships out there as well that most people don't bother applying for. You wouldn't believe what the scholarship award rates are due to students not bothering to apply. Some scholarships are awarded to as many as 40-50% of those that apply.

So, those of you who are currently undergraduate students, this is something to take into consideration. Getting a double major or taking community college courses to hit the 150 might seem beneficial now, but you need to consider what is the appropriate investment for the long-term. Do you want to take that avenue to reach 150 hours and later realize you want to go back for your Masters degree anyways? With the costs of education continuing to rise, this is something that requires serious thought. In decades past, education wasn't very expensive and it wasn't a big deal for a professional in the field for 10-15 years to decide they want to get their Masters. Today, it's a serious investment and something you may not be able to afford later in your career.

For those of you in the public accounting field and active with recruiting, I'd like to hear your input for your regions as well. I think mainly Big 4 are the only ones actually restricting positions to Graduate students, but I have noticed many firms are prioritizing their hiring towards Graduate Students over the Undergraduates with 150 hours."

19siqs,7,2013-03-06,I (21M) can't stop thinking about relationship with girl(20F) who broke my heart,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19siqs/i_21m_cant_stop_thinking_about_relationship_with/,"Reddit – I need your advice and wisdom. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my story.

My freshman year of university, I became best friends with a girl. Initially I wasn’t attracted to her and viewed her only as a best friend (we shared a lot in common and laughed often together), but I realized I was falling for her at the end of freshman year, and asked her out. It was a powerful, intimate relationship from the beginning, as we knew each other well and were comfortable with each other from being best friends for a year.

Fast-forward to sophomore year. We dated throughout sophomore year, and although the new-relationship thrill had faded a bit, it was still a great relationship filled with trust, love, respect. To put it simply, we were in love. However, I would be dishonest without mentioning the fact that towards the end of the year, a big part of me wanted to experience single life and its freedom, and sex with other girls. Perhaps a case of the grass being greener on the other side? You decide.

At the end of sophomore year, another summer was approaching, and while I was staying at the university taking classes, she was doing an internship in North Carolina where she knew literally no one. We wouldn’t be able to visit each other, but we planned to Skype/call and she had told me she wanted to stay together over the summer.

When she actually got to North Carolina for the internship in late May, she was miserable. She knew no one and called me crying on the phone. I comforted her, told her everything was going to be OK and to try and make new friends. Over the next few weeks, she grew increasingly distant towards me, responding to my texts/calls less frequently, not saying I love you back, stuff like that.

 One day, just a few weeks after her internship had started (early June), she called me and told me that she had cheated on me. I was taken aback, hurt, and broke up with her over the phone. She made no attempt to salvage the relationship, texted me saying that it was too hard to be apart, wanted to keep in touch over the summer, and that we could “see where we were at in the fall”. I told her that we wouldn’t be keeping in touch over the summer, as I was hurt, confused and trying to sort things out. She ended up dating someone she met in North Carolina less than two months later (I’m assuming the guy she cheated on me with) – I checked her Facebook one day and it was right there – posts from her new boyfriend, etc…When I found them, I became physically ill for a day. To put it bluntly, it was a hell of a summer.

She didn’t contact me until the end of the summer, when she got back home from North Carolina. I spoke to her for the first time since that phone call at the beginning of the summer – I asked her what happened. She said the only person she connected to was a guy there. I asked if she was still dating the guy, she said yes. We got off the phone. She tried calling me a bunch in the weeks afterwards, before school was starting. I didn’t respond to any of them – I had made up my mind that I was moving on.

We got back to school at the beginning of this year. She had broken up with her boyfriend and wanted to get back together with me. I said absolutely not. She wanted to be friends, platonic, anything. I said no to that too. I wanted no contact. It was hard for her to accept that.

We haven’t talked for a while now. She sent me a letter last semester detailing how much increasingly sad she has become without me, handled everything badly, and how (basically) she was still in love with me. It was the good side of her – humble, honest, and forthcoming. It was a powerful letter, and seemed like it was truly written from the heart.

The pain and anger I felt during the summer has subsided, and I am tempted to see if there is a future with us - if she really has changed. I haven’t been able to find the connection with another girl since.

What do I do Reddit? I’ve hooked up with girls at college since then. I’ve had some time being single. I think about her every day (we dated for a year and its been eight months since the breakup) and even though we don’t talk, part of me wishes that we could start up a relationship again, and I’m fairly certain that she does too (although I don’t know for sure – all I have is that letter written months ago). How do I find out if she has changed or not? I can’t seem to stop thinking about her.

TL;DR: Girl treated me badly, and I can’t stop thinking about the good stuff, and whether we have a future together.

Edit: I am proud of the way I have handled everything so far (i.e. not talking to her during the summer, not getting back together with her/being friends, etc...). I have my head held high for that. But I feel ashamed that I feel as though I'm still in love with her and don't know what to do about it..."
19shpi,12,2013-03-06,student who needs some help and advice,damage_noted,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/19shpi/student_who_needs_some_help_and_advice/,"Lately I've been making up any excuse to go to class, or to talk to people I meet on the street.  I've lied to teachers; I've said I was sick, had an interview, or had to drive a friend to the hospital.  But really, I've just been staying inside and hating myself.  I feel almost as if I'm forced to lie, and I feel like I can't face them, or my peers, or class.  Just the thought of class seems to tire me out.

Today, a very nice TA stopped me on the street and asked me what I was up to.  Without smiling, I said I had an interview and walked off.

I know I've been acting like an unethical twat.  I've been beating myself up over these encounters.  At the same time I am overcome with panic and stress at having to deal with socializing with people while dealing with schoolwork.  I am going to a well-known university for my electrical engineering degree, and I have a heavy course load, as well as a job as a research assistant.  I also have a research project I have not started.  

I've yet to find time to apply to internships and jobs over this summer.  This is pretty important because my resume isn't very good, in part because of my depression in college.  My depression now is much more manageable than it used to be, although recently it feels like I've been walking on the edge.

Mostly I'm overcome with panic at all the stuff that is due, and the panic contributes heavily to my procrastination habits as well as making me an antisocial jerk.  I don't really know what to do, because my professors probably think I'm just a jackass, and I'm wracked with guilt and shame and feel like I can't face them.

TLDR; I'm a university student who has trouble coping with depression, and I'm alienating people around me because of my inability to cope with the stress of my responsibilities, which are making me depressed.  I am asking for coping methods and some advice.

I might seem like a jerk.  I know I've been acting like one.

Apologies if this post seems disjointed, writing's never been my strong suit.

*EDIT*
Some depression history: Tried to off myself a few times, have been struggling with depression ever since I can remember.
I'm currently seeing a therapist.  I'm seeing a psychiatrist soon for medications."

19s5hu,1,2013-03-06,Sever depression when applying for jobs.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/19s5hu/sever_depression_when_applying_for_jobs/,"I don't know if this is the right place to turn to or not, but I love this subreddit more than any other, so I thought I'd turn here first.

I'm a musician and freelance audio engineer. I went to school for audio engineering and it's landed me just about $10k in debt from loans. I have been putting a deferment on these loans for nearly 2 years now. As you know, this is some stressful shit.

I left to go to school in December of 2009, which is also the same month I quit my job. I had this job from 2004 to 2009, and was part time. I cleaned hospital equipment and filed papers. I hated the fuck out of it. I was also working with my mom.

Ever since I finished there to go to school, even after completing school, I haven't had a steady job.

In 2009 I moved from AL to AZ for this. Being lucky enough that my mom cosigned the major loan for me. I got $80 every 2 weeks for food and gas. I was usually behind on my rent but luckily, my roommate was a good friend, so he helped until I could pay him back.

During the time of living in AZ, I applied for roughly 250-300 jobs. I only had one interview at Pizza Hut, and I didn't get the job because my car wasn't up for the task of delivery.

Finally, finished up school 8 months later and moved out to Nashville, TN. Began interning at a studio, which closed down a month later. After that began interning at another studio soon after.

During my time in Nashville, my wallet got stolen (right out of our house) I wrecked my car, was living off $40 every 2 weeks, and about 4 months in, couldn't afford rent. Again, my roommates were cool enough to let me stay for free.

During my stay here, I was extremely focused on my internship. I didn't want to lose any time working there, because of the random off chance that I could get a job there. So, I wasn't looking for work. Eventually, my roommates had a talk with me, and said I need to find a job. So, I started applying again. I probably put in 150 applications in about 2 weeks. Got a call from Walmart a week later, and started working as a cart pusher.

I only worked there for a month and a half and quit. Still a huge regret. The only reason that I quit is that, it was interfering with my off chance of being employed at a major studio. I obviously didn't get the job at the studio. Since I didn't, I had to move back in with my parents.

And here I am, ever since May 2011.

I had one job in 2012 that I quit (was about to get fired). It was for hotel maintenance. The person I was replacing didn't like me and was constantly treating me like a 5 year old because he'd been doing this work for 30 years and I had barely any experience.

Now, after all this, I need a job. Really, I just need money, but that shit doesn't just fall out of nowhere. I'm on oDesk, but the audio work is so scarce, that it's barely enough to pay my phone bill.

Every time I start to look for jobs, I get hit with severe depression and suicidal thoughts just roll in. I don't care about money. I just don't. I guess it's because I rarely have it, or it's just an excuse to try to not make any. But I don't give a fuck about it. And that's a bad attitude for anyone living in this culture.

I apologize if I sound like a whiny bitch (I'm sure I do). I just don't know what to do about this situation."
19rzm1,4,2013-03-06,"I stopped smoking today, and I'd like to share my thoughts with y'all. ",[deleted],stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/19rzm1/i_stopped_smoking_today_and_id_like_to_share_my/,"So yeah, smoking. Yeah... 

To be honest, I'm not sure why I picked up smoking again. It's just something that sort of happened. I know why I started in the first place though, and it's pretty lame in retrospect. I worked for a company that cleared out houses and apartments that were repossessed, and everybody smoked there. I sporadically smoked weed at the time, and I picked up smoking when I noticed that everybody else got to take short breaks so they could smoke. It's not like I was not allowed to take a break, but I had nothing to do when they did. Everyone had ciggies on them, so my gateway was there, so to speak. I quit when it got too expensive, started again when I got stressed at my internship (I'm a student teacher, and my students were the devil incarnate), then quit because it got too expensive. I'd quit for about 4 months before I picked it up again. 

The reason I picked it up the last time was because I was stressed out and I felt that smoking would relieve some stress. My dad just had a heart attack and I had relationship troubles, so the smoke seemed like a good choice. It probably was an act of defiance too, because my girlfriend HATED smokers. I stopped smoking weed for her (I haven't smoked weed in a long while though, and I haven't felt like picking it up again), but this seemed like something I could do to sort of walk that edge. I threw away the pack after smoking two cigarettes, because I didn't want her to find out. When she broke up with me two months later, I started smoking sporadically. I made it a point to only buy one pack a month, just so I wouldn't get addicted again. 

We're about 6 months later now, and I've decided I wanted to quit. Today. I smoked my last few cigarettes during my break, threw out my lighter and I've committed to not smoke ever again. I've never felt embarrassed about smoking, or at least I thought so, until I bought my last pack this Monday. My commitment to lasting a month on a pack was thrown out the window a long time ago, and I could barely last a week on a pack. The only reason I didn't smoke more was because I didn't want people to find out. I never smoked around the house because I didn't want my family to find out, and I didn't smoke around my friends because I made this big point of quitting the last time and I didn't want them finding out. I hated it. 

The breaking point was reached this Monday. I was listening to a song on the radio about relapsing, and I felt so ashamed of myself. I was dedicated to quitting, but I wasn't strong enough to pull through then. I just really wanted to quit doing this. So this morning I was walking to work with a colleague who also smokes, and I light up my second cigarette. He notices and says ""Geez, I never knew you were a chain smoker."" and that's where I broke. I had become a chain smoker. I just felt so thoroughly and utterly fucking embarrassed that I made a vow I'd quit. For good this time. 

So I smoked up my last ciggies during break, threw out my lighter and here I am. I'm hoping that spewing the innards of my brain will help with me quitting, because I don't want to be that guy. I don't want to hide and I don't want to be stamped a chain smoker. My body likes the nicotine, but my heart can't stand the embarrassment. 

My lowest point is probably something that happened a few months back. I was visiting a friend who was trying to stop smoking, and I offered her a cigarette saying ""You don't have to quit cold turkey"". She's back to two packs a week now. I'm disgusted just thinking back to it. 

So yeah, here I am. I'd say that I'm trying to be a new me, but I'm actually just trying to go back to my old me. Here's to not puffing ash. 

Sorry for the wall of text.      "

It end when i turn 30. Had to drop out of college because of suicide attempt after a first hospitalization after a breakdown  following surgery, major anorexic eating habits leading to dramatic weight loss. 

I just hate my life. I feel like i'm a slave to my family in some aspects. I'm locked in my room. No car to drive since I was hit by a drunk driver in one car and than the electrical system in the replacement went out and crashed into the back of another. I hate my life I hate it. I just am so tired. 

It just seems that no matter how much I do or try or what ever it is never enough to get out of my hell. Fate just keeps throwing more and more and more and more and more and more at me and I just want it all to stop.

I just need a job that uses my talents and skill sets but no one will hire me. I cant even get an unpaid internship. I'm sick of doing work for free and trying to use community events i help with to make some sort of connections to find a job. I'm sick of all of this crap. 

I have helped organize a bunch of TEDx Talks that brought people from all over the world. I have done video production from multiple trade shows for my own portfolio of stuff. I can't even get anyone to give me a fucking in to a paid git anywhere. I'm a IT media professional and i can get any jobs anywhere No matter what i get the phrase ""We just don't think you will fit in here"" WHat the fuck is that supposed to mean.

Sorry i'm having a mini rant break down just thinking about all of this. How do you get out of a hell that you can't even afford to get out of. When you ask for help from family they say you got to do it your self and will keep paying for you to be in the hell you are in with out helping you really.

 The only reason I ask is because I know TSA gets a lot of shit but I thought it would look nice if I were to be hired by a government agency. Thanks"

Dont have a car anymore so have to ride a bike to school/internship/volunteer and have had at least 5 tires pops in this 2 month span, and I know that some of them are my fault, but others just seemed to be because of bad luck or cheap tubes. Been stressed out with school because luckily I had all my midterms on the same exact day this quarter, so I now have been playing catch up. I am struggling to keep up with my internship and volunteer hours at the hospital because of the amount of time it takes to commute by bike/bus, and to top it all off i applied to graduate school and got rejected.

Tell me about your bad stretches and how you got out of them.

19r26r,30,2013-03-05,I just took out some piercings to make myself employable in my field and it feels crappy. ,dr_vonSexmachine,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/19r26r/i_just_took_out_some_piercings_to_make_myself/,"This is a wall of text, but I need to rant a bit :/

I am a recent graduate in engineering. Well, I graduated last spring, went to grad school and then dropped out because funding fell through and I couldn't afford it. But that's another story. 

I've been looking for work in my field. I've participated in some prestigious projects, been recognized for them and really, really love my field. I've had internships in both industry and the government, and have done lab research. I have work experience outside of my field (inlcuding customer service) and have extensive volunteer work in my industry and outside of that too. But I feel like none of that matters because of my appearance. 

Yes, it's male dominated but I fear that the way people treat me isn't  because I'm female, but because I have a few rather 'extreme' facial piercings. That is, both my ears are stretched to 1"" and each nostril to 8ga, or about 3.3 mm. I wear plain black jewelry in them, and I feel that they are very understated and elegant. 

After graduation, I cleaned up: I learned to apply makeup, dress like an adult and even got my first professional hair cut. I had convinced myself that these, plus my impressive resume and passion would make people over look the piercings. 

I finally admitted to myself that they won't. This past fall, I went to a conference in the southern US (I'm Canadian) and they didn't really even bother to try and hold back the staring and contempt. The people who make decisions still aren't going to want to take a chance on a new hire who has gone out of her way to make herself look physically different in a way that isn't considered professional. 

So, I took out my nose rings today. I know it's the right decision. I just feel like I'm ""selling out"" a bit and betraying myself. 

Have any of you ladies had to make tough choices about how you present yourself to further your careers? I'd love to feel like I'm not alone here :)

**TL;DR: Took out my nostril piercings and feel like a sell out.**

MERYL: I just found out I’m six months pregnant.

AMIR: Oh?

MERYL: That’s too late to terminate. My parents hate my boyfriend and they think I’m still a virgin. They’re gonna disown me. I dunno what to do.

Meryl starts to cry.

AMIR: Don't cry, come on, don’t cry. It's just that you're so ugly when you cry. It's true. You look ugly when you cry, I should say.

19up5m,0,2013-03-07,An Open Letter to Louis C.K. From a Twenty-Something,[deleted],StandUpComedy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/19up5m/an_open_letter_to_louis_ck_from_a_twentysomething/,"An Open Letter to Louis C.K. From a Twenty Something

Dear Louie,

First of all, sir, fuck you a little bit. And I mean that in a way like if we were friends having a beer, where it's mutually understood and allowable to call each other on our shit. Since we are not friends, I fear this will be read as desperate attention grabbing hate mail, but I strongly insist the intention of this letter is to offer constructive feedback from a perspective you no longer empathize with.

On an appearance with Jay Leno, you set up a dialogue, about the unhelpful generation of twenty year olds, stating that truthfully you hold a prejudice towards us. Surely you remember this not only from that “conversation” but as a featured bit in your 2010/2011 standup act. In this particular telling of the joke you say, “You're twenty, you've done nothing. You've just been sucking up resources, and just been taking food and love and education and ipods and just taking it and judging it.” I laughed at this when I saw it because to a point it's true, agreeing that some people my age are spoiled pieces of shit. But then I thought about it, and honestly it's kind of bullshit to be sitting where you are sitting saying that twenty year olds shouldn't complain.

Because from where we are sitting, the future for twenty year old's looks kind of shitty. And frankly it is more justifiably me who should be prejudiced against you. The economy is fucked because of people older than me were greedy as fuck. Not just bankers on wall street but every fucking person who borrowed more than they could pay back so they could have an extra jet ski. The fallout from that is a fucked up job market where people older than me aren't willing to hire and aren't willing to retire, i.e. Jay Leno. The government is fucked. Period. And it's run by old white rich men who sit around incessantly bickering like, well, twenty year olds. They don't give a shit about me, these are men who act only in the service to their own wealth and power. Men who basically enslave my peers to do their legwork free of charge, and call it an internship. And every time a fiscal deadline approaches congress, they raise the debt limit and push off their obligation to pay it off further into the future that they won't be around for. My generation isn't valued because our future isn't valued. We aren't represented because how could we be, we're only twenty.

You saying what you are saying only adds fuel to the flame. Saying we shouldn't be angry is demeaning, it's the boot pushing our face further into the pile of shit you took. My generation should be mad. Because when some fat fuck (not necessarily you, but not necessarily not you) comes into our Starbucks in the middle of the day with no sensitivity or patience to our having a shitty job, why should we be the bigger man? You are the older one. Our future is being gambled away, and excuse me for saying it, but fuck you a little bit for saying we shouldn't complain.

The next line is when I stopped laughing and got thinking, when you said, “If you are twenty you have definitely never done a thing for anybody.” Obviously this is meant to be a punchy bold statement for the sake of comedy. But come on, man. Are you joking when you say your are serious or do I really have to tell you the things me and my peers have done? Because when you insist that you actually think this way, in comedy we take it as you being “real” and not an act.

Ok, then. So I have this friend who went abroad during college, which you also mocked, and he literally designed and built a freshwater collection system in Rwanda with an engineering team. They used money they raised, and he personally wound up spending a lot of his own money going there separately from the program and taking a semester off of school to live there for three months. He did this to learn specifically how their culture works so that they could design the best possible system. Because as you have noted, some people think they are helping but once they leave it goes back to the way it was. Conscious of this, he did something to make sure that wouldn't happen, to actually affect positive change in people's lives. I'm sorry sir, but fuck you a little bit.

Another one of my good friends majored in psychology, and before she graduated (which she still did) she founded an online company that fosters anonymous online help for peers suffering from any kind of mental stress. How it works is you submit a written statement of whats going on and how you are feeling and she finds someone who has suffered from the same kind of problem who will then email back advice within twenty four hours. Using technology she cleverly came up with a welcoming and safe system for people to open up when they would have been otherwise too afraid to. Her nonprofit company is now built into student resource programs on many major college campuses and with the help of another friend of ours she has a beautifully designed website. The company she built has literally prevented numerable suicides from happening. Fuck you a little bit.

The things I have accomplished pale in comparison to what many of my friends are up to. I'm merely a seasonal gardener. I love to read and write. I have a degree in Biology, and I enjoy working outdoors. You know what I do in the winters? I shovel snow in fucking Wisconsin. Consider that for a moment. I'm one of the youngest people at my job and complain the least. If anything people get more bitter with age because things haven't changed for them. I'm positive and hopeful for the future because I know people like my two friends I have mentioned are out there. I'm hopeful, perhaps ignorantly so, but fuck you for thinking that. I'm just some dude in Wisconsin, and if I have friends like this, you don't think there are people like that everywhere?

I could blame the job market for the limited work I am able to find. That would be totally reasonable. I could resent all the rich old white men in congress who act in consistent disregard for my future, with only their personal wealth and power in mind. That would also be reasonable. But I can't blame older people in general, that would be ignorant and childish to take issue with an entire group of people. It's too easy. Just like saying twenty year olds have no value, which again, fuck you a little bit for saying.

Everybody is a product of their upbringing. I think you get that, and I suspect being a father scares you with how to raise your girls. It should. Obviously you are aware that your kids are privileged and your fear is that they will turn out like the caricature you assume we are all like. And I think your bit is nothing but a reflection of that fear which has turned into real resentment. 

But might I also suggest that you consider the implications of this prejudice not just morally but financially. Your decision to cast aside my age group seems especially ill-conceived because we represent a major demographic that has gotten behind you in your recent climb into the national spotlight. We love you. We sell out your shows, we travel for you. We like how you think because you are honest and you don't give a shit. But at the same time we like you because you are reasonable and down to earth and generally kind in an otherwise hostile world. Older people think you are crass or too liberal. Seinfeld was the greatest sitcom of all time because the show was about real life situations. It reminds us of the humor in our everyday lives (because ultimately it's all about us right). Today a lot of people have picked up a scent that whatever fame does to people it did it to Jerry. In his latest broadcasting effort he is seen driving around priceless antique cars trying to pry esoteric conversations out of comics who still get what “real” is. Your audience is much smarter than you think, and we will detect you the minute you're a fraud. Be careful with us, because if we turn on you nobody spreads information faster.

To briefly conclude, obviously I know that you are a comic and it's supposed to be lighthearted. But there is something truthful and meaningful in comedy that is equally as powerful as the emotion we feel from drama. In that same bit you recognize the scale of the stage you have, and the importance of what you say—you said “It's a heavy responsibility. A lot of jobs you affect one person at a time, but I affect sometimes thousands of people.” Well, this is me taking you seriously. I truly enjoy your sense of humor which is why I felt compelled to stick up for my peers. Because I think we have potential.

My generation is going to have to be unified, more so than yours was. We can't be as greedy for material wealth or as negligent of environmental health or as insensitive to foreign cultures. The ramifications of the actions of the past are starting to be made present. We can't keep living in complete excess and we can't keep pushing off problems. My generation was born into this fucked up situation that we didn't create and a lot us are acting to undo the things we see as wrong through means both extremely creative and thoughtful.

Again, fuck you a little bit and regards. The next beer is on me.

19ujlx,1,2013-03-07,An open letter to Louis CK from a twenty-something,[deleted],StandUpComedy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/19ujlx/an_open_letter_to_louis_ck_from_a_twentysomething/,"An Open Letter to Louis C.K. From a Twenty Something

Dear Louie,

	First of all, sir, fuck you a little bit. And I mean that in a way like if we were friends having a beer, where it's mutually understood and allowable to call each other on our shit. Since we are not friends, I fear this will be read as desperate attention grabbing hate mail, but I strongly insist the intention of this letter is to offer constructive feedback from a perspective you can no longer empathize with.
	On an appearance with Jay Leno, you set up a dialogue, about the unhelpful generation of twenty year olds, stating that truthfully you hold a prejudice towards us. Surely you remember this not only from that “conversation” but as a featured bit in your 2010/2011 standup act. In this particular telling of the joke you say, “You're twenty, you've done nothing. You've just been sucking up resources, and just been taking food and love and education and ipods and just taking it and judging it.” I laughed at this when I saw it because to a point it's true, agreeing that some people my age are spoiled pieces of shit. But then I thought about it, and honestly it's kind of bullshit to be sitting where you are sitting saying that twenty year olds shouldn't complain.
	Because from where we are sitting, the future for twenty year old's looks kind of shitty. And frankly it is more justifiably me who should have prejudice against you. The economy is fucked because people older than me were greedy as fuck. Not just bankers on wall street but every fucking person who borrowed more than they could pay back so they could have an extra jet ski. The fallout from that is the job market which is fucked and now people older than me aren't willing to hire and aren't willing to retire, i.e. Jay Leno. The government is fucked. Period. And it's run by old white rich men who sit around incessantly bickering like, well, twenty year olds. They don't give a shit about me, these are men who act only in the service to their own wealth and power. Men who basically enslave all my peers to do their legwork free of charge, and call it an internship. And every time a fiscal deadline approaches congress, they raise the debt limit and push off their obligation to pay it off further into the future that they won't be around for. My generation isn't valued because our future isn't valued. We aren't represented because how could we be, we're only twenty.
	You saying what you are saying only adds fuel to the flame. Saying we shouldn't be angry is demeaning, it's the boot pushing our face further into the pile of shit you took. My generation should be mad. Because when some fat fuck comes into our Starbucks in the middle of the day with no sensitivity or patience to our having a shitty job, why should we be the bigger man? You are the older one. Our future is being gambled away, and excuse me for saying it, but fuck you a little bit for saying we shouldn't complain.
	The next line is when I stopped laughing and got thinking, when you said, “If you are twenty you have definitely never done a thing for anybody.” Obviously this is meant to be a punchy bold statement for the sake of comedy. But come on, man. Are you serious when you say your are serious or do I really have to tell you the things me and my peers have done? Because when you insist that you actually think this way, in comedy we take it as you being “real” and not an act.
	Ok, then. So I have this friend who went abroad during college, which you also mocked, and he literally designed and built a freshwater collection system in Rwanda with an engineering team. They used money they raised, and he personally wound up spending a lot of his own money going there separately from the program and taking a semester off of school to live for three months. He did this to learn specifically how their culture works so that they could design the best possible system. Because as you have noted, some people think they are helping but once they leave it goes back to the way it was. Conscious of this, he did something to make sure that wouldn't happen, to actually affect positive change in people's lives. I'm sorry sir, but fuck you a little bit.
	Another one of my good friends majored in psychology, and before she graduated (which she still did) she founded an online company that fosters anonymous online help for peers suffering from any kind of mental stress. How it works is you submit a written statement of whats going on and how you are feeling and she finds someone who has suffered from the same kind of problem who will then email back advice within twenty four hours. Using technology she cleverly came up with a welcoming and safe system for people to open up when they would have been otherwise too afraid to. Her nonprofit company is now built into student resource programs on many major college campuses and with the help of another friend of ours she has a beautifully designed website. The company she built has literally prevented numerable suicides from happening. Fuck you a little bit.
	The things I have accomplished pale in comparison to what many of my friends are up to. I'm merely a seasonal gardener. I love to read and write. I have a degree in Biology, and I enjoy working outdoors. You know what I do in the winters? I shovel snow in fucking Wisconsin. Consider that for a moment. I'm one of the youngest people at my job and complain the least. If anything people get more bitter with age because things haven't changed for them. I'm positive and hopeful for the future because I know people like my two friends I have mentioned are out there. I'm hopeful, perhaps ignorantly so, but fuck you for thinking that. I'm just some dude in Wisconsin, and if I have friends like this, you don't think there are people like that everywhere?
	 I could blame the job market for the limited work I am able to find. That would be totally reasonable. I could resent all the rich old white men in congress who act in consistent disregard for my future, with only their personal wealth and power in mind. That would also be reasonable. But I can't blame older people in general, that would be ignorant and childish to take issue with an entire group of people. It's too easy. Just like saying twenty year olds have no value, which again, fuck you a little bit for saying.
	Everybody is a product of their upbringing. I think you get that, and being a father it scares you with how to raise your girls. It should.

19u56e,8,2013-03-07,A budding relationship and a possible job. About to make one of the biggest decisions of my life...,askgbthrowaway,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/19u56e/a_budding_relationship_and_a_possible_job_about/,"Background information: I’m 22, he’s 20. I’m in my senior year of college and he’s a sophomore, and we go to rival universities about an hour apart. We met online (OKC) in mid January, and for what it’s worth, he initiated contact. 

We skyped a few times and texted quite a bit, and we went on our first date in early February. We’ve continued to chat on a fairly regular basis, and we had another date last week. I had a long weekend, so we were able to find some time that fit with our work schedules. I went up to visit him and the plan from the beginning was that I was going to spend the night. He mentioned something about hanging out with his friends for awhile, which I was fine with but I wanted to spend the majority of the time with him. When we were heading out the door to go to the ‘party’ (in the loosest sense of the word, it was pretty lousy), he asked if I could drive because he didn’t have much gas, and so that he could drink as well. I said that it was fine, and then he requested if we could stop and get a bottle of liquor to take to the party. I agreed (it’s a douche move to show up to a BYOB party without booze), and so we stopped to get a decent bottle of vodka and some mixers. We got to the party at about 10 and ended up staying til 1. I didn’t know anyone there other than him, and he was pretty buzzed and everyone else was tanked. I wasn’t angry or anything, but I was getting kind of frustrated that we were spending so much time there and that I wasn’t able to partake in the drinking. 

We finally left the party and he was coming down from his buzz, and we had a pretty good discussion on the way back to his place. We talked about our previous experiences (we’re both pretty new to the game) and candidly discussed previous dating issues that we’ve had in the past.  Neither of us had any sort of major issue or anything, and we both talked about how previous dates have led us on and agreed that no matter what happened, we would tell the other person if we weren’t interested even if it meant being a bit blunt. We just got back to his apartment at that point, and so we went upstairs with the bottle of vodka and mixers in tow—it wasn’t opened at the party, so he grabbed it on the way out—and each poured ourselves a drink. We both got buzzed, and chatted again for awhile and started to watch a movie. We were on the couch in his living room and I leaned in for a kiss, and so of course we had the requisite makeout session. He suggested moving into his room “for cuddling”, and I figured that was probably a good idea because his roommate was going to be coming home soon. We made out and cuddled in there for a bit, and things escalated a bit. We took off our shirts and were just in boxers for awhile, kissed and groped a bit, and then a hand job. We never did BJs/anal though, and didn’t go all out because I suggested that we wait for a future time to do that; some time when we were both sober. He was okay with that, and we kissed and cuddled for another hour or so before finally falling asleep in each other’s arms.  We woke up about two hours before I had to leave the next afternoon, and spent about an hour and a half of it cuddling and making out again before we got in the shower, tag teamed breakfast, and then I left to drive home at the same time he had to leave for work.

We’ve been chatting almost daily since then, and we’re on spring break right now so I was hoping that we’d have a chance to hang out again but it appears that that’s not happening this week. He was in my city today for an appointment and a job interview, and I knew about this on our last date and asked him last night if he wanted to get coffee or do lunch after he was done with his errands, but he said that he’d rather spend the day with his parents. That’s fine and dandy, and I’m totally fine with it, but then he started texting me later this evening saying that he was bored and wanted it to be summer. I didn’t bring up the topic of hanging out tonight since he already declined, though, and figured if he wanted to, he’d do it. Then he asked me what I was doing (filling out applications for other jobs relating to my major and working on internship planning), and we discussed that for a little while (more on that in a bit) but he only replied with one and two word answers.  I got busy doing some other stuff and so we ceased conversation for the night. Again, not that there’s anything wrong with this, just providing some context for tonight’s events and what’s going to be impacted by a major decision that I have to make shortly. 

Here’s where the job/internship stuff comes in.  I graduate in May, and then I have an internship over the summer that is set up through my university. The internship is required for everyone in my major and it’s technically a graduation requirement even though it takes place after the official graduation date.  We’re allowed to pick the company with which we want to work, and I’ve narrowed my preferred choices down to my top three: one in my city, one in a big city about two hours away, and one in his city. It’s at this point that I need to add that I was considering the job in his city before I even knew he existed, but I am definitely more interested now that I know he’s there. There’s also a very strong chance that I will be hired by the company with which I do my internship, as about 90% of graduates of my degree are snatched up right after the internship.

Now that that lengthy litany of background information is done, I have several things on which I would like to hear some advice:

1.	When is a good time to bring up the conversation about being exclusive? I have dated a few guys before but I have never been in a legitimate relationship, and he has dated a guy for about a month before but has never had anything long-term. We both expressed interest in going for a long term commitment in the past, and I’m still pulling for it.

2.	I’m really undecided about my internship. I’m okay with working for the company in my city, but it’s my third choice. My first choice is the job in the big city, and I know a bunch of friends who live there as well so it would be a blast. The company in his city is my second choice, it’s a very good company and he’s there, but I don’t really know anyone else up there. I only know one other person from there, and we dated for a little while last year but then he royally fucked me over. Part of me wants to take the position in the big city, but the rest of me wants to take the job in his city, especially if we end up in a long term relationship. If I take the big city position, though, we’ll be three hours apart and that just isn’t going to work out in the long run.
 
3.	How should I approach the situation regarding him and the internship? I’m concerned and I don’t want to come across as being desperate or clingy, but this is a pretty big decision.  I want to ask him his opinion on the internship sites, and I am indeed interested in the job that’s in his town. Is it wrong of me to want to be in a relationship with him or at least have it blatantly clear that it’s part of the reason why I’m considering this position over the other one? I still have two more weeks to think about the jobs before I have to submit my final paperwork for my internship, but that really isn’t a lot of time. I honestly can’t decide which position I want right now—the big city vs. his city are in a dead tie right now."

I'm 21 and I'm from Ireland. I like to go out to dinner somewhere a bit fancy on Friday night after work. Don't ask me why but walking into somewhere in the domain and just asking for the most expensive thing on the menu makes me feel like a boss. If anyone around my age would like to go to dinner with me then post a reply. Of course if you want any proof that I'm genuine then send a pm.
I already know that if anyone actually read this they would be skeptical as fuck. Which is understandable, but I'm just a lad that really just doesn't care very much for eating alone all time. 

Edit: Should probably something a bit about myself. I've played drums for the last 12 years. A lot of experimental rock. Music you could only love if you where on lsd... :D yeah.. other than that I make video games. In Ireland I study in the University of Limerick. Video games development is the course but it's basically just computer science. I some how managed to get an internship for a few months in North Austin and so far it's been fantastic but meeting people hasn't been overly easy. After work I just get very bored.

19th04,1,2013-03-06,Just want to know if anyone else feels what I do,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/19th04/just_want_to_know_if_anyone_else_feels_what_i_do/,"Hi, Reddit world.
I've been struggling lately with a few things that I've self-diagnosed as something between social anxiety and perfectionism. The only person I really talk to about my struggles is my boyfriend, and as supportive as he is, I don't want to overburden him, so I figured I'd try sharing here. 

I'm in my 20s, in college and generally really happy with my life, which makes it hard to articulate exactly what's wrong. I guess I'll just start with small things and hope it paints a picture of what I'm going through.
I work for my university in a job related to my major. Before that I worked at a series of really great jobs that look awesome on my resume. And at all these things I've been successful, but I'm almost always miserable about work. Ever since I was little I've had perfectionist tendencies. I hold myself to really high standards and have always been bad at dealing with criticism, real or perceived. As I get older, and become more and more successful, my self-doubt and anxiety about not being regarded as great at my job, the best student intern they've ever had, a person that other students respect, etc. is only growing. No matter how good a day starts, I can get thrown off by the slightest thing. For example, I've had nothing but positive feedback so far at my job, but any time I have even the smallest interaction with my boss I obsess over what I should have said or done differently or what he thinks of me. If he responds to an email in a way that seems shorter than usual or he doesn't compliment me on work I submit, I feel awful for the rest of the day, unless I do something to distract myself.

I hope I'm not coming across as arrogant, because in reality I feel the exact opposite. Well, it's weird. I have this strange combination of confidence in my abilities but then sometimes crippling self-doubt. I'm extremely ambitious, but that's not to say I always work hard. I can be kind of lazy actually. I don't go to class. I'm not graduating this spring even though it's my fourth year. But professionally, I've done more in my field than most other students. I'm ready to get started on my career and just hate wasting time in GE science classes.
Along with this stuff about work, I've also withdrawn socially over the past year. I have some friends but prefer to be alone and with my boyfriend. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, I guess it just stands out to me because I feel like I've changed and live a lot more in my head than I used to. I used to be a lot more social but now being around other people just makes me anxious. Though I've always been a pretty awkward person around people I'm not comfortable with.

I don't know, I guess what I'm looking for is a. confirmation that I'm not the only one in the world who struggles like this. and b. maybe some help in stopping the cycle of negative thinking that turns what should be a good day into a bad one.

Since reddit has helped me so much with self improvement, I thought I can share my experience with prospect and young Chemical Engineers. I left some [comments] (http://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/zn56f/what_kinds_of_hobbies_or_activities_build/c80omhw?context=3) before, and here is a bullet pointed summary of those comments.

Looking for a descent job in industry after undergraduate.

* Internship or Co-op experience
* GPA around or above 3.5
* Proof of good social skills. (gets involved in AICHE, academic and social fraternity.)

Looking for a descent graduate school

* Research experience in undergraduate
* GPA above 3.7 (for at least top 10~20 schools)
* 3 Recommendations (build a good relationship with professors.)

Looking for a perfect Resume.

* Intership, Co-op, Research experience.
* GPA between 3.95-4.00
* An executive position in some organization. (i.e. AICHE, student government, Omega Chi Epsilon, Alpha Chi Sigma)
* Teaching Assistant (it was only offered to high GPA students at my school.)
* Win awards. such as in Undergraduate Symposium (where you compete by presenting your research)
* Join all the honor society (including the ones that you don't even need to attend a single meeting or initiation.)
* Get Summa Cum Laude, Distinguished Honor (must do senior thesis), and Dean's List
* good recomendations


Planning for semesters

* 1st semester: build your network which will be your foundation for getting an executive position. drink hard, study hard. Attend all the AICHE meetings.
* 2nd semester: Look for research for the summer. Experimental graduate student usually want to get a lot of data during the summer by abusing undergraduate (but it's a win-win). Hit professors with e-mail that you are interested in his/her research and you would like to build experience.(I may post another about how to write e-mail to professors about getting a research position.) If you don't get a position, take summer classes to get ahead of other students. (summer classes are often easier to get As and a good opportunity to get lead of gen ed. classes.) Also, if you can, get an AICHE position, or whatever organization you are involved in.
* 3rd semester: If you could, continue your research. Work hard, drink hard. look for organization positions. develop leadership.
* 4th semester: If you were able to maintain high GPA with research + AICHE position, you may be eligible for internship at the end of sophomore year. When in doubt, write your resume including your high school stuff. Get it proof read at the career office at school. get elevator pitch ready with nice professional suite, and hit the career fair (usually in early spring). If you get an internship, great for you. If not, sophomores usually don't get an internship position anyway (good learning experience.). Either spend summer doing internship or research + classes. Also keep your eyes open for TA opportunity. You may talk people in the department office to ask how they run TAs for undergraduate.
* 5th semester: You will probably have less time for drinking now, but some people sacrifice their studying time to drink. It's fine to do that. I think memory is as important as your GPA. Do the same things over and over.
* 6th semester: This semester is crucial because this is when undergraduates get internships and co-op. Do the things that I mentioned above(resume checked, elevator checked, suite checked, company background checked), and hit the career fair. Socialize, and get a position in an organization. Look for Teaching Assistant opportunity. If you have been doing research, you may get an opportunity to participate in Undergraduate Symposium. Do it! spend summer meaningfully
* 7th - 8th semester: If you have been researching take Senior thesis. Look for jobs.

Tips

* Do your best to maintain high GPA. It all comes down to how much passionate you feel towards academics, and your capability to cope with stress.
* Socialize, build your network. It's a small world, and there are so much possibilities that you will benefit from your friends.
* Focus for Graduate school: Research, high GPA, academics, independent study 
* Focus for Industry with bachelor degree: Internship, 3.5 GPA, social skill, leadership

I know there are a lot of successful chemical engineers out here in this sub-reddit! I know you are great and you should help other young engineers by adding tips on comments!

19xcq3,1,2013-03-08,I [24M] recently broke up with the girl [22F] I love over differing dreams and ambitions. Have I made a mistake? [X-Post from /r/relationships],lovemeorleavemeplz,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/19xcq3/i_24m_recently_broke_up_with_the_girl_22f_i_love/,"I have been dating this wonderful girl for 7 months until recently. I lost my job a little over a month ago, which has caused extreme stress in our relationship. I was relocated to Chicago after my job and have never quite managed to fit in to the place. With grad school and other options, plus the fact that I want to return home to NY (She is from Chicago), we have recently been on a very rocky road.

She is beautiful. A talented musician with a promising band. I enjoy her company. Although our passions and hobbies are not identical, we understand and respect each other's. The sex is fantastic. She is kind and generous. I am madly in love with her. At the same time, she is headstrong (so am I). She is constantly broke. She dreams, whereas I am realistic. Oh, and loyal, she is so incredibly loyal, which is very important to me.

While I do believe that she is very talented at music, and could in fact make something of herself there, she seems to only have ambition to this dream and not anywhere else in her life. Her 3 day work weeks are not enough to pay for her rent. To make matters worse, she spends every penny she has until her debit card declines her. On her third year of college, she decided music wasn't for her and dropped out. She claims she would like to return so that she can become a veterinarian or train animals (both things require a lot of schooling that she never got as a music major.)

I know that I am not a perfect person either. I too can be self centered and difficult. While I do spend money myself, it is what I earned. I worked a high paying job with long hours and I tend to be frugal. My ambitions and goals are related to my profession and hobbies (and wishful hobbies like flying). I lost my job and am now applying to Grad Schools as well as internships and jobs (In NYC and Chicago)

Losing my job has placed a tremendous stress on us. For one thing, the stress of not knowing where I will be in 2-5 months has been causing us to treat each other terribly. Glances that used to cause instant happiness now incite anger and resentment. Another reason is that I feel that I must look at her as future-wife-material. If I were to bring her to NYC, it would be no different than putting a ring on her finger. And we both feel that we are too young to get married. (Though I have had a few serious girlfriends in the past, I have never considered marriage until her.) She says that I don't look at her the same way and cherish her as I used to. While I know that she is right, I don't know if it has more to do with assessing future-wife-material vs normal relationship aging dynamics.

And so now, I don't know what to do. We broke up recently, and though I thought she would break up with me, I think I broke up with her. (God that sounds so teenager haha) But I have to wonder whether I am doing the right thing or wrong. If you really love someone, when do you draw the line on your own personal needs and wishes for the other person to be? Can I expect that she will change and become more responsible for herself, or am I right to call things off now, before I fall harder for someone that has the opposite values as me?

TL;DR Boy loves girl and girl loves boy. Boy's dreams and ambitions do not match girl's. Should boy love girl and overlook her flaws or find another girl?"

As of right now I will be entering in my last year of college and majoring in computer engineering, I've had internship and experience so I believe I will be hired shortly after graduation. I've also been working part-time at an engineering company for over a year while also attending school so I have a good income at the moment.

All my expenses right now are paid, my parents are kind and pay for my rent/expenditures, I also have scholarships that cover school. So right now everything I've made at has been put into a savings account with some ridiculous low interest rate


Any advice on what to do with my savings account? It's basically been sitting like that for over a year.
Sorry if I haven't provided enough information, I'm kind of new when it comes to Personal Finance.

19wzxx,28,2013-03-08,Approaching a crossroad....is photography really right for me?,replicat0r,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/19wzxx/approaching_a_crossroadis_photography_really/,"Hey guys, recently discovered this subreddit and has been hanging out here for a while, its been pretty awesome so far. The reason I made this post is for the veterans and the established photographers out there. 

Here is my short story..back in 2010, I was accepted into an international exchange program in sweden. Before I left, I knew it was gonna be an experience of a lifetime, so I used up most of my savings and bought myself a T2I DSLR with the 18-55mm kit lens. When I was overseas, I discovered that traveling there is relatively cheap, so I started going to places with my DSLR, I was quite novice at the time, armed with only basic knowledge of how to take pictures, such as the relationship btw iso, aperture, and shutterspeed. I did not know much about compositions, color etc. It was fun for me to take picture of the beautiful things around me. My interest in the subject started to rise, and I started to read books about photography, editing etc and went on more trips. I also started to invest in some more entry/mid level lens. I bought an 18-135mm to replace my kit lens, a sigma 10-20 for some landscape and a cheap tripod. During my travels, I met a austrian photography on one of my hiking trips and he was doing a star trail pictures. Now this really peaked my interests and I started learning things about taking night pictures, I became obsessed with filming the milky way. I have tried several times, and only have been successful once or twice to capture the magnificent beauty. I was quite proud of myself the first time a clear but grainy shot of the milkyway came through. I feel like I can really unleash my creativity and explore the world through the lens of my camera. 

Last year, I had an internship in south africa, I knew there was going to be a lot wildlife and my trusty 18-135mm will not be sufficient. So this time I invested in a 70-30mm Canon L lens. During my time in Africa, I went on several safari trips and took some amazing shots with my new lens. It is a mixture of euphoria, delight, excitement when your shot turned out better than you would have imagined in your wildest dreams. I often check out photography sites and blogs for inspirations, some shots that people have taken is really really amazing and it really makes me earn for my pictures to turn out like that! I realize that the picture counter on the camera does not measure much, its only been over 12000 shots for me. When I look back on it, it has been improving, but there is only somewhat of a handful picture that I am really proud of. Which brings me to question some things.. I really want to explore this subject more and invest in another lens, but part of me feel like I may not have the talent, or good enough to have those amazing shots that I see on photography sites and I may never be as good as them. Now I realize that its very natural to have 4 or 5 pictures out of 100 picture to be really good, but I sometimes feel that all those amazing shots i took are nothing but flukes.. and it was really just me being lucky instead being skilful. What I wish to do in the future is to go semi-pro, do this as a hobby but it can also generate a moderate amount of income. I would also like to build myself a nice portfolio to be really proud of when I look back to. 

So for the veterans out there.... what made you to walk on the path you walk on now? did you ever feel that you dont have the talent, or you are not good enough? or that one amazing shot you got was just a fluke and it may not happen again? 




Edit: Okay.. to give you guys a better perspective or idea..I have uploaded some shots of mine that I feel are decent, and are not ashamed of.. here it is

19wx9m,3,2013-03-08,Basically just need to output my thoughts and feelings. Thought this would be the place.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/19wx9m/basically_just_need_to_output_my_thoughts_and/,"This post doesn't really have a point to it except getting out everything I'm thinking and feeling at the moment. I usually write my thoughts and feelings out in a word document or an email sent to the future (futureme.org) or something and it usually makes me feel a lot better, but lately I've done it a lot and I don't feel any better. I figured if I posted it publicly it make have a greater effect, knowing at least one person might skim through it and know what I've said.

I don't really know where to start. I just feel negative. I can't help it, I've tried telling myself I'm being irrational and I'm just in a negative state of mind but it isn't helping. Its like no matter how hard I try to rationalise myself happy again its no use. It makes me feel like I have n o control over my mood and its all caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain which I can't change, and that is a scary thought for me. It makes me feel hopeless, like no matter how much I remind myself of everything there is to be happy about and how my fears or worries are silly, I'll never be able to break out of this mood.

I've broken out of this negative mindframe before... I've felt on top of the world and I've told myself ""Wow, I feel great...I'll never feel like I did again!""... But I always do. I don't know what changes to make me feel so good, but its like I forget why I was so happy... Like its all to just to do with processes in the body as if I'm some sort of computer and I can't change it just by trying to be happy and grateful.

While I'm on this subject...I don't feel alive. At all. I mean, it just feels like my senses are numbed. Like I'm in some sort of life simulation where the human emotions module hasn't been coded completely. I don't feel my surroundings. I don't get joy out of anything anymore. I achknowledge that something is funny but I don't laugh at it. I don't feel like any of this is real so I don't have motivation to do anything...Because I don't really feel happiness or reward or anything, why would I have motivation? Motivation is all based on feeling some sort of gratification at the end of whatever you're doing, but right now I feel nothing. 

Its like I'm desensitized. Things that should make me feel happiness, like being with family and friends and walking outside on a warm sunny day, don't even register with my emotions. And things that should make me feel sad, like reading on sad stories on the internet or in the news, they don't effect me either. Its like I'm just reading information but I don't feel it. Everything is just numbers and facts and I process them but I never take them in. Nothing seems real. I spend a lot of time daydreaming. I feel anxious about life and the world, so I retreat back into my daydreams where I can be anything and I don't have to deal with the things on the outside. But I do have to deal with things on the outside, because I can't stay in my daydreams constantly, I have to keep waking up and dealing with the consequences of the life I've neglected whilst I was thinking about something obscure and irrelevant. 

I skipped a couple of classes this week... Told myself it was for my own good as it would give me time to compose myself and sort my head out which is more important, but I just spend that time drinking coffee, surfing the internet, daydreaming and masturbating. So I basically lie to myself, try and justify not wanting to go out. 

I'm learning German and I am currently taking optional classes at University. I never do any work outside of class even though I know I should. Learning a language is hard, it should be a full time thing but I just seem to float through it... Dreading the two-hour lesson at the end of each week, sitting through it and feeling relieved at the end of it and happy that I have another week until I have to do it again. Then I just put it to the back of my mind until 7 days later and I've not done any work for it and I haven't done the homework so then I feel anxious about going. I just skipped going today because I felt so shit. I tell myself I need to do more work for it but I never get round to it so then I feel guilty for not doing it. I want to learn the language, I'm hoping to do an internship over there next year and I know it could be the best time of my life if I only put the work in. I know its good for me, so why don't I have the motivation to do it? 

I seriously feel like I'm wasting away. I feel shit for neglecting all this important work that may basically define how well I do and the job I get in later life. I feel shit for not sticking to a regular exercise regime, and not sticking to a good diet and not sticking to budgetting my money. I know I need to do all these things now or else I'll feel shit about it later down the line. But I slip. I'll feel great at one point, make loads of changes in my life, but I'll have one bad day, everything goes down the drain and then I'm left feeling even shitter about letting everything go and I feel like I'm going down a spiral until I reach the point that I'm at now. And then I'll eventually pick myself up, perhaps from talking to someone about how I feel or maybe even writing this reddit post. I'll feel better, and I'll try and pick up from the situation I let myself get into (falling behind on work etc) and I'll slowly work myself back into a 'healthy' state of mind. But its never really solved, because sooner or later I have a bad day and I'm back down the spiral.

I just hate feeling negative and whiny and ungrateful. I'm a perfectly healthy, young, gifted, intelligent young man who is privileged to have been born in a country where I don't have to fear being killed everyday, where I'm not starving, where I the possibility to be whatever I want without any social restrictions holding me back. But yet I find things to moan at, and that just makes me feel even more guilt. I'm not making the most out of what I've got...If anything I'm wishing for more, which is pathetic. I just want to feel content. But I don't feel... anything. I just feel like everything is pointless. I think things over way too much. I think too much, about everything. I question everything. I'm too self conscious. I've got low self esteem. But I know I could do anything if I put my mind to it, and if I just simply forgot everything that holds me back, I could do whatever I wanted.

I don't know where to go from here. I still feel kind of empty. I know I'm going to close my laptop lid and everything I'm still upset about is going to be in my head. But I guess I feel a little weight off my shoulder.

I feel a little pathetic. I feel like I let myself and other people down by not having the strength to just be. I feel I'm not very likeable in my current state but deep down I'm one of the nicest people I know. I just don't have the will to show my real self. I don't think I currently possess the strength to stand up for myself or anything I believe in. I feel as if my opinions don't really matter, and I don't have the courage to voice them as I'll always be wrong, or people will try and counter my arguments and I'll have to stand my ground. 

I've always liked writing...Being creative. But I feel embarrassed by it. Because I don't think its what I should be into. I wouldn't be able to stand up and say that it is what I enjoy doing and it is what I'm interested in because for some reason I'm ashamed of it. I was never into sports or anything like that. I felt I didn't fit in to the 'guy' subculture at school or anything and just felt I shouldn't admit I was into writing because I'd be laughed at because I shouldn't be into that kind of thing and I should be into football or whatever. But I could never do football or sports or anything. I'm naturally clumsy but I'm also naturally creative (I have something you might not have heard of called Dyspraxia.) 

I know, or at least I think I know, I'm naturally GOOD at writing because numerous different teachers emphasized it. All the way through school, my English teachers would set assignments and I'd do them without really thinking or making a huge effort but they'd always make a big deal out of them and read them out in class and I never knew why. I guess I always kind of thought they were just trying to boost my confidence because they knew I was a bit troubled or whatever. But now I look back I don't think that was the case. My point is...well I don't really know what my point is. I hardly ever write, and I've never really written for pure pleasure and for someone to read my piece. I don't have the confidence, and I wouldn't have the will to follow through and finish something. I never seem to finish anything, not just writing.

I like writing because I find it fun, and I feel I have great original ideas. But I'm scared to be put down or not to live up to my own and other's expectations. I know being a fiction writer is a very ambitious and unconventional career path, and I've chosen a degree subject with absolutely nothing to do with it (so the path I'm currently taking has absolutely nothing to do with what I actually want to do). But I can't get it out of my head, and it seems everyday I feel guilty for not following what I really want to do. And at the same time I'm not following what I don't want to do either. I feel like I'm floating through life without reason or aim or focus. I feel there is no point to me. I feel worthless and I feel like nothing I do has a point to it. 

If you actually took the time out to read this in its entirety, and I don't suspect many people will, then thank you. There isn't really a point to it except for me to get it off my chest and perhaps make me feel better so it must have been difficult to read. if you did read until the end then I invite you to be completely honest with me. I personally believe honesty is one of the most important things in life, even though I'm not always honest myself. Even if you want to call me a whiny little bitch, then go ahead.

**tl;dr:** I'm not really a very happy person."

19wjvz,9,2013-03-08,Aquaponic Introduction,[deleted],aquaponics,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/19wjvz/aquaponic_introduction/,"Aquaponics 101

Written by a beginner.

Basics

Aquaponics gets its name from and is a combination of two sciences. These sciences are aquaculture and hydroponics.

Hydroponic growing is the science of growing plants without soil. It is most commonly seen in three forms, deep water culture (DWC), media beds, or nutrient film technique (NFT). There are endless variations and many systems combine the different forms.

Aquaculture is the science of raising marine or freshwater animals in some sort of controlled environment. To understand how and why these sciences are merging to form the new specialization we call aquaponics we must first understand the major problems associated with these sciences.

In traditional hydroponics plants are grown in a nutrient solution manufactured to maximize the growth of that plant. This nutrient solution is traditionally made up of fertilizers that are manufactured from oil and high in salts. This makes them expensive and the salts that are not absorbed by the plants accumulate until they become phytotoxic. The response to this problem for traditional hydroponic growers is to drain and flush the system. If the system is a media based system, the salts accumulate heavily in the media. In order to flush the salts out of the media it takes roughly 3 times the volume of the media bed in clean water drained to waste in order to remove the salts. That salt rich water rinsed from the hydroponic system must be disposed of responsibly.

Aquaculture encounters a similar problem with waste accumulation becoming toxic to the system. Fish continually produce ammonia (and urea). It comes out of their gills when they breath, and they excrete it like any animal excretes waste. This ammonia becomes toxic over time, and like the hydroponic salts, must be removed from the system. Aquaculturists employ elaborate filtration systems to minimize the amount of water used, however they cannot escape the need to drain waste heavy water from their system and replace it with clean water. Again, as in hydroponics, this waste must be disposed of responsibly. That means paying to have it removed.

So now that we understand the problems we can look at how combining the industries benefits each of them. Rather than waste and replace water, aquaponics recycles water. In a well balanced system roughly 1.5% of the system water volume will need to be replaced daily. Aquaponic systems have no weeds and the water surfaces are covered to minimize the amount of evaporation. That means almost all of that 1.5% of water that is being replaced daily is being used by the plants. Nothing more, nothing less. That water efficiency is what I believe is the most important aspect of aquaponics.

    Also, aquaponic systems are inherently organic, even if the government has a copyright on that word. A well established aquaponic system is a well established ecosystem. The larger the system, the older it is, the more well balanced and stable it will be. That stability is based on a complex ecosystem of life that includes not only the fish and the plants but also the bacteria that do the work of converting the ammonia, or fish waste, into nitrogen, our essential element to plant growth.

    If you are interested in more information about aquaponics, I can recommend a number of places to start. I would caution that when researching aquaponics be wary of the difference between being ‘loud’ and being correct. By that I mean there are a lot of people on the internet saying a lot of things, and just because they say it a lot doesn't make it true. As a young field, there is a lot of information out there. What I have found is that if you want to get to the bottom of something, you have to really ask the right questions and figure it out yourself. There is no substitute for actually building a system and trying to grow plants. Plant them, move them, eat them. Eat them some more. Eating them is awesome.  

Additional learning?
    The internet is obviously a great place to start. These are personal recommendations of mine based on personal experience.

http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics
http://www.aquaponicscommunity.com
http://www.aquaponics.net.au/

Youtube should get special mention. There are thousands of videos out there on every subject you can think of. I found Murray Hallam’s videos to be some of the best.


Want to read a real book?

1. http://www.amazon.com/Recirculating-Aquaculture-M-B-Timmons-Ebeling/dp/0971264627

2. http://www.amazon.com/Aquaponic-Gardening-Step-By-Step-Vegetables-Together/dp/086571701X

If you “look inside” on this book on amazon you can read most of the text for free.    

More of the hands on type? Build something! Nothing can substitute for doing it yourself. Find an aquaponic or hydroponic farm and get a job. Experience on a commercial farm will be beneficial in a variety of ways, even if its not directly related to your individual end goal. After that seminars and trainings are a popular way to become educated on aquaponics. As a professional I’m not going to personally recommend or warn against any of these. I caution anyone considering a training to consider your source and judge the cost to you against the value of your own time. It may be worth it to you to pay for a 3 day training rather than 3 months on the internet. You’ll probably spend that time on the internet anyway, however you’ll be more directed.

Many people offer unpaid internships in places like Hawaii. I participated in one of these and would caution against them. Be sure you know what you are getting into before you go. There are a few that will actually pay interns, use this as a sign.

If you are really serious about aquaponics work somewhere or go to school. All the people doing research and the most successful people are scientists, MBA’s, engineers, and doctors. Use aquaponics as a tool to figure out what really interests and motivates you, and go to school for that. It will lead to bigger and better things!

I was put in a performance correction because of a bad performance evaluation from the supervisor at the placement (agency) I had been put at. That put me into a major depressive episode with anxiety attacks that I had never experienced before. That stared in December and I've been trying to recover since then. I was put on the performance correction contract at the end of January. Yesterday my professor stated that I had not improved and failed me because my new supervisor at a different placement said at the meeting With my professor thst i was just doing ok and was not performing up to standard. All along this supervisor told me I was doing good and never asked to see my work. I agree that I was not working on an assignment the way I should have been. But I think the supervisor should have said something sooner. Right now I feel like I can't even function. I have been crying all day, in my classes, with my friends, I just don't want to wake up tomorrow. The advice from my school was too keep going and finish out the internship. I just feel like a failure and how did I get into school if twice from two different supervisors I am being told I am not good enough. I feel like I will never make it in the real world at a job. I just don't even want to live with this embarrassment. I feel awful and I know i probably deserve what I'm getting, I just tried to make everyone happy and it didnt work. I just want to curl up and die and get away from my life. I've been thinking about swallowing pills to get away from it all. I just don't know how to get through this. "

You guys win. You guys gave a pretty compelling case and got me pumped. Reason for choosing is people were telling me how things have been pretty shitty at MSU and the nerd scene isn't to vibrant. Thanks!

EDIT:

Thank you very much for responding to this thread. You guys are making a pretty strong case for Depaul. 






Hi!

I recently got into a few universities however I'm hardcore on the fence on which school I want to go to (It's between Depaul, MSU and Purdue. Depaul and MSU offered a lot of money). So, what I am asking for is if you guys can answer a few of my questions.

After a bit of threadstalking, I see that Senton Hall and U Hall are the most social dorms. I'm a proud otaku/nerd however I am somewhat of a social guy (even though I like to spend most of my time on the computer &gt;.&gt;), will I fit in well with those dorms? If not, which dorm will suit me the best? 



How are roommates assigned? 



Is it better to room with a friend or with (a) stranger(s). 

What are the attitudes towards marijuana and alcohol on campus? Are there severe punishments for being caught drinking or smoking? Should I just leave my pot at home and not bother? 

Is it worth having a car?



How is the internet at Depaul? 

I have a massive gaming computer that I built recently. I love this thing to death however a lot of my friends say that I should sell it and buy a gaming laptop for class. My idea is that I buy a cheap notebook off newegg for class use so I can still have my gaming computer. Thoughts? 



Next, what clubs and student organizations are there at Depaul that suit my nerdiness? Is there a Starcraft 2 team or Dota 2 team? Also, what is the reputation of the Atheist Organization. I am somewhat shy of being open about my rejection of faith primarily because of the flood of /r/atheist threads that liter the front page which tend to be douchey. Lastly, although this is going to sound strange, is there a heavy lifting club/crew? 



What is Computer Science like? Primarily, what is its reputation? Are internships easily acquired? 



How many classes does a typical student take a semester and what are some of the gen eds.Knowing that Depaul has a requirement for a theological class (or at least that is what I heard) what classes are offered?  Also, could I knock out a few gen eds with my ap credits? I got a 4 on the Psych and Euro ap exams and a 3 on the Environmental science. 

How active are students on campus meaning, is being on campus fun or is it a bore? 



What is the overall nerd scene like at Depaul? 

What is the overall stress level of a student at Depaul from school work? 

Also, how much can I slack off second semester? So far I am getting a C in AB Calc, C in Psych, C in Apes, B- in English, A in Animation Honors, A in Euro. This is opposed to first semester were I got As and Bs. 

So yeah, here are the few (lol) questions that I have. Also any additional information that I should know would be awesome. Thanks in advance!

I really don't want to end up back with my parents.

I spent part of my summer working for a small company as a marketing intern. I was hoping to find a similar position at a company here in Boston, but I'm not sure if that's going to pan out. I've not been very successful, though it's only March.

What can I do to up my chances of finding a job after I graduate?

* My GPA is in the top 5% for my college.

* Like I said, I have had one internship and will either work at the same company again this summer or find an internship here in Boston.

* I will be graduating a semester early, not sure if this would be helpful

Really happy with the gains!  
I know it is mostly fat, maybe just a pound or two of muscle, but damn happy with that.


Exercise: first 2 weeks I had access to a nice gym.  Did a quick SL routine for the few weeks, and also followed the ""pavel fighter pullup program"" (almost daily pullups).

This last week I started a new internship that'll last 3 months... Stuck being a desk jockey... Trying to take ten minute breaks and walking the parking lot.  So it's been home gym week


Been doing my pullups 6 days a week, and slowly but steadily going up the pull up ladder.  Today I did 5, 4, 4, 3, 2... I feel that after taking a day off I'll b able to do 6 on my first set.


Also doing 5-10 1-minute planks ever other day. Day 1, after my first two planks by Lower back hurt so bad, I figured I was doing it wrong.  Googled, nope... My core was just to weak to even do planks.  Ha.  Now I do them with confidence, maybe even comfort.... 
Random  amounts of pushup here and there


And....Goblet squats!  And since my balance is very poor and my bar squatting was still pretty low, I'm not even losing that much weight on the goblet squats... Using 51 pound dumbell.
Also doing shrugs with with 51 pound dumbells. 5 sets of ten reps.
Today I'll also try some random dumbell lifts... Curls maybe.
If the weather gets up to 45, I'll re-setup my garage gym (bench+squat stands+iron).


Diet: I've been paleo/primal since sept.  Started getting takeout from the brazilean steakhouse almost daily.  And drinking lots more milk and kefir (nowhere near gomad)


So breakfast is either a 2 scoop shake with berries, banana, and whole milk... Or 2 hard boiled eggs for breakfast...
Snacking on nuts and carrots all the time...
Drinking milk and kefir.lunch is usually brazilean takeout(lots of meat and salad)... Plantains and sweet potatos for carbs....
That's it for now.


  Time to squat, plank, and drink milk"

    [backstory]
I met this girl while she was doing an internship in my city. I was interested and asked her out knowing she would be leaving eventually. We clicked pretty well and started dating, things moved pretty fast. We decided to keep it going after she left, I'm due to go see her in May. We have been dating for two months. I can see this becoming quite serious except for a few issues.

First issue is she clams up when she's upset, sad, disappointed. She won't say anything at all when she's undecided or doesn't know what to say or doesn't know how to say it. I'm the opposite, I'm very straightforward. I grew up debating, discussing and arguing things with my family all the time. It's been hard for me since its hard to get a dialogue going when there's an issue, but so far its been okay. She says she appreciates it and says it helps her feel there's someone who can ""keep her grounded"" (her own words).

    [/backstory]

My main problem right now is that she has a housemate who has feelings for her. He met her when she started her current job and trained her. He left afterwards for another job but a lot of her current coworkers are mutual friends, even her current manager. He has known her for a while and has apparently helped her a lot. Even more than required, such as paying for her car repair himself after an accident because he knew she didn't have a lot of money. He offered to move into her house when he heard she was looking for a tenant for the same reason. I don't don't know if she knew at the time that he had feelings for her, or if his feelings developed later. They had casual sex a few times before she and I started dating. She says she zero feelings for him and says she only agreed to his advances because she didn't want him to move out. She really can't afford the entire rent of the house she's in and can't afford to lose her job. She's ashamed of what she did and it took a lot for her to tell me. She feels she ""acted like a slut and used him for money"" (her own words). When she told me I told her I didn't think any less of her, I still wanted her and appreciated she told me, but that she had to end it. 

She agreed and she says told him when she got back that their casual relationship was over and they were never getting together. My problem is that even though she told him, she still allows her coworkers to think they are an item. She says she is afraid that her coworkers will gossip and her current manager (who is apparently an asshole) will use the information to get her fired. She also feels that saying officially that she isn't with the guy will embarrass him since people assumed they were together, and feels its too cruel to him since she feels he's helped her so much. 

Last night the two had dinner with said mutual ""friends"" who happen to also be her coworkers. I asked her, begged her to make it clear that she wasn't with him. I told her I was not okay with my girlfriend letting someone else pretend she's his. She didn't. When I got upset she got upset, fell apart, started crying said she couldn't do it, was already ashamed of how he treated him. She didn't talk at all after that despite me being on the phone asking her to talk to me. Total silence cept for some crying. After about half an hour waiting and no response at all from her I hung up.

Now I'm torn about this. I really feel she cares about me but she's also much more emotional than I and feels she'd be ""cruel"" to her housemate by saying publicly she's with someone else, even if the two were never officially together. I don't feel this is something okay to do, despite how nice he's been to her (he had motive, and reward). But on the other hand I know she's tried really hard for me already and I really don't want her to lose her job (I consider the risk to be real). 

Do you guys have any thoughts? What should I do, say to her? Is this something I should just let go? I'm just afraid if I do, it'll lead to bigger problems later on...

**tl;dr** girlfriend allows coworkers to assume she's with her housemate who used to be a coworker as well. afraid saying otherwise will get her fired, and is too embarrassing to said housemate.

I'm a sophomore in college and really need to start dressing more professionally and grown up. I'm gonna be starting internships and important interviews soon and I just wanna dress more grown up in general. My closet is full of Hollister from high school. I just turned 20 and it's time my wardrobe matches my age! 

My personal style I would describe as southern, preppy. I loveeee pink. I love Lilly Pulitzer and the sorority girl look even tho I'm not in a sorority haha. Sundresses are awesome as well as heels. I can't live without my fake pearl earrings. Spring is my fav season because of all the pastel colors an cute prints like polka dots :) I love bows and khakis and just the whole southern belle look. I have more cardigans than anyone I know.

My body type would be small framed, but rather chesty. I'm a runner so I'm thin, but my boobies can make certain shirts unfortunately inappropriate. I like clothes that are kind of modest, but not old people esque. I'm self conscious of my thighs and my butt.

What are some flattering, key wardrobe pieces I should invest in?? Online links would be awesomee. What are some good stores for a 20sonething to shop at? With a limited budget, what should be my must have buys? Right now all I have for summer and spring are denim shorts and Hollister tanks -_-

Thanks so much for advice!"
19z08t,3,2013-03-09,Is anybody out there? Just want to get my thoughts/story out.,trappedinnhead,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/19z08t/is_anybody_out_there_just_want_to_get_my/,"Hello all,

This post may turn into a bit of a ramble, but seeing as how I'm basically in the middle of a panic attack right now I thought writing down my story and getting some support may help.

I have suffered from anxiety all of my life. When I was a child, the main source was a fear of losing my parents, my mom specifically. Whenever she would go out on a vacation with my dad or just out to get groceries, I would worry until the minute she came back. Sometimes even to the point of a panic attack. If I called her phone and she didn't answer, forget it, full on panic.

As I got older this fear subsided, although I still have it to this day it's not as severe. When I was younger I also had a bad experience with throwing up, and have been emetephobic ever since. I have a severe fear of nausea and throwing up.

None of this was a huge problem until a year ago when I began having random panic attacks for no reason. I was a senior in college and they became so bad that I often would have to leave class to deal with them. My safe spot seems to be my bathtub, whenever my anxiety gets really bad I take a bath and it (usually) seems to calm me down. So I'd end up running out of class covered in sweat, feeling nauseous, shaky, and my heart pumping.

I went to a school counselor who got me a consultation with an actual therapist, who told me I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder. He asked me if I wanted to get on any meds but I said no. I was already one as-needed Xanax from my family physician and I was feeling better from the counseling. After a few months, I had my anxiety under control, and everything was normal.

I graduated with honors this past may, and got an internship that turned into a job. I have a girlfriend who I've been dating for over 3 years who is very understanding and accepting of everything as well. Life has been good.

Then this past Christmas I had another real anxiety attack for the first time in probably 7 months. When I woke up on Christmas morning I realized it would probably be one of my last Christmases in my childhood home, since I'm hoping to get engaged and married within the next 2 years. Even though I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world and want to spend my life with her, the thought of leaving my childhood home, and my parents, sent me into a panic.

I managed to get over this panic though and move on. But my job has been getting more and more stressful lately because we're in a resource crunch with a few of our staff members quitting, then last weekend I woke up to the sound of my sister throwing up like crazy in the bathroom. She had gotten some kind of stomach bug. This triggered my anxiety again (the emetephobia) and the next day when I was out on a date with my girlfriend, I had a full blown panic attack where I could barely move. With her help and some Xanax, I got over it.

Then this past Thursday a panic attack hit me again, this time at work. I felt trapped there and embarrassed about having a panic attack. I just walked out of work and sat in my car, unable to move so badly that my parents had to come pick me up and take me home. I didn't go to work yesterday either fearing it would result in another panic attack.

Now I fear that I'm developing a bit of agoraphobia. Over the past few days since leaving work any attempt to leave my house has resulted in panic. I am so afraid that my life is going to fall apart due to this. I'm afraid I'll lose my job because I can't go in to work and I'm afraid this constant mental illness will drive the girl of my dreams away from me.

I woke up this morning and couldn't even go downstairs to eat breakfast, I'm sitting next to the tub right now just trying not to lose my mind. I'm so afraid this is going to ruin my life.

Thanks for reading if you did. I appreciate any support."
19yull,0,2013-03-09,"End-of-work review, feeling disheartened.",[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/19yull/endofwork_review_feeling_disheartened/,"I've just finished a 2-month work internship in a primarily office-based job (with a handful of meetings with clients), and got my review from my supervisor yesterday. Overall I thought I'd done well - I'd done my work without complaint, asked for more work, and was friendly and chatting to my office mates when they asked me things. My supervisor was barely around and came in to ask me how I was doing only four times during my two months there, so I got a lot of guidance from my office mates.

While I did get positive feedback during my debrief session with my supervisor, a few things came up that I hadn't been aware were problems. She said that it had been fed back to her that I was too quiet and not chatty, when I asked an office mate about it later she said that once we got to know each other I would talk more but even then I was more quiet than most people. I was also told that I needed to be more assertive and confident to speak out when I was asked for my opinion. I said that I didn't feel that I had anything to contribute when I'd been asked about clients discussed in meetings since I hadn't met them, my supervisor insisted that I could have used what I knew about the clients in theory to add something. Then she asked me if I intend to stay in the area, I said I wasn't sure since I didn't have anything else tying me here. She asked if I'd been lonely outside of work, I said that at times I had. I was told that she and my office mates were concerned about how I was feeling and that I don't easily give away how I am and that they weren't mind-readers, that I should have told them so they could have taken me out at weekends. I said that I honestly felt that I was imposing if I asked to be taken out, she said that I wouldn't have been. At this point she had to go to another meeting, so our meeting ended on that note.

So now I'm mixed up. I did my work well, and didn't let my private life interfere with it. Also I did tell my office mates when they asked that it was hard being on my own in a new area, and told them honestly about how I was trying local groups but didn't feel that I was fitting in. My supervisor was rarely in, and didn't ask me how I was doing when she did see me, I didn't know that it was expected that I would seek her out to talk about non work-related things. I'd have liked to have been asked if I'd wanted to do something outside of work - I was new and unsure, and my office mates often talked about how busy they are during evenings and weekends so I didn't feel right asking them. It feels as though a lot of this was my responsibility, when I wasn't aware that it should have been.

I spoke to my dad about this when I got home (he has Asperger's too), he said that it would have been my supervisor's job to check that I was alright in and out of work, that placing the responsibility on me without explicitly telling me was unfair of her. 

Also regarding being quiet, I told my office mates in the first few days that I have Asperger's and that I'm not good at starting conversations. My supervisor knows I have Asperger's since she was the one to assess and diagnose me a few years ago! 

She ended our meeting by talking about someone at a conference who had Asperger's, how it was interesting that she'd said that she felt that she was expected to behave neurotypically all the time. I felt following our review that I had been expected to be neurotypical and that even though my work was done well, I hadn't done well enough for them."

* I really need to find an internship for the summer, but after 2 months of spamming my resume to different companies I have a total of 1 response and the interview isn't until May so I have plenty of time to worry about it. I've never had a job before and just practicing it with my dad made me nervous.
* I've been really lonely ever since I started college almost 2 years ago. I went through all of freshman year without any friends except for maybe a couple of guys I worked on CS projects with, now I have a few more friends but they don't really have much in common with me. This college is considered the ""nerd Mecca"" for the region but I haven't managed to get to know any of the thousands of geeks like me that I see every day.
I hope this doesn't sound like I'm complaining about what kind of friends I have when I knew nobody a year ago, but in high school it was the same way but worse, and I was looking forward to knowing some guys I could just hang out with playing video games or talking about algorithms or something, not having to pretend that I'm interested in sports or the Lord of the Rings or something.
* I have Tourette Syndrome, and I was wrong when I thought it was no longer an issue. Usually no one even notices it but the strong emotions I've been feeling lately have been making it much, much worse, and I also discovered that I can get ""frozen"" in place and keep yelling or flailing my arms or whatever for 10 minutes or more, no matter where I am at the time. I usually don't show my emotions much so this is obviously not pleasant, and having TS attacks like that always makes me feel terrible for a couple of hours afterwards.
* Related to the 2 above points: I play the social game [Humans vs Zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_vs._Zombies) every semester, and it's usually a great break from everything, but this week it seems like it actually made my stress worse. When going to missions and such I just kept noticing how much the people my age were dividing into tight-knit exclusive groups, how many people I knew from previous games weren't talking to me and just how horrible I am at socializing in general. I am extremely awkward and shy except when around those that I know well and not many people are in that category.
* I'm bisexual (though I've decided that I'll probably just identify as gay, since I'm more attracted to guys and probably couldn't ever have a relationship with a girl) and told my parents 2 months ago. They were accepting but that wasn't the biggest challenge, because I've been either trying to repress Satan's urges or pretending that I'm straight for all of my life and it feels very strange not having to hide it. I still haven't told anyone else.

And that's all on top of the stress anyone goes through when studying Computer Science, I have to study for 2 tests and write a few C programs this weekend..."
1a11cc,477,2013-03-10,The German Volume Training Experiment: Completed,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1a11cc/the_german_volume_training_experiment_completed/,"Hello again fittit, I have returned. After 60 days of severe pain, soreness and discomfort, I am back to report in. It works, unfortunately for me, not as well as I was expecting.

THE WORKOUT:
I used the original can be found here: http://www.charlespoliquin.com/ArticlesMultimedia/Articles/Article/441/German_Volume_Training.aspx

And before you ask, it is NOT a weekly split, it is a FIVE day split (after day five, you repeat day one, you don't go M through F then rest all weekend.)

BACKGROUND:

I'll keep this short and simple. My background is a fatass who got into shape. This was and was me: [http://i.imgur.com/Duf7c.jpg
](http://i.imgur.com/Duf7c.jpg)

My routine before this was a modified SS program that I made work for me, the A/B day splits, and running 6.5 or 7 miles in an hour on T/Th.

I really have no expertise in lifting (high school or otherwise), and just did this because there wasn't anything on GVT in reddit that I could tell. Please pardon my lack of science.

METHODOLOGY:

The idea behind the routine, a LOT of volume at about 65% your max weight. There are two halves to this, the ""beginner"" half where you do 10 sets of 10 reps, and an ""intermediate"" half where you do 10 sets of 6 reps.

DIET &amp; SUPPLEMENTS:

This is pretty important. You gotta eat. More than probably what you just though. I ate a LOT of food. On days where I wasn't forced to eat fast food (seriously, I'm a full time student with 2 internships and a job. I literally COULD NOT get around it) my diet stuck almost exactly to this: [http://i.imgur.com/QF1tSmC.png](http://i.imgur.com/QF1tSmC.png)

Also, it is HIGHLY important to note that sleep is also important as your diet. I NEVER got less than seven hours of sleep except twice, and it made me absolutely miserable. My advice is to aim for 8 hours.

The supplements I took itemized:

* Package containing Oxan-VR, 3-Test-OXO, and NGH-t

* Orange Triad multivitamin

* Mega Shred fish oil

* Assault pre-workout

* Anabolic 60 whey 

DISCUSSION:

I was warned going into this that it is incredibly brutal. After doing it, I personally wouldn't recommend this to beginning lifters and would even have some reservations about some intermediate lifters attempting this particular program. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good program (I feel), but there are a few things that would concern me:

* Lack of discipline - this routine will pound your will power into the ground. If you aren't as mentally strong as you are physically, there is no way in hell you're going to make it past 100 squat day.

* Lack of proper form - it is VERY important you have good form while doing all of these lifts. I almost injured myself due to misunderstanding ""bent knee deadlifts"" was actually ""Romanian Deadlifts"" and attempted to slowly lower heavier than necessary deadlift weight.

* Failure to adhere to tempo - This is incredibly important - you can power through the workout no problem, but doing it at the prescribed tempo can literally make all the difference, since all the difference is doing this program right.

* Not knowing your limits - there were 3 instances of the 60 day span where I had failed during my lifts, once during an incline bench, nearly crushing my head. Another was during the close grip bench, providing a sore rib cage for a couple days. The last one was the bent over rows I was having difficulty doing correctly the first day.

* Joint pain - as you probably guessed, this particular routine is absolutely vicious on your joints. I wanted to cry on 100 dip days. The worst offender of this was just that day though, but it may be different for every body.

PROGRESSION:

The program went fairly well I think.

RESULTS:

I did all of my core lifts before going into the GVT program. The numbers before and after stayed remarkably the same, and my maxes even fault ""easy"" compared to how hard they use to be.

SQUAT - 315x5x3

OHP - 135x5x3

DEADLIFT - 405x5x1

BENCH - 225x5x3

PC - 185x5x3

I would also like to report there was no loss of strength during this program, and after the DOMS end I intend to see if I can get any gains from it.

Since I'm having a hard time getting a moment to add the rest, I figured I'd go ahead and state that I'll add the ""after"" BF% once the machine gets fixed at my university.

(Before BF% was 8.5....I'm GUESSING it is probably around 10-12% maybe?)

I am 19/m and she is 18/f.. her (now ex) boyfriend is 18/m. Just thought i would get the ages out of the way early. We will call her M and him Z.

[begin background] So M and I have known each other longer than Z has known her and had been going out with her. We met through one of my exes, when M helped me through rough patches with my ex's dad. He treated her like crap, took away her phone all the time, blah blah blah, LDR, blah blah blah. All you need to know is that M acted as a go between and from there we became really good friends. This was the summer of 2009, and we were long distance friends fro a long time.

Fast-forward, and i have broken up with first ex, just broken up with second, and had decided to try again with ex #1. In the process, i mentioned in passing that **it seemed like I only ever really fell in love with girls with birthdays at the end of the month** to M (remember this, its important). At the time, she was in a somewhat new relationship, maybe 4 or 5 months. End of 2009. Little did i know, **she had had a crush on me at that time, even though she was in a relationship**.

Fast forward again to the next summer, and i had broken up with ex #1 for good. Slowly but surely, I fell for M and I let slip that I liked her. She was still with her boyfriend and very much in love with him. But I didn't care and i just decided to wait on the outside, because I looked at this girl and I knew she was perfect, or at least I thought so. By the end of the summer, she had let slip about her crush she used to have but then immediately shut me down telling me that she had lost interest after me telling her about the girls Ive liked's birthdays (hers is at the beginning of may). Needless to say I was devastated, but not disheartened, so i continued to stand on the outside, waiting for my chance.

This continued for a few years. We became the best of friends. I spent a lot of my time fielding problems between her and her boyfriend. They fought quite a bit and he wouldn't want to hang out or talk to her much, but she loved him none the less and they lasted for quite awhile. 

In 2012 we both entered college, at the same university (coincidence), and so did her boyfriend. Things went well for a month or so, but then things went down-hill, fast. The fights became more frequent, he would take weeks at a time and not talk to or see her, and she was sad a lot of the time because of this. 

During this time, I decided to play a larger role in her life. I was the helping best friend that would go eat dinner with her and help with homework and pretty much anything she needed. 

Around christmas break, things got into a rough patch. I had made comments, though seemingly harmless, caused her to go into a tailspin and not talk to me for awhile. She hung with Z maybe once or twice in a two week span, but only occasionally sending me a text to tell me she was still alive. During christmas break, we had a huge fight which ended with me coming to the conclusion that **i was in love with the idea of loving her**. I had been depressed because she would not talk to me and I felt lonely, and she told me multiple times that she planned on marrying Z. **So i took this as a chance to try and find someone else**, so I wasn't left all alone after she did marry him. Much to my dismay, every attempt failed miserably, and I don't think i have been rejected more in my life. WIth each rejection, I started gravitating to M much faster. 

[background over]

Everything came to a head last weekend when her boyfriend decided to break up with her as soon as she told him she had received an internship across the country. Needless to say, she was devastated. It came seemingly out of the blue, he told her he did not want to date her ever again, and I was left picking up the pieces, which I did not mind at all.

Now, I had gone back on my previous statement, about only loving the idea of loving her, and was trying to show her that I really did love her, not just the idea of her. I came clean and outright told her that I still loved her, to which she responded that ""no you don't. you said so during winter break that you were in love with the idea of me. and you also tried getting with other girls, so you must not be serious.""

After explaining where I was at emotionally, and why i said the things I said, she said she was flattered but that she thought I shouldn't love her at all. I didn't want to take this as an answer, and decided to continue and wait a bit longer. Maybe she would love me back, right? right? Well we have hung out ever night this last week, because she couldn't stand the thought of eating alone nor being alone, and i have sorta played around and ""made moves"" while we watch stuff on hulu while we eat (arm around the shoulder, around her lower back, etc.). All of it though has been in jest.

so now I really have no idea what to do. Do i continue waiting and risk watching her fall in love with some other guy? Do i make a real move and just hope for the best? or do i just try to be supportive and let it go for the sake of our friendship?


Edit: the internship is only for next (fall) semester.

**TL;DR: I have loved a girl for a while now, only to be blocked by the fact that she had a boyfriend. He recently broke up with her and so she is now back on the market. What should I do?"

I am a french computer science student, and on the 1st day of April, I will arrive at Auckland for a four-month internship (at the UoA). Here is my problem: I still do not know where to live during this time.

And it's a shame, because I am exactly the flatmate you always wanted. I am clean, well-educated, I browse Reddit, I pay rent on time, I am not noisy but I am perfectly able to sleep in a noisy environment, I sympathize with basically anyone aaaand I am a great cook. Ever fantasized about the country which basically invented fine cooking? That's the perfect opportunity to try it at home, each week, for almost nothing (just enough discount for that the rent is not much more than 170$/week). Trust me: you will not regret it. We got five-dish banquets with three differents wines over here. 

That fancy presentation being done, a few boring-but-important details: I can not stand cigarette smoke (lung issues), I have nothing against animals (and if you have kittens, you will make my day), it would be nice if I could borrow some bedsheets from you (I am traveling to NZ by plane, so I must bring as few as possible), it would be awesome if I can borrow kitchenware (for the same reasons), I need an Internet access, and I think that's all.

Last thing: if you can't welcome me for four months but have a little space for me during the first (or the first two) weeks of April, that would still be a great help and I could still cook you some dinners.

I hope to hear from some of you! Do not hesitate to ask me further questions.

PS: Oh, also, if you have *two* free beds, a friend of mine (french computer science student too) might be interested, so please let me know!

1a3ujl,2,2013-03-11,I [20M] have not been in love with my girlfriend [20F] for 2 years in a 3 year relationship but can't bring myself to end the relationship because I value her wellbeing. Please. Please help me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1a3ujl/i_20m_have_not_been_in_love_with_my_girlfriend/,"Oh boy, where to begin. I'll keep it as short as possible if I can but 3 years is long time, from a relative standpoint in my life. Also, my prose is fucking terrible and I tend to ramble sometimes, please try to sift past my retardation. 

We started dating in senior year of high school after a long friendship since 6th grade. I was quite promiscuous in high school and seldom dated girls rather than just sleeping with them. But all the common stereotypes joined to bring us together. She had just lost a grandfather and was emotionally unstable and within this madness of emotion and confusion, we somehow slipped into a kiss and what usually follows a 6 year friendship of repressed feelings.

So, sexy hot sex ensued. Then suddenly we were dating 7 days after I took her lifelong best friend to prom. People were angry, happy and sad for us while we were blinded by our lust and compassion and promised to never leave each other. Things were good, I was accepted into a good school and she as well. 

The end of the summer comes and we agree to stay together and that nothing could bring us apart. School starts, problems arise. She stays entirely loyal but my old tendencies quietly linger. At one point, I stopped myself from putting on a condom while lying naked with a another girl. 

I don't tell and life goes on, I still love her after 9-10 months but after finding out that she has severe anxiety, insomnia, stress disorder, and a slew of other things, my feelings are wavering in midst of her breaking down emotionally to me all the time. She acts perfect one day and is an absolute nightmare to me the next. My friends are pissed because I can never see them anymore, my social life has become my girlfriend now. Nothing. No one else but her.

After about a year of long-distance, attending an engineering college, and having 2 internships, I decide I have no more time for a relationship or anything else but my career for that matter. I meet her at her school and tell her exactly what is on my mind with a somber tone. ""It isn't practical. We never see each other. I have no time. Our lives are not going in the same direction and this can only lead to resentment for both of us."" You know what she says? 

""If you really loved me, you'd make it work and not bitch out."" 

What the **actual fuck** am I suppose to say to something like that? Seriously, nothing I said countered her entirely invalid and unquantifiable rebuttal to our relationship. She said I never really loved her, that I used her for sex, cheated on her, etc... while crying hysterically and in a sad tone. She fucking guilted me man. She guilted me into not breaking it off with her. 

Fast forward to present day. Just imagine everything I've said so far about my relationship with this girl: ***rinse and repeat***. Nothings really changed. Sex has gotten so boring that I can't even get it up sometimes. I am 20 and healthy. I should not be experiencing that yet. I don't cheat on her but am presented in many opportunities that I can't pursue due to my loyalty and we meet once every 2 weeks with short phone calls every night. The past 2 years have been her using me for emotional and physical support while I get nothing in return. And everytime I try to end the relationship, she throws some Disney ass shit in my face like the first time. She doesn't get the hint at all. She has also put on a ton of weight. Like a lot of fucking weight because she is no longer playing any sports after high school. And as shallow this may sound, I can't even force myself to be attracted to her anymore. I imagine Angelina Jolie when we have sex. This stopped being a relationship long ago.

I come to you now, not for pity or attention, but for guidance. I am at a loss here. My grades have fallen, my friends are gone from my life, I am surrounded by women I cannot pursue, and my life belongs to someone else now. 

***How do I break up with her?*** Such a simple question but so difficult to actualize.

Her birthday is in two weeks, her parents love me, and I want to keep the break-up as painless as possible for her. I plan on waiting until after her birthday to do this by the way. 

TLDR; Dating girl for 3 years, 2 of which have been me living in sadness and resentment towards her. I don't love her anymore and can't find a good way to break the relationship while maintaining some form of civility between us. Please help me out. 

In any case, I am sorry to you guys for bringing my pathetic, first-world problems and asking you for help. I just don't know what to do and that scares the living crap out of me. "
1a3s7o,4,2013-03-11,I don't think I'm meant to get a M&amp;P Shield...,medic35g,CCW,https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/1a3s7o/i_dont_think_im_meant_to_get_a_mp_shield/,"I haven't been on the hunt for one for too long compared to some; just since September 2012. Which has been 7 long months. At first I was waiting for a shipment to come in to one of my LGS. They told me they would have about 8 coming in towards the beginning of October and to call back around then. So, wanting to support my local business, I waited until October and called. They told me it looked like it would be a little bit more of a wait and to keep calling back. So, I did. Towards the end of October with still no sign of a Shield coming in, I headed to my local Academy Sports to see what they had. They told me they had a waiting list for guns and that about 5 other people were ahead of me for a Shield 9mm. I quickly put down my name because that was about 25 less than another LGS that had waiting lists. I kept checking on my preferred LGS and around mid November I called and was told that they had received a shipment in of about 6 Shields, but all the 9mm's had sold and there was one .40 left. That day I had been in class until 1pm. So, I missed my CCW for college...I guess that's not a horrible reason. 

After that, I went by my Academy again to see where I was at on the waiting list. Spot 12. But wait, I was at spot 5...how did that happen? Apparently, the other guy had missed quite a few. I left even more defeated, feeling like I'd never get my Shield. I had been checking online stores before this and forums trying to get the jump, but because of either school or work I kept missing my opportunities. Fast forward to late January. I called my Academy to check up on my spot on the waiting list only to be told that, ""oh, sorry, we discontinued the list at the start of the new year because of high demand and blah blah, but you should have received a call letting you know..."". But I hadn't. So, I had been wasting my opportunities by not calling every shipment day. I was told, probably through pity, that two M&amp;P's were scheduled to be delivered that Saturday or Monday, but he didn't know if they were 9mm or not. But, guess what? I had to be at my internship both mornings, starting at 7:30am and the stores do not open until 8am. SOL again. Similar things happened to me about three more times, either through my internship interfering or some other obligations. I would call up as soon as I was free and would get told, ""yeah, we got one in this morning...but we already sold it"". 

So, this past weekend I went to a gun show in hopes of scoring a decently priced Shield. Just as I got up to one table and asked if they had a Shield 9mm, another guy piped up and said he had just sold it to this guy in front of him. I had missed it by mere SECONDS. That was real maddening. There was another guy selling one, buy he had it for $600 and I wasn't about to pay that when I could get it at my Academy for $150 less. And this brings us to this morning, 8:00am rolled around and I called my Academy. They said they had gotten in one Shield 9mm but they wouldn't set it aside for me. So I rushed around the house to finish getting ready and then rushed out the house, in my car, and towards my Academy. About half way there (only a 15 min drive) I am confronted with a yellow light. The guy in front of me looked like he was going for it, so I was going to go for it too. Then, as my luck would have it, he slammed on his brakes. Yup, I rear-ended him. Nothing horrible, minor paint damage and no one was hurt. This happened at 8:15 am. I got out to talk to the guy and he seemed to want to handle this on our own, no need for the police. But, a sheriff officer rolled up and about 40 minutes later I had a ""following too closely"" citation and an at-fault accident under my name. Called my Academy, just to check before I continued over there, and they had already sold it. Yup, I'm pretty sure it is not in my cards to have a M&amp;P Shield. I feel like giving up, especially now that I have a $500 deductible to pay. That's $350 more than I would have had to pay for the extra cost of the $600 Shield...and it's my money I had set aside for the Shield.

tl;dr - I kept just missing getting a Shield 9mm and got into an accident rushing to get a Shield. So, obviously, a Shield is not in my cards and I feel like giving up on my quest. "
1a3rag,11,2013-03-11,I'm just so stressed and I don't know where to put it all,stresseandfrustrate,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1a3rag/im_just_so_stressed_and_i_dont_know_where_to_put/,"So right now I'm living with my boyfriend, who is bound to graduate this spring. He's stressing about finding a job in his chosen field and has anxiety attacks which he talks to me to deal with. But I'm still having trouble finding an internship for the summer and all of the good ones are getting taken before I can even apply, because I'm busy and cover letters are a new thing for me. If I'm having anxiety about this I feel like my boyfriend's problems always takes precedence over mine and all we do is talk about his plans without taking mine into account at all.

Same with my friends. I'll try to hang out with friends in order to get my mind off this stuff but then they'll start talking about their problems with our mutual friends or how they aren't sure of their relationship with this guy that they're having sex with or [TW?] how they're having PTSD flashbacks from childhood trauma. Which is like okay, generally I'm a very supportive friend but as soon as they start talking I feel like I'm being a bitch to ask them to stop or just talk about something else.

And now I'm home for break and my grandma's in the hospital for the 17372th time because she refuses to stay healthy and I'm expected to go visit her. In addition, because I chose to go on a trip with my boyfriend over break instead of staying home, my emotionally manipulative mom is being her typical emotionally manipulative self and guilting me into staying even though the trip is already paid for. Even when I call home (when I'm not on break) it turns into her venting at me about how hard her job is or how her business partner is a [slur] or how annoying her family is. Sometimes I get to talk about the positive things in my life but whenever I complain she just sighs and tells me she has to get back to work.

On top of all of this is a really full plate for next year, the fact that I'm trying to work out long distance with my boyfriend, and my complete lack of marketability which is only compounded by my procrastination on job applications and such. I am so stressed and I feel like I have no outlet, and I just try to zone out and end up watching TV or playing video games for hours at a time. Then it's suddenly midnight and I've accomplished nothing and I feel like more of a failure than ever. But I can't talk about it to anyone because they all have such big shit going on in their lives that I can't possibly stress them out with my problems. And I feel like I have to do everything at once and I'm just. So. Overwhelmed.

*sigh* I'm just sick of being everyone's emotional crutch. I get strained too sometimes. And yes I know I would benefit from a therapist, making that first phone call is proving surprisingly difficult for reasons which are even more complicated but are very ingrained into my thoughts about seeking help for things.

So, how do I tell people to back the fuck off? I don't want to be a mere fair weather friend but sometimes I simply cannot handle everyone else's problems and my own."

When we met she was doing an internship at a company and it involved working all day, every day with her boss. She was his right hand women. He always used to send her texts with smileys and stuff and I told her it was weird but she said he was just being nice. She finished the internship about a month after we started dating. Around 2 months ago I flew overseas for 3 months but our relationship stayed the same. We loved each other and said we would wait the 3 months. I'm going back in a month. The day after I went away, since they were still in touch, she told him I went away and he showed up at her house and asked her if she wanted to come over for sex. She was obviously creeped out and told me. Yesterday, after not having talked to him for 2 months, she sent him a text asking him if he could help her out with a few things at her new job and they worked it out during coffee. She told me this innocently because in her eyes she saw nothing wrong with this. I obviously became pissed of and yelled at her on the phone. She says I'm overreacting. Am I right to be mad?"
1a23ex,5,2013-03-10,My dilemma: go to medical school or run a company...,throwaway_dilemma,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1a23ex/my_dilemma_go_to_medical_school_or_run_a_company/,"I have a dilemma that I am facing and I am confused on what I want to do; should I go to medical school or should I run a company that has potential to make a lot of money. 

I am a married 26 year old male with no kids at the moment.

I have been going to school for quite some time to finish my bachelors degree (in which I will be done this Fall 2013) and right now I am at the point of going to take my MCATs so that I can apply for medical school this coming June 2013. There is a high probability that I will be able to get into medical school here in the states and I'm not ""too"" worried about being rejected. 

Here is where the ""issue"" comes in, I have been offered to work with my brother and to help run his electrical company. We do both commercial and residential buildings with occasional renovation work for quick cash and as of right now we have a total bid amount of $16 million with more contracts in the works. 

My brother is well aware of my work ethics and he wants someone who is like-minded like him so that he can amplify the business and make more money. The idea is that the more money that can be brought in, the more money we both can make rather than him handling everything himself. Basically he's the CEO, CFO, and COO and he needs help to distribute the load and reduce the bottleneck effect as he's having a hard time being in two places at once. And this is where I come in.

He is also aware that I am trying to go to medical school and he's trying to essentially ""buy me out"" of medical school and work with him to run the company and make a lot of money.

I am torn on what I want to do, I've invested a lot of time and energy to pursue a career in medicine and I truly do enjoy it because everything in biology makes sense. I also enjoy what I am learning out in the construction field and one misconception that I would like to correct is that it's not just a bunch of guys swinging hammers. To be able to run a job site, you have to know how to handle the people who work for you and to be able to get what you want out of them so that it's a win-win situation. And in order to do that, you have to be able to think on your feet and understand the limitations of people on what they can and cannot do. There are a lot of mind games that you have to play to achieve your ending goal and I enjoy being able to do that.

I also have 4 years experience in working in a genetic research facility for a muscle wasting disease and the level of work that I was doing (without having an degree of any kind) was that of a Ph.D. It was basically an internship that lead to an employment opportunity later on. I was working on a Ph.D. level without being paid as one and that was fine for me because the experience that I've gotten could not have been gotten anywhere else, especially for an undergraduate student. On a side note, I am also a published author in various medical journals and one of those publications, I am a ""second author"" (this is a very big deal in the medical field). And because of this this experience that I've gotten, I am not worried about being able to get into medical school.

Basically to answer a question that may potentially come up, I enjoy both medical field and the construction field. They both offer me mental stimulation and perspective on people and how to troubleshoot when things don't work out the way you plan (construction field and laboratory work).

I will be able to make money both ways, but I don't know which one I should take, there are both pros and cons to each and I need help from people who are not biased towards me and to offer me insight or personal experience. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I will do the best I can to answer questions that you may ask or to expand on details where appropriate."

I'm planning on moving out to San Diego **awhile** from now...like in a year. But I'm big on making plans and trying to get things situated beforehand if possible, so I wanted to see if you all had any advice about where I should look for work (or specific companies I might apply to) when the time to move gets a little closer.

I'm fairly certain that most companies won't hire someone who lives across the country, so I have a feeling I'm going to have to move without a job lined up, so if someone (anyone? please?) wants to change my mind about that, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

As far as my background is concerned...
Graduated in 2010 with a B.A. in Communications
Graduated in 2011 with my M.S. in Professional Communications
Completed two internships in public relations during undergrad. Worked as an assistant college coach for two years (while completing my Masters and the year after). Worked in IT for a year as a Business Analyst (they hired me because of my background in writing, but really I wasn't right for this position).
Started working in marketing at a nonprofit in July, where I currently still work. I do social media, photography and videography of events, website administration. I also do a ton of writing...press releases, copy for the website, e-newsletters, and promotional materials.

I love what I do, and ideally I'd like to do similar work somewhere out there. I'd also *love* to work in communications/marketing/public relations in higher ed, but I've learned that even though I worked as a college coach for two years, most colleges/universities don't consider that enough higher ed experience to want to hire me to work at their school.

Again, I realize this is very early to be doing this, but I figure it's never too early to put out feelers and get some insight into what the process would be of lining up a job *before* I move, or soon after moving.

Any insight into moving as well would be appreciated...perhaps from anyone who has moved across country or significant distance.

And, anyone who just wants to tell me about how much you love San Diego, what brought you there, what part of the city you live in...I'd love to hear it all.

Thank you so much!"

I am a sophomore undergrad majoring in biology and pursuing a career in research. I'm having a weird today. On the one hand, I just secured an apartment for me and my boyfriend (yay!) but I also just got notified that I was rejected from another summer research internship that I applied to. This is the second one that has denied me, citing a high volume of applicants for a limited number of spots as the reason. I am still waiting to hear back from one more, but it is the least attractive option because this one wouldn't provide housing so I would have to come up with a plan to get there and still make money. I am taking on my own student loans so as much as I would love to just be concerned with doing something I like, making money over the summer has to be a priority for me.

I had noticed on the sites for these tow programs that I was rejected from they specifically note that the programs are designed for minority groups that are underrepresented in biomedical research to have access to graduate education. From what I'm gathering between that and the high volume of minority individuals who participate in these programs (as seen by their year to year group photos) is that while they say ""people of all groups are encouraged to apply"", what they mean is that sure, you can apply, but we won't actually care about your application if you're white.

I am a good student, I'm in the honors program at my school, and I've worked my ass off so far in college. I don't think it's very fair that I am not considered as qualified for these programs just because I'm not a racial minority. Anyone else having similar frustrations? Or know of something else I can do this summer that will look good on my resume?"

He was terribly wrong for what he did to a young intern in the oval office. Bill Clinton is no hero, he sexually abused a young girl in the white house, he is no hero. Any politician, who thinks Bill Clinton is a mentor or role model, is admitting that they have no loyalty, commitment or respect for the millions of Americans who have lost their lives in the past to protect our constitution. Fifty percent 50% of American families have moral boundaries and moral values, and ""rights"" to uphold the constitution upon the soil of America. Modern day lobbyist have creeped into our traditional politic's, and politicians like, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Andrew Cuomo, have disregarded our constitutional rights and laws that made us the most powerful country in the world. We the people, are worth more than the bullshit these politicians are shoving down our throats. We are not democrats, we are not homosexuals, we are not muslims, we are not baby killers, we are not illegal immigrants, we are Americans. Stop fighting to change our constitutional rights because those laws are what makes us a strong America, gay America is not a strong America, gay America is a manipulated America, and it will ultimately destroy our freedom and the respect of other countries around the world. The Constitution should remain in tack as is, where is, maintained, and nothing or no one should have the right to manipulate those American laws, not ever. Bill Clinton is a perfect example of why there should be no ""thought or opinion"" that is supported by a man like him, who is controlled by the influence of manipulation.

i responded with this:

LinkedIn Melissa Ulto has sent you a message. Date: 3/11/2013 Subject: RE: Bill Clinton admits he was wrong. as a bisexual woman and friend of many gay people, i find your message HIGHLY offensive. stop sending hate through linkedin. i will notify every gay organization and civil rights organization about your publication is that is your attitude toward your FELLOW AMERICANS.

she responded with the below which is just sick:

Melissa Ulto, don't you ever threaten me, I don't care about your gay and civil rights organizations, who the hell do you think that you are, huh? When you missy bi-sexual needed help many years ago I helped you, and told your story. How dare you think you got the balls to screw with me, if you want to be in the spotlight, I'll put you in the spotlight, bring it on! I will expose you, I'll do a followup story about you, the poor battered woman. You devious piece of garbage, you sound like a real bully pig. Don't you ever threaten me again, you got that? Remove yourself from my LinkedIn! You better stop bullying people young lady... you tell your gay and civil rights organizations to give me a call because my publication or my readers, are not going to take your threats lying down. To think I helped you, you piece of garbage. BTW, I don't care if you eat pussy or suck dicks, so don't try to shove your sexual preference down my throat because I don't!

i responded with this:

Thank you for giving me copious ammunition, you hateful person. Battered? Lol, we corresponded about me being ripped off by an investor you fuckwit. Your special kind of hate will be forwarded to everyone I can think of, because people like you don't seem to get we all have civil and human rights. Not so long ago women and POC couldn't vote. Remember when Italians were called WOPS (without papers)? What you are saying about immigrants is all kinds of hateful when you clearly don't get we were all immigrants to this country in our familial history. You need to bone up on human rights - if you believe in your own, how can you say you're more human than others? You sound like a Nazi, lady.

then Barbara sent this:

What the fuck are you talking about? You're a fucking bully who shoves your sexual preferences down straight people's throats, you are a straight people hater, this is your problem, you are always on the defense when someone does not agree with you! Too fucking bad, this time. I don't hate people, I help a lot of people and I have thousands of readers and contacts, who are gay, lesbians, straight, bi-sexual, immigrants, black, white, hispanics, Indians, and asians. I'm with Millions of Americans, who do not agree with gay marriage or who think illegal immigrants should not get a free ride through our borders. It's called the freedom of speech, and not only gay people like you have an opinion, straight people have an opinion too! You are so far off from the truth about me and this article, and you will not achieve anything from being devious, I promise you that.
The only difference between gay people and straight people is sexual preference, gays have the same rights as straight people in the bedroom. The U.S. Constitution refers to marriage being between a man and a woman, it has nothing to do with equality for gays and lesbians sexual preference. I support equal rights for gays, but, marriage is off limits because marriage is between a man and a woman. Gays and lesbians can not reproduce the population without straight sex, you need Adam and Eve to have a child. Marriage is between a man and a woman, and that is what I believe, this is the Word of God!
The message in the article I wrote is a metaphor, that just a selective few are being cared for in America, and all those people you mentioned are being squeezed into a corner and ignored. We are all immigrants here, we all have family members that are gay and we love them, we all have neighbors, that are muslims, jews, italians, africans, latinos, asians etc. but, we cannot allow our own rights to be diminished for anything or anyone. The United States Constitution, these are the principles that this land was built on, these laws are what makes America free, and if we start touching those laws we will become like the rest of the world. Do you want to live in a country like Egypt? No, you do not! That is why it is extremely important we uphold the Constitution of the United States of America.
It's best you move on... Melissa Ulto... This conversation is finished.

i got further messages from her threatening, blaming and accusing me off all kinds of things, and more hate speech.

She claims she is tied in with the Teamsters, local Westchester gov't and Albany. if this is true, that is concerning to me, and should be to many others.

We did an initial dox on her and found:

I'm a student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, and we usually just post our subleases on Craigslist, but the Craigslist pages for LA and OC are so messy, I'm not even sure where to start looking. Also, the CSU Uloop website housing pages aren't working for some reason, so I can't see those.

How much do subleases usually go for, if I want my own room (and possibly own bathroom)? What are the general subleasing policies? Anything I should be aware of, or any areas I should avoid?

For the last few months I've been an intern and have developed a site for a client. I was using a local environment on my computer, but yesterday the boss approved it and it was added to the company server - it went live!

But a curious thing happened.

I want a slideshow on the front page of the site. I coded the slide show in functions.php, using div names as the identifiers for the images to included. I made a custom post type which only has images uploads to populate the slideshow.

In page-home.php, I have a query to get the post type to build the slideshow. I create a Page myhomepage in Wordpress and set it as the default home page. It also contained some content, which I could access in the loop. Everything worked perfectly.

When added to the company server, however, the slideshow didn't appear, but the content did. I added a echo 'this is a test' to page-home.php, but it didn't appear, showing that WP was not using that file for the home page.

I worked around the problem by renaming it to page-myhomepage.php and now it's fine.

Can anyone shed any light on to why this would have happened?

Thanks!"

My band just finished tracking a 6 song EP in the studio when our drummer quit the band. When we replaced him, my boss suggested that we rerecord the EP, even offered to do it for free.

We decided that since we had the opportunity, we were going to keep three of the old songs and add 5 songs that we'd been working on for a while. My boss said he's do the three old ones for free still, and charge us regular price for the rest. We decided that even though it was another thousand dollars, we could make it work, and be happier with the final product.

Yesterday I was in a car accident that has put me in a really bad financial situation. I was going to be ponying up a lot of the cash for the new recordings, so we can't afford to do all five new songs.

I talked to my boss about it, and he's now saying that he's going to charge us to rerecord the old ones that were previously free, making the total the same about that we were going to pay for the full 8 songs.

I can't help but feel a little taken advantage of, and part of me thinks my boss was just trying to wring more money out of an already struggling band. Are we being unreasonable? I understand time is money, but we're $1000 in the hole from the scrapped recordings, and we need music to put out, and we need is soon.

TL;DR I'm afraid I'm being taken advantage of by my boss, and I need advice. It's really keeping me awake right now."

Anyways we were talking a bit the first month, but then when she told me she had a new partner I started NC. The NC has been almost 3 months.

I just came back a week ago from a great trip with new friends to NYC, and that really brightened my mood and got me back on track in terms of giving a fuck about things and being social.

So right now I'm happy without her.

BUT I still want her back. I still miss her. I think I still love her, but it's hard to know for sure when I haven't interacted with her at all. I still all those things, except I'm not torn up about it. I want it, but I'm not sobbing about it.

We both got internships and are going to be living within a mile of each other in Boston this summer, and I'm hopeful that by then she'll have broken up with the new girl and I'll have an opportunity to date her and win her back, and marry her (sounds silly to type that because it's so unlikely but I imagine the slow process of getting her back often).

So I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess because I want advice? But do I? idk...

1a83ll,3,2013-03-13,You have no idea. No idea. ,GameOfGuys,circlejerkcopypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerkcopypasta/comments/1a83ll/you_have_no_idea_no_idea/,"Really? Are you fucking serious? Okay then. 

&gt;You're tall, hot, blonde, great figure. Nice rack, too, since this is imaginary. You're a just-graduated university student, starting out at some firm so you can build your way to the top. You've been in this job a couple of weeks.

&gt;You like coffee. Trim flat white with one sugar please, as always, the same every day. You go to a new cafe this morning, because you parked on a different street. Guy behind the counter is at least twenty years older than you, he gives you a smile, he waves your fee.

&gt;It's awkward. You're making your own money now, you don't need shit bought for you. You know it's cause of your legs, your long hair. But how can you refuse? It's rude, is it not, to say no? So you smile politely and go to sit down, picking up the paper on the way.

&gt;The coffee is brought over, and he gives you another grin. It's creepy, and you're uncomfortable from the way he stares. His eyes look you up and down, all around, and there's a little chuckle. But you don't say anything - he gave you a free coffee, didn't you? It's a favour, isn't it?

&gt;You leave earlier than usual, too bothered by the way he looks at you. You go to work, settle in at your desk, and get out the proposal you've been working on for weeks. It's good. You know it's good. It's solid and well thought out and perfectly exhibits that you've paid attention throughout your degree and throughout your countless internships.

&gt;Once the senior partner meeting is over, you take a deep breath. You're ready to approach a man you haven't spoken to before, someone who's not involved in staff management at all.

&gt;You stride over and say hi. He looks you up and down, smiles kindly, and asks what you want. Asks if you're looking for Rita, the secretary. You frown, and realise he thinks you're an office junior and not aiming for his job. You say that you've got a proposal for him, and he peers at you carefully. He takes you into his office, and you know it's because of the way your hips move. But that's okay, a leg up now and then is good, right?

&gt;You demonstrate your proposal, aware that his eyes follow your waist and not your pages; aware that he's only half listening and altogether too focused on your lips. You finish, take a deep breath. He thinks for a bit.

&gt;'Nice work, sweetie,' he says. You freeze up. 'You can go now.' Like you're nothing more than a child. He's not talking to you at his level, he's talking down - the worst thing in the world to you.

&gt;You're so embarrassed. So embarrassed that you tried and you proved yourself and it's still not enough because no one can get past the healthy flush on your cheeks and the way your eyelashes meet them in a sweeping motion every time you blink. You fume all day, and cringe when watch him shake hands with another employee at the same level as you. Equals. From the moment you met him, you've been a girl - not a woman, you're too pretty for that - but a girl.

&gt;You leave at the end of the day feeling dejected, and go to the bar to meet a couple of male friends.

&gt;A glass of wine later and you feel a little better. Your friends are on form, making you laugh as usual. A few minutes later, you get a drink brought over, paid for by the man-sitting-at-the-end-of-the-bar. You sigh. It's kind of him, and it would be rude to reject, but you don't want to give the wrong idea. You shrug and drink it, smiling nicely but slightly awkwardly, hoping he doesn't think you're keen.

&gt;You start to leave around ten o'clock. You've got work tomorrow, after all. As you gather your things and head to the door the man who gave you a drink comes over. He's frowning slightly, and quite drunk. He asks if you enjoyed your drink, and you affirm. You start to leave, he's standing uncomfortably close.

&gt;He doesn't let you. He asks you where you're going. You explain that you want to go home. He growls. 'But the drink. I gave you a drink.' It dawns on you. He doesn't care that you're tired, all he cares about is that he gave you a drink. You're obliged, now, to be thankful. To give him what he wants. Because he gave you a drink. Like the coffee, it's entitlement.

&gt;It's the assumption that just because you're gorgeous you're available. As though your beauty makes you an object. As though, like the 'asking for it' rape rhetoric, your genetic makeup means you're allowed to be stared at. Drooled after. Used. Who cares that you have a brain under there? That you've worked hard? That you've written a novel, that you're a talented musician, that you're exceptional at netball, that you're a multidimensional creature with hopes and dreams that don't stop at the colour of your hair and the light in your eyes?

&gt;You have to work twice as hard. You have to be twice as cold. You have to be ruthless and standoffish because the slightest nicety means you'll never be more than sweet little girl. You don't get to be kind to people, even though you're genuine at heart; because that's not seen as ambitious. Your personality isn't allowed to enhance your appearance, like normal people, because then you appearance is all that matters. All that anyone sees.

&gt;You walk home in silence, arms folded across your chest to keep away the cold. A truck drives past, some kind of construction, and a horn sounds. A man sticks his head out the window, makes a wanking symbol. You blush. You're not a whore. You keep walking, faster, until you get to your flat and collapse on the sofa.

&gt;'You're pretty,' they say. 'You must get everything. You never have to pay. Just bat your eyelashes and you get given all you want.' But that's not how you want to be seen. You want to be an equal, not someone so incapable that they can't purchase their own vodka. You want to be valued for your brain and not your figure; you want to be paid for your work and not your uterus. You don't want to be that pretty girl at the office, you want to be the most valued intellect at the company.

&gt;You're a pretty girl. But you're not public fucking property, and you're not worth less than men simply because they can't see past your fucking face.

You have no idea. No idea.

1a7kao,9,2013-03-13,I've been thinking about Seminary education.  What is /r/reformed's thoughts?,devoNOTbevo,Reformed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/1a7kao/ive_been_thinking_about_seminary_education_what/,"Hello.  I am very interested to see what all of you have to say about this.

First of all, this is motivated by the fact that I applied to a seminary for next year and didn't get accepted.  Through that I've felt like God might lead me down a path that doesn't include seminary education.

Seminaries obviously do a lot: they teach you a ton of historical theology, systematic theology, original language exegesis, and plenty of academic knowledge.  If gone through correctly, seminary can really equip one to be a powerful minister of the Gospel.

But many today feel that seminaries aren't doing what they can to be ""connected"" to the local church.  They pull you away for 2-5 years, most students don't get their ""hands dirty"" while they are there, and you really don't experience what everything looks like ""on the ground"".  Which is fine, it's not designed to do that, but maybe seminaries are more meant for academicians or those called to high-level peoples.  

This is why I am intrigued by church-based education institutions (c.f., BCS - MN) and church-planting residencies.  I am considering a pastoral internship, myself, and feel that with this more ""underground"" route, the only thing I'm missing is original language exegesis.  That's a huge deal, don't get me wrong, but it can be augmented with the technology we have today.

My take? I think it would be healthy to see more church-based training and let seminaries be for high-level ministers (professors, some pastors, etc.), while continuing to establish a connection between these two levels of education.  What are your thoughts?

**tl;dr** What are your thoughts on seminary?"

Can't sleep. Just had one of those dreams that mind fucks you abruptly awake.

I'm sitting at my desk at work, I just reactivated my Facebook account that i deleted nearly a year ago and towards the top of the home page I see a recent post written by my best friend - let's call her Sarah.  I can't remember what it was but it was poetic gold when i was reading it and it felt like it was about me.  Seemed to be a song quote but i woke i knew it was just something my mind made up versus something from a real song.  A 4 line stanza, the last being ""upset about a man along my way.""  I took a screenshot and then my boss, asked me to go over some bullshit paperwork. That's when i woke up.

My girlfriend's last day of outpatient rehab was last night.  I hadn't even bothered to talk to her all day - even though i G-chatted Sarah all day and texted her all night which is a daily routine - but i just woke up and saw a text from my girlfriend that said ""I'm a normal person again!!"" Her final court date is today.  She had been an alcoholic pretty bad for a couple years but is going with - ""I was just going through a bad time in my life and got overwhelmed but now I can go back to drinking socially again.""  She got a DUI parked, passed out in her car, in front of her apartment with the engine running and a BAC of .436…. yeah.

We'll see what happens….

I read this post on reedit yesterday which is probably why i had the dream I had earlier, not that this helps my confusion at all…

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1a5b0w/redditors_that_eventually_got_in_a_relationship/ 

While my girlfriend was being an alcoholic and never really being the person I wanted to be involved with, I was dating Sarah and everything was great - except it was never official with her and on the side I would occasionally date my now girlfriend - when she felt like it and it worked out for her schedule of ""balancing"" people in her life. There's literally been a thousand times when I should told her to go fuck herself and never looked back, but eventually she wanted to start dating me and it's what I had wanted all a long right?  She held out on the sex for 9 months but gave truly awesome blowjobs.  I briefly cut it off completely with Sarah and she was upset for a while but we remained friends and slowly we basically became BEST friends again - minus the sex of course.  

I feel like i've been dating two girls for the last 2 years! I have more fun with Sarah because she's like my best friend, but it feels like there may be more of that romantic junk with my girlfriend. Yet at the same time, I kind of miss my girlfriend when I'm hanging out with Sarah and I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up my girlfriend and take a chance with my best friend.

Ready for the kicker(s)?

My girlfriend was raped in highschool and that kid (who is now a cop) has been harassing her for the last 2 years since she moved to the town we both live in now.  Those bad memories came up and apparently led her to drinking and become this person that's made a lot of bad choices and has lied to be about stupid things many times. I can't really trust her even though I know her heart is pure love and she truly is a REALLY REALLY good person and would do anything for anyone.  She is a little ditsy sometimes though, certainly a people person and she always says ""i can talk to a wall.""

Sarah was a virgin until she was an intern at my company and met me. We're best friends and I'm like 99% sure that she still hasn't had sex with anyone else.  I don't know how you go through college and not get laid but w/e.  No she's not clingy, she's actually madddd cool and chill about EVERYTHING which i love.  I just don't know if I LOVE her for all that.  She's a little immature in the way she acts, probably because she's never had other relationships and is a fun and bubbly person.  The virgin thing - w/e… My brother and his now fiance were both virgins when they met freshman year of college and according to my brother they've never known anyone else.

My girlfriend is HOT, my best friend is pretty.  I've taken polls from other sources.

Part of me wants to finally give my girlfriend a chance now that everything is out on the table and she's not an alcoholic anymore, part of me wants to go back to dating my best friend when things were / still are cool, relaxed, easy and fun. Oh by the way, she just moved to the town my girlfriend and I live in last week (4 blocks from my apartment).  My girlfriend and I do not live together.

I also have been infected with a virus that doctors are baffled by.  15 months ago I go the standard flu shot and have never been the same.  My legs tingle and spasm so much that i need drugs to sleep, I have mental brain fog, headaches, neck pain and general pain throughout my entire body.  I've had every test known to man, MRI's, blood tests, muscle biopsy, spinal tap.  Everything is negative which is good but i literally feel like im being tortured everyday because of the intense pain.  It's become difficult to live life.  And that's the short version, it's seriously a fucked up thing I'm trying to live with and figure out, doctor/hospital visits are my life. I'm sure this all effects my judgement since I can't even be the person i want to be, not to mention bring someone else into my life even though i know both of them really want to be there. I don't want to lead either of them on but I don't know what I want myself either.

So, and to quote Eminem, ""to anyone who's ever been through some shit your lives"" - what's your advice?"

 I am a terribly insecure person - never had a gf, always extremely self conscious, socially awkward and always feeling inferior, at the age of 22.  Anyway I wouldn't say I ever had a porn addiction, but I did masturbate frequently, once a day on average and typically to online porn. I say not addicted because I found it pretty easy to kick myself out of the routine if needed (e.g. focus on work, holiday etc.)

So 2 months ago I stopped masturbating for just under 2 weeks, realising that I needed some confidence in the job interviews to come. I was applying to internships and I was accepted into all of them. At the time I couldn't say it was thanks to NoFap, because I am generally much better at interviews than real life social interaction, but looking back on it I remember feeling really confident in that period, so perhaps it did help.

Anyway, after those 2 weeks I gave in to my urges and had a 3 day masturbating spree or something. I wouldn't say I had the feeling of guilt as some people mention, because personally the only part of NoFap that interests me is whether it has a positive attitude on my confidence, and not the idea that masturbating is a 'dirty' or 'wrong' thing to do. 

Moving forward, I had another two, 2 week noFap periods. I realised that I *actually* felt a lot better about myself in those periods, and that my sense of insecurity increased a LOT when i was back to masturbating (i.e. always feeling like shit looking in the mirror, having a weak and nervous voice etc.) 

In fact there is the reason why I decided to open a reddit account and share my experience so far. I was back to masturbating since 3 days ago and yesterday I was going at it like crazy. I then woke up at 5AM from a 'nightmare'. I can't remember what exactly happened in this nightmare, but it was basically me in college being a total creep towards this girl I like but have never spoken to or anything. In the dream I added her on facebook (no idea why) and later on I checked my notifications and one notification was ""____ accepted your friend request"" and a more recent one was ""____ is no longer friends with you"" (presumably as a result of seeing my profile etc.) I then woke up after the horror of rejection in the dream. Realising how pathetic this whole nightmare was, I looked back on the periods where I wasn't fapping, and how much less insecure I was. This forced me to write this post, and I am now looking forward to trying to break that 2 week barrier I can't seem to get past!

I hope the rest of you also see the benefits in nofap!"
1a7fqt,4,2013-03-13,"She doesn't deserve this letter, but it's not for her, it's for me.  ",I-am-IRONMAN,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1a7fqt/she_doesnt_deserve_this_letter_but_its_not_for/,"2.5 year relationship ended 6 months ago.  I have made significant strides in the past few months, and especially in the past few weeks.  I used to randomly experience these ""phases"" where I genuinely felt like forgiving her and moving on with grace.  They usually lasted a few hours and random points during the day.  Then I started waking up in a calmer state and the anger didn't seep in until I was halfway done with my day.  Now, I think I've finally reached a point where it feels real, like it isn't just another ""phase,"" but an actual state of acceptance. 

I haven't decided if or when I'll send this letter.  It was a HORRIBLE relationship.  She was so selfish and insecure that I felt like I was going crazy dealing with her.  A part of me feels like she doesn't deserve this, but I want to send it because my decision to forgive her has nothing to do with her.  I'm doing it for myself, so I can turn the page on this chapter of my life, and start writing the next.  **Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Dear, [EX-GF],

I hope this letter finds you happy and well.  I’ve been hanging onto some thoughts for a while now and I felt that it was time to put the crux of these thoughts on paper and share them with you.  Before I begin, I want to make it clear that I sent this letter for my own sake and not because I want to rehash the past with you.  I have no expectations about what happens after you read it.  I won’t even know if it reached you, so please don’t feel obligated to respond (or read) if you don’t want to.  Also, I really hope the letter sounds as sincere and honest as the way I wrote it.  Seriously, there is no anger behind these words, just genuineness.  

First, I want to apologize for pushing you so far that you had to consider calling the police just so you could move on from a break-up.  I may not agree with it, but I completely understand why.  I didn’t think that I was acting dangerous (but you did and i suppose that's what matters the most) or anything like that, but when someone doesn’t leave you alone, I’m sure eventually you get to the point where you feel like you have to do something drastic to make them stop.  You must have been so frustrated…I’m so sorry for doing that to you.  On a slightly different note, I hope you understand why it took me so long to send you this letter…I didn’t want to make things worse by forcing an apology onto you too soon.  

Please forgive me for everything else that I’ve done over the years.  I loved you with everything I had.  I hope you know that I never intended for things to go bad between us, let alone get this messy.  I regret that I lost sight of myself and slowly turned into a stranger.  I feel terrible that you had to go through that with me.  I swear, I fought back against my depression as hard as I could for as long as I could, but it wasn’t enough and for that I am sorry.  

Regardless of all the crap, I am thankful that you and I shared a part of our lives with each other.  You were the first girl to say “I love you” to me; falling in love with you is one the best feelings I have ever felt in my life!  I couldn’t forget that even if I tried!  Sure, I also experienced a lot of pain because of our relationship, but pain is a part of life.  Some people aren’t meant to be together or maybe they didn’t meet at the right time - whatever the case, all I know is that even though my life was turned upside down for a while, I’m still standing.  I’m still here, and I’m better off for having this experience.  None of it would have been possible without your direct and indirect contributions, so, thank you.  

I hope you are happy, healthy, and that life is treating you well.  Good luck to you and (new guy) - may everything work out the way you want it.  Also, I hope your sister’s pregnancy is going smoothly and that she and the baby are healthy.  Same with the rest of your family, including your grandma - I hope she has recovered from whatever health difficulties she was experiencing.  Good luck with school!  You must be applying for internships these days, so I hope you kick ass on those interviews and that you get the one you want!  Seriously, good luck with EVERYTHING! 

Lastly, I have no idea where life will take me after graduate school.  Someone once told me that I had a gypsy soul to blame and that I was born for leaving, so, like a gypsy, I may end up somewhere totally unexpected.  Hell, I may end up moving to Europe.  Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that I don’t expect to see you again once you leave town.  Actually, I have a very strong feeling that I’ll never, ever see you again, not even before you leave.  To be honest, thinking about that makes me a little sad.  It reminds me of a quote I read a while ago - “The two hardest things to say in life are hello for the first time and goodbye for the last.”  I’m tearing up a little just thinking about this being the absolute last goodbye, but, you know, that’s how life works sometimes.  I don’t know, maybe I’m just being dramatic.  Still, if we happen to cross paths again in the future, I hope you won’t be too shy to say hello.

So, with that said, here is a sweet little song (Jack Johnson - Go On) to bring the curtains down on the ____ &amp; [EX-GF] show.  I hope you like it!  I guess that’s it…take care of yourself, panda.  

Love,
XYZ

1a7b3k,1,2013-03-13,3 year long FWB relationship and I(20/f) don't know what to say to him(20/m).,throwawayxxx212,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1a7b3k/3_year_long_fwb_relationship_and_i20f_dont_know/,"Well, this is a really weird and fucked up situation. We will call this guy John. John and I met our freshman year at college, within the first two months of being here. We hit it off quite well and were ok friends. We didn't really hang out outside of partying together, but eventually he came home with me one night and we had sex. It was incredible, but I was also going through I guess what you would call a ""self discovery"" stage and was literally fucking everyone I found attractive (Which was probably around 20-30 guys my freshman year of college... Ugh.) ANYWAYS, we were friends with benefits. He was one of my favorite people to invite over and shit. We'd go out and get super trashed and then I'd bring him back and we'd fuck for hours and then wake up and get breakfast, chat a little bit, and leave. 

That's basically how this went all year. I knew he didn't want a relationship, and neither did I. It was extremely casual and I just thought he was a cool guy, although a little bit of a pervert and he always tried to push my boundaries, which I liked, honestly.

Anyways, the next school year, I stopped ho-ing around and had a boyfriend. A guy I really liked and who treated me ""like a lady"" I guess you'd say.  He took me out on dates and really tried to impress me and makes me feel special.  It ended up being a really shit relationship, that just ended recently. But on our ""off"" periods of this relationship, I'd always go back to John.

The first time I went back to him, we both really opened up to each other. He told me his HS gf had cheated on him and he wasn't interested in getting into any kind of relationship because he still was shaken and had trust issues. I told him about all the shit that went down in my ""relationship"" which included physical violence, and how I was struggling with suicidal ideations etc. He was really there for me for that couple of days. Then I got back with the ex and we didn't talk for a while.

Then the second time, we had sex. Really good sex, but it wasn't the same. He didn't open up to me at all and it was purely physical. We hooked up right before one of his ""big exams"" and so he was stressed and didn't want to talk. We didn't actually hang out. Just fucked. Then I got back with the ex again.

Then there was summer, where he sent me all of these texts about how he missed me and how lonely he was at his internship.  I told him my feelings went deeper then physicality and he told me that I need to cut off the ex, but to NOT DO IT FOR HIM, because he was not going to date me.  I wouldn't have done it for him, but that really hurt because then I basically cut off contact with him halfway through the summer, until fall. 

He messaged me when he was back on campus, ex and I were currently ""off"" again, and John didn't seem all that interested.  I told him I wanted him to come over probably 15 times in a week. I finally just went over to his frat house and made him talk to me. He ended up getting really angry at me, and since I was drunk, I overreacted and looked like a fool. Walked home around 2 am. 3 am comes around, and he shows up all apologetic and tries to tell me he's sorry. I'm still drunk.  We end up getting all hot and heavy and we have sex. It was not the same as before, it was really short, and then he told me he was leaving and I started crying and buried myself under the covers. He told me to stop doing this and that I ""Knew what to expect from him"" and that I was just being ridiculous. He slammed my door on the way out.  I sent him a lot of scathing texts saying how I really cared for him and all he saw me as was somewhere warm to stick his ween. He was a huge jerk about it.  

Then I saw him again a few weeks later. Drunk, again. He told me to come home with him after the bars, I did. This is a really, really painful memory to recall, and I hate even thinking about it.  We were going to have sex regularly and he told me he ""didn't want that"" and that he wanted to put it in my butt. I was drunk, I said ummm okay...... and he did. And it hurt so bad. I told him to please stop and that I really couldn't handle that. He didn't stop and kept going harder and harder. Luckily I involuntarily started sobbing and he finally quit because he didn't want me to wake anyone else up. And then he rolled over and fell asleep. That was the last time any ""intimate"" contact was had between us. If you'd call it that.


I left the next day extremely early before he even woke up. I was so ashamed/shocked that he would ever do something like that to me when I was crying/begging him to stop killed me. He texted me about something and I told him I really am not okay with what happened but did not say the words rape or unwilling or anything to indicate that... He ""apologized"" or whatever the fuck you'd call it, and that was that.

I still have feelings for this guy.  I realize what happened was... basically rape. I'm not excusing that. We were both REALLY REALLY drunk, though and I'm not sure if he realizes exactly how badly he hurt me.

He's studying abroad right now, and I deleted him off of facebook and everything. I'm finally away from the crazy exboyfriend, and the only guy I can even think of is him. I don't know what to do reddit. I realize people are going to come in here with flaming pitchforks saying ""he's a fucking rapist etc etc!!!!"" but again, we were both drunk out of our minds. 

I've been seeing this guy in this way for 3 years. We used to have the most incredible hookups ever. He also opened up to me and I really opened up to him. I, honestly, want to be with him. I want to be in a relationship with him. I don't know how to tell this to him when he approaches me when he gets back without seeming ""desperate"" or something. I also want to talk to him about what he did to me that night because I know if he knew how badly it fucked me up, he would be very sorry. He's got a great family and he isn't a bad guy.  I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: FWB with guy for 3 years on/off between relationship and being single. I have feelings for him and want to act on them now after he previously told me ""I know what to expect from us being together in this way"". I want a relationship with him but I don't know how to approach that when he gets back from being abroad this semester."

I've applied to several jobs already, but since I haven't heard back from anywhere yet I figured I might as well ask you guys. 

Thanks!

edit: I am pursuing a degree in electrical and computer engineering, but any type of entry-level engineering internship would be great. Or, I guess, anything else that would require more brainpower than standing behind a cash register all summer."

I've been at war with my current daily driver, 2002 Mazda Millenia and all the work it's needed, it's draining me completely. 

I really only had the chance to go see the car and drive it a little. I have yet to ask about any history of the car or take it to a dealer to get it checked, though I plan on doing that if i become serious about buying it.

The local Dealer wants $5,000 for it and though i feel that is fair, i wonder if I can bargain him down a little.  

It drove like an absolute dream, I fell in love with it as soon as i turned it on. (First time driving a bimmer by the way.) The outside was almost flawless, with just a tiny bit of rust over the passenger rear wheel well. Though the interior leather seems to be a little worn out, but that may just be that it is a 12 year old car.

I am just worried that with 155,000 miles on it, it may not have been maintained very well, and will just cause me as much, if not more grief than what I am dealing with now

Please tell me what you think. I do plan on buying a new car soon as i should be getting a good internship over the summer and will be able to afford something nice, but getting a good used car now will allow me to be able SAVE all that good money i will be making, as i have no savings anymore now because of the mazda.

I will be able to answer any questions, and sorry if i forgot any details."

1a6vl8,3,2013-03-12,Rapidly declining amount of sex since new years. GF Blaming new living situation.,throwie123123,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1a6vl8/rapidly_declining_amount_of_sex_since_new_years/,"Me (22m) and GF (23) moved into a new, smaller place at new years. Since then we've had sex two or three times.
We got together last november and before that we were off and on for about a year. (commitment issues)
We've always (if it wasn't an off phase) had sex at least three times a week, usually every day.
This is a short summary of our time together: (Remember that she has always been completely honest, this is why I trust her at the moment)


* Started out as FWB
* I fell in love, she cut me off.
* Late night text from her, ended up as FWB again.
* She slowly showed lack of interest, she spent the night with some guy (no sex though), another off.
* At a party ended up fooling around again, on again.
* She started getting feelings for another guy, off again.
* She lost feelings for that guy, on again. (At this point started to say ""I love you"")
* Summer came, long time apart, she called me up and said ""I've lost feelings, it's over"" off again. (Again didn't sleep with anyone else)
* I ""rebounded"" with mutual friend (strictly casual)
* Met again after summer, she got sad when I told her I had sex with someone else, and we went back into FWB. (brutal simplification)
* A couple of months later we went into a relationship.
* Ended up at the same place in another country for internships til May. Moved in together naturally.
* In the beginning we lived with another guy in the same room so naturally not that much sex.
* New place we're alone and actually having less sex.


So, basically my GF is blaming our uncomfortable living situation for lack of sex drive. We both do feel that we don't have enough space, and it is tiring to live THAT close. We're talking 10 square meters. However it doesn't affect my sex drive at all. There are the usual excuses as well ""I have a head ache."" ""I feel sick."" ""I'm sooo tired.""


However she does masturbate and she doesn't want me to be involved in that. She wants it to be ""quick"" and just for going to sleep easier. The actual fact that we don't have sex that often I can live with, but the teasing of her masturbating right next to me and knowing that she prefers to sexually please herself is still hurtful.


We have talked about this several times and when I claim that ""I feel like you're not that attracted to me."" She responds with ""I just don't want to have sex. I can't get in the mood here, I feel depressed with this living situation""


The thing that bother's me the most is that she says things like:

* Sex seems to be the most important thing to you.
* That was nice, let's do that every time (If we had reeeally quick sex, like 2-3 minutes)
* Why aren't you that fast with me? (I masturbated in bed out of sexual frustration, really quick)


Just writing all this stuff seems super weird, and I know our relationship is very weird, but we're open with everything. It's just this part that's been bugging me a lot lately, cause it doesn't feel like we speak the same language.


**I know she's very truthful and that she doesn't want to hurt me, however I'm wondering if she subconsiously wants to be with me at all, any advice?**


Side note: There is no suspicion of an affair."
1a6t1o,1,2013-03-12,[21/m]Just got out of a fucked up LTR(details inside) and I've met this girl [21/f] and I really don't know what to do.,ihavenoideaforaUN,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1a6t1o/21mjust_got_out_of_a_fucked_up_ltrdetails_inside/,"Throwaway cause we might have friends in common who browse Reddit.

So here's a little background about me. I've been with my ex since we were both 18 and she left me about 2 months ago. My ex was in a weird state of mind. When she didn't want to do something or was scared of that said thing, she wouldn't do it. Let's say she had a strong personnality. So it happens that she was afraid of dick getting inside her. It was too painful she kept telling me and needless to say she didn't have a high pain tolerance... Anyways, long story short we never made love together. We had other things but never the complete act.

As you can already tell I loved that girl with all my hearth. It didn't bother me that she didn't want to make love with me so I stayed with her until 2 months ago. She proceeded to tell me that it was hard for her to know that she wasn't satisfying me... that she couldn't live with that any longer and had to put an end to our relationship. As you might expect I was flabergasted. I was the one who was suppose to leave her because of her problem and now I was the one being left. It broke my heart. With all the efforts I'd put in this relationship she wasn't able to put a little one herself. 

The next 2 weeks were the roughest of all my life. I had moved from the city I study in to take an internship where she was going to school so we could live together. I was fucked. Thanks to my uncle, I now live with him. I don't know anybody down here except for my uncle. So for these 2 weeks I was getting up, was barely eating then went to work only to come back and lay on my bed waiting for sleep to come.

After 2 weeks I had an epiphany. One of my friend's friend had had the exact same thing happen to him, minus the sex part. He was writing a blog and I stumbled upon one of his entry, the first after his break up. It was then that I realized that change was a good thing. That I had to go on with my life and that she just didn't know what a mistake she had made.

That was a bit huge for a background but you kinda had to know all this for the rest of the story.

So fastforward 3 weeks ago. A girl friend from university (in my original city) is organising a party so I can meet knew people and hang out with my friends. So there's this girl I know a little bit. She was in a couple of my class and I talked to her a little bit since she was friend with my friend. Not that it matters a lot but definitely a 9/10. So we were all getting a little tipsy and my friend let slip something along ''She wants you. Alot!'' Keep in mind I was still a virgin. Well the alcohol sealed the deal and I ended up at her place. I woke up the next morning, nothing is awkward we talked like nothing had happened. She gives me her number and I had to leave. So I'm back at my uncle's for the week and we texted alot. She was just my type. Funny, not afraid to sound silly just perfect. We meet again the next friday and we have a great night that ends up in non-drunk sex. So we keep this trend of meeting on fridays (she has to leave to see her family and work during the weekend) and we are now at the end of the story. 

The way she talks about us leads me to believe she wants something serious between us. I would want something serious with her for sure if it wasn't of my recent breakup. I am only single since 2 months and I feel that I would waste that opportunity if I settle down so fast. Plus I'm going to live in a house with 6 of my buddies all summer long. So that's my head talking. But if I listen to my heart, damn this girl is the real deal I mean gorgeous, funny everything you can expect from the perfect girl. 

That's it. I don't know what to do... Should I enjoy the good time with her until she explicitly tell me she wants something serious? Should I just tell her right now that given the situation my reason tells me to not get involved even if my heart is falling for her? I've talked about this to a couple of my friends but they surely told me not to get involved so I wanted an outsider's point of view.

I'm not really sorry for the long post since it was good to just let it all out. Thanks for your time.

I've always felt that the official lore Riot is providing is somewhat lacking and could really be much more extensive. In order to improve that, I think that they need to be aware how much some of us want to read more lore.

Since I'm a big fan of LoL lore and I love to write, I'm going to send an application for an internship for the creative design department in the next few days (applications can only be sent until the 15th).

So why am I telling you this? Riot requirements for internships are quite harsh, and although I already have a portfolio, I want to show them something LoL related. So, I decided to start writing lore for LoL that consists of the battles that are happening between the nations on Summoner's Rift.

I've posted those on Reddit but unfortunately, besides for a few very supportive comments, I didn't get much of a feedback on what I can improve.

This is where you come in. I really need your help with reading my story and letting me know what can be done better or what parts you like.

I know this is a lot to ask, but I promise that if I ever get to work for Riot, I'll try to push for more official lore so we can all enjoy this amazing game even more!

If you're still reading this, please help me out by reading the chapters that I've already written and letting me know what you think about them.

1ab6xh,56,2013-03-14,Advice on picking a grad school(long). Written by a PhD student at a top 5 school. ,geograd,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/1ab6xh/advice_on_picking_a_grad_schoollong_written_by_a/,"This was an email I received that I thought others here might find helpful. I had a few questions about getting into grad schools and this was the response. I have edited it to keep the authors id anonymous.

Hello!

Thanks for the email- these are excellent questions to be asking, but unfortunately the only right answer to all of them is ""It depends...""


As a warning this ends up being a pretty verbose email...

As an executive summary, I would say the most important parts of the process are (1) being honest with yourself about what you are willing to do and where you are willing to go (2) visualizing what you want to accomplish during the M.S. experience so that you can pick a suitable place and advisor, (3) having a goal that the M.S. degree will facilitate, and thus picking the right place for that
 

Geology is a pretty broad based field (not unlike medicine) and there are thus a number of different careers that can be pursued with various levels of university training.  Most all professional jobs require a Masters for new hires, although most of the workforce veterans are doing their jobs with Bachelor degrees.

Hands down, the highest paying jobs in geology are in the oil and gas industry- however, one doesn't need to specialize in oil and gas geology for their M.S. to land one of these jobs.  Conversely, it may in fact be counterproductive to a career to do so.  The industry's model for new hire geologists is that the first 2-3 years (after graduate school) are spent training an employee on how to do their job.  From what I have experienced, prospective employers in the oil and gas industry are most interested in candidates who they feel are ""integrative thinkers"" about geology.  They are keen on a potential employee who has a multi-faceted background, and has demonstrated the ability to take on a project and work on a nominally independent basis to produce some results that they can succinctly and convincingly report.  The easiest way to demonstrate this to a prospective employer is by taking a handful of graduate level classes (this is usually a requirement of an M.S. degree regardless) and producing a body of supervised research as part of a thesis.  As an example of how little the topic matters, my M.S. thesis was on XXXXX in Alaska, but I gave a 20 minute presentation on it as part of a job interview for a natural gas exploration company in Arkansas and was immediately offered the job.  The employer was more interested in the fact that I had been committed to solving geologic problems in pursuing the thesis than in what I knew about certain types of rocks.

I believe if you follow this model of getting a broad base from coursework and finding a project that is interesting, you will be set up for success for whatever endeavor you desire after school.  However, getting into graduate school is a somewhat competitive and uncertain process.  Additionally, at many schools there is a sliding scale of how much funding is awarded to incoming graduate students.  Some fellowships may be available that pay more than the regular graduate student stipend, whereas other schools may offer meager (what I would deem unsuitable) support packages.

For geology, no one should have to pay their own way for an M.S. degree.  There are various ways this works out- some schools offer a stipend but bill you for tuition (thus you pay out of the stipend- this actually has some tax benefits).  Other schools just waive tuition.  Where I did my M.S. they offered a waiver on out-of-state tuition to the in-state level, and then paid a meager (but livable) stipend out of which I paid my tuition.  Usually there is a health insurance plan that is offered by the university that may be partially subsidized by the graduate school.

So, it is important to try to be as competitive as possible in applying, because ultimately your admission, and the level of support, is solely judged by the attractiveness of your application package.

Having good grades is a great asset for the process, but probably more important is having good letters of recommendation from faculty.  I believe most schools ask for at least two letters of recommendation with the application.  For getting into graduate school, I would recommend at least two of the letters come from professors at USA, and then if there has been an employer for summer work, internships, etc..., that would be a good source of a third letter.  You can be a bit strategic with letters as well.  A big reason I am at XXXXXX now is that all three of my letters in my application came from former XXXXXX students (one from the 1970's one from the 80's, one from the 90's) who are now professors elsewhere and are people I have close working and personal relationships with.

Most applications also require a personal statement.  What makes the statement easy to write is having an idea of what you want to do academically- but that is not necessary.  I think people who don't spend a lot of time on the personal statement end up getting dropped in the rankings.  The harsh reality is that every geologist who is on an admissions committee has been required to publish at some point in their career to get tenured.  Therefore they hold the ability to communicate in writing in very high regard.  As an applicant, you must realize that they read a lot of these letters.  A verbose description of your resume is not near as appealing as a letter that tells a story.  Ultimately the story needs to be about you- and why they would be foolish not to have you, rather than all these other seemingly qualified applicants.

So, I picked where I wanted to go to do my M.S. on three criteria.  First, I wanted to be somewhere that the weather was good and the cost of living was low.  Second, I wanted to be able to do a thesis project in a somewhat exotic and mountainous location.  And, third, I wanted to learn more about one subdiscipline of geology called structural geology, because I hadn't gotten a good background on it in my undergrad but it was a field that I found interesting.  I ended up going through lots of departments and contacted lots of people.  Some professors had opportunities for prospective students listed on their webpages whereas others had webpages that hadn't been updated in several years.  I ended up making a choice that worked out well for me, but it turns out, what I got out of the experience was not what I expected.  I did my M.S. at XXXXXXX.  While I was there, I bought a house and rented out two of the rooms to gals who were students.  I did my thesis work on the XXXXX in Alaska.  I got to spend a most helping out a few of my classmates on their field sites in the Outback of South Australia.  I finished my M.S. degree without a dime of debt, but lived fairly frugally and worked the last summer, as I was finishing up.  

The most important thing I did in this process though was to make contacts before applying.  That served several purposes.  I was able to visit the school I was interested in at the school's expense.  I had a project lined up for when I came to school and actually did one month of field work before I started school.  Thus I had a head start on my research my first year and was able to finish in two years.
        

This website has links to every Geoscience department in the U.S. and Canada.  I literally went through the entire list of places that interested me. 

http://orgs.usd.edu/esci/geodepts.html


So, I got a lot out of my M.S. experience from the fact that the school did not offer a phd.  Schools that offer the phd may unintentionally treat M.S. students as second class citizens because by the time you train them, they are gone, thus a lot more efforts get put towards the phd students who will spent a couple years producing research after the training portion of their degree has been finished.  On the flipside, a school like the University of Arizona is next to impossible to get into for a phd, but and many of the student I know who are doing phd's there got into the program as M.S. students then switched.  it all depends on if a phd is something that is interesting.  If you are interested in going to somewhere like south africa,  nepal or antarctica for graduate research, a phd makes more sense because there is going to be a lot involved.  But that I suppose is an entirely different question that wasn't necessarily asked...


Some schools are very geared towards turning out people who will go into industry.  This is especially true in places that have oil and gas booms ongoing (e.g. University of Arkansas, West Virginia University).  This pretty much will guarantee a job, but might limit the breadth of the M.S. experience.

If I had to do an M.S. over again, I think I would look at UC-Davis, Wyoming, UTEP, Northern Arizona University, Oregon State, Univ. of Arizona, UT-Austin, South Carolina, Auburn, Western Washington University, Central Washington University, Washington State University, Montana, Montana State.  I am somewhat partial to western schools because I think field based learning is critical.

One curveball, if you son is good at/enjoys math, an M.S. degree in geophysics is a great option as well.  At least going to a school that had a strong program in both geology and geophysics should be a consideration if he is interested in industry jobs.  


As for the endgame...  All the good oil and gas industry jobs are pretty much all in Houston.  There used to be more opportunity for expat work, but the internet has allowed things to be a bit more centralized than in the past.  There are jobs outside of Houston, but they are more competitive and are held in lower esteem.  I know several people who have gotten jobs in the mining industry.  Unlike oil and gas, they seem to require a bit more of a specialized background or at least an internship. Which leads to a side note- the M.S. degree is a great time to do one (or several) internships within industry.  They actually pay the same as the career positions, give the student an opportunity to experience a company's culture, and look good on the resume because they are indeed good diversifying experiences.

If industry is not the direction (I ended up working a little over a year in industry after my M.S. and then went back for the phd), academia, government and the environmental/engineering sector all offer career opportunities.  academia and government research scientist jobs generally require a PhD and some postdoc experience.  This job market is pretty decent right now as a lot of geologists are at retirement age, but it is also highly competitive.  As an example, I have a friend who did his B.S. at XXXXX, PhD at XXXXX, and is 1.5 years into a postdoc at XXXXX and has yet to be offered a full time position.  These research intensive jobs offer the most freedom in terms of what one does on a day to day basis (the only requirement is to be able to get your work funded), but where you work is up to what place has a position open that you qualify for. 

Environmental/engineering jobs I believe can be had with a B.S., but an M.S. would be a huge advantage.  These are job usually dealing with code compliance, pollution remediation, etc... and are available in most every big city.  These jobs, for my understanding, generally involve a lot of report writing and the time spent ""in the field"" could easily be spent in an actual field, or parking lot, or construction site.  


That's a long winded start.  Feel free to ask some more pointed questions, or provide me with more info about what kind of research may sound interesting- that would help me drop some names of people that would be good to contact.

Respectfully,

XXXXX"
1ab13m,2,2013-03-14,I'm worried I [28/f] am making a poor choice in breaking my engagement (to [25/m]).,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ab13m/im_worried_i_28f_am_making_a_poor_choice_in/,"I'm 28, female, halfway through law school in the Pac NW. I moved out here by myself from the Southeast, leaving behind my SO (25/m) who shortly thereafter joined the military. We continued in a LDR that's been mostly very positive for both of us and became engaged last summer. Seeing each other infrequently has not been a detriment to our relationship at all; we miss each other, yes, but we talk and skype often, send presents, and maintain a mutually open relationship to address any sexual needs/desires. Openness is a very positive thing for us, and we've both worked really hard to create a safe space to talk about this, and there's no concern of one of use being pressured to say or not to say anything.

I grew up in a military family and loved being a military brat. But knowing I had plans for a career in law, I knew that moving around based on orders would not be a life for me. SO and I got together in 2008, and we talked about all this during our first couple of dates, that it'd be a dealbreaker for me.

Years pass, things are awesome, we live together for more than a year. I apply to law school and select my current school. I tell him that I don't want him to come with me because I didn't want something to happen and him be 3000 miles from home and his family. Weeks later, typical day, and he asks how I'd feel about him joining the military. He's already committed to signing papers the next day; he had been visiting a recruiter and had made this decision while I was at work and without my knowledge.

We have 5-6 rough months. I love him dearly, and no one's ever understood me in the way that he does. I visit once. He visits before leaving for basic training, and I decide to commit to military life for him. It's a finite commitment, we're so perfectly compatible, and I'll pick a state(s) to practice in accordingly.

I take an internship in DC last summer; he comes to visit me on leave from his assignment in the South, and we get engaged. I start to plan a wedding in the Mid-Atlantic despite both of our families living in the Southeast: we've talked for years about how I don't want to spend wedding money in states that have outlawed gay marriage. I get attached to a light, casual idea, and plan it to the point that we just need to work out budget so I can contact appropriate vendors.

A few months after he returns to his post, he finds a place near his post that he falls in love with. I accept his input, loving that city anyway, and change plans, beginning to research vendors and venues in that area. Again I make it far enough to alert my family and his family that we'd like to start talking about budget over Christmas. When we're all together, however, he tells me that he wants his entire extended family at the wedding, including older nonbiological relatives (i.e. his bio-aunt's in-laws) who have significant health and travel limitations. Now I'm stuck. Our homestate was an early adopter in anti-gay policies, and I love culture and cities, I love good food, I love exotic locales. I rack my brain for two months and finally find a potential compromise. Despite two months without any wedding conversation (and no budget conversation over Christmas), he groans and drags his feet, asking if we *have* to talk about it. He eventually acquiesces; I suggest a major city in our homestate, able to accomodate his requirements and my tastes, only to be told that none of this new idea is possible because it's not within two hours' drive of these older relatives.

I'm frustrated. I have no real desire to get married but am willing to because he and his family find it important and because the military won't acknowledge our relationship without it. If we get married, I want to have a wedding I can look back on with confidence that it demonstrated our tastes and relationship. He, on the other hand, doesn't care about the wedding at all but very much wants to be married to me. He hopes to advance in his career, which means longer commitment and more moving (for me, since he'll be gone for months at a time). He told me that to have the wedding that I (not we) desire, we would have had to start planning last summer for a wedding this summer.

The last conversation we had about this, I told him that I shouldn't have accepted the engagement ring because I'm obviously not able to accept his joining the military. I'm disheartened because, eight months into our engagement, we still can't set a date; and he's never suggested one, leaving it entirely up to me. He was upset, but we both agreed to have a serious conversation about the future when he comes to visit (five weeks out then, one and a half weeks out now).

I'm totally lost. I love this man. We get along beautifully with each other's families, and we're best friends. Am I making a mountain of a molehill? Am I being selfish? I'm resentful of his lack of interest. I'm even more resentful that he seems perfectly comfortable introducing potential problems but that he never suggests accommodations or solutions. I'm beginning to feel like we had a window for happiness that passed without either of us knowing it, and now suddenly we're faced with the reality that a life together is never going to be easy even if it is possible. I don't want to end our relationship, but I no longer see marriage in our future.

**-----
TL;DR: 28/f in law school engaged to 25/m in the military, despite long-standing aversion to being a military spouse. Wedding planning is an unproductive battle, which seems to be symbolic of a lifelong requirement to compromise my career and lifestyle desires. Help!**"

I'm about to graduate with a BS in Biochem and I see myself as, at most, an overwhelmingly average student. I am barely a 3.0 student with an uninspired research project and hardly any good references/relationships with the science faculty. I had always wanted to go to grad school, but I missed this year's round of applications because I genuinely feel incompetent. And I have no plans for my future - every time I start to look at potential internships, jobs, etc. those feelings come rushing back and I get nowhere.

My research experience is very discouraging to me. I can't tell if it's the environment or my skill level that is bringing me down. Basically, I joined the lab as a junior and got stuck with a dead-end project that was eventually scrapped. Now I have a freshman-level project using biochemical techniques to supplement my grad student's data, but our data isn't matching up and I feel like everyone (including myself) is highly questioning my research abilities. In comparison to my peers, who have all produced good data, I am essentially useless to the lab.

Another thing is that I moved here a couple years ago, and genuinely cannot stand this geographical region. And while I would love to move away, my boyfriend of 8 years is starting a business here. So having to choose between a long-term relationship and my location is also a downer. But that is for another topic.

I'm just freaking out a bit. I get that I'm not an idiot, and many people are under the impression that I am a good (albeit lazy) student. But I still don't have the confidence I need to apply to any programs after I graduate, or even to LOOK at these programs. I know I can't keep putting this off though. How do I get over this?"

I am in a difficult situation and was hoping someone could lend me some advice. Let me explain. I am a soon-to-be college graduate. I have gotten one job offer in Ohio but it has always been my dream to move out closer to silicon valley. I have an interview with a good chance of being hired with a company in Redwood city but would have to decline the Ohio offer before I would even go to that interview. As you can imagine, I am going to have to be making some tough decisions soon! I have lots of internship experience, and have a good amount of web development experience (Rails, PHP, jQuery, etc.), but definitely not senior-level.

So would it not be too difficult to find a job in SF if I decide to go that route? I know what I want to do but if the job market isn't too hot right now for someone like me, I'll know what to choose.

Halfway through high school, I moved away because of my Dad's job. I kept in touch with her, and feelings waned a bit, and I even thought they disappeared. 

Nope. During Spring Break, I went and visited her, and I feel I felt back in high school. Nothing has changed as far as how I feel about her. Leading up to the visit, the feelings were the same. This didn't just jump out of nowhere. It's just been lingering. 

I've been timid in the past, but I'm looking to change that. I'm going to be moving to the city where she lives this summer because I got an internship, there. Something is going to happen with this situation before the end of May. 

So, after searching around a bit, I've found several methods that have worked for people escaping the friend zone. Basically, from what I've heard, it comes down to divisive action that basically comes down to: ""I want us to try to be together or I can't continue to be friends."" I basically want to go with this method.

I want one of two options: I want to either be with her, or not be friends any longer. I don't know if I can take any more of the other option. I don't want to, at least. 

All that is well and good, though, but the reason I'm posting this is because there's another obstacle in the way that I haven't seen others deal with: **She's in a long-term relationship with another guy**. They've been together for more than a year, maybe close to two. She's starting to talk about marriage with him, and I can't take it. Luckily for me, it seems he may have commitment issues and does not want to propose, though they have talked about it. 

Basically, I'm hoping for some advice, pointers, or just general motivation. This is not easy for me, but I'm not going through this shit all summer. 

I'm getting on with my fucking life, with her or without her. 

**TL;DR** Loved her since 8th grade. She's talking about marriage with another guy, and I can't take it any more. "

I've been meaning to write this for a while but was just too lazy. A mix of many things finally made me do it today.

I spent almost 8 years at college doing a ""hard science"" major because of my parents and their old school style asian culture/beliefs. I failed miserably my first two semesters, my grades were so low, I should have been kicked out, why I wasn't, I think it was due to me paying to college ""cash"" through borrowing tons of money. I went to a high school where kids all went to top tier schools, me being the first one in my family to go to college here in the U.S., I didn't know what to expect and was not even close to being prepared.

I started at the college and I hated every minute of it from day one. It is located in an inner city, I had to commute because my parents didn't want me to dorm, and I was actually OK with it because it wasn't a very pleasant place to live anyway. So, I failed hard. I always did well in math, science not so much, but in college, I did well in nothing at all as I did not care to be there one bit.

I didn't get kicked out after my first two semesters, but I begged and pleaded with my parents to let me go to community college and go into the finance field which I always wanted to do. This was not even close to being ok with my mother, as I would make her look bad in the community, since every one elses children were all becoming doctors or engineers. Those were my only two fields of choice, and this was the only school I was allowed to go to. I couldn't afford to go to school on my own, my parents had to co-sign my loans, but if I wanted to go to community college I would have to pay myself which at the time I did not ""know"" how to. Why? I was raised very sheltered, although I was ""poor"" compared to probably 80% of the kids in my school, I developed the same mindset, working only to blow all the money on things I wanted, not thinking about the future and saving.

So I continued school, I changed majors from computers to medicine, and continued to fail, but the easier classes kept my GPA just high enough for me to stay in school. At the start of my third year there, I changed majors again, this time to engineering. I continued to fail, I felt horrible, my friends were about to graduate, while I pretty much had the equivalent credits of being a freshman at the end of my fourth year.

I talk to my parents again, they finally see that I'm struggling, but it's too late. My grades are too low to be able to transfer to any other college, I would have to drop out, or go to community college and pretty much start all over, or I could stay where I was.

I stayed. Why? I don't know. I continued to struggle, I continued to fail and repeat classes, everyone else just blowing by me, me being stuck in time in the same place with no end in sight.

As much as I hated the place, I made many friends and met many people. One of my friends helped me get an engineering internship at place where that summer they had over 7,000 applicants out of which they hired only 90. I was actually happy for once, they were paying us, what seemed to me was a ridiculous amount of money. I was excited, but at the same time, I was scared shitless. They never asked for my grades and I was afraid they would find out, I was afraid the people who get me the internship would find out and I would make my friend look bad. At the end of the summer, I got a great review, but I had to go back to school and face failure again.

I continued, I started doing better in school, the internship somewhat helped me put into perspective of what I could be doing if I did graduate. But then I always realized that even if I did graduate, due to my grades I would never be able to land a job anywhere. I had applied to many other internships, but why would they want anyone with such shitty grades? If it wasn't for my friend, I wouldn't be where I am.

Summer came again, and the company let me do another internship with them, paying me even a little more this time. My work ethic was complete opposite of my school work ethic. In the real world, I always did well, rarely made mistakes, and tried my best to keep everyone happy. I had a different boss this time since I worked at a different location, he was awesome, and he gave me an awesome review and I thought I would get hired when I graduated but I didn't, not because of him, but because the company had a hiring freeze.

So I finally graduated, almost 8 years later after I started. I felt like shit. It took me so long. I saw people from high school who had already been working for 4 years, becoming independent, doing what they wanted. Me? I was close to being almost 6 figures in debt, I couldn't get a job anywhere, sure they'd interview me, but as soon as they asked me for my GPA and I told them, I could see their disinterest right away.

Again though, with the help of a friend, I was able to get a full-time job only 3 months after graduating. Kids who were in my classes who had close to 4.0 GPAs couldn't even find work. I stay in contact with them, and even a year later they couldn't find work, many decided to go back to grad school.

I landed this job, because they didn't ask me about my grades, I interviewed well, and they loved my attitude towards learning. My parents were happy, I was happy, but again, I worried that they would find out my grades, luckily it never came up.

So, I always read about people having so many problems due to not having money. I've come to realize, money has nothing to do with, and everything to do with it. I'm making somewhere close to 6 figures now, but due to my student debt, I still am staying at home.

I am very happy with where I work and what I do. But at the same time, I have a deep resentment towards my parents for not letting me do what I wanted to do. I know for a fact I could have excelled greatly in the finance field, but they still feel that forcing me to go this route was the best decision ever.

So now that I've graduated, and making lots of money, has my depression/sadness gone away? Not one bit. If you see me outside of my house, you'll never see me without a smile on my face, always smiling and laughing, never get mad at people. I have more friends than I know what to do with. At home, it's the opposite, you'll rarely see me smiling and I always feel angry.

My parents don't seem to be happy, now that I'm working, they want me to have an arranged marriage, and start a family. My happiness is linked with my parents for some strange fucked up reason. I feel as if though I can't make them happy, then I'm just a piece of shit and I myself feel sad. If I do what makes me happy, they will be sad, which in turn would make me sad because I never want to see my parents hurt in any type of way. If I want them to be happy, I feel like I would have to be sad the rest of my life.

It is a vicious cycle to which I see no end to. I am stuck in what seems to be an endless torture in my mind. Even though I have so many friends, I still feel completely alone. I can buy myself almost anything I want, but usually that gratification of having something new lasts only for a few hours. In college I always thought that once I graduated and started working, all my worries would go away and life would be perfect. The reality is, I feel almost the exact same way. I come home from work and just prepare for the next morning because I don't feel like doing anything else other than sitting around. I have no motivation, as I feel that no matter what I do, I will always be stuck feeling this way.

Can money help solve some of one's problems? Without a doubt in my mind, I know it can. Will money lead you to happiness? When you don't have it, you may think so, but from what I'm experiencing, it is just a big misconception, kind of like playing with fire as a kid, it doesn't look dangerous until you stick your hand in and feel the pain.

1a93xd,3,2013-03-13,How would you guys feel about this?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1a93xd/how_would_you_guys_feel_about_this/,"

We've been together for about a year and a half.  Love each other very much and have a great time when we are together. Often times when one of us has to head home it usually takes an hour or longer to head out since we'd rather not be apart from one another. 

He is on his final semesters (just the rest of this semester/fall semester left) of college and on his way to complete his bachelors in mechanical engineering.  He is extremely stressed about not doing well in school, trying to finish up with the best grades he can, finding an internship for the summer and finding a great job for when he graduates.  While my stress levels are a little lower, I'm still trying to figure out what road I want to travel down when it comes to what school I want to transfer to so I can complete my bachelors. 

Since he is so stressed with things about school he decided that we needed to make a business decision about school and us.  Meaning we needed to slow things down so he could have enough time to get his studying done to get through the rest of his time in school (I might add we live an hour away from each other).  With the amount of homework and tests he has, the business side of me is in 100% agreement, seeing as I would rather not be a cause of him not doing well in school if I can help it.  Not saying he'd do that but I don't want to take any chance of that happening.  However the emotional side of me is completely torn apart about slowing things down and taking some time apart to make all this happen.  He has told me that this has been really hard for him to do, but it is something that he feels he needs to do to give himself the best opportunity to find a great job after graduation so that he can provide for us.  We have a current agreement that to our family, friends, and any others that ask we are very much still in a relationship however on the inside we slowing down and taking a little time apart.  I can see it on his face that this isn’t entirely what he wants to do but at the same time its something he feels he really needs to. 


How would you handle this situation? "

IfI don’t change right now, I’m going to be dead in a month.

In this post, I would like to offer the complete and total truth.

I'm very serious about this 2 week water fast. I know everybody tells me it's not going to work, but it's something I believe in beyond a shadow of a doubt. Monday IS the day. I’m going to do it, or I’m going to die, but I will NOT fail.

I would like to start a blog/vlog covering my journey from here, and im wondering if you think it would have a chance of gaining a serious following.

I’m extremely physically and mentally ill. I’m dying, and I need to change NOW because this is absolute last chance and I can NOT accept the life I’ve living. I’m supposed to be one the worlds greatest, I’m supposed to be make a big change, I’m supposed to be a revolutionary.

Growing up, I was always supposed to be “the golden child.” The best looking, the genius, the star of the family that everybody KNEW was going to “make it.” My mom told me people used to stop her on the street with me to comment on my looks and how I should go into acting or modeling. This is when I was 3.

I’ve been a musician and classic rock junkie since childhood- hardrock is in my blood, it’s my very soul, I live and breath it. It’s how I’ve always identified myself.

I was the talented one, I was the special one, I was always the one to watch. I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to be a great scientist, or a mega star in the entertainment industry, but I knew I’d be one of them, and so did everybody around me, even some people who really hated me. I’ve been a musician and classic rock junkie since childhood- hardrock is in my blood, it’s my very soul, I live and breath it. It’s how I’ve always identified myself. I KNEW it was gonna happen someday!

Life was great, I can’t lie. I was popular in high school, got all the best girls, lost my virginity at 12, had a great home life, etc. I thought “if I can just keep this up, life will be perfect!”

I’ll never forget the day I had my first death-anxiety induced panic attack at 16. Cold sweats, shaking, crying, heart pounding… I was listening to “the end” by the doors, and I suddenly had a very clear and complete contemplation and what eternal death was like, and I’ve never felt anything like it before or since. Pure, absolute terror.

The next day I became a transhumanist. I started researching radical life extension technologies- gene therapy, nano, etc- and I decided I was going to dedicate my life to finding the solution for aging and mortality. My plan was to go to MIT, study A.I and nano, and develop technology around the brain-in-a-vat theory to create potential centuries of full virtual reality. I’d also perhaps get to work for the likes of Marvin Minsky or Aubrey de Grey (both of whom I’ve met, btw.)

I started going to conferences, the singularity summit, MIT labs, etc. I’d meet professors and apply for internships. I’d write articles on doctorate level work and have it published.

Around this time, I also got into the mens rights movement (MRA.)

I also started going to taco bell everyday.

So M.I.T tells me my grades aren’t quite up to par (thanks to slacking off in the early years), but if I took a year off , took some classes,did some work and really impressed them, they’d be happy to have me. Great!

I’ll never forget july 19th 2010, the day I picked up guns n roses book Watch you bleed in boston airport on the way back from one such meeting. Immediately I knew “THIS is what I have to do! THIS is who I am”! I’d never felt a stronger feeling in my entire life.

By this time 90% of my calories comes from fast food/junk food

I went to Vietnam to teach English as my sister was doing,thinking it would be great for my MIT resume. Of course I was listening to appetite everyday. The teaching was a complete disaster, but I had so much fun. Sexy European girls, free and plentiful weed, brawls with hordes of drunken Australian backpackers.We had a rotating band we called “the wrecking crew”, and wreck shit we did. I was 18 and invincible.

Then I was offered heroin, and accepted. I’ll never forget November 5th 2010 either. It was that night I formulated my plan- I would start the next greatest hardrock band, rise up to superfame, become a cultural icon around the globe, and use that to foster the transhumanist revolution and become the ultimate hero of humanity.

I hitch hiked from south florida to L.A. Describing that would triple this post, so I’ll justsay ask if you want any details. It’s the craziest part of the story.

I turned 19.

Ah, the joys of opiates. I had all sorts of crazy ideas that were, admittingly, pretty fucking cool to think about. My original plan was the scale the wall of Geffen records, burst in some unsuspecting AR and tell them all about my brilliant plan. It would work..it HAS to work! Of course they’d see how brilliant it was!

Then I thought first, I wanted to become infamous, then rise up. I wanted to stand against the materialistic, judgement. I hate how the average people are shut down, how people are told they aren’t good enough or cool enough. Maybe I’d create this “troll character”, a fat ugly loser type, to become a tabloid. Under the watchful eye of heroin, I started this ridiculous idea where I invented this character called “the #1 infamous anti-celebrity and celebrity stalker” and proceeded to write a series of letters to select actresses and TMZ about my plan and exploits. I’d sneak into movie premiers at the Chinese theater (I actually got into the Oscars a few weeks ago.)

Of course, I was here for guns n roses, and the first thing I did was go on the “GNR hajj” where I visited all of the classic places: canters, el compadres, the hell house, etc. I lived down the street from the liquor store on sunset/ la brea in slash’s book.

By this time, 100% of my calories are coming from fast food/junk food. I’m topping 15,000 calories a dy and 2 gallons of soda a day.

Remembering my privileged childhood, I always regretted not having lived a more “street” life. I thought, “If im going to be GNR, I gotta LIVE gnr”.

I came up with a motto- WWSD- “what would slash do?” the answer the obvious- I need to drink and do drugs!

And thus the “suicide diet” got kicked up a few notches. I started drinking, shooting up, “living life”.

I had a fake ID- shit I looked old enough- and always made sure I had enough vodka. A half gallon turned to a full gallon. Then 1 gallon a day would turn into 2. My eyes would turn yellow. My skin would turn yellow, (except for when it would turn blue). I'd throw up blood. I'd cough up blood. I'd go to the bathroom and see nothing but blood. My legs would swell and start bleeding from the pores. I’d start having vivid hallucinations. Shoot. Spike.rail.

I’d shoot 2 consecutive speedballs, go to the mirror and see my skin turn blue, only to go and shoot another one, pass out, and wake up 2 days later…and do it again. spike I started having serious symptoms, and really started feeling sick.

I turned 20. rail

I knew it was time to stop, but now I was beginning to realize what so many before me hadn’t- I wasn’t able to.

I was sick shoot. I was beginning to look different. I need to quit. Ok, I quit. Rail Ok, next week. Monday is the day Shoot

So I turned 20.5….time to quit next monday Shoot.rail

I finally reached 2 gallons a day, everyday. My skin/eyes are always yellow. I’ve gained 30 pounds. I supported a habit through illegal means*

*note- I never hurt anybody in anyway, and was never involved in anything harder than weed.

And now im 2 months, 3 weeks and 3 days away from 21, and it’s time to change. I KNOW that im meant for more than this…it isn’t supposed to be this way…

And it wont be. This Monday is IT, no matter what. I will finish this two week water fast, restore my youth and rise up in the hard rock revolution. im going to change for everybody who believed in me becausethis life is NOT how things are supposed to be.

so, do you think if i made a youtube account tonightt posting my story, i could get a following for this? how should i say it? what should i do?

In the past, the organization has recruited a lot of parents three years ago. However, most of the families recruited do not have the level of commitment and stability necessary to provide for these children with moderate to severe behavioral issues.

So, parents of Reddit, I ask you:
-Would you ever consider becoming a foster parent? 
-What would hinder you from becoming a foster parent?
-What do you know about foster care? 
-Have you seen any marketing about becoming a foster parent? How did you react to it?
-The agency is specifically looking for 24/7 room and board and parents fulfilling parenting responsibilities and privileges aged 35-60, nuclear families, LGBTQ families who are financially stable with no child under age of 12 in household. If you are a part of those populations, what would be your biggest incentive to becoming a foster parent? What information would you want the agency to approach you with? 
-If you have already considered becoming a foster parent, where did you go to find information?

1actcb,4,2013-03-15,I feel like I cant dust myself off again,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1actcb/i_feel_like_i_cant_dust_myself_off_again/,"Everythings been piling up into a whole heap of going to shit and maybe I'm finally past my limit of being able to tolerate it.

I'm stuck in a dead end job, I was up for an interview with a career related job (my first one) that would have been amazing but for various reasons I got seriously screwed over by an agency so its rapidly looking like I haven't got it (but this process has been going on since September and I still don't have an answer).

I've been struggling to apply for one job a month and the truth is the reason I've done so few is because I hate putting myself out there, I cant cope with the rejection, so I just hide away in fantasy worlds instead of making the steps I need to, to change my life for the better.

I've been trying to get jobs in one area of my career and I've rapidly been realising I'm no longer interested in it which is a massive problem because I move to london to pursue that career (I've been here a year and got nothing just a couple of work experiences).

I'm broke and having to take money from my parents to survive.
I'm over weight.

I finally grew some stones and asked a girl out only to find out she had a boyfriend and I'm still kicking myself over that because I knew for a long time she was single I just waited to long.

My sister has been dianosed with depression, shes on medication and shes been having a rough time but she admitted to me that one of the reasons she's depressed is because of me.
I mean my sister is literally worried sick over me and I dont know how to react to that, I mean its great that she cares (she never really shows it) but I'm kind of angry at her as well but then I feel like a dick for being angry at her.

I never wanted to move to london its just there were no career options at home and after graduating university I ended up work in a super market for two years but had nothing to show for it then came here to try my luck.

Oh and to top it all off I want to move to canada but theres a distinct possibility that I wont be able to because I'm more than likely on a black list and I'm seen as a flight risk (as in potential illegal immigrant).

That stories complicated but the short version is I was going to intern with a company in canada. At the time we didnt know I needed a visa to be over there (it was an unpaid internship), I got one sorted eventually but the company used its government connections to try and sneak me in the back door and I guess I got caught.

I had no idea this was happening and I didn't find out anything was wrong until my next visit to Canada two years latter where I was pulled over at immigration. Luckily the guy let me in the country but he gave me very strict warnings.

I've heard its impossible to get off that black list so even if I follow all the processes correctly I could still be rejected.

Which means my main dream is over before its even started."

",ThrownAwayy119,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1abs1z/my_m20_exgirl_f20_wants_to_get_back_together_i/,"Hey Reddit, 

I want to thank you in advance for reading this, and giving any input you may have.  I don’t know where else to turn – the shame would kill me if I told my friends. 

I love her immensely; when we click it’s a thing of beauty.  Most of the people around us dream of the type of relationship we have.  We communicate well, I trust her with everything, after almost two years I still find her gorgeous and attractive as hell – and the sex, don’t even get me started, its wonderful. 

At the beginning of this year, I moved away to complete an internship for 4 months about one hour away. I was home practically every weekend, and we would do our thing – obviously dyeing to see each other, it was never enough. It was painful, especially for her. “ It hurts to think about you, so I try to distance myself, I try not to miss you”.  I was fine with keeping up this little long distance thing, especially with modern technology; it’s my opinion we have it easy.  Nevertheless, this didn’t work for her and she broke up with me, but we kept hanging out and seeing each other and being intimate, going on dates and all the rest of it.    I still felt attached, close and content for the most part.    She was happy making friends, going out and wheeling guys.   

Nevertheless she wanted distance from me, she wanted single life. Chances are , this was happening whether I moved away or not.  When we met she had just gotten out of her first, only long term relationship – and was planning on being single for a while. On the other hand I had been single for a long time, knew what I was looking for etc.  She always told me how she regrets not having that time to herself, to be single and live that life.  Problem is, we were fireworks right away – we didn’t want to let each other slip and we made it official a couple months into a relationship that was pretty exclusive from the get go.  

So recently, we spent the weekends together – doing really cute shit, beautiful dates, holding hands.  She would tell me she loves me, and how hard it is being apart – share our thoughts and feelings.   I always asked about her nights out, and she would tell me, even about how she kissed a guy at the bar, (doesn’t bother me at all, heh) rejected another – how awful the singles market is.  I was getting used to being just her sorta-friend.  Its weird listening to a girl you see yourself spending the rest of a long time with, potentially slipping away. 

I am pretty jealous, in a caring way, but I never creep, go through phones, or stop her. Ever.  I do however have an old school mentality about sex and love, exclusivity is important.  When she got excited as hell recently to talk to me, I practically knew what she was going to say – she wants to be with me, boyfriend-girlfriend.  She said how we have something special, and that it took the time apart for her to realize that, and we talked, I rejoiced and the world was good. Until she dropped the “I hooked up with someone”, and as she explained it more in depth she probably saw the perfect picture of my heart breaking.  She apologized, said how bad it was – nothing like ours, it was a premeditated sober decision because she was single,  “why not”, alcohol just helped the process – the logic is so I know she would never ever cheat on me if we are dating. Apparently she literally stopped it, no one got off and she went home.     He is a friend of a friend, she isn’t ready to tell me yet – but I know I will find out I already told her it is critical to me, one thing at a time though.   

Help Reddit,  .   I don’t know how to get over it, its pretty fresh,  I just cant get the image of another man between her legs out of my head – I cant even comprehend how she would let our relationship go ( I told her this, response was “ I was willing to let us go when we broke up” ).  I thought of her under someone else, someone else insider her, and as close to her on that level which I hold sacred. SRS is going to fucking love me, but here it goes – I just feel like she was mine and I was hers, and now even though she was “single”, that boy will always have a little piece of her so to speak. She isn’t infinitely mine, and won’t be, unless…. I don’t know, I get over it I guess.  I think I even see her as less attractive in my mind.  Fuck, I am so dramatic.   

How do I let it go? How do I build my relationship with her again?  How can I get rid of the shame? How the fuck do swingers work, seriously?  I feel hurt.  

She is also very eager to be normal, it doesn’t bother her at all – she is chipper and happy to Skype, talk on the phone – see each other, and I m just sitting there asking for details, being obviously sad. I just, I don’t know if I see her the same.  I do, she is all there, but just not that perfect girl I thought was mine. 


**Things I am not worried about (just to clear it up, avoid wasting your time): **

I trust her completely, she told me everything, she wouldn’t keep something at this point, and if she is – I am sure its for good reason. 

I am not worried about this happening again.  

Not worried that the other guy was bigger, or physically better looking.  Might sting a little to find him being a stud, but meh.  Motivation for the gym. 

**Something to consider; oh the irony:**

About a year into our relationship, a girl kissed me.  She was loaded, I was drunk – no excuse but she basically jumped me. I told her, I love my girl, thanks but no thanks, we are not going anywhere.  No one saw, so I kept it in my heart – I didn’t want to hurt my women.  Girls know girls know girls – and I get a super angry call about 2 weeks later.  She finds out what happened, I learn my lesson about communication – and we continue on our way.   She considers this worse than what she did because we were “dating”, and official together.  On the other hand, currently we are single – therefore no big deal.    In my opinion the title means nothing to me, they are just words – actions and feelings are the language of love. 

**TLDR:**  Amazing relationship, break up for about 2.5 months – frequently seeing each other, being intimate and doing couple stuff. Has shitty one night stand to try single life, decides its not for her two weeks later. Asks me out, I want / plan on accepting – but I don’t know how to get over something that hurts basically like infidelity.

1abphs,1,2013-03-14,Venting about Nursing clinical,throwawaynursing,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1abphs/venting_about_nursing_clinical/,"Alright, I just made a throwaway to vent.  I don't know why.  I'm just too hurt to keep it to myself.  It's so hard to convey in typing how much it hurts.

I have just been threatened (by my instructor) today to be failed in my clinical placement.  This would mean that I would be held back a year and basically lose everything (especially my new friends) that I have worked for since September.

Backstory: I am currently a full-time student in the second semester of a nursing program at a university.  It's my first year, but technically it's my fifth since I already have a degree in another major.  I've managed to make a few friends during the first semester, which have really helped a lot to motivate and support me to keep going, especially since I feel like utter shit for wasting my time and money on my first degree.  In my program, I have a clinical placement built into the curriculum (that's when you're sent to a hospital or long term care facility to work with staff and learn your skills; it's basically an internship for nurses).  However, during the first year, students don't actually get a real placement until second semester (which is where I am right now).  
So first semester is just sitting in a classroom for 8 hours and talking about practice standards, interview skills for patients, basically boring shit.  This is where it started.  The clinical instructor that I got (chosen at random; I had no control over who I was with) was a complete stickler.  Every single assignment I have ever handed in to her was wrong (we had multiple weekly assignments; it's not just 1 or 2).  They always, WITHOUT FAIL, needed corrections, needed revisions, needed attention.  Needless to say, it was very taxing and stressful, and eventually it all started to erode on my opinion of this instructor that I had never met before.  I hated her.  It felt like I was fighting some sort of really sneaky war, where the enemy strategy was to mentally break me down, and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  
I eventually got through the semester, worn out and bitter (although I will admit, I have made some really great friends from this war of a course that I fought).  Keep in mind that this was just one course.  I still had 4 others to attend to.  I hated this instructor that made 4 months of my life a living hell.  But I was done with her.  Free.  

Or so I thought.

Jump to second semester, where I am now.  It turns out that I was one of the ""lucky"" few to get the same instructor for my first clinical placement (we only found out which instructors we were assigned to, at the very last minute).  I thought it would be better; I had somewhat gotten used to how she marks things.  Maybe it would be better?  Maybe I could turn things around with her?  
No.  I now see that this was just wishful thinking.  She still ripped apart my assignments, just like last time.  And to add to it, I have to actually take care of people within my placement, with her moving around throughout the building to check up on what each of us are doing (there are 5 other students who are also in the same placement as I am).  When we perform skills in clinical, we are supposed to find our instructor so we can show them we can do it right.  I can say with confidence that I have performed every skill that I have been taught, and my instructor has not been around more than half the time to observe me doing them.  This is why she is failing me.  Because I couldn't fucking locate her within the building, just so I could show her I can do things (no amount of assignments or documentation can prove that I am capable of the skills that I have learned).  I had a meeting with her and a clinical coordinator today.  They **strongly** advised that I should voluntarily withdraw from the clinical course because they **strongly** felt that they would not pass me (And I quote, ""I'm about 90% sure you will not be given a pass."").  Again, I repeat that this would hold me back a year.  I would lose all of my friends, be back to square one, and waste more time and money.

I don't know what to do.  It makes me feel like shit.  So what? The degree that I have already earned means nothing?  That I'm more incompetent than a fresh-out-of-highschool student?  That I'm not deserving enough to even be considered a chance at second year?  I've been backed into a corner, and I feel like I'm drowning.  

If you've read this far, I truly thank you.  I have no idea how to deal with this, and I'm scared."

1afmip,2,2013-03-16,I've had it with my home state.  r/trees you're my only hope. Don't know how long I'll last here.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1afmip/ive_had_it_with_my_home_state_rtrees_youre_my/,"Greetings ents. 
Allow me to begin by thanking all of you
Your subsection is the main reason I browse reddit, and your photos and posts continually remind me that a better world exists, though it currently lies far outside of my reach.

A little background info:

I have lived in Virginia since birth.

Until age 21 I believed the bullshit, spin and propaganda D.A.R.E, Law Enforcement and indeed much of the backward population of this state spout concerning Cannabis.

I have suffered from suicidal depression and anxiety for the entirety of my teenage and adult life.

Junior year of college was particularly dark.  

I felt as though life was hopeless, nothing I did mattered, and that every genuine desire I had was thwarted by the State, Family, School or my own scrambled psyche.

I was desperate enough to try anything. Even if it meant defying my family and country.

I made the necessary connections and acquired some ""herbal remedies"".

Cannabis broke my depression over it's knee and laughed heartily while doing so.
My anxiety melted away into a glorious spiritual reawakening.

Physically, with increased appetite and improved mood and outlook, over the course of two years I transformed from a literal ""90-pound weakling""

to a healthy, robust 120 pound flyweight (still tiny, but no longer a gaunt, dreary skeleton)

I am currently 23, recently graduated with a bachelors degree in the humanities (Though no internships or extracurriculars, so my slip of paper's utility is questionable at best)

I am stuck working a soul-sucking minimum wage job whilst I am continually rejected by every ""decent"" employer I apply to.

My dream and goal is to escape this nightmarish gung-ho redneck military police-state to the shining sands of California or any state where Cannabis is more readily available, where I can receive adequate treatment for my condition, and enjoy my life once again.

My job affords me only enough money and hours to keep my car filled up and my stomach (relatively) full.  

I was forced to leave the city I lived in during college and return home to the backwater hamlet I grew up in.

My parents are unsympathetic to my problems, calling me a ""drug addict"" and a ""lazy stoner"".  

They question why I need chemicals/addiction as a crutch and fail to see any irony at all when I cite coffee, alcohol, cigarrettes, gambling and all manner of other substances and practices they freely ingest and engage in.

I expect no help from them and have given up my appeals to reason.

I left my collegiate social circle behind, so I have been almost completely alone since graduation (Dec) making do with whatever herb I managed to scrape together enough funds for (Cannabis is prohibitively expensive in ""Neanderthal"" states like mine due to the high risk involved)

My depression and anxiety have returned in force. Imagine how nice it was to hear their voices again.

I have hardly any appetite, and am losing weight at a steady pace (currently around 112-108 and dropping).  
I have lost much of my motivation to work out, and as a result, my strength is fading and my muscles are slowly wasting away.

I refuse to ingest ""State-Approved"" Psychoactives like Prozac, Zoloft, Wellbutrin and all other manner of Pharmaceutical snake oils.
I will die by my own hand before Pfizer profits from my misery.

Ents, I need your suggestions for the FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY out of this state and into a better one.

I don't require much.  Just a roof over my head, some clothes on my back, some food to eat and a brimming bowlpack.

I have searched several corporate, insurance claims, and call-center jobs ""out west"", but so far, every employer has rejected me.

My degree is in English Literature (turns out all the jokes about an English degree being useless have a great deal of truth to them)

I am willing to scrimp and save for an apartment security-deposit and enough gas for the trip (and it is likely that my parents would be willing to assist me financially if my move is cloaked in the guise of employment)

Any suggestions would be a godsend to me.

&lt;3 J.

P.S. I've been on a ""forced tolerance break"" long enough to piss clean for any pre-employment drug-test, though I'm not so sure about hair"

I'm a recent grad who is looking for an entry-level system, network, or database administration position in the Philadelphia, PA area.

I have two summers of internship at a local Fortune 100 company.  I worked with the team responsible for maintaining the internally and externally hosted web applications for the company.  

I have experience with: 

* Windows Server 2003/08 (software installation/upgrade, documentation, builds, PowerShell scripting, etc.)

* IIS 6/7 (troubleshooting, configuring sites, etc.)

* RHEL (LAMP configuration, installing/configuring CMSs and MySQL databases)

I haven't been able to find anything since graduation and figured I'd give it a shot here.  

I'm not looking to re-locate at this time, and I'd prefer something in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia, but I'd be open to hearing about anything at this point.

If you'd like more information, please send me a PM and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

1aeca1,6,2013-03-16,I just can't seem to find the point.,DirtDog13,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/1aeca1/i_just_cant_seem_to_find_the_point/,"When I look at my life from an outside perspective I see that anyone should be happy in my shoes.  I'm a senior in college with literally 2 months until I graduate.  I have an internship doing what I love and I've held it for 4 years.  I have a loving family and every member would gladly do anything for me, especially my father.  Yet, on the inside, I cannot find happiness.  While there are stretches when I am happy, when I'm with friends or family, the feeling is fleeting and afterward I find myself sad and alone. 

During my first 2 years of college I was on depression medication.  That helped, but didn't fully solve the problem.  After my doctor said I could wean myself off of the meds, I did.  It went well for a year, but this year I find myself in a deep, dark, sad hole.  Alone.  I know that my friends would do anything for me, they are there for me, but I do not want to burden them with my sadness for I feel it would take away from their happiness. 

I write this message as I sit at a friend's house during my spring break, a time in which I should be completely at peace.  I cannot, however, find that peace.  When I go out with friends I am happy, but as soon as it ends I feel dark and alone. Even though in less than 10 hours I will be awake and with them again.

I can't find the point in trying to be happy, as the happiness inevitably comes to an end and launches me deeper into darkness.  The girl I love barely knows what I feel (which I think is for the better considering I have only 2 months left in the town with her) and I continue to hide what I feel for, what I think, is the benefit for everyone.  

I just don't know what to do anymore."
1aeb1w,1,2013-03-16,So now what?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1aeb1w/so_now_what/,"I'm going to be graduating college in May, and I feel really terrified. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression all through school, so I never got the full college experience; I never went to any parties or events, I never made any friends, I never volunteered for any internships or projects (I'm a film major) because it made me way too scared and anxious (I even used to throw up every day before my screenwriting workshop class.) The fact that I just /couldn't/ do a lot of my work also caused me a lot of grief. The only reason I held on was because I promised my mom -who didn't finish high school- that I would graduate for her. But now I feel that once I do that, there really won't be anything left for me. I know I won't ever get a film job because I'm not ambitious or outgoing enough to pursue it, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life working somewhere I'll hate. Hell, even if I did get my dream job, I don't want to spend the rest of my life just hating myself. I don't see myself ever being happy. I think about killing myself a lot, even if I don't think I would do it. I always promised myself that once I graduated college I would do the one thing I've always wanted to do, take a road trip across the US, and I kind of really wish that if I do, I'll get in a crash and die before I have to come home.

1ah052,0,2013-03-17,"Day 23 of my first try, thoughts and observations:",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ah052/day_23_of_my_first_try_thoughts_and_observations/,"I’m a 22 yo male and I’ve been doing NoFap/NoPMO for 23 days now. It’s my first try, and I’m doing it because I believe I have a porn-induced ED. I’m seeing a girl at the time, and I would like to be able to have sex with her. The last two years I have been struggling with depressions and my self-esteem has gotten worse. This has led to a more excessive porn-use(although I have been fapping to porn frequently since I was 15 - that was when we got high-speed-internet at home). When I found out about YBOP and this subreddit, it was like a revelation for me!! It all started to make sense, and I decided I had to give it a try because I really believe this project will help me with getting able to give girls a good time again.

The first days I was extremely motivated, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how much porn had fucked up my brain. For instance it became clear to me how I often associate normal things/objects with things I had seen in a porn scene and in the next moment my brain would go crazy and make me crave porn. Another thing that got some clarity was how bad I actually was reducing girls to being nothing less than sexual objects. Around day 4-5 the craving got really bad. Especially after hanging out with my girl cuddling and kissing but not being able to get my dick to work properly – getting home made me crave heavily. This was also a thing that made me see how fucked up my brain is at the time: I thought if she would be here right now I would fuck her brains out, but I realized how unrealistic these thoughts were. I had just been over at her flat for hours and been able to get hard enough for penetration!! Wtf???!!! I also had moments when I just had to get away from my desk so I wouldn’t relapse. I also avoided cravings just by getting out of the house – walking. Because I have a heart disease at the time, I haven’t been able to go running, or to hit the gym pumping that iron like the Governor back in the days. Can’t wait to get back there - at some days my energy levels have been sky-high. I’ve also noticed that some good tunes have helped me when the craving has been bad, and I have tried some creative things like writing or drawing. It has helped me with expressing my emotions, and getting more clarity.

Over the past 23 days I have also been having sporadic wet dreams, like most people here.

Around day 7 I think I hit the flatline. I felt like I had no libido at all, and cravings were down to a minimum compared to the last days. The next two weeks there was absolutely no sign at all that my penis was even close to being alive. It sometimes felt like I had lost it, and it got smaller – like when it’s cold outside. I tried to keep the touching down to a minimum. From day 10 on I was out of town for an internship. I hooked up with a girl and went to her place, but I couldn’t think of anything else than sleeping – even though I was lying in her bed with her. I have to say that she was not the prettiest, but I don’t think I would have given a fuck if my sex-drive was normal.

Day 20-23 I had erections when I woke up in the morning. Two of them were 80% and one was a 100%-Hallelujah-erection! Omfg it felt like someone was contacting me from outer space! My sex-drive has not been any stronger though. I don’t know yet, if this project is gonna help me with getting rid of my ED, but I really believe so!! I am noticing that there is stuff going on (the wet dreams, the zero sex-drive), and I would say that my emotional state has changed in a positive direction as well. I’m still having some ups and downs, but in general I feel a bit better at the time. I can’t say that I believe NoFap/NoPMO is the only reason for these changes, but it feels like it has some kind of a key role. All these things motivate me even more to keep going, and I hope all of you will do as well! When we are done with this shit the girls won’t know what just hit them!! Stay strong fellow fapstronauts!!!

This fall I fell into a pretty deep depression for a variety of reasons.  An unfortunate coincidence was that I happened to move home at the same time and had to be sober.  This semester, I moved out on my own again, and between just living life and some self-medication with trees, I was happy and had pulled myself almost completely out of the hole I was in.

Last week, however, I learned that what I am doing this semester will not get me where I thought it would in terms of my career path, and that I may find myself just as lonely and unemployed at the end of this semester as I was last semester.  As a result, I started to slide back down the rabbit hole.  A quick trip home over spring break only served to further that feeling as I couldn't bring myself to tell my parents the truth about my predicament.  

Usually, I would smoke to reach some inner peace and clear my head.  I don't view it as running away from my problems but just a way of clearing my mind of the stress and worries so that I can approach my problems on an even keel.  This time, however, I am slammed at my internship with projects and I need to get on top of them because if I fuck this up, I'm really screwed.  I know this, and yet I procrastinate (see me posting here instead of doing work).  All of that pressure is piling on top of my depression and pushing me further down, but I feel like I can't smoke because I have so many responsibilities I need to attend to, including things that I have yet to complete for tomorrow.

I know I need to finish these projects.  I just feel like I'm completely off my center.  Weed usually helps take me back there, but I don't think weed is a good idea right now since I have critical deadlines coming up this week including uncompleted work that is needed tomorrow.  Really, I just feel lost.

Should I toke up, which will affect my work but hopefully help bring me back on a road to inner peace, or should I remain sober for this period, so that I can focus on my work?"

1aggbz,0,2013-03-17,Invest in us.,[deleted],RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1aggbz/invest_in_us/,"Hello to you,

My gf and I are saving to buy a home in Peoria, Illinois. I have recently found a condo for sale that is in foreclosure for $27,000. We are looking for an investor to help us buy this house in a peer to peer loann format.

We've been working with a financial adviser here in town for some months now. The snag is that we only qualify for an FHA loan with a cosigner. Totally fine, I have a parent who is willing to cosign with us. This condo, however, is not FHA approved. So, I want to expand our opportunities for buying a home at a great price by searching for an independent, peer to peer, loaner.

The condo is $27,000. And we have saved a %10 downpayment so far. If we can agree on an interest rate, for example, of 3.5% over 20 years (for example) you stand to profit $18900.

Basically, the reason we need the help is I've got the good credit but she's got the income. And she has no credit to cosign with me. Making it through college on full scholarships left her debtless but also creditless. A double-edged sword. I'm self-employed and working on growing a small business. She has a full-time income that is reliable and an education that will pay off even more once she's done with her internship.

We are working on building her credit by using a secured credit card. In the coming years we will be able to get a mortgage for the full price of the condo and pay you off in full. Sure, we can wait it out and get a loan for a house in a year or so. But this is a great opportunity to buy low and watch our investment appreciate. We'd love to seize the day!

Thank you for your time Mr/Mrs Investor. "

This is a throwaway because the boy is Redditor and hates when I post on this sub so I'll probably delete this post in the morning so there is no chance he sees it. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. He graduated from college last May with a double major in two different fields of engineering from a top engineering school. He got a good 62k a year job straight away and moved out of state for it and we broke up because we didn't want to do long distance. Two weeks later he quits his job on a whim and comes back here saying he's going to attempt to market some of the products he made as a undergrad. Fine. We get back together and I support him. 

After about 2 months of attempting that and working part time jobs to pay rent to stay here that didn't work out. Now he has decided to start an Internet business with his older brother who has recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Needless to say, that's not working out too well for him either. He and his brother Skype all day long but get nothing done and just fight all the time. He has been struggling to pay rent and doesn't want to work at his part time jobs anymore. 

The problem is, every time I try to talk to him about applying to other full time ""real"" jobs again he gets very angry at me. Says that a real job just isn't for him. That he gets sick in the mornings and can't work normal hours. That he is a bad employee and can't stand working for someone. I, on the other hand, am currently in school full time also pursuing two degrees while working two part time jobs to have money to do things. Anytime I want to go out with him I have to pay for both of us because ""he's broke"" and ""can't afford it."" 

I am at a loss of what to do with this situation. I have an amazing internship secured for this summer that will hopefully lead me to a full time job with the company and he's still floundering around with his life. He is also now tired of working part time to pay rent here and is moving back home a state over so that he can ""really focus on the Internet business."" The boy is amazing other than this fact. He treats me like I'm a princess and always goes out of his was to support me and make me happy but he absolutely refuses to budge on this job situation. 

What do I do? How do I handle this?

1. Comments are static, and so they can be mistakenly not updated during refactoring 
2. They can be missread
3. That if there is a specific need for them, that is usually because the code is not written well enough. Ie, the structure does not make the structure of computation clear enough, or the function/variable names are not descriptive enough

I think of the time when I was 19 and flew home from an internship and was still drunk and couldn't be bothered to put on actual clothes and my dad picked me up from the airport and I was wearing sweatpants , my makeup was smeared and I reeked of booze. He didn't even have to say anything, but he didn't have to. I was so embarrassed. 

I think of the time I planned with a coworker to drink while we were stuck on a late-night closing at Urban Outfitters and I was caught after a manager smelled booze on me - I admitted to it but refused to bring my friend down, because it was close to his last day, but I got fired. 

I think of the time I was drunk at a house party and fell down some stairs, pulling one of my best friends with me, giving her a concussion.

I think of the time I was arrested for being too drunk and was charged with resisting arrest because my reaction was to fight against the police officers. (charges were eventually dropped, but what a nightmare that was). 

I think of the time I fell down a flight of stairs and cracked my head - I didn't get stitches, but probably should have - and refused help from my boyfriend because I was so drunk and angry. I still have an indent in my scalp from that. 

I also recently decided - after a particularly awful drunk night - that I had hit rock bottom, and I'm not going to drink anymore. Most of my friends can get shit-faced and pull it off relatively well. But not me, and the hardest part has been that I can't handle my alcohol like everyone else I know. 

I am so grateful I found this subreddit. Seriously, thank you so much for all your support and giving your own experiences and just being strong, amazing people. I have tried to quit drinking before and failed, but I am determined this time. "
1ajp83,76,2013-03-18,"IMA (nearly) 4th year medical student who is having difficulty with specialty selection and having second thoughts about a career in medicine in general. I am seeking advice, thoughts, or experiences from the good people of /r/medicine.",[deleted],medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1ajp83/ima_nearly_4th_year_medical_student_who_is_having/,"So, a little more background:
I am in a US MD program, and thus far, have had a fairly unremarkable track record.  I was middle of the pack for my USMLE step I, had zero honors during my first 2 years (yeah...i know), little substantial research experience/volunteering, and a handful of honors/high passes during my 3rd year.  I have no financial support from my family and have been funding my own education. Despite being one of the lucky few to get a nice scholarship, I will be leaving here with around $100k in debt.

Throughout my training, no specialties have really stood out to me above the rest, though each fell somewhere on the spectrum of intolerable to tolerable.  After much thought, I felt like anesthesia, IM, and emergency seemed like the best options for me (though my exposure to anesthesiology was for only 1 week), but I am going into my 4th year rotation-selection with very little conviction about my would-be career.  Part of me is not convinced that I want the life that a career as a practicing physician seems to offer.   

I am worried because the reasons that I decided to go into this field have been overshadowed by more negative experiences.  The aspects that I enjoy (getting to know patients, medical detective work, saving/changing lives) are a fraction of what has occupied me over the last year of my clinical training.  My ability to focus on the positives is dwindling and I am becoming overwhelmed by the hours/lack of sleep, the pressures around documentation/CYA, the highlighted systemic shortcomings, and the social exhaustion I feel from working from the bottom of the totem pole in a rigid hierarchical system.  

I watch the residents cope with their indentured servitude and see them struggle to pay for child-care that can accommodate their extreme hours. One intern guiltily remarked that he hadn't seen his kids in the last month because he is always gone before they awake and home after they are asleep.  I've watched marriages crumble, residents bitterly complain about how the maternity leave for one of their co-residents was forcing them to pick up the slack, and heard a new female attending (in her early 30s) anxiously describe how she feels obliged to continue to delay having children because the effects that it may have on her new practice. I recognize that this is in the setting of me being a male third-year, having no children (or even a willing incubator, for that matter), and practicing ""diet-doctoring,"" with significantly fewer patients/paperwork/responsibility. To top it off, I am rarely even reaching 80 hour/week duty hours.  

So... I am likening myself to a guy who is complaining of blisters during the first mile of an ultra-marathon.  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?  Or is my training designed to increase my comfort in knowing that I am not in a tunnel, rather on a never-ending subterranean highway, and I should be grateful that I may go from 80 hr/wk to 60?  

So, are there any anesthesiologists, IM docs, ED docs willing to talk about their careers, and the factors they weighed most heavily in deciding on specialty to select?  Are there any medical people who have had cold feet during their training?  Anybody out there who took the debt from getting an MD degree but didn't pursue a residency or clinical practice?

TL;DR: Naive MS3 whines about medicine, is undecided about his career, and wants to hear from meddit about cold-feet and career selection. 

Edit: typos

Edit #2:  I wanted to thank everyone for their support and advice.  I cannot describe how meaningful it has been for me to read these comments.  It reminds me that one of the greatest things about this field is how it selects for so many smart and genuinely nice people.  Again, thank you all so much, and I am grateful to be part of an online sub-community that is filled with such kind and insightful members.  "

I am looking to buy my first home in the Raleigh-Durham, NC, area, and I am trying to prepare myself as much as I can before I start the process. I've been lurking here (and /r/HomeImprovement) pretty intensely for the last few months, but I still have so many questions, so I wanted to just lay out my whole situation to the fine people of this subreddit.

I want to buy a home that costs roughly $100k-$150k - that is, a pretty small house of 1200-1500 square feet. I have roughly $50k saved up in cash that I could use for the house (with additional money in investments and retirement funds). I believe my credit score is somewhere in the low-to-mid-700s, but my only credit history is a credit card with a $500 limit that I've had since I was 18. No student loans, car debt, or anything of that sort.

The biggest potential problem that I see - and it could be a big one - is that I will starting a new job in April. I'm set to make about $70k a year, which is about double what I've made the past few years. My last few years have been sort of semi-stable-ish; I worked full-time at one company for 2 years, then switched to a different company as an intern (although I actually got paid more), and then I went to do an internship in Europe (same company, but it paid less). The permanent job that I am starting in April will be with the same company where I did my internships.

So, my questions to you all are:

* How badly do you think my job situation will affect my ability to get a mortgage? I know there's only one real way to find out (walking on in there and asking), but I want to have some realistic expectations before I walk in there.

* How much of that $50k should I carve out as a down payment? I'm sure it depends on the condition of the house I'm moving into, so let's assume a house in moderate shape that might need a few small repairs. I don't have a lot of furniture, but I plan to get most of my stuff (excluding a mattress and possibly couches) from consignment stores, Craigslist, and even Goodwill if they happen to have anything good.

* What housing ""features"" should I watch out for? For example, I've heard some bad stories about houses on slab foundations. I'm also pretty wary about all of these houses with fresh paint and new floors; I see it often mentioned here as a selling point, but it really rings my alarm bells because who knows what kind of water damage and other crap is hiding under there. I'd rather look at houses with dirty walls and carpet because I feel (although it might not actually be true) that I have a better idea of what I'm in for. Are there any good inspection checklists out there with things to look for when viewing homes?

* How many places do you usually shop around for mortgage pre-qualification? Are there any good, trustworthy online tools? Can anyone from the area recommend a bank or broker?

* I'm a single female in my mid-20s, and I'm worried people won't take me seriously. Considering this is all new to me, I feel like I'm in a very vulnerable position, which is why I want to be as prepared as possible. I am sure real estate agents and mortgage brokers alike will have dollar signs in their eyes as they imagine the things they could get past me in their contracts (sorry, do I seem paranoid?). What things should I look out for in contracts? Any recommendations for how to get people to take me seriously?

* What's the best way to contact a reputable real estate agent? I've seen ""Contact a buyer's agent"" ads on real estate websites, but what other avenues would you recommend? I don't know anyone who could personally recommend one to me.

* I'm also considering buying a piece of land sometime to build a future home on. Do people get real estate agents for land sales? How does buying land differ from buying a home (other than there not being a house). I know about perk testing in areas without city water/sewer, but what else do you have to look out for? If land hasn't been perk tested, what do you do - just buy and hope? I assume you could look at soil data to get a good idea of whether it would or not, but really I have no idea.

Thanks!

1aj87b,0,2013-03-18,Me M[21] and my girl F[21] have been in a relationship for five years but never became friends. What now?,LDRadvice101,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1aj87b/me_m21_and_my_girl_f21_have_been_in_a/,"Wall of text warning.
Since 2008, I've been in a relationship with a really cute girl. We started dating during high school, and since I was her first serious boyfriend, we started out taking things very slow. After high school was done I started seeing her less and less. It started when I first choose to major in accounting. I was working a full time job, and she choose to major in art, and fashion design. We saw each other about once a week. She worked in the weekends that time, so it when we saw each other, I usually slept over, and left the following morning. This had to be done because we both had homework to do, and since I sometimes have a hard time focusing on my work when other people are around, I did that back home. 

After eight months I decided to quit my studies, because I didn't like it. She was still in her first year of uni, and was focusing full time on her studies, so I couldn't see her more. I started business administration the following year, and I could still see her only about once a week, because her study was simply very time consuming. She once told me that  none of her classmates (all girls, mostly) are in relationships because of the lack of time for that. That was the year when my father got fired, which now poses some financial problems, but that aside. My girlfriend and I had some weeks off together during the summer break. Since I was broke I also had to work a lot during the summer, but we still had some time for ourselves. She and I didn't really know what to do with so much spare time, so we kind of hung out and did some things we wanted to do for a while, go swimming etc. This felt kind of forced and awkward, because when you are in a relationship with another person for more than 3 years, you would expect to know how to kill time together. Shortly thereafter my I started my new study, public healthcare management. I have enjoyed this new study a lot, and it's something that I found I can achieve and be happy about. During the last half year we still only saw  each other once a week, sometimes even less. Me and my girlfriend barely talk about our relationship. I tried to start conversations about things like sex and relationships, but I quit trying a long time ago because of a lack of response. 

In January, my girlfriend applied for an internship in the uk, which is a 7 hour drive and quite expensive for me, given the fact that I'm soon jobless. She is gone for 5 weeks and one day now. During the last five weeks she has been gone I've realized that the communication with my girlfriend is terrible. Aside the usual 'what have you done today ' we don't really talk about important things. She hates to use Skype to talk with me, as she told me on my visit last week. This is not the first time I have doubted our relationship. I can barely remember the times when we had proper long conversations. I also have to say that we barely share any common interests, and we both find each other's hobbies to be weird. She loves fashion, and while trendy sometimes, I'm a nerd who loves the internet and I love reading literature, and well, she doesn't. As stated previously, I have thought about ending our relationship before. We had a small breakup in our first year together, mainly for the same reasons posted here, which I couldn't feel I could explain to her at the time. I now realize that was a mistake. I am troubled about quite a few things at this very moment. I don't have enough money to visit my girlfriend as much as I would like to. The funny thing is, after being together for five years, I can easily be without her for a long amount of time without starting to miss her big time. I think this is a very bad sign of the status of our relationship. When I visited her last week, I felt kind of ok, but not super relieved or anything, but I was happy. I really don't know what to do. I could use some outsiders advice! Thank you so much in advance.

**TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have never really been emotionally attached to e/o and are figuring this out now 5 years in.**

EDIT: Excuse me for the throwaway. It's for privacy. Also excuse me for the bad english. It's probably not as easily read as I would like it to be. I'm not a native English speaker."

Right now it's sitting in a data center until my contract is up in August.  I plan to have it shipped back to me so I can start up a homelab.  I plan to virtualize the machine using ESXi.

The specs of the machine are as follows:

* Xeon E3-1230v2
* Supermicro X9SCM-F-O
* 32GB DDR3 1600 ECC
* 500GB Western Digital RE4 (I disabled TLER after realizing it was pointless to use an RE drive by itself, so right now it might as well be a Black drive)
* 128GB Samsung 830 SSD
* Supermicro CSE-512F-350B Chassis (and a heatsink and rails)
* OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard


I've secured an internship for this summer (paid), so I'd like to put some of that money towards lab equipment.

Since I won't have that machine until August, and I want to get started earlier, I'd like to pick up some other hardware to get myself started.

Here's what I've been thinking about:

* I want some sort of NAS solution to hold all of my VMs and any other data I'd like to share across my network (media maybe?).
* Gigabit managed switch (maybe utilize the SFP and do a little fiber networking?  I might be able to get my hands on some free transceivers)
* PFSense box (on something like a firebox x550e or similar)

Do you have any recommendations on what I should pick up to start up my lab?  I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing at my internship, but I plan to use my lab to further my learning from the internship when I'm at home.  I know I'll be working more with infrastructure rather than programming, but that's about all I know.

As far as budget goes, I don't really have one.  I don't want to spend more than I have to, but I also want some decent hardware (e.g. if I had to choose between a gigabit switch and a 10/100 switch, I'd be willing to spend the extra cash if it's not an absurd amount).

Thanks!"

A few years ago I had a bone spur on my ankle that was tearing apart my Achilles Tendon. December of 2011 I had surgery on it and the recovery was sloooow. Three months of crutches, then about five months of physical therapy. The kicker is, the surgery did not work. Apparently I am regrowing the bone spur, and the ankle pain is actually worse. Before it would only hurt and make me limp if I sprinted a lot. Now I can't even run at all.

Basically, if you read all that the point is that it has had a huge impact on my ability to exercise. I am a college student that also has a job, an internship, and I do research with one of my professors, so I don't always have time to go to the gym but I have gained about thirty pounds since this whole ankle business started. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to start off? I tend to snack a lot and have a huge problem with carbs, I can't seem to stop eating them. It's hard to get motivated too when I know it's not like I can go for a run. I do the bike at the gym when I can, but it doesn't burn nearly as many calories. "
1airza,54,2013-03-18,ME Trilogy completed...one week later... I'm still searching (*SPOILERS ALL*),sudline,masseffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/1airza/me_trilogy_completedone_week_later_im_still/,"Let me start this off by saying that I'm an RPG junkie and I just unequivocally love this series of games and am completely taken with the Mass Effect Universe.  While I played the trilogy it gave me a feeling I haven't felt since I was a wide-eyed kid playing Final Fantasy 4, 6, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and as I got older: Skies of Arcadia and Xenoblade.  That all consuming feeling of wanting to play every minute of every day.  The feeling of total world immersion.  Every night before my wife would go to bed she would ask me, ""How's Mass Effect going?""  And my response would usually be, ""Absolutely incredible.  I LOVE this game.""  However, once it all ended with ME3 I was devastated and left searching for some kind of closure.  One week and many sleepless nights later I still feel awful.

**How I got to this point:** WARNING: LONG AND RAMBLING.

I started playing ME1 two months ago.  Since I have the whole wife, kids, work thing going it took me awhile to complete all three games.  I played ME1 as an Adept and 2 and 3 as an Infiltrator.  I don't think I'll ever get sick of the sound and kickback of a Widow rifle (or squad cryo!).  Incredibly satisfying...  The absolute high point for me was definitely ME2.  I love games with large parties to choose from and lots of characters to get to know.  With all the recruitment and loyalty missions and subsequent dialogue....I was in heaven.  For me the story and dialogue became first and the action was something to do to get to more dialogue.

Now I've never had much use for Bioware romance.  I romanced Ashley in ME1 for...boy I really have no idea why...ugh...let's just say I wish I had chosen to save Kaiden on Virmire.  So as I was playing ME2 I was kinda insulted when the obvious T&amp;A show (Miranda) shows up who conveniently has a king size bed in her office...sigh...(c'mon Bioware...seriously).  I decided then and there I wasn't going to waste my time with romance.  Later after the Haelstrom mission Chambers tells Shepard that Tali likes me...  Wait, what?!  Tali was always the ""innocent little sister"" figure to me.  I liked Tali, I didn't think they developed her much in ME1 (more of just a walking Quarian codex), but I always had to have her all the time in my squad because of her decryption, so I had certainly gotten used to having her around.  But then I thought, ""This is interesting, where does Bioware go with this...a romance with the girl who can't take anything off or she gets sick and could die...a platonic romance??""  Ok, I'll bite, down to engineering I go.  Then as a curveball Tali tries in three separate conversations to tell me basically ""you don't want the akward girl in the suit, you deserve better."" Shepard: ""I don't want anyone else, I want you.""  Homerun!  Bioware got romance right.  My Shepard became a much deeper character with Tali at his side.  He was no longer just a renegade bad-ass space cowboy full of great one-liners and poses.  He was also caring and committed enough to be in a relationship where intimacy was difficult and his girlfriend was considered a second-class citizen through most of the galaxy.  ""Totally worth it.""  And I loved Kasumi's line: ""Tali is so cute...she loves you Shepard, be good to her.""

So blow up the Collector Base, everyone lives, tell the Illusive Man to F-off.  Game over.  ME2 is now in my Top 5 favorite games of all time.  I don't say things like that lightly, I've been gaming pretty much every day of my life since Atari.

Sigh...here it comes...I knew it going in....I read video game blogs every day...ME3 was controversial.  I never read any spoilers.  All I knew was the ending was bad, but it had been corrected in a free DLC.  So good!  Wow...I was not prepared.

I liked ME3, I liked the sense of urgency, the much darker tone.  I hated the ""keep clicking the red ring"" to talk to me dialogue with your crew.  Where was the dialogue wheel?  It no longer felt as real.  Don't get me wrong, there was great dialogue and I liked dropping in on conversations, but I felt a little dis-attached.  I satisfyingly broke up with Ashley (thank god...) told Allers to ""Get the hell off my ship!"" when she flirted with me on our first interview, and I loved every second of Tuchanka.  I was very sad to see Mordin go (my 2nd favorite character), but knew curing the Genophage was the right thing to do.  I was getting a little impatient, my version of Shepard did not feel complete without Tali in the squad, so I rushed ahead to get to Rannoch.  The whole sequence from the Geth dreadnought to slugging Han'Gerrel to Legion asking me ""How many creators have you seen unmasked?  Well....one,"" to killing the Reaper was incredible.  All was right in the world of ME:  I had Tali back, she says ""I love you"", she's going to get her beachfront house, the Quarians and Geth are united, and I get a bad photoshop picture in my cabin (whatever...).  Shepard is on a roll and I am on cloud nine.  Suddenly, I become more focused and the game becomes easier.  Shepard's Black Widow V is obliterating everything in his way, Tali went from akward pilgrimage girl to bad-ass shotgun-wielding sarcastic, funny, unashamed quarian admiral.  Every one of her whispered lines melted my heart and I couldn't wait for the inevitable ""House on Rannoch"" scene.  The Reapers were going to lose.

I'm a completionist.  I had every war asset I could find, all systems were explored to 100%.  I completed the From Ashes, Omega, and Leviathan DLC.  I had made all the right decisions, I never lost a crew member (except Kaiden).  It was time to win.  I got through Priority Earth and was ready for the final push.  I got to talk to all the wonderful and memorable characters one last time and Tali melts my heart with the ""I want more time"" line.  That ""House on Rannoch"" scene is going to be so awesome.

I get to the beam run scene.  Tali gets hurt and Shepard calls for an evac.  What?? An evac here???  How is that possible??  Why not just drop me off at the beam then??  Shepard loads Tali into the Normandy and I'm hit with the ""I have a home.  Come back to me."" line.  I can feel the knife go into my heart and twist.  Shepard responds with ""Go, get out of here!""  What??  The girl just poured her heart out to you and that's what you say??  Where's the ""Don't worry, I'll be fine.""  At least tell her you love her.  What?????  I calm myself down, it's ok, Bioware wouldn't do that...the game has been masterfully written.  Let's get to the beam.  Shepard is hit and my armor is gone and I have a pistol??  I don't carry a pistol...  Harbinger flys off....he just FLYS off...ok???  WTH is going on here?  Here comes some husks and a marauder.  Shoot them dead.  Good.  Hit ""R"" to reload.  There's no ammo in this pistol...ok.  Another head scratcher.  So finally get to the beam and who is inside but Anderson and the Illusive Man??????   How did they get here?  Cue everyone stumbling around in pain sequence.  Kill the Illusive Man, Anderson dies.  I think of the Han Solo line ""Let's blow this thing and go home!""  Then the ghost kid appears...

THREE CHOICES?!?!  NO! THERE IS ONE CHOICE!  I just spent the last 150+ hours convinced that the Reapers need to die and in the last two minutes you are trying to sell me on sacrificing myself to either control the Reapers or synthesize with them??  So basically, do what the Illusive Man or Saren wanted?!?!  HELL F'ING NO!!!  It's damn insulting to even consider that.  I didn't spend the last 150+ hours WINNING just to lose in the cutscene.  Let's blow this place and GTFO.  Call the evac in!

Wait...WTF is Joker doing?  He's leaving the fight...he's leaving the f--cking fight...he would never leave the F--CKING fight...nor would any of his crew!  All of them would gladly die trying to get Shepard out.  Ok ok, Admiral Hackett's speech, yada yada, a bad slideshow of vacation photo's of the crew, keep going...the payoff is coming soon.  Wait...is that Tali holding my f--cking nameplate to put on the memorial wall.  NO.....no......no no no no no no no no no no no no no!!!  ALT+TAB.  Open chrome.  WTF did I do wrong??  Did I make a bad decision??  I thought I would get the perfect ending.  Oh good, here's a youtube video: Perfect ending Tali Romance.  Wait...this is the EXACT SAME ENDING I JUST SAW!!!!  Go back in-game see the crew crashed on some jungle planet?!?!  Joker, Tali and Javik go out.  WTF IS THIS BULL?? Then I get the ""Tell me more about THE SHEPARD"" line.  See the breath scene.  THANKS FOR PLAYING!!!  Purchase more DLC!!!

THANKS FOR PLAYING?!?!?!?!  THANKS FOR PLAYING?!?!?!?!  NO, F--CK YOU!!!  You just ruined my favorite game series of all time and you tell me to buy more DLC?!?!

I woke up my wife at 4AM that night and said.  Honey, I beat ME3.  Oh good, she says.  I say ""No, it was f--cking bullshit!""  The ending was non-sensical and awful!  An unpaid emo intern wrote it who thought it would be cool to make a DARK ending.  It's the only explanation.

So here I am:  still upset.  Still getting 3 hours of sleep a night.  Pouring over ME videos and content trying to get answers of just WTH happened over at Bioware.  I was even more distraught to learn how they handled the initial outrage a year ago.  Will time heal the wounds?  I played the Citadel DLC (they got their wish!!  I did just what they asked me to do!  I bought more DLC!! Hooray!!  Maybe I'm indoctrinated...).  Lots of awesome moments (nearly cried when Tali sang to Shepard), but couldn't enjoy it because I knew ultimately what the end game was.  If anything it just sent me into a deeper spiral.  I found myself staring in the mirror the other night saying, ""Pull yourself together, you have a family to take care of, it's just a damn game.""  But to me it wasn't....it was the ultimate space fantasy escape.

If you managed to read all of this...I thank you.  I know...it was LONG and long-winded, but it probably means that you care just as much I do about the ME Universe and where its future goes.  I really hope this isn't the end.  AND where's my GODDAMN house on Rannoch??"
1aiibj,197,2013-03-18,How do I accept the fact that I'm an average person?,awwfuckmylife,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1aiibj/how_do_i_accept_the_fact_that_im_an_average_person/,"I'm a guy in his early 20's finishing Computer Science/Math courses with mediocre grades at a community college. I'm probably transferring to a mediocre university because I got rejected from (so far) six universities I applied to, and the rejection letters are still coming in. I will probably never work at a top tier Silicon Valley tech company or work on cutting research because I'm simply not smart enough. Summer internship hunting hasn't been successful either. I've honestly got nothing going for me.

The thing that hurts the most is that I actually try hard at improving my life, but I keep coming up short. I study a lot, genuinely try to learn about CS in my spare time, and exercise 4-6 times a week. From an outsider's perspective it may seem like I've got my shit together, but my actual achievements are hardly spectacular.

I've always imagined myself to be this badass guy who went to a stellar university and got a job at a place like Google or something, but I'm beginning to realize these are childish fantasies. The reality is that I'm just an average dude, going to an OK school with absolutely no intern/job prospects at the moment. Maybe I'll accomplish something great one day, but it's hard seeing the light at the end of the tunnel at this point.

I'm not giving up on pursuing my goals. The motivation is still there. It's just that I keep asking myself ""Is this the best that I can do?"" and the answer is almost always ""Yes"". My self-esteem has slowly been decreasing over time, but that should already be obvious.

My distress is further increased by the vast amount of success stories that float around here. It seems like there's so many people here who simply worked hard and became uber successful. But what about the guys who work hard and don't make the cut? What happens to them? I fear I might end up in the category of failures you never hear about.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the incredibly insightful comments. I truly appreciate them. I'm taking my time to read through each and every post and trying to respond. Thank you all once again."
1aidtv,3,2013-03-18,Dont know what to do with my life. ,NAZGUL9,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1aidtv/dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"First off, Ill start with a little background. Im a 26 year old w/m and i live in the midwest. I went to college (did really well surprisingly) and got a BS degree in Law Enforcement. Amazingly after completing my internship and graduating i got a job as an investigator at a county level narcotics task force not more than a month after graduation. 

This is great, I was barely 22 years old and got a job doing what alot of guys spend their entire careers in patrol striving for. So for almost 4 and a half years I work for the task force. At first it was pretty amazing, doing undercover work, catching bad guys, putting evil people in prison. At some point along the way i realized that some of the people we were arresting weren't bad at all, (small time non violent users) and I started trying to justify our ruthless actions to put them away. We would arrest someone for possessing an ounce of weed, and it would make the other guys happy, like they were getting a kick out of catching this person doing wrong. I started to question a lot of things at my job.  

The task force i worked for doesn't lend its self well to making careers. The pay is not very good in comparison, and its grant funded so it can lose funding at any time. So the idea is you get some experience and you parlay that into getting a job in patrol at a department thats well funded and has a union. This is exactly what i did, 4.5 years into my career, and Im strapping on a uniform all while questioning the very role of modern law enforcement. 

Lets just say my time in uniform didn't go very well. They took me and threw me into the fucking shark tank. I can begin to describe how douchey and macho/alpha male everyone at this particular dept is. Im quiet, I prefer to let other people talk until i need to make my point, and then I can get very assertive. This did not fly, I was immediately informed that i was not nearly aggressive enough with ""telling people how it was going to be"" and that I ""didn't want to look like a bitch on the street"". To cut it short, they basically found out that i was laid back, and totally didn't fit the mold for their dept. I will admit that I made a bunch of rookie mistakes throughout the training process, but who doesn't? Also none of the things i did wrong were, illegal, immoral, or unethical. Just dumb shit like driving the slower way to a call. 

Well eventually Im given the option to resign or be fired. They sat me down and said ""you don't fit in here we want you to leave"", so i resigned and left. This was two months ago, and now I have no idea if i should try my hand in another sector. I have very few marketable skills, and a pretty narrow education. 

For the last two months I've been lost, I have no idea what to do. I apply for any job i qualify for, and a few that i don't. Ive probably sent out 60 applications. Ive had two interviews for part time jobs, and I soon got emails stating that neither of those were going to work out. I feel worthless, like I did something horrible, and now society is making me pay for it. My family is disappointed in me, even though this is the only time I've been unemployed since college.  

Im lonely as shit, I went through a hectic few weeks after i got fired, and the resulting negativity caused the girl i was dating to break up with me, I really don't blame her, I treated her like shit the whole time I had that job, I would do the exact same thing in her place. Its impossible to meet people as i live in a small rural area, and if I do meet someone nice, I'm like hey yeah I basically reddit all day and not get calls back for part time jobs...........Ladies contain your orgasams 

So yeah, Im here, trying to vent out all my anger, frustration, negativity. I decided today that the only thing i can really do is try to be positive, and hopefully positive things will come my way. "

1am3ri,2,2013-03-19,I [27 M] am having trouble getting over my ex [21 F] who lives below me and shares four college classes.,Synchestra,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1am3ri/i_27_m_am_having_trouble_getting_over_my_ex_21_f/,"Ok, this will be kind of long, but here goes...

I graduated and got my bachelor's degree in psychology this past December and immediately began on the path to get a master's degree in Residential Property Management. Because I'm changing career focuses, I have to take several courses with undergrad students in order to officially take graduate level courses, and so my classes are composed of a younger crowd. Meet Shelley.

Shelley is in all of my classes and starts talking to me one day. We hit it off so to speak during that conversation we realize we live at the same apartment complex. We had a night class that same day and afterwards she asked if I wanted to get some beer and hangout. I was leery because of not wanting to shit where I eat, so to speak, but it was hard to say no. She's a very attractive petite blonde, and didn't seem high maintenance to me. Almost too good to be true.

So of course I said yes and we hung out and talked for hours. This ended with her curled up asleep on my chest in her bed. I suddenly came to at 4 am and once again thought I was getting in over my head is a situation that would be compromising. Still I kissed her a few times and said I needed to go upstairs.

Fast forward a few weeks; we're spending almost all our time together. She works two jobs currently and when she wasn't working we were in class, doing homework, having sex, or hanging out. I knew it was really fast but she was just VERY into me. I've had sexual issues for years, almost my entire adult life. She's the first girl in years that I confided in before we tried and being more comfortable and allowed me to relax. I was really getting into having a real sex life again.

Things progress and although there's an age gap I felt like we can handle it. I'm totally set on being my own person and she does too, at least no jealousy or possessiveness seemed to pervade our relationship. At some point Shelley mentions that women in her family have issues with their vaginas more or less (frequent UTI's, that sort of thing), so I wasn't surprised that she was nervous about going to a gyno appointment that was coming up for her. That whole week, she eventually couldn't start her period. She told me about this one night and I asked her if she might be pregnant, of course. She'd already taken a test and said she ""knew"" that wasn't pregnant or she would feel differently. She then told me about the abortion she had this past summer and how she was worried that she wouldn't be able to have children based on how she'd been feeling. I tried to be reassuring, but she didn't seem that affected.

Amidst all this going on, her grades are slipping a bit in school, while I'm trying to help. She's on academic probation so this is her last shot. Eventually she started acting very different around me, she'd say she'd call or see me that night and would never get to me. Keep in mind this was of her own accord; we didn't make prior plans, she would just call and then...not call back. I knew something was up, especially since she was all over me for over a month and then...nothing. The last two weeks were really hard.... She was so unaffectionate and negative that I knew I couldn't have that in my life, but I didn't wanna ditch her either. I was torn. I really liked her but at the same time, I felt like I couldn't make her feel better about things.

I finally talked to her and she revealed that it wasn't a good time for her to be with someone, which I understood. She explained that there were many things I didn't know about her past (some of which was drug use, which I did know some things of). We agreed to remain amicable of course. Why not, right?

Well the first few days after I felt kind of liberated, as she had made a difficult decision for me. But then all the past couple years of building myself up and feeling confident and self-assured started to creep back into gray territory. She seemed so unaffected by the whole thing, just very different. At one point she did get tested for ADD (which she had bad study habits involving distractors like TV, music, etc), but the psychologist thought she was depressed. I know the way she's acting probably wasn't really about me, but it's been hurting all the same.

To make matters worse, we both attended a multiple company interview last week (something I had been looking forward to and something she'd been dreading) and she got an offer for an internship. With my degree and life experience I thought I was a shoo in; I guess I'm trying to say that it made me jealous somewhat and I know that's pointless and that if I really care I need to be happy for her. I think her total disconnect really bothered me. She did apologize a couple times for being a bitch, but honestly she wasn't a bitch to me, she just had a very bad attitude and I told her it was no big deal, especially considering the circumstances and how she'd been feeling.

Sorry, I know this is really long. I just sometimes feel like I get so emotionally attached that it consumes me and I've really been trying to leave that part of me behind. What can I do? Are relationships just too emotionally demanding for me?

TL;DR GF and I date for two months; sex life is good, first good sex life I've had in years. Girl reveals past abortion and and grows distant and breaks up with me.

1alixw,5,2013-03-19,"First time posting here, here is my journey so far.",Rhombus_of_Terror,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1alixw/first_time_posting_here_here_is_my_journey_so_far/,"Bare with me, a wall of text is incoming. It seems like the normal thing to do first time posters.

So, I have recently had a 5 year stretch of self inflicted isolation. It is only until this year that I decided to take action. I'm 28 years old. I have not had a full diagnosis yet, but all signs point to social anxiety and exclusion, implicated by my lack of self confidence. My CBT program begins in a month or so. I have had many a situation evolve into me not engaging in any kind of conversation unless I am spoken too, which gives me information to work with in order to talk. I have the added complication of Dyslexia. I don't go out to socialise, which many of you would expect, or more importantly, network.

I feel better talking about anything rather than who I am and what I do, the only thing I want to say is that I stay at home spending many hours drawing to keep myself busy. I never waste time playing video games, it's counter-productive. But the environment I am in is too comfortable for this to be of any success. It's not as good as talking about my “job” working in a design agency for example. This does not bode well for my future life, especially when my chosen career in illustration relies heavily in selling yourself as an individual. Mostly, my artwork reflect the complexities I go through in life and how it affects me, contorted caricatures of people, sometimes extensions of myself, to paintings of the cosmos to reflect my distancing away from my surroundings. The people I know don't know that, but you and I do. When approaching anything regarding work and making decisions for  myself in that area, I feel a great sense of enclosure and not in a comforting way. I haven't got anything to fall back on or back me up along the way. I am also very self aware of my surroundings in public, so I always go out with my headphones to distract me.

So a lot has happened in two months since making the decision to fix this.

How I have managed it for now by somewhat forcing myself to do things, not too often but enough to build on before my CBT takes hold. I am never comfortable with this process though it has yielded one good result. I found, via twitter, a group of creatives that meet-up bi-weekly. This turned out to be a good exercise in how I can handle a situation like the on I described above. I had one or two moments of like; “oh, what should I talk about now” as most of the group were graphic designers / illustrators my questions were very constrained. I had learnt quickly I was the only one without a job, they all had internships, mentors and / or prospering jobs etc, so that was at the forefront of my mind for most of the evening. I meet them again this Thursday.

Speaking.....typing of careers and work, this area is my most worrisome area. I have never formerly had a conventional job since my A-levels in 2004, or ever in my adult life. The idea of being in a constantly public place was and still is too taunting to me and worried how people I recognised would view me as. I do not believe at this time that I don't have the capacity to describe what my assets are. I don't believe that I possess many of them when I think about it but I do know I will be able to to when my CBT takes effect. This in-turn has made my job searching tastes very picky and I often come across that the requirements ultimately put me off applying. My most valuable experience was at an artspace which ended with me being swept under the rug so-to-speak after a year of being there, but it taught me a lot about my hometown's art scene and how it is such a push-pull part of my life right now. Most of the art is un-engaging but it is an area of great interest career wise. This has also given me the impetus to try and set-up an artspace beginning with those who are in a similar position like myself. A twitter friend came up with the idea of gaining support from a charity so we could establish ourselves, she had anxiety which has since been treated. So there's another avenue that I am keen to explore.

My family loosely knows about my position and I have no best friends to speak to about it, let alone reveal the truth. Right now, I am resting my hopes on these creatives meet-ups, my involvement with my local mental charity and the forthcoming CBT sessions. The pieces are there but my next challenge is to put them together.

1akq16,1,2013-03-19,I feel like the world just hates me and will continue to do so. ,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1akq16/i_feel_like_the_world_just_hates_me_and_will/,"Just as the title suggests. It doesn't matter what it is about me, it just never seems to go right and/or isn't ideal. I have a lot of things going on in my life, so bare with my long explanation please. 

General: I'm a 21 year old college student

Education: I study political science. I've always been good with relating to people no matter how different they really are from me. All I want to do with my life is help people. I want to help other people like me out of poverty and to a good life. But unfortunately for me it seems like the only way I can get into politics or a decent job with a non-profit is if I graduated from Ivy League with a 4.0. Truth is I go to a shitty state school and I have a 3.07 GPA. As I see graduation coming I feel like I can say goodbye to my career dreams. Hell I can't even get an internship, let alone a real job in my field. On top of this I'm currently taking 18 credits of 400 level political science classes and studying for my GRE exam. I also work in my university's library 20 hours a week for a boss who threatens me daily and is very discriminatory about my gender (if you read til the end you will know more)

Personal Relationships: I haven't had a real relationship since I was 17. Haven't dated anyone since. I haven't had sex in a year and a half. Why? I'm scared to death of it. The last girl I slept with falsely accused me of rape and then proceeded to drag my name through the mud til she found out I tried to kill myself over it. Then she admitted that she lied after finding out. 

Family: I've never had much of a family. My mother is a good person, but she is an alcoholic and she has dated an abusive alcoholic most of my life. My father is controlling, like military controlling. He was psychologically and physically abusive to me growing up. I barely talk to them anymore. My only close family member is my brother and he lives 1500 miles away from me now. Its hard to keep in touch as he lives his own life now. 

Random: It kills me on almost a daily basis how I fucked everything up. Once upon a time I played football, basketball, baseball, and track. I was recruited for everything except baseball. I got a scholarship to Division I for track. I ran the 110m/400m hurdles, high jump, and 4x100 relay. High jump was my best event though. Why is this a problem right now? I couldn't handle college as a freshman, I let my anxiety and depression get the best of me and I failed out. Thus giving up my passion and scholarship. Every spring I get that itch to go out and run on the track again. But I can't do that anymore. I just pissed away my amazing physical gifts. 


The biggest issue: I'm a pre-op male-to-female transgender. I'm far past the point of questioning and I'm completely out to everyone in my life. No one at this point refers to me by my birth name and as a male, they all refer to me as a girl and by my girl name. Right now I'm currently waiting to see a doctor for my estrogen therapy. I'm seeing arguably the best doctor in the world in the field, but unfortunately she has a long waiting list. I've already been waiting three months, I've still got a month and half left to go. It hurts really bad inside every day to get up and look in the mirror. My body doesn't match who I am on the inside. The waiting game for the hormones is killing me inside.

Other than my general waiting for my hormones, there is a plethora of issue on my mind in relation. I've hid my being transgender from my family for the past two years (that is how long I've been out). Last month I came out to every family member. They all have been supportive, but its very overwhelming. I also have to worry about how I'm suppose to pay for everything, since insurance thinks its all cosmetic. I have to worry that I won't get a job because of who I am. I worry every time I leave my apartment that someone is going to insult me or attack me. I worry that I can't find a real boyfriend because it seems like every guy interested in me is some porn addicted freak trying to satisfy a fetish. My boss is discriminatory in the fact she won't call me my name or refer to me as a girl. This whole gender transition thing is majorly depressing. I wish I could just wake up tomorrow as a girl. 

All of these things together makes me feel like the weight of the world is constantly on my shoulders. Its been this way for years now. I see a therapist, but it doesn't help. Being that, what brings me to make my first post to this subreddit? I had a girlfriend of mine earlier style one of my wigs for me. It took her hours to do, so I decided to a take a pic with it on. I really loved the pic, I thought that I looked beautiful and for the first time in a long time I saw myself as a girl. There is a subreddit on here for transpeople where a person submits a photo of themselves trying to pass as their gender. The forum generally is positive and upvotes nearly everything no matter how much the person doesn't pass. I've submitted before and had a lot of success and positive comments. Being that, I submitted the photo I took. I was feeling really happy and good about myself prior to that. I posted it and within ten minutes I was downvoted into oblivion. I know I shouldn't care about such ridiculous things like upvote/downvoting, but for someone like me, passing as my gender is everything and for me to look that fucking bad kind of kills me inside. When I saw how many downvotes I had, I deleted it and promptly cried. Needless to say, I think I'm going to avoid the transgender subreddits for a while. 

I'm sorry if this was too long. Thank you so much if you read all of it. I've just never felt this depressed in my life and I kind of needed to talk to someone about everything. Either way, I think I'm going to go cry myself to sleep now :(

1akpaq,1,2013-03-19,"my apathy is becoming a significant problem in my life. please help, I need advice!",1depressedstudent,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1akpaq/my_apathy_is_becoming_a_significant_problem_in_my/,"Thanks for reading my post. I appreciate whatever advice you can give me. I'm a second-year biology student a highly ranked public university. I came in with honors and from top percent of my high school class and I'm generally described as a bright guy. Lately my grades have been slipping, leading me to a 3.25 gpa, but this quarter I'm looking at pretty much all Cs and Ds. There's one class I need to pass in order to even get my biology degree (it's a lower-div requirement, and if I get below a C then I have to choose a different major), and right now my grade is a 24%. The average is about a 60%. If I get 100% on the final then my raw score will only be a 64. Basically, without a serious curve I'm at risk of not even getting a biology degree. I'm below the average in all my other classes and I dropped oChem last month because I failed the first test. I just got fired from my research internship because I didn't put enough effort into it, and I got rejected from a returning student leadership position just because I missed my interview appointment. I like science and learning, and I'm captivated by the idea of going into research but I don't know if I'm just lying to myself. I put off my work until the last minute, sometimes really screwing myself over because I'm rushing into class late with unfinished assignments. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and whenever I ask myself I shrug and procrastinate. If I'm not half-assing a project or studying, then I'm mentally or literally masturbating. I find myself lurking on Reddit more than ever, and some weeks I go with barely any sleep and I let my room become a mess. I don't think I'm depressed so much as apathetic, but it's really stressing me out and I hate myself for not being the person I want to be! And I hate myself for not even having a real idea of who I want to be! I'm scared of confronting this hole that I've dug myself, and I've started to lie to my girlfriend and my parents about my grades. I'm starting to feel sick thinking about the mess I'm in and I could really use some advice, Reddit. Why am I doing this to myself? I want to stop being so apathetic, but thinking about my other actions as of late, I think the only thing I ever really want is approval. I'm sad and angry and I want help!"
1akojr,3,2013-03-19,Someone please lift me back up.,Nemesis3137,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1akojr/someone_please_lift_me_back_up/,"Its been 1 and a half months since the breakup and i'm falling down again. Theres a giant fear in me because I know shes going to try to see me next week when she visits town. She wants to work on being friends and move on.. I need to gather the courage to say It's not a good idea. I just dont want to get hurt more. Since she broke up with me, Ive checked this subreddit every single day, I guess it makes me feel better to know that I'm not alone. Ive googled everything about breakups. Ive read everything out there. I blocked her from popping up on my facebook newsfeed but I wont defriend her. Now, Everytime I logon i see her in the chat area, with the green circle or the mobile img. I always want to click but I never do. I just wont let myself do it. FB always puts her name first when she likes my friends status. I think it doesnt understand that we broke up, It just knows that I used to talk to her a lot so it thinks we are best friends. 

I just don't know what to do with myself I think im falling into depression. Ive thought about going to the campus counseling but I know ultimately they cant get her back to me. They would only help me focus on me.  Ive kept NC only breaking it once to send a letter 3 weeks into the breakup. The fact that she hasnt said anything to me since she broke up with me hurts. I thought I could always count on her to talk to about life. Everyone else is leaving me in the dark. I don't have that many friends and no one seems to be texting me or fb chatting me anymore. I feel alone. The thoughts and memories of her are always on my mind. I wish I could just go back to being happy. I wish I was still with her. 

She said It wasn't my fault, I didn't do anything wrong and I dont need to change and that I am a good guy but she cant be with me anymore. I cant stop wishing that I was a different person, whatever she wanted me to be. Then we both could be happy. Sometimes I wish one day I would find a post from her here, but she doesnt even use reddit. I feel like if she ever knew just how much time i spent moping about her she would think im so pathetic and that I need to move on. Im convinced she doesn't think about me everyday. It's so different for the one who initiates the break up.

I live life day by day now. I go to school, I do my work, I workout but shes always in my mind. She'll never leave. Im scared to see her again when she gets back from her internship, I don't want to just be friends like she wants.

Ill still be here for you guys. I read your stories everyday. Ill comment on your posts and try to help you, I know you hurt like I do. I want everyone to get better."

[x-post /relationships],[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1akmni/why_cant_i_just_be_happy_and_normal_xpost/,"We've been dating since college, it started 5+ years ago. We've only been married for 6 months. We are very much in love and we are great together, but my problems seem to weigh him down so much, specially my anxiety and fibromyalgia.

I haven't graduated yet. I've had severe depression and he's always been there for me. I've had many jobs, and there was a time I actually succeeded, but since my pain began everything just went downhill.
Four years ago I had an ""accident"", I was drinking with him and fell on my ass. It was really funny until next day I could barely walk, and I realized I had broken my coccyx, and the doctor just told me to rest for a few weeks and put ice on it, but my pain never fully went away. A couple of years after the accident it became unbearable, to the point I couldn't get out of bed and had to leave work (I was an english teacher) and college. 

In a year I did get better and get back to work, found a job I loved in a great family company where everyone loved me... but soon it all came back, so I had to leave. It was really disappointing, especially because I felt horrible for the company who had just put so much work into me. Around the same time I was really depressed and decided to leave my college course, which I hated. He supported me fully and helped me follow my dreams. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia (and the accident had just triggered it), after going to many doctors who didn't believe me because all my tests were normal. 

Another year went by and I was feeling better again. I was in a new college, studying what I love, and had found an internship I loved too. Then I got an awesome job offer: a company I really wanted to work for had decided to open an internship spot for me, because they loved me so much and I didn't have time for a full time job (because of school). I was thrilled! But then... all over again. This time was worse because I was so miserable there I didn't even want to go. 
They didn't know exactly what to do with me so I was working as a filler and I had to carry heavy stuff all the time. I told my manager that I could not carry it because it hurt me and he just said ""well, don't"", which isn't easy to do when you're trying to do a good job and dirty plates keep piling up beside you and no one takes them to the kitchen. Also people have always looked at me weirdly when I say I'm in pain because it's invisible - I've gotten so used to it you can't tell I'm in that much pain. So a lot of people just think I'm making excuses. Anyway, I stopped even showing up after a month... which is really unlike me.

It's been 8 months and I'm completely terrified of looking for new jobs. I've applied myself to studying and I want to do a masters... But I don't want to depend on my husband! He works so hard and I'd like to be able to contribute... but every time I even think about working I get freaked out. My anxiety is getting worse and I'm starting to miss classes (and lie to him about it because I'm so ashamed), having panic attacks, sleeping terribly. I feel another bout of depression coming and I can't handle anything in my life anymore. I'm on medication and psychiatric treatment, he is really sweet and supportive... But I feel like my depression, anxiety and pain are weighing him down. He deserves to work less, not to worry about me and to be completely happy. I'm afraid I'll never be able to contribute.

I don't even know what to do anymore. We are in a good place in our relationship but we are not exactly happy because I'm not happy, and he loves me so much I know he keeps his pain inside not to trouble me. I want to help him be happy.

Oh, and my pain has horribly affected our sex life. It used to be amazing, then it started to be painful, and now I get so nervous when he touches me that we barely ever have sex. Probably once every 2 weeks when I'm drunk and feel no pain/anxiety. I really miss the intimacy. I miss being close to the love of my life... And I feel like we're slowly drifting apart. :(

Why can't I just be normal? I have everything I could ever want and need, and I just lose it or ruin it or make it sad. I know it's not my fault but it's hard not to blame yourself when there's no one to blame. I just want to be able to do normal things, even the smallest things are SO HARD for me! I have all this capability and intelligence locked inside a depressed brain and a weak failing body. ARGH.

I know I should be happy, I am going to college without that much debt, having fun, getting good grades, I have a part time job that allows me to have a life, etc...

But I just hate it. I have a crappy job as a student fundraisor for my school, where I get bitched at by everyone I am calling, and then bitched at my my manager because I let the unemployed psych major go because she had to rush about and get her three kids to bed without asking for all four levels of money. I feel so shitty about what I am doing, I can't stand it. I only have $500 to my name that I can spend, and &amp;250 will soon be spent because a ""friend"" of mine was smoking in my dorm's bathroom, and when he was cought claimed I told him it was okay (yeah, that never happoned.)

And I am pursueing a double major in History and Geography, because I enjoy both subjects and I am too stupid for the math required for the good majors. Honestly I would be better off dropping out and starting to work at McDonalds now, but my parents would be devastated. On both sides of my family, everyone fucking went to college, I am always compared to my cousins (3 engineering students, a Physics major, and a nurse). My parents don't know that I chose such shitty subjects, because they would never accept it. 

I thought I was on the right track, I was all prim and proper throughout High School, got decent grades, studied what needed to be studied, easily found out that I love History and Geography, got accepted to every college I applied to, got a near-full ride to an okay school, chose to go there because my parent's expected me to pay for it by myself. 

I am about to just call it, and drop out. I don't give a fuck anymore. Every day I am reminded that no matter what my shitty BAs in History and Geography won't mean SHIT. I have had it. Don't even want to finish my reading for tomarrow. I love history, and love geography, I have enjoyed all of my classes this past year, enjoyed the freedom, made new friends, but it is all for naught. Every day I go in for work I am reminded just how fucking pointless it is. I talk to liberal arts graduates with no job, working in wawa, or getting paid $7/hour to scrub urinals as a ""History Intern"". 

I can't seem to find another job. Work-study job are only available to those who have an inside connection and the rest just ignore my application and resume. I worked my Junior and Senior year in high school, had a internship at a federal agency during High School, have excellent references, and a fairly strong resume. 

Fuck me, right?"

1akkx5,4,2013-03-18,"I got street harassed, I reacted badly, and now I think my harasser might be staking me out by my apartment building. Any advice? [TRIGGER: stalking, harassment]",secretagentemeline,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1akkx5/i_got_street_harassed_i_reacted_badly_and_now_i/,"I just moved to Washington, D.C. from a smaller city out west to do a semester-long internship. While I've been harassed on the street at home, I feel like it's been more frequent and more virulent while I've been here. It happens at all times of day, regardless of what I'm wearing (not that it matters, whatsoever) and in all sorts of situations and locations. I'm usually pretty good at putting up my bullshit blinders and just ignoring street harassing scumbags, but a recent street harassment incident has left me really scared, really intimidated and really pissed off.

I was on my way back from a yoga class on Sunday afternoon when, not twenty feet from the front door to my apartment building, a man standing on the corner whistled at me. 

Again, usually, I just ignore this stuff and refuse to engage with that kind of behavior, but something happened this time that made me snap. I was physically tired, from my class, but also tired of feeling unsafe, freaked out and sad every time I leave my apartment. I flipped him off as I walked away, without looking back. He immediately shouted, ""Asshole!"" back at me. (Not what I was expecting from a street harasser -- I've heard ""bitch"" and ""whore"" before but such a gender-neutral insult was surprising). Again, out of character, I yelled back to him, ""No, you're the asshole!"" as I walked into my building.

I immediately regretted it and wished that I had just ignored him, but I forgot about it pretty quickly and went on with my life. 

However, when I was getting off the Metro on the way back from work tonight (Monday), I saw the same man standing at the top of the escalators with another man. (I should note that my apartment building is right above this Metro stop -- the place where I saw him again is about 30 feet from where the whistling happened). Luckily, I was with a friend, and as I passed by him, I deliberately didn't make eye contact or even look in his direction, and when I glanced back, he wasn't looking at me. It's pretty normal for people to hang out under the covered area by the escalators, but something just made me feel like he was waiting for someone.

I want to think that my response somehow deterred him from harassing other people, and that all of this can just be chalked up to some huge coincidence -- maybe he lives or works around here and we just overlap because we share a neighborhood. But I've always been told to follow my instincts, and something about this feels weird.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I'm reading too much into this, if I'm blowing it up too much or not enough, if I should get the police involved, if I should tell my building's front desk/security people. I've kind of thought that maybe I should see if he's hanging around the next few nights and proceed from there, but is that risky, or the right move at this point? I would really, really appreciate any advice, feedback, stories, etc. I know I'm not alone in this, but it sure feels that way.

**TL;DR A guy whistled at me as I was walking into my apartment, I flipped him off and a small shouting match ensued. Saw the same man near my apartment tonight. Wondering if I should be concerned.**

I'm a junior at the University of West Georgia studying Computer Science. I am looking to work during the summer (full-time or part-time, either is fine by me) and get my feet wet with practical application of concepts I've learned throughout my time at UWG. I am willing to commute anywhere in the metro-Atlanta or West Georgia areas.

Completed coursework includes Data Structures &amp; Discrete Math, Software Engineering, Web Development, System Architecture, and Intelligent Systems. I plan to take Information Management, Android Development, and Program Construction in the Fall.

I am proficient in Java and Python development, and have had exposure to C, Visual Basic, web2py, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I also have ~1.5 years of employment experience with UWG's student helpdesk, providing tech support for students with Windows and OS X based computers.

Ideally, I would like to pursue an internship for software development or system administration, though I'm keeping an open mind for any other suitable opportunities.

Any leads would be much appreciated!"

The day before yesterday (Sunday) I was on my way home from a yoga class and just steps from the front door to my apartment building when a man standing on the corner whistled at me. Again, these smaller cat calls (not to say that any form street harassment is less serious than another) usually don't receive a response from me, as I feel like I shouldn't even dignify their bullshit with a response. But I was tired -- physically from my class, and tired of being harangued like my body is a public object that is somehow open to commentary -- and I snapped. I flipped him off as I walked away, not looking back. Immediately, he called out, ""Asshole!"" Then, without hesitating, I shouted back, ""You're the asshole!"" Not the most tactful response, but it felt like I was a branch snapping under the weight of months of this behavior. 

I immediately regretted it and wished that I had completely ignored him, but I didn't think anything of it until I came back from work tonight (Monday). As I was getting off the Metro (luckily I was with a friend) I saw him standing at the top of the escalators with another man. It's pretty normal for people in my neighborhood to hang out under the covered area by the escalators down to the Metro, and it was raining tonight, but it felt looked like he was standing there waiting for someone. 

I want to believe deep down that somehow my comeback opened his mind to how offensive, rude and gross street harassing is, or that it at least put him off it, that he wasn't waiting outside the Metro for me, that he just lives around here and it's all a coincidence. However, a big part of me feels like I've provoked a violent reaction in a person who obviously has a hard time with respecting boundaries, and I'm afraid of what could happen as a result of that. I'm also afraid of jumping the gun and filing a police report or talking to the front desk/security folks at my apartment building, just in case this is a total coincidence. I thought maybe I should wait a few more nights to see if it keeps happening. Luckily, I'm going out of town this weekend so I'll have some safe-time away from here. Most of all, I guess I'm just freaked out that he knows where I live and where I commute. It makes me feel unsafe in my home and in my body, and that really sucks.

Should I even be worried about seeing him tonight? Am I blowing this up, or should I be blowing this up? Is it worth reporting to the police at this point or should I wait to see what happens tomorrow night? Is pepper spray or some other self-defense mechanism a good investment at this point? 

**TL;DR Got street harassed outside my apartment building, responded with my middle finger and a small shouting match ensued, saw harasser again the next night right by my apartment building, felt like he was waiting for me. Super freaked out and trying to figure out the next step. **

1akepr,0,2013-03-18,[26/m] not understanding what my capricious relationship with my interest is exactly [25/f],PsyLaw,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1akepr/26m_not_understanding_what_my_capricious/,"So I met this girl in May 2012 through, of all people, my mom's friend. She introduced me to her employee (school tutor and student) and asked if I could help her with the LSAT, since I'm currently in law school. She is very capricious, and we're now 2 career choices past law school... I had just gotten out of a terrible, abusive (Her to me. She had borderline personality disorder) relationship with my ex. 

I was instantly attracted to her. Beautiful, witty, funny, head on straight, and now a college grad. Unfortunately, we met the summer before I moved 5 hours away to attend law school. We never really established anything other than dating which later became more of a friend zone thing. We eventually started calling more and more. 

In November, we finally admitted that we had feelings for each other. We would talk for hours almost every night. In fact she helped reassure me that I was going to be fine on my finals; that I'm way too smart not to do well. Come winter break, I come home and finally we get to see each other. Kissing led to heavy petting, but she stopped it since we really had no where to be other than my car. I was okay with that. After a week and a half of that, she called me to tell me that she just isn't ready. She really likes me, but she needs me to be her friend for now until she's ready. I said I understood. I didn't...
 
I guess I never treated her as a friend. She was still sweet to me and we talked romantically quite a bit. I may have smothered her a bit by sending her a stuffed animal, candy, and a really long overly emotional letter (Feb 2013) telling her how great she was and how I would wait for her (mistake). She soon got weird after that and became very distant. She wouldn't answer my calls (never more than 1 call within 2 days). She ignored my texts. We finally got to talking and se said that she just doesn't feel the same way she did when she talks to me now. 

Fair enough. I accepted it. I gave her plenty of space and prepared to move on. Well... I came home for spring break (last week), and I texted her... She called me about an hour later to see how I was doing. I was short and mentioned that I was well. She told me she was at her best friends for a get together. About 1 that night she ""accidentally"" called and hung up. I returned the call, and she apologized for accidentally calling. She told me that she missed me and was glad I was home. I said I missed her too and I let her go. About an hour later her friend ""accidentally"" calls me from her phone. She just said sorry. About an hour later she calls me and said she may have drank a little too much, but she didn't want to stay there. She asked if I could get her. Then she immediately changed her mind and said that she didn't trust herself with me. I said that I was already in the car. Anyway...

I get there and she got in my car. She seemed happy to see me. When we go to her neighborhood, I asked her if I should drop her off right away, or park around the corner (implying that we would sit and talk). She elected to park around the corner. She then asked me if she could give me a hug, and she gave me the sweetest 10 second hug ever. We got flirty, we kissed. She seemed a bit apprehensive, but she still kept leaning in. We talked until sunrise and I dropped her off and kissed her goodnight.  

Her family (and my own) being in town kept us from seeing each other the rest of the week. We still texted back and forth and talked on the phone, which was reassuring. But then Sunday came and I had to leave back to school... I texted her and no response... I have no idea what she's thinking. She is a good girl, and I know she is old fashioned and decent. I have no reason to think that there is someone else. She's mentioned that she has a commitment issue. She isn't even comfortable with us kissing or messing around because we're not committed. She's mentioned before that she doesn't want to be a distraction to me and my studies. The night I picked her up she was counting how many minutes I spent with her and made a comment about how I'm not always around. 

This summer, I have a job back home as an intern. She's getting her teaching certificate, so we will both be home. I have no idea what to do. She hates being backed into a corner and has a really tough time making hard decisions. She also hates confrontation. She is a complicated girl, but I really care about her. Sorry about the long post. Please advise..."

CompSci major.",[deleted],SyracuseU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyracuseU/comments/1ak5qx/advice_not_sure_what_to_do_big_move_compsci_major/,"Hi everyone, just wanted to thank you ahead of time for any advice. I have been accepted into the LCS CompSci program for Fall as a transfer student. I currently live in Texas and this will be a big move for me to a place where I have no family for at least close to 2000 miles, so I'm trying to be very careful in planning! I really like Syracuse and I miss cold weather (I'm English, and have lived in Texas for 9 years) so that isn't an issue for me. I'm fairly certain I can get in a CompSci-related paid internship with my current employer in the vicinity, but it will be a big pay cut for me (it pays roughly $900 a month working about 15 hours a week during the school semester, then full time outside of that). It has no benefits, and I currently have a $400 a month car payment so my bills are high at the moment. I think I could work out a refinance or figure that out. I have my financial aid letter from SU and it covers a nice chunk of tuition, but I think I can get it re-evaluated if I take a very large pay cut to an internship. I also have a small dog, non-aggressive breed and won't get bigger than 30lb.

I am currently financially flexible but I definitely won't be going forward if I make the leap. So I guess my main question is, do I make the leap? There are alternative schools here where I currently live in Texas, but I think I have my heart set on SU and the Upstate NY area after trips there. Thank you so much.

1ap2de,6,2013-03-20,"I (23m) am completely depressed with my gf (25f) of 4 years. Please help, I can't handle this anymore. ",-Illumination-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ap2de/i_23m_am_completely_depressed_with_my_gf_25f_of_4/,"Hello reddit.

So my girlfriend and I met online in 2009. Live in the same city, actually met through a friend who was into BDSM (we were both active in the community at the time), hit it off. Totally connect, amazing sex, similar future paths. We were in college at the time. She's pretty, hilarious, has introduced me to some amazing stuff and on the whole is just totally mentally stimulating. I truly love her as a human being.

She's in her final year, I am done and have a solid intro job (save about 1000 a month). 

My girlfriend suffers from depression and when her mom moved away across the country and gave her 2 weeks notice to leave, she started to withdraw in the winter of 2011. We got a place and she seemed to warn up and her depression faded in February. Her stepfather admitted to her in April that he was a serious alcoholic and I think this sent her into a harder depression, but by May things seemed to seriously be ok. I helped her in every way I could. Even took 2 weeks vacation off of work just to help her through it. 

My mother died of pancreatic cancer in June and I basically had a mental breakdown for almost 3 months. I was incredibly close with my mom and for like 10 weeks I could barely eat, I cried every day, etc. She was only 38 years old and it really just broke my heart. 

Instead of supporting me my girlfriend got so upset that she was like going into the bathroom and throwing up. She hated being around me. Her support waned after about 5 days.  Ever since then she has been incredibly passive aggressive.

The slightest thing that never bothered her before, like me forgetting to fill the car with gasoline or do the dishes, causes her to totally shut down and go ""I think you should leave for a little while."" When I prod further she just starts crying and goes ""Get the fuck out of the room, please."" At this point she is inconsolable. Sometimes for minutes, sometimes for days.

At this point I honestly think she is just totally broken as a human being and I don't know why. We've only had sex 5 times since June and last time was early December and ended with her crying mid-intercourse. The last time we had pleasurable sex was October, when I took her on a trip to PA.

I feel like everything about our relationship is just gone. I'm out of college now so I don't really have my college friendbase to associate with even though we play online games and such a few days a week and I have about 4-5 friends locally that I enjoying being with. 

My girlfriend at this point has lost connection with all of her friends. She doesn't hang out with anyone, including her family whom she was previously very close with.

I am honestly afraid to come home some days because I feel like I might make some mistake like forget to feed the dog or do the dishes and she'll just guilt me or threaten to leave the house if I don't go out for a few hours.

There are periods of lucidity where she with collapse and tell me how horrible she's been. We'll make up. But in a few weeks it always ends up the same as it is now.

I think we're done. It's kind of hard to accept but I reached out to my best friend and he's willing to move out her for an internship for 2 years and live with me in September. I've considered it seriously.

I really love this woman. And I wish I could salvage it but she seems so emotionally broken and I just have no idea what caused it. I don't know if that's what is causing her pain or if she feels like I'm not reliable because of my mother's deaths affect on me 

What used to be texts of ""I love you~ Want to go out tonight?"" and ""Hey so I got this crazy thing from the adult store. Come into the bathroom when you get home."" has become ""My head hurts. Kind of feel dead."" and ""I honestly can't stand working anymore."" I am honestly concerned about her. She has not exhibited any self-harm at all. 


I have tried **repeatedly** to get her into therapy for almost a year and a half now. It is not working, she refuses to go. There is always an excuse.

I am at my wits end. Please, any advice or experience is welcome and very, very accepted.

Tl;dr

-Mom died, broke down
-Girlfriend basically treated me like shit over it
-Girlfriend has had some horrible experiences, is pretty much broken spirited, won't seek therapy
-Am honestly concerned about her well being
-Don't know what to do. It just feels so over."
1aosal,15,2013-03-20,Am I (f25)dating a mommy's boy (m22)? ,gotaqstn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aosal/am_i_f25dating_a_mommys_boy_m22/,"This is something I have been struggling with for some time now, and even after reading different articles about I am still not sure what to think.
General facts about us: we have been dating more than a year now. Knew each other for half a year before that. We see each other  2-3 night a week and either Sat or Sunday.

His family lives with him, and he currently goes to school so he can transfer. Before that he held a full time job which supported his family (his mom, his 3 siblings and him). He got laid off about 1.5 months ago, so now he is looking for internship and/or a job. His mom just started working after 2.5 years of not doing anything. His siblings just go to school.

My bf is the middle child and has an older brother.

I work full time, live with my parents so I can pay off students loans faster, which (yay!) will happen really soon.
My parents like my bf and have no problem with him coming over, especially since he helped us a lot by helping me to take care of my sick grandma.

Story: My bf generally is a nice guy, cares for his family and me. He has his issues and struggles with different emotional traumas which are caused by his parents not getting along (they are currently separated) and fighting all the time when he was a kid and then a teen. He generally avoids confrontations with his family or me, and he doesn't like fighting at all (it reminds him of his parents fighting), however he has a bit of a temper.

My issue with all of this that sometimes he refuses to do different relationship activities with me or lies to his mom about it because she doesn't like it or starts to asks him questions which he doesn't want to answer or deal with.

One of those issues is that she doesn't like when he comes over to my house. He says that she doesn't like it when he spends time at other people's places in general but for as long as I've known him he never did it. Another issue is that he doesn't tell her he's going away with me up until the day before we leave. Or he lies to her about it.

Another is that she guilttrips him when he chooses to actually do something very couply with me. Or that he rarely buys me those little things that generally girls love (like flowers or something small and cute, because it just doesn't occur to him) but when we go out and I decide to actually buy myself those little cute things (like $5-$10) he usually exclaims ""Oh my mom would love it! I should buy it for her!"". Happens every single time. Even when I just point out something because I like it. Not a big issue but it just falls into general pattern of their relationship.

One of those issues came up yesterday. We were going away for 2 nights, so I told my bf to tell his mom about it maybe 2 weeks before we actually went. He waited till 2 days before to tell her, and I actually had to remind him about it again. Okay. We come back and I ask him to stay over since I don't work today and he doesn't have school, but does have an interview at 3.30pm. He says he can't since his mom is home. I just raise my eyebrows and ask him ""so?"". He says he can't come over because his mom expects him to be home. Which again makes me to raise my eyebrows to which he says that I don't understand. I end up saying whatever mostly for the sake of the interview which he didn't think about until I brought it up myself.

At the same time it is really bugging me. It happened a few times before, when he refused to stay over simply because she doesn't like when he does it. 

His sister in comparison is 18. 2.5 months ago she got a bf, who comes over and stays at their place. They recently went away with her bf's family and his mom didn't say anything. When me and my bf hit about 5 month mark we went away for 3 days, which my bf lied to his mom about because she would be upset that he went away with me, and when we came back he bought her flowers to apologize about it. At 9 month mark we went away for 4 days, to which he lied about to his mom too. He said to her that he's going camping with my parents and me, while it was just me and him going somewhere else completely.

Sometimes he lies to her about when he's spending time with me when to her he says that he's with his friends. Again his 18 year old sister spends all of her free time with her bf, which is every day. Her mom only said something to her when she started skipping classes. His sister would be out up until very late, whether up until recently my bf always got calls about where he is and when he's going to be home while he's out with me.

When I try to bring this up he just says that I don't understand, and when I ask to explain he just gets quiet. It's been bugging me for a long time now but I don't know what to do.

Is it him just being a mommy's boy? Him not wanting to hurt her cause his dad hurt her? Him not wanting to be a bad son?  Or is it really me not understanding their dynamic?

TLdr: Boyfriend lies to his mom about the amount of time he spends with me cause she doesn't like. Brings her up when I talk about something that I like in the way that she might like the same thing. Or he doesn't do coupley things with me because of her. It makes me sad and uncomfortable. Not sure why he does it.

Edit: something I remembered that put a damper on our relationship at the very beginning.
At about 3 months I was invited to his family friend gathering. There were a lot of family and friends there, it was in a park and it was a pretty good day. I have met his mom and siblings and it went pretty good. Next day I obviously asked if his family liked me. He happily tells me that they loved me. Few days later I see him, and he is in a very bad mood. Very upset and almost looks like he's about to cry. After some prodding I learn that his mom doesn't think he should be with me, and that she thinks he should break up with me. That it's nothing personal and that his mom likes me, but she doesn't want him to be with me. It went on for a few months after and we did break up for 3 days because of it."

1anxj4,44,2013-03-20,The most insane LD I have had to date. Please read and discuss with me. (I can't go back to sleep now) Warning: VERY LONG ,Dont_drop_the_SOPA,LucidDreaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1anxj4/the_most_insane_ld_i_have_had_to_date_please_read/,"Alright I'm typing this on my iPhone in bed. I just woke myself up about 20 minutes ago and called my closest buddy and told him my dream so I don't forget it. 



A little background: I've been able to lucid dream since I was about 10 years old (I am 22 now) and this dream I had tonight really scared me for some reason. I am going to go through the story best I can and I would appreciate some sort of feedback of discussion. My heart is still pounding. 



So it starts out at some house, a large house, which somehow in my dream I perceive as my house. This house was hosting a birthday party for my brother (who is 30) and was packed full of people. Everyone was sitting, enjoying themselves, and there was a ton of people there. I remember my mother was there, my father, a bunch of family friends, random people, etc.; the house was packed. So I walk over to this couch as the party has started but is a little quiet and I was tired so I go to sleep on the couch to take a nap. I wake up a couple hours later (in dream time) to a raging party! Everyone was still there but it was out of control. People were drinking like crazy. My overly conservative mother was standing on a chair yelling things out. She looked like she had tanned WAY too much and had leatherskin I remember telling her to stop going out into the sun. There was an old friend of mine from high school with his family and his girlfriend. He was making out with her. He is currently in the navy I haven't seen him or talked with him in years. I remember going into a room where people were partying even harder. There was an elderly lady snorting cocaine off of the table and everyone was asking where I was and I kept repeating that I took a nap and I would keep sarcastically telling everyone, ""thanks for waking me up jerks!"" or something like that. Then all the sudden I end up in a hallway to what I presume to be my ""brothers room"" with a bodyguard and I think they were playing poker inside. I yell to let me in and my brother just says ""who the fuck said that I'm gonna kick your ass!"" Then he realized it was me so he didn't mean what he said and I asked him why he didn't wake me up for the party. 


Somehow I end up stumbling outside of this house. It's sort of a jungle like environment with a futuristic house in the middle. Outside my dad is keeled over I could tell he drank a little. I instantly start crying in my dream and saying ""I just want you to get better dad."" (In real life he has had some heart/health conditions which I always think of and how we want him to make healthy choices) Anyways, he began telling me he is doing fine and follows me around to the front of the house. He was explaining to me that he is doing great because he got $7,100 back on his tax return. He was saying it was originally supposed to be $6,100 but somehow the tax people had a commercial saying they get you $1000 more on a tax return so he got extra money. He was very excited about this. Next thing you know, I'm outside of this house and everyone is outside and there's these two catering chefs behind a counter wearing all white. It's almost like we are all out on some concrete runway at this point. Everyone is getting breakfast SANDWICHES made for them. I notice how rude everyone is being to the cooks so I don't order and I wait until they are not busy. Eventually I ask the catering chef for a sandwich, and he makes me a lunch sandwich (I LOVE BREAKFAST SANDWICHES) because they ran out of eggs or something or it was later in the day at this point. He makes me a sandwich and I peek around the corner of the table and all the sudden it turns into a cockpit of some sort of futuristic jet or plane. 


The other catering chef is there too and one of my friends ( I think his name was Thomas from real life). The other chef keeps going on about how much tips they made in such a short amount of time. And keeps telling the chef that was helping me how good it is that he is an intern making $60 some odd dollars a hour while working or something. Then all the sudden our group of 4 decides that we want to leave the party so we strap in. I guess the main catering chef was also a pilot so he started to fly the plane away. This takeoff was weird it had a long takeoff with a ramp at the end with a lip to launch us up. So we takeoff and I'm a little scared at this point and the pilot is laughing as we take off about ""WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT"" and then he says ""Just kidding"" as he turns the plane around to avoid crashing (it just bumped the mountain instead) and we think we are safe. Then he hits some sort of bar or debris in the sky that starts to crash out plane. I remember the other three people holding onto the planes part to remain safe and I flew WAY OUTSIDE UP IN THE SKY. I would keep coming down and bouncing off the plane. (This is when I realize I am dreaming and begin to fully lucid dream) So I eventually grab hold of some part of the plane and I'm with my ""friend"" who was originally Thomas except at this point I don't see his face so I just perceive him as a new friend or something. 



ALRIGHT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WEIRD. 
So me and this new friend somehow crash land at night at the end of my street. I know 100% I am lucid dreaming and I know this is my street. EVERY HOUSE, EVERY CAR, EVERY STEP WAS THE SAME. (I've lived here my whole life.) I look up into the sky and point out that there are multiple moons, they are different shapes and colors. I somehow realize that I'm on some sort of different dimension planet or alternate dimension of where I live. So we decide to go down the street to my house. The garage is open. I look back before going in. I remember seeing a projector on a garage across the street of an image of Doug Funny from nickelodeon. (Haven't seen that show since I was a kid) Random. So we are about to sneak into my house through the garage door. The garage is dark, the door is cracked open I can see inside. Once my friend enters then me, we quickly sneak our way through the living ro and kitchen, past the hall and into my room. My ""new friend"" was somewhat faster and sneaker than me so he beat me to it. So as I get to my room, it gets darker, I can see a light at my bedstand however. I notice my ""new friend"" has already crawled into my bed. (keep in mind I already started getting an eerie feeling and was feeling scared when I walked in my house, my room especially.) I pull this new friend out of my bed. And I notice someone sleeping behind him. I recognize HER as my ex girlfriend from over a year ago. She had a little distorted face, but it's because I recently saw a picture of her that made her face look weird I think. Now as I realize it's her? I forget about my ""new friend"". Now I'm scared. I notice there's a ladder behind my headboard of my bed. And it's very very dark at the top. But I see feet on the ladder leading to darkness as if someone was watching over my bed as my ex girlfriend was sleeping there. IT FREAKED ME OUT WTFFFF. I proceeded to grab my ex gf QUICKLY out of disbelief and horror out of my bed. I literally dragged her out on the floor and then into the hall. She started waking up. At this point I was so scared I let go and just ran outside of the door. I ran into the street. At this point I'm so scared I decide to wake myself up. So I just open my eyes. 


My heart was pounding, I still can't sleep. It's scary. And now I would like to hear what you think?


I wish I could see it all again, but not be so scared. 


TL;DR -- This is a crazy random exciting scary lucid dream. You should read it. If you don't have time, sorry, I can't TL;DR this. 



Please please talk to me! What do you think?!
Also, I want to see this dream in movie form. Isn't there some guy on YouTube who animates people dreams? Link if possible. 
Thanks!"
1anqjj,2,2013-03-20,I'm starting to feel a little burned out; hoping to push through this semester. ,NeedSomeAdvice23,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1anqjj/im_starting_to_feel_a_little_burned_out_hoping_to/,"This semester I packed my schedule, and at first I was handling it pretty well, but now I seem to be slowing down. I'm just looking toward the finish line when I can start all over. 

This semester I loaded my schedule up with 2 internships (4 days a week/24 hrs) a full course load of classes and extracurricular activities. It's starting to hit prime time to reapply for new internships, and I'm so tired of it. Applying to internships takes so much effort, and unlike a job, I have to do it every semester. 

I always look back on last semester when I had time to go to the gym and work out. It's so difficult to fit in gym time now. Waking up at 6 am to work out before my internships was helping , but this week I've just been skipping out on it and sleeping extra, and coping with it by trying to eat less. I used to constantly body-check for muscle/fat/bones, and while I still do, I think about it a lot less. My mindset now is just, ""wait until the semester is over and then worry about getting back into top shape."" 

It's tiring to get up at 6/8 am, leave the house, get back around 9 p.m. and worry about sleeping in two hours when I still have to eat, shower, study and fit in some leisure time. 

I'm also worried my friends and I will fall apart. I'm usually too busy until the weekend to hang out, and I feel like they think I'm neglecting them. "
1anky1,43,2013-03-20,I never understood text posts until now.,Vivian1993,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1anky1/i_never_understood_text_posts_until_now/,"I have been at this for a semester and a half, and my lifestyle changes haven't been so difficult. I didn't even really change my diet. I went from 2 sodas per day, to none (when I was younger my parents let me drink two a day and when I was older that habit stuck with me), I started eating less, and someone deserves a Nobel prize for inventing the elliptical- its a lovely device where even a 250lb kid with a muscular disorder can ""run"" for hours (its how I started is what I'm saying). 

Anyway... here is where I would post pictures if I had them (the reason that I am not is because I do not have access to a decent camera). 

I always felt the posting of pictures was paramount. They inspire others, and they must feel really satisfying. Hell, a few months ago I wouldn't go out without a coat, a sweatshirt, or at least a vest to try to conceal a few pounds. Now I go out proudly on most days. But what inspires me to write this is that 30 by my name. I am not breaking any speed records for weight loss over time (guesstimating that at this rate I'll be just shy of 90lbs lost in a year) but looking at that scale and seeing the change is something you really just wanna share with EVERYBODY.


Anyway, here it is: Male, just turned 20, started 250lbs, now 220lbs and falling.

**Edit** By popular demand I'll tell more of a story, also because I love to talk. I grew up with sick parents. Mom has 3 rare disorders and I happened to catch the unlucky gene which causes my muscles to prefer to eat themselves than heal normally. I lucked out in a way though, my weight issues from the American side of my family, my dad's side, may well prevent me from dying of a heart failure in my mid to late thirties. My dad himself is a 3 time cancer survivor, and a decorated former state trooper. Needless to say, I can tell you all about the wonderful hospital facilities up and down the east coast of the United States from Duke University to Johns Hopkins and Kennedy Kruger. I can also tell you what its like taking care of your little brother and the most important of life lessons: ""Don't panic"". With my mom's frequent, lengthy hospital trips her death went from something I feared to something I expected, each time they'd call for an ambulance, I would respond similarly, fear- but I also had a job to do, which started with not being helpless. Of course, this mentality and a dark sense of humor that comes with it does not garnish you with many friends on the playground. Socially I was a fish out of water, and I was living off of TV dinners and pizza. Fortunately no one in my family died and slowly things have actually gotten better. 

Fast forward a bit and I am 16 or 17 in firefighter 1 training. I can't exactly explain why, but I had been a volunteer for years and finally I was old enough to carry a hose and 60+ pounds of gear while working a part time job at Micky Dees (not where you typically go to lose weight, mind you) at this time I'm 210lbs, maybe 220 and growing. I'm in a car accident, the girl I had lost my virginity to about 2 years prior was killed on impact. I was pretty seriously wounded. Badly enough that just out of the Firefighter classroom and into live burns I could not complete training. I enrolled in EMT because of the ability to ""transform from such a total idiot into a hero in the presence of immediate danger"" as my dad worded it once, and a lack of empathy that is kind of vital to the job (or as I called it, ""my own little protective bubble of PTSD""). Unlike my dad who is and was a great man, a hero to say the least who describes himself as the kind of guy who is likely to cry in the ditch with the survivors, I am cold and calculating- I can keep my emotions out of the way and treat horrible injuries and think nothing of it until I have safely delivered the patient to the emergency department, and step outside where the first breeze to hit my face gently carries away all the stress. Go back to base, write my report, turn in my report, rinse, repeat. If I had to say why I went for EMT I could say that its because of seeing too many of my friends (by this point of my life (2 with a 3rd dying) Tango Uniform. Realistically its because the worst feeling in the whole world is feeling completely helpless and useless. With medical training and my years of experience, I have generally kicked that feeling even though 90% of your calls are BS, those 10% where I truly make a difference- or at least bear witness are somewhat empowering. 

When I was 18, I carried that attitude into college where it was largely beaten out of me by the redundancies and the fact that college no matter how you slice it is a business just like everything else and I fell into most of the pitfalls, drinking somewhat, a sociology and criminal justice major, and the fact that everyone has the same political and social beliefs and insists on repeating new stories from the Colbert Report. It ate away at me and quickly I became bitter and self-righteous (like a standard college student), and I hated-loved it and continue to love-hate it. The unemployment especially takes its toll, while I spend 6 months out of year on campus, and 6 months ""back home"" (roughly), no one wants to pay me if I spend half a year homeless as far as they are concerned. I continued my volunteer efforts, an EMT back home, a senior member of the Civil Air Patrol, and an unpaid internship (the Diane Champe Institute). Life on a budget of about nothing and being WAY too proud to ask my parents to send me money. 

So here I am, a second year, overweight, a minor success with the ladies, a proud smoker, and a volunteer, spreading myself way to thin on a never ending quest to put my name everywhere that I can throw it. HATING how I look as an overweight guy. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/Zh80Itc.jpg) dated about a year ago exploring the ruins of the Tome School for Boys (1890-1942) in Port Deposit (later converted, with 70 surrounding farms, to the USNTC Bainbridge 1942-1976). Something had to change. I began working out, started calorie counting with MFP (hardly changing my diet) went from eating ~2000-2500cal/day to about ~1000-1500 virtually overnight and as long as I was plugging it in and SEEING that I was eating enough, I didn't feel that hungry. There was some pain and suffering, but nothing major. Meals became less about eating, and more about sitting back and chatting with the few friends I have made. I also began hitting the gym, running mostly, because I had never used weights that werent machines and its really hard to screw up running (eliptical and treadmill). You can adjust your form to run faster/longer/etc... but if you run or even briskly walk long enough, you will lose weight. Then I find r/losit and r/fitness and I learn that its easier to lose weight by lifting weights and gaining muscle (complicated by a muscular disorder, but not impossible) because muscle eats up your fat storage to maintain, a win-win. So I track down every lead I might have on friends who can show me what to do in the school's fitness center so I don't look like such an idiot lifting heavy things and putting them down. Dead lifts and leg presses are my favorite, but I am picking up on all of it. and Here I am, 30lbs down, and a lot more to go. Working out about 4 times a week, and running almost every day. Any tips are welcome. Thank you for reading. OH! Also I switched from smoking to vaping with the help of r/electronic_cigarette. Vaping is wonderful and you should all do it. That is all"

Answering that kind of question is easy though, just point the person towards a couple popular beginner's books and they'll be on their way. That was me about 8 months ago, and now that I'm through those popular beginner's books I don't know how to continue my education. My learning resources thus far:

I feel like I have an overall good grasp of the language and a fair understanding of what's available to me in most of the Java SDK (I'm mostly familiar with lang, util, I/O, swing, awt, and math packages but not with specialized packages like nio, rmi, xml, sql, and etc). So where do I go from here? I'm a freshman CS major and I wanna get an internship this summer but I feel so inadequate whenever I look at any job or internship ads because they all expect you to know so much more than just the language and core standard library. The past 3 days I've been researching and reading nonstop trying just to wrap my head around all of the following:



**Build Tools?** Ant? Maven? Gradle?

**Databases?** SQL? PostgreSQL? ORM? Hibernate? JPA? MongoDB?

**Web development?** Spring? Struts? GWT? DOM? jQuery? AJAX? XML? JSON? SOAP? REST?

**Java EE?** Servlets? JavaBeans? JBoss? Tomcat? Jetty? GlassFish? JSP? JSF?

**And there's more?** Commons? Guava? CDI? Guice? Hadoop?


When will the madness end? I feel so overwhelmed, and I don't know where to start or how to tackle any particular framework or technology. I want to be a skilled and marketable java developer, but how do I get there? Which frameworks/technologies should I focus on? What books do I read? What tutorials do I follow? What kind of projects can I do to apply my learned knowledge and show off on my portfolio to potential employers?"
1amsil,37,2013-03-19,"I [F/26] just freaked out at my boyfriend [M/24] about a girl he met abroad, never had jealousy issues before, I'm lost.",fezfjepjfezpfgeg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1amsil/i_f26_just_freaked_out_at_my_boyfriend_m24_about/,"**Bit of background:** 
We've been together for nearly a year now, during this year we've both lost our respective places and we are currently living with friends.
We were both working on and off but never enough to get a flat, in November he found an internship with a school, he started helping them with an event abroad and organized the whole shebang.

I had suspicions about that place from day one, and I was right to, once he was hired full time they started the dance of not giving him his contract, complete with the non-payment of wages.
They didn't pay anyone in fact, and by being pushy he managed to get some advances to get to work and get food and such.

He decided to stay with them until he finished the event, cause he wanted to see it through, and I was okay with it.

During his journey, he asked me to take a picture of me kissing a dude off of my Facebook, as a favour, because he found it whilst casually stalking me and thought it was my (abusive) ex, which made him sad.
In exchange, he'd change his status to 'in a relationship'.
I have never been too fussed about it, but I accepted the deal. Upon checking his page I discovered that he'd friended mainly girls whilst away.
One of which commented to his relationship status with a strange message going ""Oh wow, well you need to treat me"".
I thought that was a bit off, and brushed it off as random jealousy.

He came back, happy to see me of course but things were strange, I couldn't quite pin it, he was sad, and we talked about him moving back to his country and I was trying to cope with it.
He then suddenly felt better, as he usually does and we resumed normal activities.

However, he's going to work with the girl who left the weird comment, about a project I'm not understanding fully because he keeps being evasive about the exact terms of it.
He finally explained everything, he was only talking to her because of work and nothing else and I'm obviously such a silly girl.
He had to apologize to her this week as he was not being able to work with her after all because he found another placement.

**What happened tonight:** he was talking to her and a friend of his on Facebook on my laptop, and he left to go have a cigarette, and I did the psycho thing, I went to read their conversation.

He was comforting her because her dad is in a bad way, apparently he met him (I didn't know that) and her dad asked how he was doing, if he's married and if they're ""more than just friends ;)"".
He only answered ""tell your Dad I'm not getting married yet"".
In their entire history I found her to be overly nice and it made me feel sick. 
She even said that she was so glad he came into her life and she was glad to have a friend like him. They spent three weeks together like.
I wasn't mentioned at all, ever. He didn't mention me to her, even when he was talking about life at home or even his plans tomorrow.

I confronted him about it, he laughed me off because it's funny that I'm jealous and it doesn't matter because she lives on another continent.
He also said that I'm nuts, which is fair enough, I have acted nothing but insane about it, but I have this gut feeling that something is wrong.

It's just, all my exes have lied to me and quite a few cheated.
I'm usually quite a decent judge of character, except when it comes to pick my partners, but my intense fear of being abandoned and lied to means that I'm currently unable to see if I'm judging her too harshly because she's just nice or if she's actually trying to do something.
I can't shake off the fact that all he said was that she's too far. Not that it's ridiculous, but ""she's too far"".

**I should add**, that I have never been the jealous type, I have über close male friends and I understand that other people have super close friends too.
This is quite new to me and I don't know what to do.

My most recent ex started seeing someone I knew when we were still living together (but separated) and they both lied to my face for weeks, but I knew, I knew from the second they met that it was going to happen. 
This is feeling exactly like it.

I know I fucked up and I'm glad he's not mad at me for reading his emails but I don't know what to do.
I'm leaving tomorrow for a week and we haven't talked or touched each other since, he's asleep next to me and I'm awake, crying and dealing with travel anxieties.


**TL;DR: I went through my boyfriend's emails and I found no comfort in it, unfortunately, being hysterical means that I can't see where my crazy starts and where the dodgy ends.**


**EDIT: Thank you all for your messages and for the help, I'm going to talk to him online tonight as I won't get a chance this morning. No ultimatums, no paranoia (hopefully), gonna aim for conveying of feelings and trust issues.**

1amqo3,29,2013-03-19,Brother arrested with drugs. Not sure how to feel.,throwawayawkfks,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1amqo3/brother_arrested_with_drugs_not_sure_how_to_feel/,"I'm in college, and my little brother back home is 16. For almost four years now, he's been struggling with addiction. Up until yesterday, we only thought it was marijuana and alcohol, which changed to cigarettes recently. Nope, it's been cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, k-pins, every drug you can think of. He's dealt pot to pay for his hobbies, and got his start-up money by stealing jewelry, electronics, and cash from our home. He's forged a check for $250, and recently when my mom asked him how much it would take to pay off his dealers so they wouldn't threaten him with guns and follow him home anymore, he said $900. She paid it.

My mom found out and has been actively doing something about it for two years now. He was in therapy before that, because my parents were divorced, and has continued in therapy and specifically addiction therapy with extreme reluctance for the entire duration of these events. His money has been restricted, Mom prevented him from getting a license for over a year, he was watched until he could be trusted and then broke the trust again and again.

He was a very sensitive, loving kid, who never hurt animals and wanted nothing more than hugs, up until age 12, when he met a friend who was dealing drugs at that age. We all went through a difficult time at that time, because my parents divorced and we moved to a new state. But he has continued to make poor choices, again and again, so it's not just that.

Our parents are a doctor and a lawyer. We live in an upper-middle class setting, with good education and small luxuries.

I'm at a top university, on merit scholarships, doing internships at other top universities that have offered me entry to grad programs. I've never been drunk or smoked a cigarette, let alone seen illegal drugs. During the divorce, I remember one night when my dad passed out from drinking and I had to make dinner and put my two siblings to bed. I realized that our family had an addiction problem and stayed away from that shit at all costs. My brother knew it too. I am extremely confused at how we have come to such different places in our lives so far.

My little sister is stuck at home with my emotionally drained mother and my brother. I hate to leave her there, but through my own years of therapy, I've realized I can't make their problems mine, and I'm enjoying my life on my own. I only feel this kind of helplessness, anxiety, etc, when I get a call from home because something big has happened. Also, guilt.

This time, the call was because he was arrested last night. Thankfully, it was his friend's pot and paraphanalia, and the bugged cop car caught him asking my brother to take the fall for him since he had priors. So, it looks like he won't get charged with intent to distribute, just possession. Nonetheless, he is in the system. They have his name and his prints and his license. They're after distributors, after all, and not so long ago he was one.

I'm confused. I'm a psych major, and I've studied human development from a comparative perspective. I understand that people sometimes rely on maladaptive coping strategies when they have too few supports compared to their challenges. But how is it that I developed resilience, and he has not? Why has therapy been beneficial to me but not him? Why do the antidepressants work for me and not him? Why does he hate me? Why won't he let anyone help him? Why does he push away anyone who wants to support him? How did he become this person I don't know so quickly and so completely?

His ferret died recently from neglect. I'm still mourning that, because I took care of it too, and don't know what to think about that situation either.

I'm confused. I don't know if anyone can shed any light on what he's going through, or some observations about what I am. I just needed to vent."

My girlfriend (f22) and I (f20) met about two and a half years ago out of the blue at a small social gathering. Instant and explosive connection. After less than eight months, I dropped out of university because my mom got sick. We decided to stay together because of how in love we were. Everything was fine for a while. We talked a lot and skyped a lot and I got my license so I could go see her. (my old college town is 3 hours from where I live with my parents)

I decided to go for an associates degree at my local community college while she remained. Then a lot of shit started happening. There was a flood and her father's business was destroyed. They were denied aid by FEMA and have still not opened the business again. My SO's sister's violent marriage broke up and the ex husband burned down their other business. The fire and the flood happened less than four months apart.

Meanwhile I'm working full time and school full time while trying to complete a required student internship. My sister steals $1000s of dollars in jewelry and cash from me and my family and finally gets checked into rehab. 

Right now it's been a few months since that happened but we have never been the same. We are trying to balance her working seven days a week and me working or at school seven days a week. We barely talk  and I have a tendency to brood (really insense introvert). I have a really negative outlook because her parents won't accept us and I'm afraid more things will happen that will prevent her from moving in with me this summer. 

This isn't even the whole story, just a summed up version, but I really need some support today because everything feels so fucked up in our lives and our relationship has really serious context for how young we are and it is so incredibly stressful. No one understands."

I was really happy she was able to go and follow her dreams and have such a wonderful experience. But she has changed quite a bit since she's been back, almost a lack of interest when compared to how we were before she left. At first I figured it was just her adjusting back to the US and healing from the new friendships that had been lost, but weeks later there still seems to be a wall that wasn't there before both sexually and emotionally. I started feeling really shitty and kept wondering what it was, I tried to talk to her about it but the answers were all the same. So (I really don't like admitting that I did this) I checked on her facebook and saw a message string from on of the guys she had met in Rwanda, he was an intern that worked and went out to party with their group. There was no indication that they hooked up but it was apparent she had fallen for him, she said multiple times how much she loved him and wanted to be back in Africa with him ( oh and she is planning a trip there after graduation next year, and want to work there for a little at least after college). The last two messages she sent him were about how she found out that he had done it with previous girls that went on the trip and that it broke her heart and she never wanted to talk to him again. I just don't know that I can trust her any more, but the worst part about it is we live in the same house for another 6 months and I need to try to make it work at least until the end. Should I trust her? Should I break up with her after we move out? And should I start searching for someone else right now. I really did have strong feelings for her and it hurt so bad to read what she had said."

I'm 22 years old, work at Ford as an intern and attend Wayne State for a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (ME). I'm a real easy going guy and I have a desire to travel and get away from home. Lately I've been interested in the Air Force. What I would like to do is work in the Air Force and continue my ME degree, I realize I will only be taking classes part time, and working 8 hours M-F. At my current rate in college i'll be finished with all of my classes in roughly 3-4 years (I'm almost done with my Gen Eds, took me 3 years. So I'm just now getting into core engineering classes. My adviser told me I have a lot of credits that should transfer if I go into the Air Force). I go to school full time (sometimes excluding summers), work part time at Ford and I'm also in a fraternity. I realize I would have to leave all of this. I want to make sure I'm making a good decision. Now there is the option of finishing my degree then joining, which is what I hear the most. But I would rather start now, and finish while serving my term, ultimately working for the Air Force.

The job I'd like is the job dealing with aircraft (testing, repairing, analysis) then ultimately being a developmental engineer. I worked at Sears Automotive for a while, so I have some mechanical background and with that, I love hands on. I was looking at 62E? Seems pretty interesting. I just don't know what to do as my job while i'm pursuing my degree or even where to start, and what comes after! I hear to do research before talking to a recruiter, as they ""sugar coat"" information and get you to try to sign and join right away.

So my questions are:

Is this a good path?
Where do I start? 
What steps do I need to take?
What job might suit me best?
How many terms might I have to serve?
Can I still get an engineering job after the Air Force?

Those are my main questions, i'll ask more as the discussion rises. I appreciate your time, opinions and experiences. Thank you!

1aqrwg,2,2013-03-21,Am I being selfish? [21F],friendvsboyfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aqrwg/am_i_being_selfish_21f/,"Okay, so:

I've been dating my boyfriend [21M], ""A"" for 6 months now. I think we're in a great place, we have amazing sex, but neither of us has had a serious relationship before, so sometimes we have problems - but who doesn't?, and we've always been able to work them out with minimal drama.

I've known my ""best friend""/roommate (read: my only female friend) for only a few months longer than my BF. She doesn't like him (as you can tell if you read any of my past posts), although she's grown to accept him as part of my life and will sometimes jokingly tell him, ""You're not so bad"" with a fist-bump. 

Ever since the first month of my relationship, she's been badgering me about spending too much time with him. She's lightened up since she got a boyfriend of her own and started seeing how easy it is to lose track of time with someone you like a lot. But recently, it's flared up again. She will text me at all hours of the night asking when I'm coming home (I usually spend the night at A's apartment), tell me to come home to take my meds (I take an SSRI and I keep some on me for my sleepovers), and, about every other night, tell me that she needs the room for her own sexual purposes. Whatever, I have another place to sleep, she doesn't (her boyfriend has a double room with a hermit-like roommate), so I don't usually mind.

Last night, after sleeping at A's two nights in a row, I decided to spend the night in MY bed. I have to get up at 6am a few days a week to go to an internship in the city, and it's way easier to get ready in my own room. She was initially happy that A and I were in the room for the night, but then decided that she wanted her boyfriend to sleep over - and so she told us to get back to A's apartment and sleep there. I told her my reasoning for wanting to stay, but she continued to push the point. ""But X and I haven't had sex in X days"" ""But you're barely in the room anyways"" ""But I'm very accommodating when A stays over"" (although I have never once asked for solitary use of the room, because I know she has nowhere else to go)

I finally snapped (we were having this conversation in front of mutual friends, which I hate) and told her that I was done talking about it. Before I went to bed, I changed the password on my computer (she spilled tea on hers a few weeks ago and has been commandeering mine ever since), which was probably unwarranted, but it made me feel a little better.

This morning, she texted me about how she is going to change rooms, backing out of our plan to get an apartment (we currently live in the dorms), and nullifying our ""sharing items"" agreement (fine by me, this means I get my ipod and half my wardrobe back). 

I don't really feel that I'm in the wrong here, but selfish people rarely do. We spend a few nights a week together, go shopping, etc, but I've told her time and time again that between my internship and my deepening feelings for A, it's natural that we won't see each other as much. 

Was I wrong for not giving her the room, if this is the end result? She's crazy, but she's my friend, and I don't hold down female friendships well. This also really fucks up housing plans, because I don't have a very friendly household and I was really looking forward to getting a place of my own. A and I have discussed the possibility of moving in together, but it's a distant possibility because we're still so young and the relationship is still relatively new. 

**TD;LR: My roommat/""best friend"" of 8 months tried to sexile me on a night before I had to get up early, I refused, she immediately ends our friendship and future housing plans. Feeling a little lost and confused.**"
1aqpdo,59,2013-03-21,Bill Simmons columns on good/bad contracts are loaded with errors.,[deleted],nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1aqpdo/bill_simmons_columns_on_goodbad_contracts_are/,"First, I am a huge Simmons fan.  I don't know if I'd be as big of an NBA fan without his writing.  But these columns are loaded with errors and someone has to point it out.  Reddit is the only platform I have!


.


Here's a quick definition.  A qualifying offer is a minimum salary that a team must offer (in a 1 year deal) in order to retain the right to match the salary of restricted free agents *after* the contract is up.  It is absolutely not part of the current contract.  A team is not required to make the offer and players are free to negotiate contracts for higher than the qualifying offer.


.


For some reason, in his [good contracts](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9002028/the-best-bargains-nba) and [bad contracts](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9030601/the-worst-contracts-nba) columns, Bill Simmons (or his intern) decided to include the qualifying offers as part of the contract in many cases.  This is a serious error.  It makes good contracts seem better because it makes it look like they have an extra year at below market value.  It makes bad contracts seem worse because it makes it look like there is an extra year and several more million added to the contract when there is not.  I actually wonder if Bill did this intentionally.


.


Here are all the errors from the best contracts column

.


Kyrie Irving (reported as 4 years $28.6 million)  (reality is 3 years $18.1 mil)

Kenneth Faried (reported as 4 years , $8.6 million) (reality is 3 years $4.9 mil)

Avery Bradley (reported as 3 years, $7.7 million) (reality is 2 years $4.1 mil)

Jimmy Butler (reported as 4 years, $7.6 million) (reality is 3 years $4.2 mil)

Larry Sanders (reported as 3 years, $9.3 million) (reality is 2 years $5 mil)

Eric Bledsoe (reported as 3 years, $8 million) (reality is 2 years $4.3 mil)

Festus Ezeli (reported as 3 years, $3.2 million) (reality is 4 years $5.2 mil)

Nikola Vucevic (reported as 4 years, $10.6 million) (reality is 3 years, $6.3 million)

Greivis Vasquez (reported as 3 years, $6.5 million) (reality is 2 years, $3.3 million)

.


The Ezeli one is weird because Bill didn't include the qualifying offer there, but also did not include the last year of his contract.  Bill did correctly report Kyle Singler's (3 years, $3.13 million), Isaiah Thomas' (2 years, $1.65 million) and Chandler Parsons (3 years, $2.78 million) deals and did not erroneously include qualifying offers.  Anyway, that is 3 for 10 on correct reporting of rookie deals in the best bargains column.


.


I also can't understand why some rookie deals were allowed to be counted among the ""best contracts"" but others were not.  But whatever.

.


The only error in the worst contracts column was Jan Vesely (reported as four years, $17.3 million).  But this is an egregious error.  First of all, the qualifying offer is included, which is absolutely not part of the contract.  Second, his final year is a team option.  So even counting this year (almost over) the Wizards are committed to paying him $6.5 million over 2 years.  And Bill ranks this as the #20 worst contract in the entire league?  Worse than the $16.5 million Bynum deal when Bynum will never play for his team on that contract?  How does that make any sense?  I suspect it was done so Bill could make a crack about his draft night kiss, but it's still wrong.

 Should I try to sit down for the first actuarial exam already? What are some of the college classes I should have already taken in order to have an easier time with the first exam? So far, I will have only taken general ed courses (calc I-II, physics I-II, chem I-II, bio, comp sci I), that I wonder how some people I see online already pass their first actuarial exam during their first semester of college. Is it just mostly self study?

I was hoping to take an exam this summer so that the summer after my soph year, I can try for an actuarial internship.

I have some questions about this though.

 Do actuarial internships require at least one exam? What are the credentials I would need to be marketable and get an actuarial job when I graduate? (like how many exams, how many internships) What would be a good timeline during the 4 years of my college to achieve this?

Long-time restaurateur Brock Shepherd is bringing Toronto’s ultra-local brewery trend to Kensington Market—but he needs your help.
BY: CRYSTAL LUXMORE
Starting a brewery isn’t cheap. Usually, would-be brewers rely on friends, family, and a generous bank loan to finance an extremely expensive venture. Brock Shepherd, however, is taking a different approach: He’s counting on ale-loving locals to pitch in.
Like many beginners, 44-year-old Shepherd first crafted his recipes—Augusta Ale and Baldwin FishEYE-PA—at existing breweries. (In his case, Oakville’s Black Oak Brewing and Guelph’s Wellington Brewery.) But the plan was always to open a brick-and-mortar outfit in his own Kensington Market ’hood.
In December, Shepherd took the plunge, bidding adieu to his 15-year-old restaurant, Burger Bar. Two weeks ago he inked a long-term lease on part of a new retail development under construction at 299 Augusta. The plan is to open this fall, with an on-site retail store. David Lee, a 31-year-old Mill Street veteran, will be brewmaster, and says he’s eager to start crafting all-new recipes at a smaller shop.
But even small shops cost big bucks—about 500,000 of them. That’s where Shepherd hopes the community will step in and help. “I heard about a few people doing community-supported breweries in the States, and thought, that’s a really good way of involving people and letting them watch something grow.”
Shepherd’s plan is one-part community-supported agriculture, where customers pay up front for a share of the harvest, and one-part Kickstarter, with top-tier investors getting access to members-only privileges.
Shepherd wants to raise $50,000 to $100,000—at best, just one-fifth of the total cost. But he also hopes the venture will help win the hearts of market locals who might not love the slick new structure going up on the block (which will soon replace the building that housed the bar and performance space Bread and Circus, and more recently, Electric Theatre).
“Kensington is like its own little town, in its quirky way,” says Shepherd. So bringing the neighbours on board makes good business sense here, maybe more than anywhere else in the city. And if the locals show the love for their namesake brewery, then surely the rest of the city will, too.

1aspne,174,2013-03-22,"I've (m24) been with my partner (f23) for 4 years, but now work on the other side of the planet 60% of the time. She understands the reasons (I make very good money), but after 12 months of doing this, she's told me to quit my job.",throwaway75329,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aspne/ive_m24_been_with_my_partner_f23_for_4_years_but/,"Long ass back story (or skip to TL;DR)

So we've been together for about 4 years now. We met at university, we've both had a bunch of short- and long(ish)-term relationships beforehand, and things just went perfectly.


We're both from, and studied in, the UK.


Before I graduated, I was (almost out of the blue, but from a very legitimate source) offered a very well-paying job ($80k) as a software engineer in the US. The deal was for me to spend 2 months in the US, then I would work remotely from the UK, and visit the US for a few weeks at a time, a few times a year. Initially the idea of spending 2 months away from her sounded like hell, but we both saw that with the UK's economy in the state it was (and still is) in, it was a pretty damn good deal.


We were living together in an apartment that (with a little help from my father) we'd bought, and had just moved in when I had to leave for the US.


After the 2 months, and a Christmas break, I was offered a raise (to $100k); in exchange for another 6 weeks in the US, but this time they'd pay for her to come along for the ride too. She was still studying at that point, so came along, but only for 3 weeks.


After that, we lived together very happily for about 4 months. Then one day, I was offered another raise. To $140k. But from then on I'd have to spend at least half my time in the US. It took some time for it to sink in to both of us what was on the cards; trading a very nice cohabiting situation, for a part-time long-distance thing. There's obviously a whole debate on that itself, but in the end, we decided that I should take it.


We came to the agreement that I'd spend 6 weeks in the US, then 3-4 weeks in the UK. And just roll with that. She came over and chilled for 3 months in the summer after she graduated; we travelled the US, went to Canada, and had two very luxurious weeks in Hawaii. 


She'd graduated with a degree in crime / law, and through a contact of my boss's, got [legal gray area] an internship with a private investigator[/legal gray area]. After a month of that, he wanted to employ her full time, and sponsor her for a visa. If you're unfamiliar with the US visa system -- from an outsiders point of view, even those with higher education qualifications (I have a Masters degree, and I barely got in) it's one of the worst systems going. She's basically ineligible, because the US decided that the number of years spent in education outweighs the globally standardized levels of certification. An undergraduate degree in the US is 4 years, but in plenty of other places it's 3. We were told she's not even eligible to apply. Go back to school and get a Masters degree, or 3 years progressive work experience. 


She can stay in the US for as long as I'm there -- we're not married but there is a non-working visa for long-term cohabiting partners of people who have a working visa, and we have enough proof of that (proof of our joint mortgage is enough). But for her, it would likely suck, because she cannot work.


Since then, she's been back in the UK, and I've been travelling to and from my office and her. It's not easy, on either of us. But we've had enough long, hard conversations about it, and decided that we should give it a year, and reassess things. I work for a startup company. There's a fair chance that my job won't even exist in 12 months time. My visa allows me to transfer to another company, but it might be hard to find one that's quite so lenient on me disappearing from the office every 6 weeks. So I'd probably come home.


But if my job does exist in 12 months, then it means were doing well. I'm on track to have a raise and a bonus that would put me at $180-200k for this year; not including the fairly significant number of company stocks I own.


The trouble is; as much as we both see the upside to this, it really isn't easy on our relationship. She recently got a decent job in the UK, with some good prospects for advancing, and pays about $30k. We both work long hours (both our jobs expect at least 50 hours per week, and I've worked both days of the weekend for weeks in a row in the past), and with an 8 hour time difference, communicating isn't easy. We email each other from when I wake up to when she goes to sleep, but a phone call during the week probably only happens 2-3 times, for 30 minutes, when I get chance to take a break from working.


At the weekend, we Skype for about 3 hours each day, unless she's got plans otherwise (it's morning in the US, so I'm always available). When I'm back in the UK, things are usually excellent. At the weekend, we'll drive to another city for a couple of nights, or get a cheap flight to somewhere in Europe that we've never been. But a few weeks in, and I have to leave again.


I've come to the conclusion in my mind, that this is the situation we're in. I think it's far from perfect, but considering not many people are as fortunate as I've been, I think it would be wise to ride it out. Keep collecting the pay checks until I have to come home, or if the company survives the year, stick it out and get a pretty big payout in the end. I try and remove as many negative thoughts about how this is affecting our relationship as possible; not because I don't care (which is what she thinks I do it for), but because thinking like that is going to do nothing but make both of us feel bad.


She's very good at hiding her feelings, and will one day sit down and talk over all this, we'll agree on things, and move on. But then a few weeks later, she'll burst out into tears and anger at how I've escaped across the world. This is usually after she hangs out with her ""friends"" (right now, people she's been working with for about a month, have never met me, and don't really know her) that just make her feel stupid; by making out that she's some sort of idiot for putting up with me. ""My boyfriend would never, *EVER*, do that to me!"".


Last night, was the first time we've had an argument about this situation while I haven't been over in the US. Usually it comes after I've been gone for about 4 weeks, and one of us gets too busy that we don't get chance to speak for a few days. We talk it over, and then we're fine again. She's always said that she doesn't want this to go on for longer than a year, but this was the first time she said ""if you're still over there in 12 months, I'll have to leave you"".


My long-term friends, are all just mostly jealous because they know I make more money than they do (though they actually think it's quite a bit less than it really is), and think my girlfriend is ""so lucky"".


Her long-term friends, are generally very supportive.


Both our families are supportive, but hers have suggested to her in private that I should probably quit my job and come home. Though they don't know all the details, and aren't really aware that I'm not going to be able to get a job of this caliber in the UK.


**TL;DR
I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years, I took a job that requires me to spend 60% of my time on the other side of the world, about 18 months ago. I make a truckload of money, enough to support both of us comfortably, but if she joins me she'll have to quit her job, and won't be able to work.**


Has anyone else that's been in a situation like this got any advice/experience to share?


Was I just a massive cock for taking the job in the first place?


Am I the greedy, immoral slime ball that her co-workers think I am?


Is it unreasonable of me to want to make (a lot) of money while I can?


If you were me, would you have taken the job?


If you were me, would you quit my job?


If you were her, would you move to the US knowing you couldn't work (the deal includes a puppy of your choice, and 5 minutes walking distance to the beach)?


If you were her, would you just leave me now, because it's already been long enough?


What the hell can I say to her that I haven't already?"
1asa5m,2,2013-03-22,the end of an 11 year relationship. starting a new happier life. ,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1asa5m/the_end_of_an_11_year_relationship_starting_a_new/,"just wanted to share this story with you gals incase any of you are in the same situation. its a long story...

we started dating when we were 15. my first 'real' boyfriend. i was his first girlfriend ever. our relationship was pretty solid for 9 years, we had out ups and downs but always worked things out. 2 years ago he moved halfway across the country for an 8 month long internship. he flew back home once a month, it was tough but we did ok for the first 6 months. the last few months he became very distant. we wouldnt talk, he would get mad if i wanted to talk etc. then he dropped the ""i dont think i love you anymore, i think we should take a break"" i was heart broken. i had no idea what to do. i begged him to change his mind, i did whatever i could to convince him he loved me. 

my biggest issue was, i have known NOTHING other than my life with him. he was everything to me. he came back home and i was basically his slave. i did everything he wanted me to, i needed to make sure he stayed with me, i wouldnt know what to do without him. everything i did was to make him happy. i was horribly depressed but i knew if he left i would be worse off than just pretending i was happy. 

eventually i convinced myself everything was fine. i just assumed this would be my life forever so i just went with it. i let him lie to me, i forgave him. he told me i was getting fat, i started dieting and working out, i needed him to love me and be attracted to me, i did whatever it took. 

after a year of completely losing all respect for myself, a friend died and i started talking to one of his friends via facebook messenger. we started out just talking about our friend and his passing, then we started talking about other things, ourselves what we like etc etc. we were texting continuously, it was all completely innocent just friend talk but i really really connected with him. after a few months i realized i had developed a major crush on him and was really torn at what to do. after thinking i decided my current relationship was great throwing away an 11 year relationship for someone would be foolish and way too much work. i was comfortable where i was. so i decided to stay in my relationship. i decided i needed to stop talking to him as much as possible. 

months passed and my relationship was falling apart. i started standing up for myself. if i didnt want to do something and he wanted me to, i didnt do it. i think talking to 'the other guy' about myself and what i liked and how we liked similar things really made me realize how much i was giving up in my current relationship and how truly unhappy i was. my boyfriend would lie to me, he would go out every night come home drunk, puke all night, he was rude, he dropped out of school, he slept all day and barely worked. all he did was go out with friends. he never did chores, i was paying some of his bills. 

it got to the point where i actually told him to ""get your shit together or leave"" and he left, and didnt come back for 3 days. at this point i knew what i wanted in life, i knew what i had given up to try to get him to stay. i wanted him to change. i wanted him to realize what he was doing and i wanted him to be like he was years ago. and i just kept hanging on thinking one day he would change. 

when he returned he told me he didnt want to be in a relationship anymore. for 3 days i cried and felt hopeless. i had no idea what my future would be. i knew nothing about being single. no one would want to date someone who has been in one relationship for 11 years! after my pity party i realized this was the best thing that had ever happened to me. i was finally free to be me and to stop living HIS life. i could finally live my life. 

i knew it was way soon but about 2 weeks after the break up i flat out told 'other guy' that i liked him and wanted to date him. i as sick of hiding my feelings and pretending things. his response was he had a crush on me but knew i was in a relationship at the time and figured hed never have a chance to date me. 

weve been together for almost 4 months now and its everything i could possibly ask for. hes understanding, hes sweet, we enjoy a lot of the same things but also have enough different hobbies and interests that we are each still separate people. we give each other enough space but we always have a wonderful time when we spend it together. there is nothing about him that makes me think twice about being with him. 

this is such a learning experience. i have no idea how relationships generally work, but so far things must be going ok because we are both super happy. 

i am no longer depressed. ive lost about 15lbs just because ive been taking care of myself for once. i like myself again. i am confident and i am happy with my life. 

my new boyfriend is not THE reason i am happy. i was hesitant to jump into a new relationship right away because i wanted to be ok with 'me' before just transferring to someone else. and i wanted him to know that. he sure helps make life amazing, but i am the major reason i am happy. i stood up for myself, i survived a breakup (pretty much a divorce) and came out a stronger, smarter, amazing person. new guy just helps me realize that. 

any girls stuck in a LONG long term relationship and feel trapped because they dont know what to do without their boyfriend or girlfriend in their lives, really think about what you want, what makes you happy and if staying in a relationship just because you are scared to not be in one is taking your dreams and happiness away, you need to get out. its hard, but its very worth it to actually be with someone who treats you right and helps you succeed in life. 

tldr: ended loveless relationship of 11 years, started dating new guy who is awesome. dont stay in a relationship because you are too lazy or scared to be alone or start over.

1ars31,4,2013-03-21,I am so done with you. I am no longer your crutch,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ars31/i_am_so_done_with_you_i_am_no_longer_your_crutch/,"We have been friends since kindergarden. And since then we have always been friends. Not a day since kindergarden has gone by without the both of us going to bed and thinking of each other as friends. That changes tonight. 

This has been building up for such a *fucking* long time. All through out high school you were contemptful towards everyone. I didn't mind, I was the same back then, with all my anxiety and depression weighing on my shoulders. 

I knew you felt bad because of your dad dying and that the girl you loved walked out on you. But you blamed it all on the world, you took no guilt for yourself at all. You could've ripped the cigarettes out of his mouth, you could've asked him to stop drinking. But you were never sincere enough. 

He died eight years ago. I know it must still hurt, and I can't even imagine, but it's how you carry the weight that matters. I tried to carry as much of it as I've could, but I can't do it anymore. I've cried so many tears with you, I've listened to so much, I've said so much.  

You are so rude to your mom, who just tries to get by. The jobs she has taken to provide for you doesn't make you grateful. It just makes you scornful and ashamed. 

Every time you got drunk you threw shit around, broke things, hurt people's feelings. You threw your brand new phone for a thousand dollars into the wall just because a girl wouldn't talk to you. Ever think about why? Maybe because you got so drunk you couldn't even talk, yelled into her ears and acted hostile toward your own *fucking* friends. 

It's not even friends you hardly know that you try to push around. IT'S JOHN, YOU'VE KNOWN JOHN FOR FIVE YEARS. 
You are going abroad with him in just a few months, he's one of the few people left now who can even stand the real you.  

When we both met Jenna and I called dibs, you never let that one go, did you? I felt that every time I've tried to get back together with her you've been scornful and tried to shoot it down every time. She was so great for me, and all you ever did was to pour your negativity and hate all over our relationship. I can't remember you saying one positive note on the subject at all. Not even a single, shallow ""Way to hit that"". 

And after all this time, after all I've done for you, this very night, you called me ungrateful. You said that I didn't stick up for you, that I'm never there for you. I think I've never been so hurt, disappointed and above all **angry** before in my entire life. 

I told you at three separate occassions to go see a shrink. Each time you promised me you would. I got you all sorts of numbers to call, I set everything up for you. You didn't show. 

I picked up the phone every night you drunkenly called me late on *week-days*. I GOT WORK. Just because its an internship that involves music and I enjoy it doesn't mean its not ""a real job"" you fucktwat. Just because you're miserable and getting used at your workplace you have to drag me down with you?

You gave me a pair of headphones you got for free and then you expect me to buy you an expensive gift in return? You got them for *fucking* free man. You haven't given me a single dime in gas money, ever. You also make way more than I do, and have so much more money in the bank. It's easy for you to throw around twenty bucks as a gift, the problem is that those twenty bucks doesn't stay a gift when you want more than you spent back. 

The money doesn't matter at all to me, but you're so obsessed with it. You can't see that a gift only has value if it means something to you as well, not just a mind game to make me ""owe"" you something. You act like such a big-shot when you pay for something as well, to impress strangers, then outside you turn around as demand the gift to be repaid in both equal amount of cash and a bunch of gratitude.

That night when you called me and said you wish you never lived, I stayed up all night and felt bad for you while you were blazing with your douchebag friends. 

I drove you around since I know you have a hard time getting your license. Tonight I didn't wanna go pick you up in the middle of the freaking night since I have to get up at 6 am, and tonight you called me out on never being there for you. 

""WHEN HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE FOR ME!?"" I yelled at you on the phone after that self-righteous text you sent me. When you were quiet for three seconds, I realized that you haven't been there for me ever. I can't remember the last sincere thing you ever even said to me. You don't care about my paintings, my music, my dreams. When I try to share them you just shoot me down since you can't handle other peoples' success that you perceive as socially superior to your own. 

I've tried so hard to help you, I've always put you before me. Always. I feel so bad, because I know you need someone like me. I can't be him anymore. I'm sorry.

All you've ever cared about is you. Soon you're not gonna have anyone else to care about anyway. "
1av8yf,15,2013-03-23,"I was complimented on my work ethic, and I can't stop smiling.",ripcurly,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1av8yf/i_was_complimented_on_my_work_ethic_and_i_cant/,"So a little background: I am working as an intern at an engineering firm for six months. They have had a lot of interns in the past and will have lots more in the future, so sometimes I feel very insignificant, and I wasn't expecting any sort of recognition or appreciation when I took the job....

Anyway, yesterday I had a lot to do for several different engineers who all wanted me to finish by the end of the day. I worked really hard to get everything right and double checked all of my work because making a mistake can be a big problem; I was stressing out internally but stayed very positive and professional externally.

The end of the day rolled around but I still wasn't done with one task for one of the lead engineers. I decided to just stay late because I hate leaving things unfinished, even though he didn't really need it until Monday. I finished it up and was getting ready to head out when another engineer (one who's been very nice to me and given me a lot of responsibility, which I appreciate) walked over and asked me if I had finished that task he had asked me to do.

You know, the one thing - the ONLY thing - I didn't get to.

So I had to say no, and he wasn't angry but he was clearly overworked and a little bummed that I hadn't gotten to it, even though it was a very minor thing. He said not to worry, that I had clearly already stayed late by about half an hour, and that he would wrap it up. However, it was a five-minute task that was super easy to complete, so after he left, I finished it (in less than five minutes, actually) and walked over and gave him what he needed.

He said thanks, but that I didn't need to stay late to do it. I shrugged and said that I was already there, and that it didn't take long at all, and that I didn't mind since I liked working for him. I went back to my desk to collect my things, and as I passed his desk on my way out for the weekend, he stopped me and said...

""Thank you. You're doing a really great job.""

and then proceeded to comment on how impressed he is with my attention to detail and active participation, especially since this is my first-ever position at a real engineering company. He even said he wants to give me more responsibility, since I've proved that I'm a hard worker!

Isn't it funny how something as simple as that can still make me smile hours after it happened? But since it's my first professional job, it means so much to me that he noticed my hard work, and then to compliment me for it.

I'm so thankful to be able to truthfully say that I am someone who looks forward to going to work in the morning : )

As an aside: if you are in charge of an intern at your job and they are doing well, letting them know that will probably encourage them and get them to work even harder! Obviously don't give praise where it is not deserved, but there is nothing quite like recognition for a job well done. After all, the best compliments are the ones you earn.

I have a lot that I need to get off my chest, so I apologize for this in advance.

My name is Dave Muscato and I'm the Public Relations Director for American Atheists. Four years ago, I was a professional Christian worship musician. I want my fellow Redditors to know exactly what role Reddit has played in getting me from there to here, and how grateful I am for this forum and for every single person here.

I dropped out of high school to play [secular] music, which I did for several years. When I was 20, I got a call to fill in at a medium-sized megachurch. I started playing for them fairly regularly after that. I believed in God at the time but it was more what I'd now call theism. 

After a few months of experiencing how welcoming everyone was, I had an emotional experience during a Sunday service that I now recognize was just being overwhelmed by the music. At the time, I was thoroughly convinced that this was the Holy Spirit telling me that I should give up playing secular music and in order to play worship music professionally. I got ""saved"" and converted to Christianity. For two years or so, that was my life.

I decided that I should learn as much as I could about Christianity if I wanted to call myself a good Christian. I'd never read the Bible cover-to-cover, so I read the NIV and the King James. Then I thought, this is silly, there are dozens of English translations. If I really want to know what Jesus taught and how I should live my life, I should go to the source: I wanted to learn to read the original manuscripts. I found a classics grad student who was willing to tutor me and started learning Latin and Greek. We met twice a week for two years. I found out pretty quickly that you can't read the original manuscripts because we don't have them, just fragments of copies of copies of copies. I started reading books by people like Bart Ehrman, Karen Armstrong, Robert Price, Richard Carrier, and David Fitzgerald. I started learning more about epistemology and ancient history and it was not long before I went from Bible-believing Christian to closeted atheist.

I remained in the closet for a year. After 5 years as a worship musician, I didn't want to lose my job nor all my friends. But I knew I couldn't continue living a lie, and so eventually I had to come out. When I did, I was asked to resign from playing worship music. I lost many of my friends. Not knowing what else to do with myself, I enrolled in college, where I met Brother Jed.

Brother Jed and I have had some really great spats. We are friends; I have had dinner at his house several times in addition to doing two formal, moderated debates and dozens upon dozens of informal hecklings when he would do his street-preaching schtick. It was because of Brother Jed that I first became aware of the Secular Student Alliance/Center for Inquiry affiliate at my school, MU SASHA (Univ. of Missouri Skeptics, Atheists, Secular Humanists, &amp; Agnostics). I quickly joined and ran for a position of public relations officer. The next year I ran for VP and started a blog for SASHA.

This is where /r/atheism comes in.
-
The SASHA blog could have easily faded into obscurity like so many millions of blogs on the internet. It is because of /r/atheism that the SASHA blog started to get a really positive reputation in the atheist community. Since April of 2011 I've written about 170 articles for the SASHA blog, and we've also had guest posts from David Fitzgerald, Damon Fowler, and others. Several of our articles have made the front page here. When I attended my first SSA leadership conference in summer 2011, I was amazed at how many student leaders were well aware of my group because they regularly read our blog. That is also where I saw David Silverman speak for the first time. That summer I also attended the CFI leadership conference, where (among others) I saw Amanda Knief speak for the first time.

Because of you, r/atheism--the world's largest atheism forum--via the traffic you brought to the SASHA blog, I started getting invitations to do public speaking. I spoke at some other universities and appeared on a panel at Reasonfest 2, where I met James Croft and Greg Epstein from the Humanist Community at Harvard. James was impressed enough with my panel appearance that he invited me to start blogging for Harvard's site. I attended the Reason Rally and the American Atheists convention last year a few months later.

Blogging for the Humanist Community at Harvard led to a summer internship at the Secular Student Alliance under the wonderful Lyz Liddell and working alongside JT Eberhard, after which I took some time off school to focus on writing and public speaking. This led to an invitation to apply for the Public Relations Director position at American Atheists' national headquarters in New Jersey, where I am today.

There's a saying: ""Don't meet your heroes."" I presume this is because if they turn out to be not what you expected, you'll be disappointed, and it's better to keep the fantasy alive. Frankly, this is bullshit. The first time I met Amanda Knief, I told her I wanted to work with her someday. Dave Silverman has been a hero of mine since I first became aware of American Atheists in 2010. I still sometimes have trouble grasping the fact that my office is two doors down from his and three down from Amanda's; it just feels surreal. This is my dream job, and it blows my mind that I get to do what I love every single day. My coworkers are some of the most passionate people I know. I say this with entirely pure intentions (and I hope Dave isn't reading this!), but Dave Silverman is one of the smartest people I have ever met. Working for him is not only a dream come true but a real intellectual challenge. I don't know if I'm explaining this very well, but there's a reason he's famous: He's brilliant, he's decisive, and he has very high standards. He gets things *done* and he doesn't take crap from anyone. My point is that I absolutely love my job; I simply could not be happier with what I do and who I do it for, and I intend to keep doing it until I'm so old I'm physically incapable. I am so much happier now than I ever was as a worship musician with all those nagging doubts. I feel so free!

If it had not been for you, /r/atheism, I would not be where I am here in New Jersey, working at my dream job, doing work that I feel confident is really making a positive difference in the world. If it had not been for you, I would still be in Columbia, Missouri, an unemployed musician and part-time student, blogging away about atheism to the vastness of the intertoobz and trying to figure out what to do with my life.

This year is American Atheists' 50th anniversary, and I'm so proud to be part of the team during such an important time in history. I owe a great debt of gratitude to all of you. Thank you so much for existing, thank you so much for reading the blog, thank you so much for your comments and input and feedback, for your arguments that led to some great blog articles, for all you are and everything that you do, thank you.

-Dave Muscato, Public Relations Director, American Atheists

Thanks to r/atheism's help, I went from Christian worship musician to full-time professional atheism activist. I love you all for helping me find my place in life doing my dream job and working for my heroes. "
1aud7s,2,2013-03-23,Thanks for listening ,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1aud7s/thanks_for_listening/,"Have you ever had days where the upside never came. It is hard to complain about my life to others because I come from a well off family that has supported me. I feel like I can't say anything bad about my life because from the outside it looks like I have it all. I am in college that is being entirely paid for and I have a job for the summer at my Dad's company if I want it. But this semester I have had my current roommate who is one of my only friends at college ditch me for rooming next year and did not tell me till i found out through a different friend. Then I asked the only other people I hang out with and they accepted to only reject me weeks later as the person they though was moving out was going to stay. Also three different internships i was really excited about getting turned my down after they had told me on the phone that I was going to get it because of company restructuring. I know most of this is just bad luck and not my fault and even after all of it I am still better off than most. But some days just hit hard and i am left wondering  how i did i ever get so alone. I was always taught to solve my own problems. To everyone i look like i am doing great, making good grades and doing well in life, but on the inside i just want to give up. I don't want to talk to friends or family because they would get concerned but i can't live with the idea of being weak in their eyes. I know they would do what is right but don't want them to see someone to pity and help. I think at this point i would rather it looks like an accident or a single bad decision than a problem that has been brewing, i can't leave them with that guilt. I guess at just want to say thanks for reading, i may not have a lot of good reasons to think like i do but hey maybe i don't have to for long."
1atyzp,1,2013-03-22,My (M25) Fiancee's (F23) parents are getting divorced. She is withdrawing and acting irrational. Together 4yrs.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1atyzp/my_m25_fiancees_f23_parents_are_getting_divorced/,"Sorry in advance if this isn't dramatic enough for /r/relationships. I'm a long time lurker here and would appreciate your advice.

Her parents are getting divorced. We all know its going to be a long process since they share a business and multiple houses.

When she fist found out about it she was level headed and we talked for days about her feelings and how it was better for them but selfish that they were doing it the year she and her brother are getting married. She did all the talking I just validated her feelings and supported her like a good listener since i have not gone through anything like this in my own life.

Now, 4 months later and 4 months before our wedding, she is becoming withdrawn. The latest blow was when the Easter celebration she planned with our friends fell through (they all sited money or the obvious family conflict that was preventing them from going). She is saying things like 'none of them care about me' and 'I'm going to die alone'. i point out that ill be with her and i care about her and she will change it to 'we will be alone'. I've never heard her say such irrational things before. She brilliant and knows none of that is true.

She is getting a masters degree in psychology and is working with sex offenders at a prison as part of her internship (which i know isn't helping her feel good about people.) She is always very rational and open about her feelings and accepting of my comfort and emotional support. But not lately. I'm planning to tell her she may want to talk to someone professionally about the divorce, being a psych major she has often suggested that as a solution. But i don't consider her as depressed since the behavior has only gone on for about 3 weeks and only really bad this last week when the plans fell through, I'm not sure if suggesting that at this point is the best move.

Any advice for reaching her and making her feel better? I want to get her friends together and I'm trying to reach out to them to tell them she needs their support, but I'm struggling to do that effectively and to plan something when they don't seem willing or able to travel to our state (CT to RI, about 2 hour drive) for an evening. I may be her only support until we move back to CT in May.

I'm going to get her a cheesecake now (because I'm just that awesome), but i feel whenever she smiles and starts to act herself again that she is actually hiding these feeling and putting on a mask.

TL:DR; any advice for helping an SO through divorce? Any advice for gathering her friends when they don't seem willing to go the extra mile to come to us? And any advice for recognizing depression in someone who has a masters in hiding the symptoms of it?"

*I made the design so I own the copyright on it, right?

1axp25,37,2013-03-24,Tips For Becoming a Federal LEO,[deleted],ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1axp25/tips_for_becoming_a_federal_leo/,"I know a lot of people like the idea of becoming a federal law enforcement officer. I'm definitely one of those people, and the past couple of years, I've been collecting tips from various sources on how I can eventually achieve this goal. I figured I'd throw a little post together since I'm bored on Spring Break. To be clear, I'm just an undergraduate college student. I am **not a LEO of any kind.** It's just a career aspiration of mine. That said, some people who read this will probably have much more of an insight than I do. If any of these tips aren't as accurate as I think they are, feel free to correct them please.

* **Keep your record clean:** This is a given. Don't break the law. Unless they change things in the coming years, you *will* be polygraphed by the feds if you wanna work for them. Also, their background investigations are very stringent. Chances are, you'll be getting top secret clearance if you become a federal LEO. They don't just hand those out. As always, on the application process, be entirely honest. They forgive lots of stuff within reason, but one thing they do not ever forgive is lying.

* **College:** Chances are very good that you will not get hired by a federal agency unless you have, at minimum, a four-year degree. I believe it's a minimum requirement for most agencies on the federal level. In fact, it's so competitive you might want to even think about getting a graduate degree. They don't have any requirements in terms of what degree they want, but there are some that stand out to them. For example, the feds like computer-related degrees nowadays with the increase in cyber crimes. Many federal agencies like international relations for degrees/experience. The FBI tends to like accountants for some reason. If you're interested in a particular agency, then research what degrees/experience might be appealing to them.

* **Look for internships:** There are tons of agencies out there. Look for internships with them. You have to start somewhere, and internships are a great way to both get your foot in the door and gain relevant experience. I've applied for a few internships, and I finally got my first interview with a federal agency coming up. If you don't get accepted the first few times around, keep trying.

* **Don't plan on getting hired right out of school:** All federal agencies are extremely competitive. I applied for an FBI **internship** and was apparently up against ex-military and people with Ph.D's. No, I didn't get it (shocking!). Prepare to work elsewhere immediately after college, whether it's in law enforcement or not.

* **Think about the military:** Consider joining the military, especially as an officer. Even better, if you get into a relevant career like military intelligence, they'll like that a lot. It's just something to consider. 

* **Learn a language:** This will be useful for any career, especially within law enforcement. According to the guys with whom I've talked, it doesn't really matter what language you learn (though if you're fluent in Arabic, that'd be nice). Just become fluent in *some*thing on top of English. It'll help you get hired quite a bit.

* **Do your research:** Look for career fairs, try to find emails, and contact agencies directly. Of course, use your discretion with this; don't be an annoying pest and bother people all the time, but think about it. Most of these guys worked really hard to get where they are, which means they probably take pride in their work. That also means that they often enjoy mentoring young people. I've talked to a handful of federal agents; a few have had me call them and were excited to see my initiative. An FBI agent with whom I've communicated quite a bit via email was very helpful and provided very detailed responses; I could tell he cared. Think about all the LEO's on this subreddit. They all enjoy talking to us as long as we're reasonable with our questions.

* **Do your research, part 2:** Yes, people will often not mind chatting with you about the job, but ask intelligent questions that aren't necessarily easy to find on the agency's website. This means you have to also do your own research. Learn about each agency and what their mission is. Most agencies have a website with info on how to get hired (minimum requirements, the process, etc.). Make sure you look at that stuff before asking people questions. You want to be an investigator for the U.S. government? Start by investigating the career you want.

* **Federal LEO's are not ""above"" local LEO's:** The reason I personally want to go federal is not because I think it's better than local; it's simply because I think I'd enjoy that kind of work more. I like the opportunities offered on the federal level (i.e. travel), and I like the idea of investigations more than patrol-type work. That said, what local LEO's do is just as important and just as difficult. If you ever get a job as a federal LEO, just remember that you're not any better than local LEO's. Chances are, they'll be making your job much easier, and hopefully, you'll be doing the same for them.

Here are some federal agencies:

**Misc:** [NASA OIG](http://oig.nasa.gov/rec_current.html); [State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security](http://www.state.gov/m/ds/career/); [FBI](https://www.fbijobs.gov/index.asp); [Secret Service](http://www.secretservice.gov/opportunities.shtml); [DEA](http://www.justice.gov/dea/careers/occupations.shtml); [ATF](http://www.atf.gov/careers/); [DHS HSI](http://www.ice.gov/about/offices/homeland-security-investigations/)

There are tons I didn't mention. For example, NASA is definitely not the only agency with an Office of the Inspector General. I mean, even the CIA has federal investigators. 

**Military Agencies with Civilian Agents:** [Army CID](http://www.cid.army.mil/join_CID.html); [Air Force OSI](http://www.osi.andrews.af.mil/questions/civilians/index.asp); [NCIS (Yes, it's real)](http://www.ncis.navy.mil/Careers/Pages/default.aspx); [CGIS](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg2/cgis/)

Here's a list with a lot more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law_enforcement_in_the_United_States


Mods, not sure if this is worthy, but feel free to put this in the side-bar. I know a lot of stuff about getting into federal law enforcement is often asked here. If anyone else has tips, feel free to comment with them, and I'll add it here (I'll be sure to give you credit).

Lastly, if you found any of these tips helpful, please make you sure apply after I get a job. :-)

Thanks for reading!"
1axnd9,21,2013-03-24,Dr. B,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1axnd9/dr_b/,"This took place about 5 years ago in the fall of 2008, my senior year at the university.  Background: I am a gay 27 year old female.  At the time these events occurred I was still sexually confused.  I knew I liked girls, but I hadn’t completely eliminated guys yet.  I had switched my major multiple times and had finally settled on criminology.  

It was fall of ’08 and I had 4 crim courses and 1 italian course.  For one of my crim courses I had an instructor who went by Dr. B.  Dr. B seemed like your typical white woman at first.  She was quite tall, slender and very pale with dark, wavy hair in a cropped cut and big blue eyes.  She looked like she had recently lost a lot of weight and was somewhat on the emaciated side.  She had delicate features and she walked slowly in a deliberate manner.  I did not pay much attention to her during lecture as there was this girl I had a crush on the previous semester sitting in the front row of the class.  I sat with my friend Gabby in the 2nd row, directly in front of Dr. B’s desk.

One day Dr. B put us in groups for a small group discussion.  Each group had to pick an answer to whatever question it was.  Dr. B was going from group to group and when she got to our group she stood across from me for a while, starring and smiling at me.  She looked at me with her eyes sparkling and twinkling like she was a pirate who had just uncovered a treasure chest full of gold.  This went on for about 5 seconds when I blanked out on our answer because I felt embarrassed and I looked away to this other girl in my group, who then answered the question.  I didn’t know why Dr. B only looked at me for the answer but I assumed she just decided to pick someone at random in our group to answer.

Anyway I forgot about that group question fail and during the next few lectures I just sat next to my friend, trying to pay attention.  During the beginning of the semester Dr. B never looked in my direction, she just randomly looked around and glanced quickly at the sea of faces that were my classmates, never really focusing on one face.  

However not soon after our small group discussion I started to notice Dr. B looking in my direction more often.  I didn’t really think it was odd, as some professors would sometimes focus on one person’s face as they spoke, as if they were speaking to a specific person and then move on to the next random student.  I had a few professors do this, and the professor I had after Dr. B did this a lot to me because I was one of the only people who actually tried to pay attention in class.  

But with Dr. B her glances started to feel different.  She started to focus on me all the time while she was lecturing, with that same twinkle in her eye when we did the group discussions.  It didn’t bother me at first but then during her lectures her stares became more intense, to the point I had to look away or look down when I saw her starting to roam her eyes in my direction again.  I started to feel uncomfortable and a bit unnerved during her lectures.  It didn’t seem to me as if anyone else had noticed because I looked around and no one was paying much attention anyways, and I always had tried to make an effort to focus on the lecture.  

Her class focused on deviant behavior and one time she was discussing bi-sexuality and she joked about having a girlfriend.  I tried to avoid eye contact during this part of her lecture so I bent down in my desk and pulled out some gum, offering some to my friend.  Right as I got back up I had accidently locked eye contact with Dr. B after her strange joke and she was starring me down earnestly, smiling at me.  I wanted to nope the fuck right out of there.  

You would think that me being sexually confused and this professor eye-fucking me during class would have been exciting but in reality I was terrified.  I didn’t want to be there and I felt trapped.  I’ve gotten creepy stares before but I was always able to escape the situation and in her class I just couldn’t up and leave.  I contemplated taking an F by being a no show but I had already been on academic probation so if I failed another class my GPA would be in the danger zone again.  I tried to endure the rest of the semester as much as I could.

During class sometimes Dr. B would mention things that seemed out of place.  She bragged about attending 4 different popular universities.  She joked once that she was a slut and another time that she was a pothead.  Another weird comment she threw out once when I was biting my nails, and she said that nail biting was a bad habit, something along those lines.  Sometimes she would lash out on the class as a whole, treating us like 6th graders.  She made us stand up once because we weren’t paying attention and until everyone shut up then we were allowed to sit back down again.  Another time she reprimanded us for not coming to her office for help on a paper.  The thing that stuck out to me the most was she had done research on sex offenders and at one point she tracked sex offenders’ activities online.  This is important later in the story.

The next several classes after this class she seemed to avoid looking at me for long periods of time.  I was somewhat confused yet relieved I wasn’t getting much attention anymore.  Maybe she had finally understood that I had felt uncomfortable and decided to lay off the creeping.  Unfortunately this didn't last for long.  

During one class we had to watch an instructional video and the lights were off.  I had my eyes focused on the projector screen but I could see in the corner of my eye that Dr. B had her gaze on me.  I felt creeped out and just ignored her staring but the whole time I could feel it and my stomach would turn.  I began to have anxiety problems towards the middle of the semester.  I remember one day coming in class and I sat down, my hands started to shake when Dr. B sat at her desk.  I couldn’t pay attention anymore and I would avoid eye contact with her at all costs.  

By the end of the semester I would just be doodling in my notebook, drawing circles repeatedly and just wishing class would be over.  A couple times I turned instinctively to glance at the clock, she would catch me and bitch that class wasn’t over yet.  If I did look up I would just stare directly at the projector at the powerpoint slides, acting concentrated on taking notes.  

One time I was staring at the powerpoint projecting onto the board and I felt Dr. B’s eyes on me, I tried to ignore it but she wouldn’t stop.  So I looked away from the projector really quick to glance at her and she was giving me a really mean glare, making my blood run cold.  I didn’t understand why no one noticed this but me.  Was I imagining all this?  I skipped the next class after that because I didn’t want to deal.

The next class after that was our last, I remember.  I don’t recall what our class was about but I remember her mega stare down which I completely ignored.  I could smell the desperation off her as this was her last lecture of the course.  Next week was finals and I had to turn in a paper during her class.  I looked completely ragged as I had done two all-nighters in a row and had not gotten much sleep in between writing papers for my other courses as well.  She was late to pick up the papers and we were all waiting to turn them in.  I was getting rather desperate because we couldn’t just leave the papers on her desk since she required us to be “signed off” after turning in the papers.  

When she did show up she would call us up row by row, I finally gave her my paper and I although I didn’t want to look at her I noticed that she was avoiding my face and she looked somewhat shaken up for some reason.  As I turned around to nope the fuck out and started to quickly walk away she calls out in a high-pitched voice, “Have a safe winter break!”  I hightailed it out of there, not once looking back and never felt so relieved to finish a class.

After I finished her class and I went on home to finally catch some sleep.  Towards the end of the night I checked my school email for some compelling reason.  I saw an email from Dr. B wishing us a generic happy holiday.  I think my anger and lack of sleep had gotten the best of me and I emailed her back calling her a creep.  On the computer I felt safe being a dick.  The next day she replied to me saying, “I’m sorry what???” and I got nervous.  I could have gotten in deep shit for talking back at a professor so I replied and lied saying I meant it towards a friend!  

Then a few days later I swear to God, Dr. B sent me an email only to me, saying a quick hello and to tell me she made a mistake inputting my grade into the computer system.  She had put on Blackboard that I earned a B, but on the university website it showed that I received an A.  At this point I didn’t trust anything she said.  If it were a mistake then okay whatever... but I did not understand her intentions if it wasn’t.

I was working in a major retail store at the time during this Christmas season and I was just hired as holiday recovery help.  Basically I only had to fold clothes on the display tables and clean out the fitting rooms after they were trashed.  So there I was folding clothes on one of the display tables near the elevators.  One of the managers that worked in the department came up to me and asked me to go towards the fitting rooms instead because customers had trashed them.  I said I would be there shortly and I quickly finished up at the table I was working on.  

Well as I was slightly bent over the table folding I felt a pair of eyes starring at me from my left side, towards the Traditional Women’s Clothes section.  I look over, and there was Dr. B hiding behind a rack of cashmere sweaters.  It couldn’t have been more than 3 seconds when I had looked over and we locked eyes.  The thing that terrified me the most was when I looked right at her she didn’t even look away, but she was completely frozen, with this intense stare on her face.  I quickly looked away and pretended I didn’t see anything.  Instead of confronting her and asking what she was doing I briskly walked away to the fitting rooms and for the rest of the day I denied what had actually happened, but in the back of my mind I had thoughts racing over what had occurred.  

I had actually made a Facebook account a couple days before Christmas because I remember my first picture post were photos from Christmas Eve.  I had my account public and had posted where I currently worked at.  It really didn’t occur to me at the time that Dr. B would look me up on FB and go to my place of work.  I had barely made a FB account a few days ago!  Needless to say I changed my profile quickly from public to friends only.  Her finding me so fast on FB made me think of when she had mentioned tracking sex offenders online and it made me wonder if she had used some type of software to track my online activity.  

Just thinking about it gives me the creeps.  Also after I saw her at my work and I checked my grade again, my grade had finally been fixed to a B.  After this went down at my place of work I never saw her there again, but I recall being afraid while walking outside at night into my work parking lot.  Sometimes I would feel like I was being watched and I would quickly make my way into my car and lock all doors a.s.a.p.  At school the next semester I would also look around in the parking lot while getting into and out of my car, having that being watched feeling from time to time.  

I did tell someone about what had went down during my fall semester with Dr. B.  I talked to my friend Gabby that was in the same class with me about it.  We started emailing each other after the fall semester had ended and I had confided in her that Dr. B was being creepy.  Gabby said that was strange because when she went into Dr. B’s office one day to ask for help on her paper, Dr. B had offered Gabby a job to work with her and her husband!  I thought wow that woman had some fucking nerve in class.  It made me think how she just had this power trip, starring down girls to make them feel uncomfortable and getting off on it.  That made me so angry to find out.  Gabby did confirm to me that Dr. B was kind of acting weird and sometimes would give her mean looks which she didn’t understand since Dr. B had offered her a job after she graduated school.

Anyway one day Gabby and I were sitting at the university’s cafe when she confided in me that something weird happened.  She had to ask professors for references over an internship she was pursuing and thinking Dr. B would for sure give her a reference, she contacted her via the school email.  She then said Dr. B refused to give her a reference, saying that she didn’t know Gabby that well.  This was after Dr. B had offered Gabby a job!  For some reason I felt like it was partly my fault and I apologized to my friend.  Gabby shortly after this had her a flat tire and her boyfriend said it looked like someone had slashed it.  I automatically thought of Dr. B but figured there was no proof and really no good reason.

Luckily I did not see or run into Dr. B at all during the spring semester.  However towards the end of April before finals week, I remember lying in bed, writhing in pain and crying because I had menstrual cramps.  They were so painful that I would just lie there for at least an hour until the pain subsided.  It was a little before midnight and I was lying face down into a pillow with a blanket pulled over me while I cried into my pillow.  I had my window slightly open because the weather was getting warmer and I liked the cool breeze blowing into my room.  Well I’m just lying still and almost out of pain, silently crying when I hear something move outside.  I kept completely still, holding in my breath to see if I could hear it again.  

Our house had mulch that ran around the perimeter of the house and it was underneath my window so it sounded like someone was shifting from foot to foot in the mulch.  It seemed like deliberate movements, and not reckless thrashing like if it were an animal.  I realized someone was standing at my window, watching me for who knows how long.  I froze in my bed and kept still for a minute until I couldn’t take it anymore and I got up, screaming and running to find my mom.  After I told her and I came back I looked out my window but no one was there.

A few months after that, when spring semester was over and I had graduated from the university, I was sleeping in my bed and around 3 am in the morning I woke to a noise outside.  I was disoriented and half-asleep when I heard something like someone was sawing off the screen of my window.  I remember getting out of my bed and turning on the lights.  After that it stopped and again I ran to find my parents.  They thought I was dreaming and had a bad dream but I knew otherwise because I was sleeping peacefully when this sound abruptly woke me up out of my deep slumber.  

The next day I wanted to confirm that I wasn’t dreaming and I observed that my window screen had been pushed in somewhat but not enough to be removed.  My dad had recently replaced the windows after the incident with [my creepy neighbor](http://redd.it/1aifwn).  I thank my dad for that because I really don’t know if it was Dr. B or my creepy neighbor at my window again.  This time however it was clear someone was trying to get inside my room while I was asleep.  Fucking creepy as hell.  I still don’t know who did but I am leaning either to Dr. B or my neighbor.  

I wish I could say it stopped there but from time to time I would see someone who looks like Dr. B from behind and I would freak out.  Shortly after someone tried to break into my window, I was at Target looking at the lipsticks when I would feel someone glance my way before walking past.  To me this was nothing out of the ordinary but in this moment I had a weird feeling in my gut and after this woman had walked past I looked over and from behind it would look like Dr. B.  I remember my heart stopped but I would try to reason that it wasn’t.  

About 5 minutes later I tried searching for this woman to get a good look at her face but I didn’t want her to see that I was obviously looking her over, in case it wasn’t and I didn’t want to be creepy.  I spotted her in one of the aisles and I approached slowly with my cart, and the closer I got to make out her face the more I came to recognize that it was almost positively Dr. B.  I freaked out before getting too close where she would notice me and I made a 180 and got the fuck out of there.  I almost had an anxiety attack and the whole time I was trying to figure out why she would pass by me and keep going as if nothing.

Years have passed and every once in a while I would see a woman pass and when I turn to look from behind it looks exactly like her.  Never from the front, only from behind after she had already passed by me.  Most of the time I feel like I am overreacting and I try to reason that it is just a random stranger, but I can’t help but feel sometimes that it is Dr. B.

**TL;DR**: I had a professor creep on me in class and later weird shit ensued."

In the first situation last year, the bride was generally pretty unpleasant to work with, but it was sort of par for the course for her at that time. After the wedding, she lightened up considerably and we have a better relationship than we even had before her engagement.

Because of all the trouble I'd had with the first gal, I was psyched for the second one to get engaged. I consider this person my sister. We've been best friends for many years and I have always known her to be a steady, understanding, laid-back person. I thought her shower/bachelorette/everything would go smoothly and be a joy. 

Everything was pretty much fine until a couple months ago (the wedding is in July). We'd had a couple disagreements because she kept badgering me to ""lock down"" my own boyfriend (I presumed maybe because she wanted a partner in the planning process?) and it's not the right time for us, so I had to shut her down repeatedly. No big deal. The real trouble is that now she is being overwhelmingly negative about everything. The flowers, the DJ, the pictures, the venue, the money, the dress, I've heard her complain about all of it--but the real trouble is the dates/details of the shower. She drags her feet every time I try to set a date (I'm throwing her 2 showers in 2 cities so things need to come together soon). She is snarky with me about my choice of date--it's limited because I'm in med school and just trying to eke out my first year, and I have finals/ceremonies/mandatory internships I have to work around. 

Negativity is one thing. But now she isn't responding to my requests to hang out. When we hang out in a group, she ignores me, to the point where her fiance recognizes what's happening, looks visibly uncomfortable, and goes out of his way to include me. There was a death in my extended family a couple months ago and she barely talked to me about it, even when I brought it up. I can forget about venting about school to her; she just launches into how much harder her situation is because of wedding-this and wedding-that. 

I am honestly doing my best, and I started out with the best of intentions. I worried for a long time that maybe she was being hostile to me because she'd heard me vent about the first friend's wedding and thought that I'd adopt the same attitude to hers. But I truly didn't think anything like that until she started getting cranky with me. I know I am probably at least partially at fault but I have done everything I can think of to correct my own behavior and nothing has improved. If anything, it's worse now that ever.

So I need advice. The fact that my first friend totally returned to baseline after her wedding makes me want to hold my tongue. I know that this friend is incredibly sensitive and holds some major grudges, and I don't want to get on the bad side of that. Is wedding planning really so consuming and important that it can temporarily morph a person's personality, only to return to normal? Or is this something I need to hash out right now, since the problem won't evaporate in August? My best friend is unrecognizable to me and my feelings are getting hurt. 

I understand that this is ridiculously long but I'd appreciate any insight. Tell me your stories and help me understand the wedding-planning mindset. Thank you :)

1ax9kd,0,2013-03-24,22 Years Old. Reaching Financial Independence Early!,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ax9kd/22_years_old_reaching_financial_independence_early/,"22yrs old. I have one more semester of school to complete and will graduate with a bachelor's in computer engineering  in December 2013. 
Currently have no debt.

Have $10,500 in an Ally savings account

$2,500 in Wells Fargo Checkings/Savings

Have a reliable car that's paid off.

I have a 12 week internship from May 20th-Aug 9th where I expect to clear ~$10,000 after taxes

Able to keep my monthly expenses May 20th-August20th ~$1100 rent/food/entertainment/insurance(Rent is the killer here!)

Expenses from now to May 20th ~$700 (Rent is already paid)

Expecting to pay ~$3500 in September for last semester of school

Expecting to pay about ~$4000 for last semester living expenses.

I also have an side gig that I made ~$5000 last year but that is not guaranteed whatsoever this year but I may make about that amount again so I don't like to count on it.

Those are the big numbers. I am wondering how to make the money work for me as best as possible! I would like to make the max contribution to my 2012 Roth($5000) before the April 15th deadline.

Funds I have been looking at are

VFINX- Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares

VASGX- Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund

VISGX-Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund Investor Shares 

VHDYX-	Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund Investor Shares

Being only 22 I have a pretty high tolerance for risk as I won't be touching most of these funds for a while. That being said I also have a goal of early ""retirement"" or better said financial independence.  Once I reach the crossover point of where my investments are making enough money to live on I intend to ""retire"". 

I live pretty well but also frugally at this point and have no real need to have a flashy new car or things of similar natures. I am setting a goal of having this done by age 31 but depending on my spending obligations in the future(Possible children etc..)  set a max age of 35. I intend to save &gt;%50 of my income if possible.

Speaking of income I intend on making anywhere from $50,000-$60,000 out of college(January 1st, 2014 or so)  and should have room for salary growth.
My employer this summer even as an intern offers a %4 match on 401k(Traditional or Roth) contributions with %100 immediate vesting and allows me to manage the 401k myself. So I am thinking I should definitely take advantage of this! I am hoping to stay with this employer after I graduate but due to their many locations around the country I don't really know where I will end up geographically.

So really I am searching for direction on what to do. How much should I invest now? Funds to invest in now? Should I put money into my 2013 Roth at the same time when I put my 2012 contribution in? Should they be different funds? How to structure my portfolio?  Should my 401k investing be any different? Hopefully I was descriptive enough, let me know if you need any more information! Thank you so much in advance!

1ax95x,1,2013-03-24,Atheist and Christian Breakup,Knightsgrim,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ax95x/atheist_and_christian_breakup/,"Hi reddit. This is my first ever post, so here it goes:

This story is about my finding and breaking up with the only girl who I have felt a true connection with. It all begins with in the summer of 2011. It was a normal day at work for me, at the time I was working as an audio visual tech in an office building. As I was doing my normal routine checking in on meetings, etc, I saw a truly gorgeous woman. A woman so attractive and elegant that I was awe struck. She had everything that I wanted, physically. She was tall yet cute, her hair was dark and poofy (I love poofy hair), and and top of all that her body was full and curvaceous. Immediately I decided that such a woman was out of my league because I was not used to such seeing humility paired with beauty in such a way. To my surprise, she was sweeter, and more caring, and more humble than she was beautiful. 

One day at lunch she just sat down at the same table and we sparked a conversation. I was even more delighted that she, like I, was a little nerdy so immediately we had a bit of a connection. I couldn't wait for the next move. I found out that she was younger than I thought, she was only 18 (as opposed to being in her mid twenties which I had initially thought) and I was 21. Normally I would have been put off by this but she proved herself to be quite mature. 

As time passed we had become close, but, there was a huge obstacle in the way. She had been the first girl that I had become close to after a very destructive and manipulative relationship that I had been extremely affected by. There had been a year's time between these events but I was still quite affected and I knew it. As I was wrestling with the idea of pursuing this amazing woman she had beat me to the punch and told me that she had feelings for me. I was unable to give an answer at the point, and I left with one thought heavy on my conscience. I was sad that this girl had took the risk of tell me her feelings and wasn't able to provide her with anything substantial. I then told her exactly why I couldn't make up my mind. I brought to my home and showed her the empty nursery that I had built for my baby boy. My son was born from the previous relationship which I had mentioned before. My ex girlfriend had done everything possible to tear me down and I was still recovering from all of it. I told her that I could not guarantee that things would go well between us. 

Afterward she stayed. We still hung out, even more in fact. I saw that she was really goodhearted and simply wonderful. So, I went for it. However, what I feared had started to happen. My anger with my ex had started to perverse the relationship. I had found myself being unreasonable and apathetic. Even though it pained me to leave her, I forced myself to because I knew I was not being fair to. 

Over the following year I was able to open my eyes and find a way out the cave in which I had retreated due to my other relationship. I had stopped being pessimistic and unreasonable, things within myself were returning to normal. It was at this point, more than any time, that I would miss her the most. I couldn't help but think ""Why couldn't I have been this way with her? If only I could see her again, to apologize at the very least"". To be honest I believe that the guilt I felt, and still feel, from the way I didn't treat as she deserved had been the thing to allow me to transcend myself and get over what had happened to me. For this I am forever indebted.

Fast forward to the summer of 2012. The summer is the start of the college internships at my job which she was a part of. For a whole month I searched for her in hopes that she had returned. Just when was about to accept that she wasn't coming back I saw her. I couldn't believe it. As cliche as it sounds I felt like the luckiest guy in the world that I was given a second chance. That moment of elation was short lived with the thought of how she must feel towards me. When I found myself right next to her I wasn't to confront her at all. How could I say the things I wanted in such a casual atmosphere? How could I begin to bring up what in a professional setting? At the same time, how could I simply say ""hi""?

I did about the lamest thing possible I sent her an email saying that I'm glad your back and asked if she wanted to have lunch some time. It worked.

We went out after work one day had a bit of small talk and she quickly asked ""why did you want to talk?"". Relieved, I told her the truth. I told her that I was very sorry for the way I treated her and that I missed her, I really missed her. Before parting ways she told me that this changed her perception of the situation and some time to think. 

After hearing her side of the relationship and hearing her anger towards me she decided to give me another chance. Not only was I overcome with joy, this time, I was ready. Holding her at that moment was indescribable. I was sure that I had lost her and yet, there I had her. 

After some time had passed she had begun trusting me and I had continued to treat as the beautiful and wonderful woman that she was. Everything was right. My family had liked her, her family seemed to like me. There was an issue. Something that I still think about today. It seemed that the closer we got a part of her became that much more distant. It was discreet and by the time I had notice it had become too late. In an instance it was over. She had abruptly ended the relationship.

Her reason was that our sex life was bringing her further away from her religion. I found this to be odd primarily because I let her progress things sexually. I never pressured her into trying new things and always made sure that she was comfortable with what we were doing.

I wish that I could elaborate on this but she wasn't able to elaborate on this herself. She tried to explain but couldn't find the right words. I always knew that this was a possibility because she was religious and I am an atheist, but we are both rational and respectful people. Though I don't accept her religion as my own I respected her right to believe what ever she wants. For these reasons I honestly thought this wouldn't happen.

She admitted that she enjoyed being with me and that I was good to her, better than she felt she deserved even. So I am left to wonder if this is the real reason she ended things. I don't want to believe this to be the truth because it is simply unfair. I'd rather it be anything else. I'd rather it be that I didn't deserve her, or even that this was payback for our first encounter. Then I would at least be able to accept my own fault. This relationship ended late august of 2012 and I still have not been able to come to terms with what happened. 

Reddit, what do you think?"
1awufs,2,2013-03-24,Struggling with my decision to move there.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1awufs/struggling_with_my_decision_to_move_there/,"So my bf (29) and I (22) have been dating since early November, but have known each other since July/August. He lives in the Netherlands, I live in Germany but am originally from the US. He asked me a few weeks ago to move in with him, and I have to say it's incredibly tempting. I would get a visa that allows me to work anywhere I want as long as we live together and are dating. Whereas here my visa relies entirely on my job.

I'm absolutely petrified about telling my parents that I am going to live with him, as they are relatively old fashioned and think that me moving to another country just for a guy is ridiculous.

However, there are some extenuating circumstances that make my decision more difficult: I have a job here. It's not a very good job, and at the end of April it may no longer be a job. But I've worked my ass off and gone from intern to head of the Community Management department in a matter of months. Considering I do not have a degree that's a HUGE accomplishment. My boss is still waiting on getting our increased funding approved by our investors, and if that doesn't go through then the company is going under and I'm out of a job and a visa. In that situation moving is obvious.

However, if the funding does go through I have a well paying job here in the gaming industry. That's not something I could even imagine getting in the Netherlands. There are some places, but my resume looks quite lame and I doubt they'd even give me a second glance.

I'm just so stressed. If I do choose to move there then I may not have a job and may not find one for months, as I speak 0 Dutch. But my bf claims that's not a problem. I'm also worried that the dynamic will change drastically when we're finally together and have to work and do other stuff as well. Whenever we see each other now no one has to work, and we're sort of in this bubble of happiness.

I'm sorry I'm rambling. I'm just nervous and unsure of what to do. I know so many of you will think I'm nuts for considering not moving there. But if the funding goes through this job can be huge for me. I HATE where I am now. I hate my roommates, I hate my friends here, I hate being in a city, and I hate seeing my bf once every few weeks (which is better than most of you, I know I shouldn't complain). But I'm so afraid that I'll move in with him, have no friends, and just be miserable and bored and lonely all the time.

Our house will be in a really tiny town pretty far from any major city, and I don't know anyone in the country other than him, his friends, and his family. I'm just.. worried and needed someone to vent to, sorry."
1awpus,32,2013-03-24,"Mom, I'm sorry for what I've done to you.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1awpus/mom_im_sorry_for_what_ive_done_to_you/,"I've had issues with depression since I was young. It started when I was 12, with the standard middle school bullying where my ineptitude at sports and getting along with people made me a friendless pariah-- much like everyone else in middle school, I imagine.

I let myself go to places I shouldn't have back then, and I refused to talk about them. I think my sister had some of the issues as me-- she was the one who brought up the idea of suicide to me when she was fourteen, but she only brought it up once. Either she got better, or I wasn't a good person for her to vent to.

I refused to talk about it for a long time. Doesn't mean it didn't hit me. I stopped functioning every so often. I remember one day, in particular, something caused me to shut down, and I lay down in the hammock in the side yard and refused to respond to any stimulus.

My mother sat next to me the whole time. She knew something was wrong. I refused to tell her. For absolutely no reason, except that I was positive I wasn't supposed to be feeling how I was, and that revealing that was just revealing more of what was wrong with me.

I didn't bring it up. I toughed it out through middle school, mostly because I was fortunate enough not to have any means of suicide available to me. I got to high school. Things got better. I got to college.... things got worse.

For Christmas, I couldn't enjoy the holiday. My family and I have become estranged. I only feel comfortable with my mother out of my whole family. I tried my hardest to avoid the family for the whole three weeks of break that I was home, and mom noticed. She pressured why I was drinking more and interacting with family less, and I finally admitted that I hadn't trusted anyone in the family in a long time, ever since I decided that I didn't like how hypercritical they all were of one another and, I extrapolated, me. We talked it over, I convinced her not to talk about it with the family at all.

Back to college. I'm in my senior year with no work experience, nothing lined up for the summer, and a GPA below 3.0, which means nobody wants to hire me as an engineering intern or full-time worker. Add to that the way I *knew* that I wanted to be an engineer since I was seven and find myself questioning it now, plus the issues that came to the forefront in my first relationship to last all the way into the six month mark... well, I guess it's all rather silly when you look at it from afar, but I got very depressed from it, and I went further with the suicidal stuff than I ever have.

I tried to find what the least painful way to die was online. All I found were people saying not to do it, no relevant data. I settled on an overdose on sleeping pills in hopes that I would be asleep when the overdose effects ended me. I registered on Amazon and ordered a bottle. I wrote a note. I made sure to absolve everyone who might feel responsible. Anyone I'd ever made the mistake of opening up to. I took full responsibility for what I did, I left what I had financially available to the people who had been friends to me since I was young.

But somehow, thousands of miles away, with me being just as silent and shitty a son as I've always been, my mother figured out that something was wrong. She texted me and made me call her, made me talk to her. I told her that I was depressed. I told her that I felt worthless. I didn't tell her that I was considering suicide. I can't tell her that. I can't do that to her.

But I've started going to a counselor now. The pills came in the mail and I threw them away. I'm still having issues with depression sporadically. My girlfriend and I decided that our problems were insurmountable and broke up today. It's ups and downs, and I'm taking it one day at a time.

Apologies for the wall of text. Just... needed to get it off my chest."

I am 22, graduated from college in May 2012, and have been working a full time job since shortly thereafter. In high school, I ran cross country and played soccer. I remember one of my first drivers licenses reading that my weight was 120 pounds. Long story short, I went to college and freshman year wasn't tough, but sophomore year I moved into my sorority house WAY across a large campus from the rec center, with a cook who was carb-happy, and found myself insanely busy with classes, work, internships, etc.

A friend from high school recently told me that in high school he always thought I was too skinny (I always thought I was on the heavier side of my friend group), and warned me not to get that skinny again.

Now, I'm in-between 5'5"" and 5'6"" and my moment I knew things needed to change was when I stepped on a scale for the first time in probably months and realized the scale read that I was over 180lbs, and again when I went to the doctor and she showed me my chart and I noticed my BMI was WAY too high (according to my standards). I knew I was gaining weight over the last few years, but it didn't really hit me until I saw 180+.  My highest weight was 183, and in the middle of January I started working out to try to lose the weight. I got down to 176 by the middle of February, but then I developed a headache that lasted for two straight weeks and found myself unable to do much, especially high-energy things like working out. I fell off the wagon and haven't worked out since aside from occasionally going for long, brisk walks with my boyfriend after work and on the weekends. I have maintained my weight loss because I have become aware of what I am eating and have been eating much healthier (eating out less, packing lunches for work, etc). So, I still hover around 176-179 depending on fluctuations.

I *need* to make this change, because I hate what I see when I look in the mirror, so I'm getting back on the wagon tomorrow and heading to the gym first thing in the AM. I keep looking at pictures of me from 4 years ago and can see so many differences that I hate - of course in my figure, but also in my face. I will probably need support and motivation from time to time, but I'm glad I found r/loseit! 

I've decided I want to set my goal weight to between 125-135lbs. Tomorrow starts my journey to lose 41-51 pounds! 

Please let me know if you think this sounds healthy. Also, if you have a similar story to mine, how long did it take you to lose this much weight? What kind of program did you do? Thanks for reading my wall of text, and I'm excited to share my progress with you!

1aznnr,8,2013-03-25,Learned some shit today (2 months post breakup),Nemesis3137,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1aznnr/learned_some_shit_today_2_months_post_breakup/,"So I was working out with one of my friends today who is in the same design college and studio as my ex and he asks me if my ex is suppost to get in contact with me this week. I told him yeah since shes visiting town from her internship she said she wanted to meet up and work on being friends and moving on and i havent quite decided if I wanted to see her or not. I havent seen her since we broke up. Anyways he starts telling me some stuff, things ive never heard before. He told me about how my ex told one of his friends (who's also in the same studio) about how she would sometimes lie about being at studio working on homework just so she didnt have to see me that day. 

At first i got pretty mad at him, thought he was lying, but then it just started making sense to me. She always complained about how much work she had to do and how she never had time to see me, yet everyone else in her class who I hung out with always told me she exaggerated things and that she finished before all of them. If they had time to hang out with me, there should be no reason why she didn't. During the breakup she also told me there were times she didnt want me to come over and she didnt want to see me and she shouldnt feel this way about someone shes dating, etc. I guess i never really thought to much into it.

Im just so pissed /r/breakups.. I mean pretty much all of the fights that we ever had during our relationship were about her being so busy all the time and sometimes id only get to see her like once a week. I mean it got so bad she made me feel fucking guilty for actually getting mad at her for putting school before me. I always told her school comes first, always. That was her mindset as well. But to hear this shit, now? If she does contact me to meet up this week part of me wants to say yeah sure, then just give her a yell storm when i see her. She didnt deserve that fucking letter I sent her 3 weeks post breakup, I gave her all my emotions and completely opened up to her. I thought it was right. My heart told me I had to send that letter, it was the right thing to do, so i did it. But, As time goes on, you learn shit. That's why people say they come to regret breaking NC, youll eventually see shit you didn't even know existed while you were dating that person. 

Anyways Im pretty much at the point where if she does get in contact with me this week since she is in town right now, I am going to tell her I have no interest in being her friend and leaving it at that. I just feel so fucking betrayed, I mean I gave it all to that girl, tried to be so understanding with how busy she was. I did it all for her. She lost that, and one day she can just fucking realize that without talking to me.

1azh9t,7,2013-03-25,Dealing with a Narcissistic Aunt,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1azh9t/dealing_with_a_narcissistic_aunt/,"Hello! I'm in need of some advice... I hope it's okay to post here as this isn't about my parents acting this way, but rather my aunt. This is a wall of text (a really, really long one at that) so I apologize in advance. This is one of the first times I've ever tried to get this off my chest.

This has a long history. My aunt is the oldest of three, and my father is the middle child and my uncle is the youngest. Everyone in our family knows about how when my aunt was young, about five, she tricked my father into consuming dangerous household chemicals because she wanted to be an only child. My father had to have his stomach pumped multiple times because of it. Some of my family members joke that she was just a child and didn't know what she was doing, really. That was the extent of any physical harm that she caused that I know of. She is now closing in on 50 and has four kids of her own, while my father has four and my uncle has two.

Everyone knows that she likes to lie about her accomplishments. She will frequently say, ""oh, I was only three credit hours away from graduating college"" - when everyone knows that she went to college for one semester and then flunked out.

She constantly made her kids' childhoods and my/my sisters' childhoods a competition. ""Well, MY kids started walking at one year old!"" ""[X] was reading at only 2 years old."" ""[X] was the best on the basketball team, but the coach was horrible so I had him drop out.""

One time she unexpectedly dropped by our house right before Christmas saying that she had bought us a Christmas tree. We had not requested this, we did not want this, and my dad was quite furious she would just show up with a live Christmas tree and expect us to pay for it. He later said he was sure she just wanted to see how big/how many presents were under our existing tree.

Throughout my childhood, I remember many hurtful things - but I have always been the type of person to not make a fuss and to be passive, more or less. I've always been a very quiet person, I don't boast or brag about myself - and I've actually been told many times that I'm too hard on myself and that I tend to downplay my accomplishments.

I taught myself HTML and basic programming at a young age, and while at my grandparents', my dad mentioned how I had built my own website. My grandparents wanted to see it, so I brought it up on their computer. My aunt leans over, and says, ""what is this even... why would anyone look at this?"" I was only about 12 at the time, I didn't say anything although that made me feel very bad.

Fast forward to college... I got into an in-state public university for computer science. Every time we have a family gathering, she insists on bad mouthing it. It's certainly not a bad school, not the best but one of the two major universities in our state. 

I got into an internship out of state at a large metro area that I felt quite proud of. She'd badmouth the internship and the city it was in (""that is the most disgusting place I've ever been to"").

People tell me, ""oh, she's just jealous"". Two of her four kids dropped out of high school and obviously didn't go on to college, and one of them went to a small local college for a degree in psychology. She couldn't find a job so she is a manager at a store at the local mall. 

Is ""jealousy"" really an excuse to badmouth everything that I do?

Now, as her kids and me/my siblings are all about the same age, now we are all getting engaged and married about the same time - as was bound to happen. I started noticing an increase in the nastiness after I got engaged, which was right before I graduated college. Suddenly, her two sons were engaged as well. Suddenly, they had scheduled their weddings immediately before mine. Suddenly, they - their whole family - were acting angry at me, and when I would ask why, they would just say, ""there's nothing wrong, we're not angry at you"".

My sister gets married, and their family shows up long enough for the ceremony, to take some food, and then leaves. They post on Facebook later that they went to a bonfire at someone's house. They didn't even stay for their first dance or the cake cutting. My sister was very upset about this, especially about them blatantly bragging about what they left her wedding for on facebook.

So my cousin's, her son's, wedding rolls around and she comes up to me and asks very snottily, ""are you taking notes?"". This was and still is one of the rudest things I think anyone has ever asked me. At this point, my patience reserves are empty. I just say, ""Nope."" She walks away, and that was the only thing she said to me the entire night.

Then her other son's wedding arrives. She made a section for family, and another section for everyone else. She specifically has my uncle and his family sit with the family, and she leaves our family out of it. This made my father very angry, and my grandparents as well. It was completely obvious she wanted to make us feel excluded.

Now my wedding comes, the last out of the bunch. Her whole family had blown off my bridal shower, I get no apologies from any of them besides my aunt - who says, ""I'm so sorry, I just forgot"". Which was a very hollow and I felt offensive apology - couldn't she have at least said that something unexpected came up? Couldn't she have let me know ahead of time?

She completely blows off my wedding, too, saying that she was going to watch a volleyball game in a town about an hour away. I had been careful to send out save the dates and invitations months ahead of time, and I know they all knew when it was. My cousins come, but none of them speak to me.

At this point, I'm furious. I'm furious because I feel like they - my aunt in particular - have blown off my important life events and acted like I don't matter for the last time. I break down and talk to my dad at length about it, he says that she's just a horrible person, she won't ever change. 

Now my aunt starts posting on facebook with long tirades against atheists. I am an atheist, and she knows this. I do occasionally post things of a religious nature, but I am careful to use facebook lists to my advantage to only post the items for discussion purposes - but only for those who can handle it (she cannot so the list she is on is excluded from those posts).

My sister, who lives overseas, recently had a baby. She posts photos of the baby on facebook due to the fact that is the only way anyone can see him. My aunt downloads the photos of the baby, and reuploads them to her own facebook without my sister's knowledge. My sister has a history that involves stalkers and other nefarious things... and so she is very cautious with photos and privacy. My sister finds out about this, can't get my aunt to take them down, so she reports my aunt for stealing copyrighted content on facebook. My aunt's account gets disabled for something like a week as a result. My cousin immediately takes to social media and starts accusing me of being behind it and otherwise badmouthing me. At this point, I'm on my honeymoon - WHY would I be busy concerning myself with someone else's photos on facebook? My sister gets angry, gets in a fight with them all, and decides to block them all. My cousin then contacts my other sister and completely flies off the handle at her, saying that my aunt was hysterically crying about being blocked from facebook and how we were all being bitches.

It's at this point that I decide that I'm done with them all, too, especially my aunt. This is not normal behavior and after reading about narcissistic personality disorder I am convinced that she has it. I'm convinced that either her kids have it, or she has manipulated them to be like her little puppets carrying out her nastiness when she can't/won't do it herself. So I decide I just want to cut off all contact from all of them - they have been nothing but nasty to me, I've tried to ignore it and not get involved, but enough is enough. I block all of them on facebook. I use google voice, so I set all their numbers to get blocked (so they receive a 'this number is no longer available' message). I decide that I will do the bare minimum if I am forced to see them face to face at family gatherings, but that is it.

Then thanksgiving rolls around and my cousin goes so far as to pull the chairs away from the table that I am sitting at and arrange them around the other table so that none of them have to sit by me. This pisses me off greatly because it's just so incredibly CHILDLIKE - how can you not even be civil at THANKSGIVING?

Now I find myself loathing going to any family events. I don't want to be treated like shit. Now Easter is next weekend, and luckily my husband's family is having something at the same time and I'm already mentally preparing that ""sorry, can't go"" speech. But I feel awful doing this. My grandfather is in poor health, and I don't know how much longer he has. I shouldn't have to give up whatever time I have left with him because they treat me like garbage.

I just... I don't know what to do. Cutting off contact with them has been the best thing - I don't see the constant digs against me and my family on facebook. But I still have to deal with them face to face when we have family gatherings and I just don't know how to handle it. Part of me just wants to cut out that side of the family all together and never deal with any of them again. It makes me feel bad, it makes me stressed out. But I shouldn't have to do that - these are my grandparents, too - but that's how bad it is.

tldr; ... how do you handle narcissistic extended family members? and I'm seriously sorry about how long this is, just so much backstory..."

I work at an advertising agency in Canada doing business development (basically cold calling). The agency is medium sized with about 50 staff and a well established client base. I am fresh out of university but have been running my own marketing firm for about 2 years. Prior to that I had been making ads and coming up with strategy for about 5-6 years (started when I was 15!). I have done 2 internships in media/advertising agencies and used connections from there to land this job.

The management here was aware that I wouldn't be happy doing cold calls but I agreed to do it for 6 months (to better my phone etiquette) then switch to account management (what I really want to do!). I thought I'd be able to last but I really, really dislike it. The connection who got me this job is a mentor to me and I don't want to let him down by leaving. And I'm not sure how easy/hard it is to land an account job at another agency. 

I've been here a month and a half now and I truly feel like I am wasting all my experience with creating and managing advertising programs. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

I am doing my internship in Northern France and decided to order the Nexus 4 through the Playstore and get it delivered at the house of a co-worker of mine who lives here. I am from Belgium so the Nexus 4 is not available to me.

I ordered the nexus 4 on March 15th and the order was supposed to arrive on March 18th.  However I just got an email mentioning that my order got cancelled.


I fucked up by paying with my credit card but putting the adress of my co-worker as the billing adress (I suppose that is the problem)

Now Google requires me to send an identification of my identity/bank account before ""unfreezing"" it. However they also ask not to send a copy of my bank card. Any idea what verification I should send then?

The reason I put his adress as the billing adress is because I was uncertain my order would get declined if it was a Belgian adress.

As a final question, any idea how long it takes to sort this mess out? I know the website says 3 days but it also said 3-5 days for my order.

The whole Google website is also a complete mess to properly get in touch with somebody."

Please take the time to read and hopefully help out.

Last night, I went out with roommate for her birthday. When we got to the bar, heavily intoxicated white woman called me racist names regarding my Arab heritage and then it escalated to her striking me when I walked past her. I spoke with the bar/bouncer about it, and they wouldn't do anything other than to say to 'stay away from her'. But when walking by her again to get back to our table, she hit me in the face; so I defended myself. The response was for the 6'4 300+ Ib bouncer to pull me outside, threw me to the ground, and beat me up. My cell phone was a casualty of this battle.

I'm coming to you with this: most of you know that i'm a social work graduate student. Well, i'm a very broke social work graduate student and I use my phone for my internship (note: I work for free). My clients contact me via phone. I also use it for the organizing and fundraising work that I do for my clients as well. With the high cost of living in NYC, and working for free, my resources are already very exhausted, and I don't want my clients to suffer because of all of this.
I'm looking for anyone that may have anything to spare to help out. If you could donate anything at all, it would be incredibly helpful. Below is my paypal account email.

Also, if you think that you know someone that could be helpful, please pass this along. Thank you very much for your help.

1ay4rk,36,2013-03-24,My TL;DR of Budget 2013,illskillz,CanadaPolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1ay4rk/my_tldr_of_budget_2013/,"I thought I'd post this in this subreddit as well this year as usually better discussion is generated here!

I recommend reading Federal Budget 2013 in full as it is the one action plan our government sets out each year. I think we all have an obligation to read it - http://www.budget.gc.ca/2013/doc/plan/toc-tdm-eng.html. However, this TL;DR is the next best thing ;)

Just remember, the budget itself lauds the (conservative) government. I have tried my best to remain unbiased by giving an accurate representation of the budget &amp; it's claims (not a fair representation of all points of view/arguments/criticisms). The budget doesn't criticize itself.


**Budget Thesis**

This budget helps ensure we remain on track to balance the budget by 2015-16 by controlling direct program spending while not raising taxes or cutting transfers to persons/governments. Canada remains in the strongest fiscal position of all G7 countries. 950k net jobs have been created since the recession (5.7% increase) and 1.5 million net jobs have been created since 2006 (9.2% increase) - the best of all G7 countries. We are also the only G7 country that has more than fully recovered from business investment loss since the recession. But there remain challenges, particularly modest U.S economic growth and the euro recession. While controlling program spending, we seek to promote job growth by taking action to ensure that Canadians have the right skills for the jobs that need to be filled.

**Trade**

Lower prices for crude oil &amp; nat gas are reducing our gdp by 28b/year which would result 4b/year in government revenue
Since 2006, canada's export of goods to the u.s have decreased 5.7%. exports have increased by 57% to asia, 31 % to europe  and 36% to the rest of the world. canada will need to continue growing these export markets to foster economic growth.

Commodity prices have increase 4% since the fall update. both global crude oil prices &amp; prices of base metals have gained ground due to solid demand from emerging economies. canada has not reaped the benefits of these increases (particularly crude oil) since we rely so strongly on the U.S market to export to.

Overall prices received by canadian crude oil producers are no 6.5% lower than at the time of the fall update although the WTI price is up 5.4%.

To further the Beyond the border action plan, Canada will upgrade border infrastructure at various ports of crossing. 

Canada will also increase access to the FAST and NEXUS programs

**Immigration**

Improve foreign credential recognition for immigrants under the Pan-Canadian framework which will notify workers quickly in 14 occupations if their credentials are recognized, and if not what education is required to become accredited.

Reform canada's temporary foreign worker program to

1. Ensure that these workers are only used when Canadians cannot fill these jobs

 2. Require employers to increase recruitment efforts before relying on it 

3. Require employers to have a plan in which they will trasnfer over to a Canadian workforce over time. 

4. Ensure employers will no longer able to list fluency of a non-official language as a job requirement if they are using this program

**Taxation &amp; Financial regulation**

Close tax loopholes by: (see page 269-270 for full list)

1. Further limiting the amount of Canadian profits that can be distributed to non-residents as 'interest payments'
 
2. Enhancing corporate anti-loss rules 

3. Ensuring that derivative transactions cannot be used to convert fully taxable ordinary income into capital gains taxed at a lower rate.

4. Eliminating unintended tax benefits relating to leveraged insured annuities &amp; arrangements

5. Withholding GST/HST refunds to businesses that haven't provided CRA with necessary information 

6. Criminalize use and sale of software designed to help commit tax evasion. Closing of these loopholes will generate an additional 1.2b annually by 2017-18

Require financial intermediaries to report EFT's of $10000 or more to the CRA to help avoid tax evasion

Increase lifetime capital gains exemption to $800,000 and index to inflation

We will continue to push for a canadian securities regulator. If we cannot come to an agreement with the provinces, we will introduce legislation that will enable us to fulfill out regulatory responsibilities as decided by the Supreme Court. It would be much more effective if we had a national securities regulator, as all other industrialized countries have. But we will implement reforms designed to monitor, prevent &amp; respond to systematic risk in capital markets regardless of whether or not a national securities regulator is established.

1ay4ex,26,2013-03-24,My TL;DR of Federal Budget 2013,illskillz,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1ay4ex/my_tldr_of_federal_budget_2013/,"I recommend reading Federal Budget 2013 in full as it is the one action plan our government sets out each year. I think we all have an obligation to read it - http://www.budget.gc.ca/2013/doc/plan/toc-tdm-eng.html. However, this TL;DR is the next best thing ;)

Just remember, the budget itself lauds the (conservative) government. I have tried my best to remain unbiased by giving an accurate representation of the budget &amp; it's claims (not a fair representation of all points of view/arguments/criticisms). The budget doesn't criticize itself.


**Budget Thesis**

This budget helps ensure we remain on track to balance the budget by 2015-16 by controlling direct program spending while not raising taxes or cutting transfers to persons/governments. Canada remains in the strongest fiscal position of all G7 countries. 950k net jobs have been created since the recession (5.7% increase) and 1.5 million net jobs have been created since 2006 (9.2% increase) - the best of all G7 countries. We are also the only G7 country that has more than fully recovered from business investment loss since the recession. But there remain challenges, particularly modest U.S economic growth and the euro recession. While controlling program spending, we seek to promote job growth by taking action to ensure that Canadians have the right skills for the jobs that need to be filled.

Why are the interns acting differently and why is he treating Jo differently now?  She was literally a complete jerk 3 episodes ago.

Was this episode intended for one of the first?  Also, I'm watching through through this season and feeling unsettled by the character dynamics, especially Dr. Cox'.  Everything seems off.  Thoughts?

EDIT:  J.D. just told Jo that their patient was expected to die, and she responded with ""Sucks to be him.""  And then he gave a very surprised reaction to it.  Why would he be surprised by that when she was blunt the entire season so far?

EDIT 2: **Why** is Dr. Cox so obsessed with the fact he dislikes an intern that he's asking everyone why he hates him???  Very unlike Dr. Cox and seems like he grew a vagina overnight."

Just got a job (temporary internship, but still something!!), mixing up my workouts, fitting into clothes that were too tight a few months ago, etc. 

The most important thing about me losing weight right now versus last summer is that last summer I was so focused on losing weight that I completely cut out alcohol, had absolutely no cheat days, etc. I would sometimes even avoid hanging out with friends because the temptation to eat/drink would be so intense, and it's easier to just avoid that. Then, when I moved across the country for a job after getting down to 127 pounds, I started my drinking back up (and my tolerance hadn't even gone down, annoying) and lots of eating out/unhealthy. I stopped exercising because I was exhausted from working. I gained back everything and then some.

Now, however, I pretty much drink and cheat on my diet every weekend. I'm sure I could get faster progress if I didn't, but I don't want this to be a temporary thing like last time - it has to be a permanent change, and in order for that to work, I need to learn how to balance my social life and my health/diet. I think I'm doing a pretty good job of that now.

As for exercising, I'm too interested in everything, so I've been sporadically lifting, doing Tabata sprints and hill sprints, and doing long runs (10.5 mi this past weekend). I'd also like to try pole fitness, but for now I think I need to slooooow down and focus on just a few things before I spread myself too thin, otherwise I won't be able to hit my goals in weight lifting and running (body weight squats/half-marathon). My new job has a gym with barbells (!!) so I'm going to try to get in some weight lifting during lunch, and maybe some HIIT during shorter breaks on the stationary bikes.

Final note, it's amazing what eating right and exercising can do for your self-confidence and mood. I'm happy. That's the best part :)

Female
Age 21
5'5""
191 lbs
Have a fear of reaching 200 lbs. For some reason that just seems like the point of no return.
About a year ago I started losing weight for the first time ever, starting at 191 lbs. I lost almost 20 pounds running three times a week (c25k), keeping track of my calories (shooting for 1200/day), and not really drinking anything besides water. The very strict calorie limit also had a tendency to make me a fairly mean, angry person.

Then I turned 21 and didn't realize how many calories were in alcohol. I *almost* became an alcoholic. I dropped the no soda rule and drank a lot of rum and cokes.

The semester ended, I went on an internship, and I had trouble adjusting my low-calorie diet to the pattern of cooking for myself, going out for lunch with coworkers, and finding time to run. It didn't help that I was in Colorado, and lots of smoke from the fires there made it too hard to breath for running on some days. I did fairly well at the end of the summer when the fires were dying down, but I was still back up to 180 pounds.

Got back to school, started lifting weights, which made me want to eat a lot more. Got into the habit of doing so, which was fine until I stopped lifting weights.

Now I'm right back where I started. 191 lbs. Ugh.

I'm going to need to be on a more sustainable lifestyle plan if I'm going to do well this time, so I have a few guidelines to start:
-One soda a week, on Saturday during pizza night.
-Reduce slices of pizza on pizza night.
-Otherwise, drinks are water or coffee, but for coffee I must know exactly how much creamer and sugar is in it.
-I'll make my own breakfast/lunch/dinner, and have a general idea of the caloric content of my food, even if it isn't exact.
-Running 3x a week. Sign up for another 5k event.
-Bodyweight workouts or weight lifting 2x/week. It doesn't have to be long, but it has to be something.
-Try to eat less carbs (not eliminating altogether). Just not eating Korean takeout five times a week should help with this."

Then, something extremely stressful happened - a lot of uncertainty about the future. It was causing stress in both of our lives, but it was manageable. By this January, I had found out that I will be in a lot of debt, about 4 times as much as I thought that I would be by the time I graduate college.  I am not in debt because of college, or frivolous spending, it will mostly be a big fine for something that I will have to pay off. I never told my girlfriend about that, but it wasn't really anything that I could talk to anybody about. My solution was to just try super hard -- I have really great grades as a Computer Science student, so I took on a paid internship this semester, as well as taking three senior-level CS classes (and another filler class). I also got a full time paid internship in the summer. My reasoning was that if I work really hard from now until my graduation, I should be able to get a pretty decent paying job, and this debt would be paid off in no time for our future. Let's just say that I got in over my head. 20 hours a week is way more than I thought it was, and these CS courses have pretty big workloads. Most nights I get under 6 hours a week, including weekends, because I just have so much to do and no time.

About two weeks ago, my girlfriend took a trip to another city and ended up cheating on me (making out). I pretty much forgave her, because she was really wasted, told me right away, and I could tell that she was genuinely extremely sorry, and our relationship had been so good, and she had been so attached, I figured it did not mean anything. She continued talking to the other guy, though, and she would tell me about it. I broke up with her once she told me she talked to him a third time. It wasn't until this that we finally talked. She talked about how unhappy she was with me never having time for her anymore. About how neglected she felt, about how awful I made her felt. And she was totally right -- I truly didn't give her enough time, and nowhere near as much as I used to. She would come into the office and ask to see her, and I would be in the midst of a programming assignment and basically tell her to go away because I needed to finish this. She honestly had every reason to feel insecure about us -- she felt like I only cared about getting a good job after school, and that she wasn't my top priority.

Once I told her about the big debt that I have, and that I was trying to get a good job now so that we wouldn't have to deal with it later (we had talked about marriage, together for 3.5 years at the breakup), she started crying and said ""this would all have been different if I had known this -- I wish I didn't have to feel like you didn't think that I was beautiful enough, or that I was annoying to you for the past six months."" We were still living together at this point, just giving eachother more space. I saw something on her phone about her talking to him again, and things went even more downhill. She felt betrayed that I looked at her phone (she should have), but I only did it because I felt betrayed (because she was talking to somebody who she cheated on me with), and so we both had some issues. She is now moving out. However, the story does not end there.

We both talked about what we wanted out of the relationship after we decided that she should move out. I made it very clear that I am still interested in her, but that I am just too busy until the semester is over to give her the time that she deserves. I made it very clear that I wish that I had told her these things, and how much she does mean to me. She said that she feels the same way about me. We both agree that we need some space -- that we would stay broken up, and with such, test the dating market if we so wish. She said that she wanted me to experience other girls (not sexually) so that I would hopefully appreciate her more. I told her that I would not be happy with her dating other guys, but that it wasn't my business, not being her boyfriend after all, and that I would understand. We also said that we would occasionally see eachother, and if we both agreed, would go on dates from time to time -- very casual and start slow -- to see if this is truly what we want. 

I miss her like crazy. We have a date scheduled for this Thursday night, and I want it to be something that it can never be -- something to make up for all of the time that I neglected her. I'm trying to think of things that she has said that she wanted to do but has never done (such as a hot air balloon ride: she always wanted, but I am terrified of heights), but I feel like that is pretty extreme for a ""first date"".

Does anybody have any date ideas? I want it to be something personal to her, not something like dinner and a movie. Something that shows I care, but I don't know if I should do something too extravagant for a ""first date"", etc. Maybe even just advice on what kind of date would be useful.

tl;dr Just broke up with gf of 3.5 years that I lived with because I was super busy with school/work, but we are going on a date this week. Need date ideas, and what type of date might be appropriate if we are trying to ""take it slow"""
1b0pt8,0,2013-03-25,Am I (22) in an emotionally abusive relationship with my GF (22)?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b0pt8/am_i_22_in_an_emotionally_abusive_relationship/,"My GF and I have been together for over 5 years. As the relationship has gone on, I have slowly begun to feel powerless in the relationship. 

We currently live about an hour apart and normally see each other about once a week. It has become a common occurrence that when I go to visit her, she talks about how she doesn't think that I really care about her and that I don't really want to be there. She goes on about it until I feel so guilty that I will basically do whatever she wants to for the night/weekend.

This has started to steep into more phone conversations as well, with her guilting me over not visiting enough. She always wants me to come out to her, but I am a full-time student with a paid part-time job, and another unpaid internship (she works a full-time job in her city).

Last week was Finals week for me, and I had to move around some of them so that I could visit campuses of graduate programs I was accepted into. This was a big deal for me. Not only was I having finals with very little time to study due to moving them around, but I was also looking at some places that may change a lot about my future. At every step of the way, she would tell me I wasn't considering her and that I was being narrowminded because I was going to go do these things and wouldn't have time to see her.

I was flying into her city on the way back from one trip (I am in between to coast to coast trips for visiting campuses as I had to come home for another Final), and she expressed how bad of a person I was for not planning to visit her (despite a trip that involved red-eye flights, full days of campus events, and my need to study for my final). I finally gave in and agreed to have dinner with her when I landed. She keeps trying to get me to stay despite my need for sleep and studying, and eventually gives an exasperated, ""Well *I* tried.""

It seems that almost every time we talk now, I end up feeling like a bad BF and person in general. It is making me unhappy overall, but often I feel that I am just being selfish. Someone told me that it wasn't my fault and that she was emotionally abusive and I should leave. Is this the case, or am I just a shit BF?

**TL;DR GF makes me feel guilty for not being with her enough to the point that I almost always feel bad around her. Is it me, or is she emotionally abusive?**"
1b0p6x,0,2013-03-25,SICK and TIRED of jealous friends,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1b0p6x/sick_and_tired_of_jealous_friends/,"Sorry for the long rant.
Most people won't like what I have to say, but I have no one to say it to, as no one wants to hear it.

I didn't choose to be built like a Barbie (with bigger breasts). My best friend's mother warned her not to be friends with me as a child because the ""boys were going to be all over me and she would feel ignored"" (Fucking ignorant and shitty to tell your daughter.. but ok) I knew from a young age that I was ""beautiful"" because everyone fawned over my body. They still do. I realized the privilege that came with this ""beauty"" (people trusting you easily, boys linking you even if you are a twit, etc.) and decided I wasn't going to live my life based off of my looks. I started to volunteer in the 8th grade at a homeless shelter and found my passion for helping people. I will soon be finished Social Work graduate school that I worked very hard to get into. (Social Work is almost 100% women, so looks didn't help get me there :) )

Every. Single. Close. Female. Friend. I have ever had so far has ended up not being my friend anymore because of a few reasons: 

1. Their boyfriend's hit on me behind their backs... and when I tell my friend about it, they ALWAYS blamed me. ""You must have led him on! You are lying.... You slut!"" they say... and then want nothing to do with me. I wan't nothing to do with their scummy boyfriends! ( I am bi, anyway, and for a long time was only interested in women and didn't want anything to do with men!) They don't want their ""hot"" friend around to distract their piece of shit boyfriends (that cheat on them) so they abandon me, no matter how good of a friend I am and no matter how crappy he is.

2. They are jealous. I don't assume this, they always tell me. They are jealous because I am pretty and I work VERY hard to be successful and get good grades. I don't sit at home smoking pot and eating chips and playing video games all day. I save my money wisely, I splurge for things that I enjoy. I saved up to go to Bonnaroo VIP with my s.o. and for a new car and a new macbook because I don't go out every fucking weekend and spend $200 on booze like they do. I work two jobs, go to school and intern. I know that one day, I will be able to work a normal 9-5 but until then, I need to work and study my ass off. They think they are ENTITLED to a 9-5 because they have an associates degree and refuse to intern. I am dedicated, I don't give up, and I have given my life to helping others (NOT because I wan't to make myself feel good, but because the world is shit and I think I need to try and help out as much as I can before I go back into the earth) They go out of their way to insult me or subtly put me down when I am happy (Especially when in the company of others) because their lives suck (A few of them apologize after they do it, they know what they are doing and see how sad it makes me..). When I am happy or feeling successful (I usually keep it to myself and dress down so they don't feel bad) they like to attribute it to my looks, even things that have no fathomable connection to my appearance, like getting into college. 

I know, I know, ""just make new friends!"" but this has been going on ever since I outgrew a trainer bra in 5th grade. It is mainly my female friends, but it happens with (some) male friends as well. I am not perfect and I am not free of fault, but I am a loyal, dedicated friend, and I am fucking sick of people I care about hating me because they are so insecure that they can't get past my drive and appearance and return the gift of friendship to me. The only few friends I have been able to have are lesbians who I work with, because they don't feel the need to compete with me for men. I think this is the main driving issue here, to be honest. Hopefully, I will find more friends in grad school who have self esteem and who enjoy helping others as much as I do, and I can leave these clowns behind..... I just get so lonely. I guess I don't need anyone.
Thanks for hearing me rant. "
1b0mne,3,2013-03-25,Question about etiquette for adding to old tattoos.,monkey3,tattoos,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1b0mne/question_about_etiquette_for_adding_to_old_tattoos/,"I currently have 3 separate tattoos that I have had done by three separate people. I have decided that I want to go ahead an stop getting piecework done and I want to get a professionally done sleeve. All of the previous works was done by (interns? journeyman?) tattooists, and are probably not of a quality that /r/tattoos would consider up to snuff.

Now, the actual question part. would it be considered insulting to ask a quality professional to incorporate the existing ink into the design I would have them make? I ask because I like the tattoos I have now, even if connoisseurs would turn up their nose. I would definitely be willing to have the line-work updated or modified but essentially I want to keep the tattoos as they are an work them into a new design. I know that as a customer I have the final say, but I don't want to step on any toes."
1b55h7,1,2013-03-27,Everything just accumulates as a weight on my chest,burdurdurchick,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b55h7/everything_just_accumulates_as_a_weight_on_my/,"I don't know how posts are supposed to read, but I've got a lot messing with me and it's got a lot of backstory, so I'm sorry, this will be long. To skip backstory, skip the next five paragraphs and reference as needed.

I think I've been suffering from some sort of depression for most of my life.  I'm 27, female, weight's a bit higher than I'd like it to be but still acceptable on a BMI scale, and I feel like I look (I guess) somewhere between a 4-7 on a hotness scale depending on what kind of day I'm having. I'm the middle child of three, middle-upper class family (I'm actually not sure which one I technically fall into), the only girl, with a mother who's shallow and self-centered and only likes me when she's got a chance to take credit for something or profit somehow, and a dad who is benignly negligent.  None of us are close as we were pretty discouraged against interacting much growing up since my mother didn't have the patience for the inevitable squabbles that kids get into.  I'm pretty clearly the least favorite.  I'm socially awkward since my social life was enthusiastically discouraged/prevented.  I stayed grounded almost all of the time due to rebelling against the pretty intense controls I was put under.  But all in all, I was a good kid: I was lazy and disinterested when it came to schoolwork, but nobody in my friends group smoked or drank and I didn't get anywhere close to losing my virginity til 19, and a respectable amount of that can be attributed to me and not just my inability to have private time with anybody. I spent an awful lot of time hiding in my room reading and became an expert in daydreaming.  By the time I graduated high school, I had a pretty set life plan: I was going to train horses for a living, marry well by 25, and have one or two kids before or around 30.  I was goal oriented in the extreme, mercilessly tomboyish, and absolutely confident about the quality of my future self and life, despite no indications that I was the sort of person I imagined I was going to be.

I think the emotional negligence I had growing up has made me overly dependent on relationships.  I am not happy unless I have my one person to indulge in on a regular basis, but I think that has also been contributing to the failures of those same relationships.  My first serious one at 19 lasted 3 years, but looking back I was extremely emotionally needy and very selfish.  He wasn't the sort of person that could or would meet my probably excessive needs, and when I got frustrated enough, I finally cheated (about a month) and then left (I assure you, I felt plenty, plenty guilty and left him with all of my new-bought furniture, but never have had the balls to admit what I did).  The new guy didn't last long though; he almost immediately pushed me away (lesson firmly learned about cheating).  Reckless, and a bit desperate for love and attention, I moved across the country for a guy I'd met online. That lasted about two months, and then I had to come back home with my tail between my legs (lesson learned about online guys).  At this point I was pretty devastated, and that showed in my dating life.  Desperacy is not an attractive trait for a serious suitor and is happily and easily taken advantage of by those who are not so serious.  At this point I *needed* to prove myself to be better than the cheater I now thought of myself as, and each emotional rejection piled onto the other, I became a mess.  I've always, unfortunately, been dependent on my partner's sexual attraction to me as an indicator that I am attractive and loved, and now, in the lack of anything loving, I simply accepted sex instead.  I needed intimacy in some form, and sex was the best I was good enough for, so I took it, though only from guys who at least put several hours' worth of playing at getting to know me.  Flirting was fun, sex felt good, and those few hours that I was not alone kept me from staying a fetal position in the corner of my room contemplating the bottles in the medicine cabinet.  The need became so strong that for a short time I seriously worried that, while I'd joked about it before due to my high libido, I was actually becoming a nymphomaniac in the worst sense.  This thought did NOT help the depression.  It is truly terrifying to be sitting at work, depressed out of your mind, and feeling a truly overwhelming NEED to have someone fucking you.  Anyone.  

Around the same time, I a) decided it was time for a GOOD change, and registered to return to college (I had earlier had two years of junior college that I did not complete) and b) got involved with a married coworker.  It was the usual story: he was incredibly dissatisfied with his marriage, sexually alienated from his wife, who he was convinced was cheating on him.  He was fun to talk to, and we had crazy, crazy chemistry despite an undeniable age gap. I honestly, honestly hoped I would move away for college before we crossed the sexual lines that we were recklessly flirting with.  But I didn't make it, the sex was glorious, there was something amazing in the way I felt about him, and miraculously, it seemed, *it was mutual*.  Within a couple of months he separated from his wife and I was mostly openly his girlfriend. I was in love with this man in a way that had redefined my definition of the word.  But he was always guilty, and seemed ashamed and embarrassed either of me or being seen with me when we were out in public.  He refused to trust me, and quickly began accusing me of lying of all sorts of things. It became habit to preempt the accusations with full, irrefutable accounts of everything. The amount of sexual debauchery he believed me capable of, whether I was *actually* doing it behind his back or apparently incredibly tempted to, was astounding.  Mind you, we were several hours apart at this point, so that it was even easier to believe these things of me.  I was obsessed with this man, absolutely uninterested in anyone else, and have never been so certain of my entire future.  Every life goal I had became tied with in with this dreamy/fucked up relationship.  I neglected friendships because he got stressed out when I'd go hang out with people, and had to cut off every male friend I had because to everyone but this man, I was just a piece of ass (remember, as a tomboy, a strong and close portion of my friends were male). I loved, loved sex with him since it was unbelievably satisfying on so many levels, but I think my enthusiasm was damning me as a sexual deviant.  I learned to loathe my sexuality.  I pretty quickly lost count of the number of breakups we'd had, but every time, I accepted and even prompted the angry, intense verbal abuse and accusations because I knew that once he got it out of the way, he'd let up and take me back. I wanted to marry him so hard. This relationship matches descriptions I've heard of manic depression - the highs were so addicting that the miserably awful lows were acceptable.  Anyway, to keep from running on, eventually I couldn't accept any new limitations without losing every sense of self that I had, and cut it off.  

After that, more dating, including yet another manipulator who just seemed to be looking for an abuse target, and some weird Match.com dates. At this point, my guard was so high, my self esteem so low, that it was hard to begin even trying to emotionally connect with someone.  When I found out that my ex was already, within months, in another relationship with the word ""love"" being used comfortably, I broke.  The way he had apparently so easily moved on rendered every euphoric feeling and moment of the last almost three years a lie.  Classes became almost impossible to follow because my brain wouldn't shut up with every irony or now-bittersweet memory being replayed over and over. I lost even more friends who got tired of emotional me. One even treated me like I was going to begin ""preying"" on her male friends and made it clear she didn't want me near them, which baffled and surprised me to no end. I, on several occasions, *physically* nearly couldn't breathe while in public, due to fighting tears so hard that my throat closed up on me. I - and I have told *no one* about this - got drunk and took every Benadryl I had in an effort to hurt or kill myself one night, to absolutely no affect, since it seems 30-40 are recreational, hallucinogenic doses (I checked later) and I didn't have half that (laugh if you want, but I've always been scared of taking one too many Tylenol. I didn't comprehend how *much* overdosage would be necessary).  I sought help through campus psych services, but the ""therapist"" I was assigned seemed to be annoyed and impatient with my problems and I stopped going after three sessions - I guess there's only so many college brats you can listen to crying about boys before you don't want to hear it anymore.  I ended up leaning heavily on a male friend.  We were both traumatized by recent breakups so we paired up as mutual crutches so we wouldn't just date to fill the void and get more hurt. With him there, I stabilized and was kept occupied enough that I couldn't focus on miserable thoughts. When he left for an internship, I started crashing again.  

This was last June. Then I started seeing a much younger guy who was very often in the place where I studied.  I was taking an intense course and studying for many hours daily, and he started dropping in more and more frequently, and we'd go get lunch or hang out.  Eventually we were spending so much time together that, although I'd been avoiding mentioning it for fear of rejection, he brought up labeling us a couple, which I accepted.  We quickly were spending so much time together that I pretty much lived with him. We were both very guarded, though, and he especially shared very little about his emotions, though I wasn't much better. Despite the incredible stability with this actually wonderful and caring guy, a genuinely good person, who was a catch by every definition, I still fought a steady, heavy depression that liked to show up in every moment I had alone. I still had nightmares about my ex where I would beg and grovel for him to even acknowledge me, and he would either act like I didn't exist or treat me like shit (I never told this bf this). After eight months and a very cautiously executed official move-in, the L-word had still never been said and I began to fret in earnest. I had been very careful about not pushing relationship subjects since it had backfired so nightmarishly in the last relationship, and had been waiting for him to indicate readiness for the next step. But with graduation and post-graduation planning looming, I finally pushed the subject on Saturday.  While I'd approached this relationship with a refusal to get my hopes up, for fear of another horrendous crash after it failed, I was pitifully hopeful that he would admit that perhaps he *was* ready to take the next emotional step. After all, I'd spent the entire time carefully cultivating ""awesome girlfriend"" points with him and his friends.  Unfortunately, what I *got* was an admission that he wasn't in love with me. I made the obvious, immediate and inevitable decision to officially break up.

**Which brings us to present day**. I have nowhere else to go, so we're still living in the same room. The apartment doesn't have a couch and the roommate has the only other bedroom.  I still care about him so much, and I've spent so much time thoroughly enjoying his company and taking pride in the guy I was privileged to call my boyfriend, that it gnaws on me as a constant pain.  We still talk, and sleep snuggled up together, but all I can see is something I lost, another person I wasn't good enough for, another future snuffed out. I still crave touching him and being touched, but I can almost feel the intense reserve he has against this. He'll hug me and hold me, but by ending our relationship, I've regretfully ensured that touches are strictly platonic.  I have never been able to take breakups well, and I've never been able to shake the loss and disappointment of the previous ones, so this is just another brick (boulder?) in the wall I'm stuck carrying. It's heavy, it *feels physically heavy* and it's with me everywhere I go.  I thankfully don't have any lecture classes in this last semester, but I'm still prone to finding myself staring off into blank misery for way too long.  I try to do things, try to accomplish tiny goals like finally picking up and sorting laundry off the floor (I've been dangerously close to being out of underwear for a week, each clean pair found is a tiny miracle), but I seem to only manage a few moments of momentum before I lapse into blankness again.  I can't even really cry, it's not a sharp pain, it's just so heavy and so overwhelming.  I've been thinking regularly of hurting myself since the previous breakup (though I've tried to hide my depression from my most current ex - nobody likes a sad person), and it just looks like such a welcome relief. I think about it many, many times a day. I don't trust people anymore, I don't trust my value as a person anymore. Goal oriented as I am, I have only one goal for my life that hasn't died off - to have my own intact, loving family with a caring husband and one child who would be the world to me - but I feel nothing but despair that it will ever happen  I feel like men think I'm fun and attractive and perfect for a temporary fling, but never the girl to marry.  I am so broken into so many pieces that I have no idea how I'm still here.  I don't feel like there's any relief for me - I don't even get the sexual release that I used to get.  After the mind-blowing sex that I had with my ex and the way I was made to feel about my sexuality, everything about sexytimes has lost its luster.  Everything feels disappointing.  Obviously, the golden rule of sex is to absolutely never let on about disappointment except through absolutely positive suggestions, and I try to *never* do anything that would harm a partner's sexual ego, but my last few partners seem to have sensed it anyway, and I've been unable to miss the issues it's giving them.  I'm scared I'm stuck in an endless cycle and I'll be the bitter old lady with too many cats and too many shoes with nowhere to wear them.  I desperately don't want to grow old alone.  The idea of being frail and old is unappealing to begin with, but being that way with no family to visit your lonely ass in the shithole of a nursing home you're stuck in is a personal nightmare of mine.  I feel like my only mark on the world will be my hypothetical child, who I vow that I will raise better than I was and set them up to not have the problems I have had. But that takes two, and finding that second is proving impossible.  I feel like I wasted my prime dating years on an abusive asshole who I still, STILL have intense cravings for and who I will always have to be ashamed of. Now it's just a short and painful march towards 30, which I have to convince myself is NOT the beginning of middle age, and then on towards 40 and infertility and the end of everything I've ever wanted.  I have no hopes left that I might manage anything in the next 10 years that I haven't managed in the last.  I feel like I've become such a bitter and guarded and annoyingly hopeless person that I can't even imagine relationships getting off the ground.  It all feels hopeless, like it's all over already. I feel like I should get actual, professional therapy and that it will take anti-depressants to neutralize the world for me enough to stand back up again, but since I'm currently on my parents' dime - they have been shitty parents but I am grateful that I won't be saddled with college loan debt - I'd have to go to them about it first, and I'm pretty sure I'd just get bitched at for being so expensive.  I don't have medical insurance, haven't since I turned 26 and got pushed off my parents' insurance.  Please give me hope, some kind of hope, Reddit."

I'm sure i sound like any other 21 year old and maybe i do, but i feel like i might be different.

I work in a sales job that i can move up in, but i just dread going to work.  I fantasize about just quitting on the spot almost every day.  But then i think ""what would i do""  and i can't really answer that question.  I have a few ideas but nothing concrete and they all seem daunting.  I have this fear that I'll be on my deathbed and look back and think ""why the hell did i waste all that time doing something i hated?""

Despite having a job i hate, from the outside looking in my life looks pretty nice.  I just bought a home, and when i tell people about that they can't believe i bought a home at such a young age.  I don't think it was very difficult but i guess I'm just good with money?  I also have the best friends in the world.  Friends that i can talk to about anything, that would do anything for me, and that will be there for me till i die.  I go to therapy every week; not because I'm sick or crazy but because i want to better myself and strengthen my relationships.

So a lot of my life sounds great, but i feel so unsatisfied with my day to day life...mainly with a career, and the future.

The few ideas i have for a career are going back to school to become a teacher, or a computer engineer(programming), or IT guy.  But for some reason i have a fears behind all of them.  A consistent fear is that I'll spend 4+ years and $40k+ and then be right back where i started.  I went to college for a semester when i got out of high school and i just loathed it.  I hated the teachers, and the idea that you cram as much info into your head for the test just to get an A and then forget everything you learned.  There is a part of me that wants to go back to school and a part of be that just fucking hates that idea.

I'd love to be able to get into a career that i enjoy without college but from my experience trying to volunteer, intern, etc makes it seem impossible.

If anyone has any suggestions, comments, criticisms I'd love to hear them.

TL:DR: 21, just bought a home, have great friends, generally a happy life.  However i feel like my life and career are going no where and i have a huge fear that I'll regret wasting time on things i hate.

I'm a second year college student, and pretty sure I'll be declaring my math major come next semester. This makes me think more about my career plans, what to do for internships, what courses to take, etc.

I wanted to see what people do with their math degree and what kind of preparation or experiences helped you get there.

As far as I can remember in high school, my mom used to come to my room after midnight and scream at me telling me I'm a loser and that I will never go anywhere in life. She did this many, many times and the more she said it the more I believed it. The first 2 years of high school I barely talked to anyone, and then from junior year and out I tried to not give a fuck. The tension between me and my mother grew worse as the days went on. But now, I'm in college and I'm 20 years old, and I am still very negative towards myself. The first year of college I had many friends, but as the months went on those friends grew distant from me and were no longer my friends. When my sister was accepted into a very prestigious school, my parents just made me feel much worse about myself and my sister did as well. When summer of 2012 had arrived, I landed a job and internship and I was proud of myself, and also a very loving boyfriend. I felt so happy for the first time in years, but when school started again it came back to me, the pain. My mother moved to Saudi Arabia, and she still made me feel like nothing even from half way around the world. Fall 2012 semester, I lost more friends and I just started to hate the human population more and more. I just can't see anything in a positive P.O.V. and I've tried and nothings worked. I refuse to take anti-depressants because that's not who I am. I tried smoking herb and it helped me but I recently stopped and it made me remember how much I hated everything. For the past 2 months, nothing would make me more happy than just ending everything but the guilt of hurting my family and my boyfriend's feeling is far worse and I don't know what to do. I recently saw my mother for the first time in 6 months and she told me the only time she saw me smile was seeing my boyfriend and that made me realize how unhappy I am. I can't find anything I like about myself. I literally don't know what to do and the emptiness is eating at me every day. Someone help please. "

Here's some quick back story to help explain what I'm trying to accomplish.

So I work as an intern at a high end computer training facility that is very well know and radda radda but I'm just an intern....to the operations department which is basically just being a secretary (not saying its bad to be a secretary, its just not ideal for me).

Recently, I've started getting into programming and it seems awesome (My work place actually teaches it but only for admin uses, which I still plan on taking) and I wanted to completely computerize 2 of my daily tasks. 

Which are:
(1) going onto ""Website A"" and cross checking the information to make sure it matches up with ""Website B"" none of it is hard and any monkey can do it, but it's just incredibly tedious

(2) I am in charge of making the certificates for the people who take some of our classes and attend them and mail it to them. what I want to do is, basically open program, then go through classes for ""x"" date open each class that appears and then click on a certain phrase (Roster) and click on another phrase (that opens all the attendees names on a blank certificate on a bunch of microsoft word files that we then open each one individually and print) and its all very tedious

What program should I download and where can I start learning how to make a program that can do that for me


Thank you to whoever read that huge wall of text!

1b2tip,3,2013-03-26,Please help me. Boyfriend and I are drowning in a sea of troubles and we feel helpless,Valence_Electrons,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1b2tip/please_help_me_boyfriend_and_i_are_drowning_in_a/,"I don't even know where to begin with all of this.

My boyfriend ""Y"" and I have been dating for a total of 3 years. He's 20 and I'm 19. We go to the same STEM university, him for computer science and me for chemical engineering. We'll be moving into a lovely apartment next fall, along with 3 other people. We've already lived together before when he needed to get out of his parents' house, so I know it's going to be nice. Why I'm writing this post: My boyfriend has a lot of problems, and they're becoming hard for both of us to try and handle..

1. My boyfriend has depression. We are sure of that; he's seen a mental health professional, and it runs in both sides of the family. His mother has it and is taking pills for it, his biological dad has it and as far as I know, is not taking anything for it. ""Y"" is not on anything for it yet. He doesn't like the idea of medication, and was reluctant to even start a spasm-controling medicine to help him with his IBS. I understand his aversion to depression medication; a lot of the side effects seem really scary. His mom has really been pushing him to get on the pills she is on, but the way she asks him is not productive. His depression is aiding in a lot of other problems.
2. Dental work = hell. He is terrified of the dentist. This is mostly due to childhood experiences where he would cry and cry, his mother would yell, and they would end up leaving the dentist after 2 hours of this. His mother was not very stable when he was younger (divorce, anger management issues, depression) but she is much, much better now. Anyways, I feel so awful for ""Y"". Because of his childhood fear of the dentist, he never got his teeth flouridated or whatever, and so he's had awful dental problems. This runs on his dad's side of the family. He's needed 4 cavities filled, after which his dental hygene became REALLY good, but he's still needed 2 root canals, and will need fillings. this leads into the next part..
3. He had a seizure when he was getting his fillings. How awful. It was new years eve. I sat along side him after too many blood samples and tests. It was so bad, I wanted to cry after seeing all the pain he was in from the needles and his aching back and head. His family had absolutely 0 history of seizures. ""Y"" is now even more terrified of going back to the dentist to finish his fillings. He can't drive until July, by law. Stressful. After much deliberation, the neurologist recommended him anti-seizure medication. He's terrified of being so dependent on a drug.
4. IBS. Enough said.
5. Not doing well in school, due to all the problems listed above + bad childhood. He has no motivation, but if he doesn't pass this year, he will have to owe 25000 and may not be able to move onto next year. He's doing well in most of his current classes, but need to finish a lot of work from last semester that he got extended due to severe stomach pain (IBS).

It's so much to handle. I love him. We are both at our wits end. ""College is the best time of your life"", WOW, what bull shit. Anyone who said that should be shot in the head. I'm so mad. We're the most stressed out in our lives, there seems to be no solution to anything. 

He recently said he thinks he needs to take anti-depression pills, if only to stop people from thinking he's not doing all he can to better himself. This goes against his values, and whether you agree with that or not, please understand that inner turmoil. I'm scared for the side effects. I'm so fucking scared and he is too.

We're both seeing counselors at our school. I'm doing well in school, but I've always enjoyed school and have always been very good at getting good grades.

My boyfriend is smart. SMART. He is such a fast learner, but once he learns it, he has no motive to do the homework related to it. He doesn't want to be here in school, but he didn't see any other option that was viable. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, so unless that's the absolute only advice there is, please tell me something else. I feel like he and I are a strong couple; we have good communication, respect, all of it. We're both just so worn out.

Neither of us got any internships for the summer, and that was a huge blow. We feel terrible and hopeless.

Sorry, this is really long. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm worried for ""Y"". I just want things to fast-forward to where we're 26 or something, and past all of this bullshit. I am so resentful of everyone who gets to have fun or gets a co-op/internship, while we have to deal with all of these problems that just are fucking CRUSHING. We need so much more money to pay for all of these things than we have. Seriously, money would help so much right now. Dental work, apartment, he has no insurance, SCHOOL. ugh

Ramble over. Please someone, have an answer

Streeter: Okay, what?

Amir: That's right! I once shot 3 holes in one in a row it wasn't an accident either, the killing.

Julie: You *monster*.

Amir: I am a monster. On the golf course I take no prisoners. Also I will never un-see that child's face. Every blink is a reminder and every time my eyes aren't open she's just in my minds eye, taunting me. (Makes a scary face). *Bleh*.

Michael: How could you do that?

Amir: How could *you* do that? Crystal Skull? We saw that, it was garbage! I killed a child? (Amir starts crawling to where Michael is sitting across the table). Yeah, well you killed a franchise!

So like the title says I'm doing study abroad for a year.  My major is computer science so I have had trouble meeting single and attractive women.  I could find women that were single but I did not find attractive. I could find women that I found attractive but had a boyfriend.  I did find two girls that I liked that weren't taken.  Asked one out got rejected, talked with the other one and we really did not have that much in common.  Doing an Internship right now at a large IT company and hanging out with local computer nerds, so I don't see myself really meeting any more women, as computers are a global sausage fest.

Thinking about sending this girl I like a post card with something like, ""I want to take you out on a date when school starts in the fall.  You free then?  Email me.""

So Reddit, thoughts?"
1b74hy,2,2013-03-28,I feel like a new person today.,tr1ppn,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1b74hy/i_feel_like_a_new_person_today/,"I would just like to take a moment to express how good it feels to see some good in myself and begin turning my life around. I am working on a better me for the first time in my life, and it is wonderful. I cleared my credit card debt at the bank today, and such a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders that I was able to see a lot of different things for what they were and realize what was going on. I know many have it much worse than I, and I wish the absolute best for you. Maybe this post will be a moment of clarity, or maybe you'll just downvote it into oblivion. I don't care. I'm just glad I can express myself.

A year ago, I was working part time as an IT intern, graduating college in 2 months with absolutely no job prospects. I couldn't make rent (got a loan from parents), car was about to be uninsured (another loan from parents), and I was living off of credit card and checking advances. I maxed out my credit card at $2,000, paying the minimum and then spending it again, and went over my limit for about 4 straight months. It was getting very ugly very quickly.

I managed to get hired on a limited term contract where I was an intern for 6 months starting last June. I busted my tail all summer trying to convince them to keep me employed. I got no paid time off, making things somewhat difficult. I moved in July to a new apartment with a friend who was going to split the rent. He moved out 2 months later, and the only way to avoid paying double the rent I budgeted for, or living with someone on craigslist, was to make a new arrangement in which I am paying 85% of rent, and all of the bills. With all of the legal holidays in November and December, I lost a large amount of pay, and continued to bounce back and forth between credit card and living off of 2 sandwiches a day.

I caught a break about 2 months before my end date at the limited term contract, when someone transferred out of a position, and I was able to get it. I also managed to get a small raise. Two months later, I got hired full time, with benefits and vacation, and a nice raise. Things were beginning to look up, but I was still hurting from the lost wages. 

Tax season came around, and I planned on clearing my credit card (or at least trying) with the money if I was able to. My step-dad (who does my taxes) called to let me know what my return was going to be. It was WELL over my remaining balance for my credit card, leaving some money to spare. I was floored.

My tax returns came yesterday and today. I was able to triple the amount I had in savings, get a hair cut for the first time in about 4 months, pay to have my car repaired, buy new contacts, and, most importantly, I FINALLY PAID OFF MY CREDIT CARD!!! I need to call tomorrow to cancel the card, and I will be cutting it up as soon as I get home after work tomorrow. I could not be more excited.

All of this has allowed me to go from not knowing how I was going to eat to being able to pay all of my own bills (including student loans), eliminate my credit card debt, and save money. It's a great feeling knowing that I can live independently and manage my finances. I have ALWAYS been terrible with money, which is how I got into this mess in the first place. Today begins a new chapter.

Not only have I managed to get my finances in order, but I got engaged to the love of my life and my best friend 3 months ago, and have been working to plan a wonderful wedding for Summer 2014. My fiancee just got accepted into graduate school, has an interview for a job tomorrow, and will be moving in with me in 2 months.

I also started changing my diet so that I could be a healthier person and enjoy my life about 4 months ago, and I managed to lose 20 lbs just by eating better. I recently started a workout routine to get my heart/body in better shape, and I already feel fantastic. Coming from someone who was so depressed and upset with the world that I attempted suicide a few years ago, I am turning my life around in every possible way I can find, and working on a better me for the first time in almost 24 years. It feels amazing to finally see some good in myself. I just wanted to share the turnaround that I've had in my life in hopes that someone may see it as a moment of clarity and inspiration in their own life to begin working on a better them. "

I don't know what I'm doing typing this on reddit instead of getting back out there, especially since I don't post on many subs often, but I found this sub, so I'm going to post.

Hello fellow thespians!  Let me tell you my story.  I have long since graduated college, where I majored in (among other majors and minors) theatre arts.  I spent many hours back stage, but even more onstage.  Much of my education was focused on either acting, writing, or producing.  I enjoyed making props, and sets, and to this day I'm an avid playwright (unpublished, obviously).  However, it's been just about three years since I've been onstage.  I haven't had a voice lesson in almost as long, and my last work in theatre ended sourly because of an internship with a company that I saw was being run into the ground, and I decided  it wasn't for me.

Now, it's some time later.  I'm back living on the east coast, after some travel, and find myself able to revisit the reasons I wanted to be onstage in the first place.  Here's where I get worried, and suppose the reason I am posting: in my time without theatre I have become rather... illustrated.  Tattoos and piercings are a rather big part of my life.  I'm not saying that I am covered to the point of not being able to hide them, but a full ""sleeve"" and scattered pieces make me more tattooed than the average person, let alone actor.  I can tell you I am a good actor... not the best, there's always work, but I do the work, and the text, and it shows.  

My big fears are: will it be like riding a bike? I've been steadily reading plays, and practicing monologues for fun. Also, just how bad will tattoos inhibit my ability to be cast?  I live in a very progressive city/area, so I know that I have opportunity regardless, but is there still that stigma around tattoos in acting? Lastly headshots, and resume.  I need a new headshot, which won't be so bad, I know a lot of professional photogs, but my resume is pretty much worthless now I feel like.  What do I add to say what I've been doing for this time?

Any help, advice, and encouragement is very welcome."

Can I get some perspective or advice?",dreamsaremadeof,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b5ph5/i_22f_am_finding_it_impossible_to_come_to_terms/,"background -- I have been dating him for a little over 7 months, and we'd been friends for about 5 months prior to that. We are both in college in our third year, and this is our first serious relationship. I know I don't have experience, but I feel like we really click: we are similar in our attitude towards finances, religion, humor, friendships, and family relationships and values. Many of our friends are also couples and we have a lot of fun going out together to bowling, karaoke, bars, dining, and exploring. All in all, I have been so happy these past few months, and so lucky. 

Problem -- I will be graduating on time in one year, so spring of 2014. He will be graduating early one semester, so fall of 2013. The catch? Although we are the same heritage/ethnicity, I grew up in the States, while he is an international student and will be returning home to Hong Kong, where his parents currently live, after graduation. 

I like to think we are both realistic people. For international students on visas, it is nearly impossible to find a good job out of undergrad in business (which is what we are both studying), and he already has an internship back home for this summer that he will hopefully be able to turn into a full-time job after he graduates. I, on the other hand, will be interning in New York this summer (we had a similar arrangement last summer where he interned in Asia and I in the States, so nothing odd about this, and we both handled being faaar away from each other for months pretty well). I have always wanted to work abroad in Hong Kong-fell in love with the city when I visited it once in high school-but at this point this is just a dream and I have yet to make progress towards it, and cannot realistically put my hopes in it. I know anything can happen, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that after he leaves, I really don't see how or when we would be able to see each other again. 
I'm not sure how he feels about it since we haven't talked about it in depth (this is a conversation that I am dreading because I'm afraid I'll just burst into tears and turn in a useless pile of blubbering mess...any advice?), but I know that he also must dread the inevitable. This has been weighing on me a lot recently, even though I try to avoid thinking about it (I know, bad), to the point where, on the nights when we are not spending the night together (usually 3-5 nights of the week), I let myself get sad to the point of crying myself to sleep (I have literally never done this in my whole life, for anything). This whole thing is so bizarre to me because I have always been the solid one, the strong one, but I just feel like it's tearing me apart and I don't know how to deal with it. Has anyone ever been in this situation before, and do you have any advice for me? 

**tl;dr Bf is graduating one semester early this winter and going back to his home country to work (which is completely understandable and I support that 100%). I have no way of ensuring that my own dreams of working abroad in said country will come true, and cannot otherwise see how this relationship can continue no matter how much I want to. I am depressed, sad, frustrated, helpless.**"

&gt;Land internship at DC defense think tank, they want me there immediately

&gt;Scramble to find apartment in DC

&gt;Locate lodgings via craigslist

&gt;Four bedroom luxury apartment being rented by some college kids

&gt;Rent is reasonable, people seem okay

&gt;My room shares a wall with Jennifer, wildebeest in training

&gt;Her room looks like it was acquired by consuming its last occupant, a fourteen year old girl

&gt;Jennifer may in fact be Kirby

&gt;Whatever, I'm only sleeping here

&gt;Come home one day, chat with roommates

&gt;Jen has a date lined up. She met the guy on craigslist.

&gt;Recently single, I ask if this is a good way to meet people in DC

&gt;Jen shows me her posting

&gt;Extremely sexual. Might as well read ""buy me dinner and you can fuck me""

&gt;Myspace angles, Myspace angles everywhere in the photos

&gt;Seriously, it's just her eyes, cleavage, shitty angles to hide her corpulence

&gt;Naive me questions Jen

&gt;""Why all the weird angle pictures? Why not just put a pic of you?""

&gt;""Oh posting_about_sex, you're so innocent. Everyone does this. Besides, once they see me in person, they're so horny they're not gonna walk away. It's just an easy way to make a booty call.""

Seriously, that was her tactic. She just set up dates and made it clear they could fuck her if they bought dinner. By the time they showed up and found out she was a lying fat fuck, they were too invested to walk away. It was bait and switch TO THE MAX.

&gt;Whatever, enjoy your date

&gt;""Oh I will, teehee. Sorry if it gets noisy later.""

&gt;I grab drinks with some work people, turn in early

&gt;Go to sleep.

&gt;Awoken about 2 am by Jen's door slamming. Can hear her voice and a guy, both very drunk.

&gt;A few minutes pass, I start to drift off.

&gt;A sound starts, like someone is riffling a pile of bologna like a deck of cards on top of a pile of mayonnaise

&gt;Oh God no, no no no no no.

&gt;Keeps getting louder. I can hear grunting and heaving. Squeaking. Weird gushy noises. Squealing. It's like Deliverance in there.

&gt;A sound like a foul tuba mixed with a fog horn starts

&gt;It's Jen screaming in fatstacy while she's getting plowed.	It's like James Earl Jones having a fatgasm

&gt;The aural trauma stops.

&gt;I fall back asleep. Wake up early because lol alcohol. Get up to grab some water.

&gt;Emerge into hall at same time as Jen's pork tenderizing date. Looks like a fairly normal guy. 

&gt;He's carrying his shoes.

&gt;Walkofshame.jpg

&gt;He looks hung over, pale, and shaken. Makes eye contact before heading for the door

&gt;Dead, empty eyes, like a sex abuse victim.

&gt;Glance in Jen's now open room.

&gt;There's a butt plug on the floor. There's brown on it.

&gt;Get my water, go back to bed.

&gt;Jen brags about the hotty she bagged last night at breakfast.

&gt;Later complains that guys never call her back

I lived with these people for three months before they threw me out for being antisocial."

1b7yz9,4,2013-03-28,Sophomore physics major with an interest in Comp Sci: where to go?,[deleted],Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1b7yz9/sophomore_physics_major_with_an_interest_in_comp/,"**Hey r/physics!**

**I'd really appreciate any suggestions or perspective that you knowledgable and experience people could give me!! I've seen a lot of great advice on this sub, I'd be very grateful for any help you can offer!  The important stuff is bolded, if you want more details, I've probably included far too many of them, but ask me as well, of course.**

I'm a **sophomore physics major** at a very good US university.  When I came in, I was entirely planning to do academic research in physics (probably astrophysics).
I did astrophysics research last summer, and had a great time.  I really enjoy the subject matter and the work I was doing (a lot of hardware stuff) was very fun.

I've taken quite a bit of the coursework, and I'm doing fine in it so far: a mix of B+s and As.  Some of it I've really enjoyed, and other parts have been more frustrating than interesting.  My school offers a BS in Physics and an Intensive BS in Physics.  I'm currently on the Intensive track, but it's easy to switch down, and the BS still includes a senior thesis project, and quite a few advanced physics classes.

However, this year I've started to think that **academia really isn't where I want to end up**.  I'm concerned about the lifestyle aspects: that I'll have 6-8 years of grad school, then another 6 of postdocs, and then a desperate search for anything that could lead to tenure track, and then several more stressful years until I (hopefully) get tenure.  It feels like I'm not going to have a real job until I'm at least 35.  I want kids and a family though, and especially as a woman, that adds a whole additional layer of complexity.

Additionally, it seems like my professors spend most of their time applying for grants.  While I realize that it's necessary, and that they do make research decisions and have great, inspired ideas too, I really don't think I want to spend so much time doing that.

**Instead, I've become quite interested in programming, and also applied physics/engineering.**  Through physics, other research, and personal interest, I've had some programming experience.  This semester, I'm taking Introduction to Programming, though it turns out I've significantly underplaced myself.  I had never used Java before, so I'm obviously learning a lot of syntax, but I really don't think I've learned a single new *concept* this semester, and my grade is currently over 100%.  Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that I don't have much experience, but I'm not quite as much of a beginner as being in Introduction to Programming would imply.

**I really enjoy the programming.**  I've been making a lot of projects up for myself, and I'm doing Udacity and other online classes, and I feel like I'm making progress personally, if not in the class. **It's sparked an interest in doing this long term, which looks like a really compelling alternative to academia.  My other academia alternative would be physics research in industry, which I don't have much exposure to, but I believe that I'd probably find it interesting and engaging** (depending on exactly what the work was).

In figuring out my course schedule for the next two years, I've been focussing on including CS classes.  **With the Intensive Phys major, I can get get 6 of them in, which is about half of the degree.  However, if I were to switch to the BS in Physics, I can get 10 classes and the BA in CS.** My school doesn't offer minors or certificates or any other more halfway solutions.


**My question: with an uncertain career path (tech startups, physics industry, software development, engineering grad school, and possibly academic physics are all under consideration), is it better to have a Intensive BS in Physics with a handful of computer science classes, or a BS in Physics and BA in Computer Science?**


TL;DR: see the bolded stuff.

P.S. If anyone has still-available summer internship suggestions in applied physics or programming for a kid with a bit of experience and a lot of enthusiasm, let me know!"

I'm currently taking a gap year from college to solve some personal issues.

Luckily, I have since acquired an internship, with the possibility of pay in the future. But currently no income or steady stream of it.

I'll come out with it. Currently, I have about 1k in the bank, which is supposed to support me in the short run at least. The only problem is that I need to find a place to live for 5 months from September to December. Most places in NY are out of my price range for that. 

I am not a drinker, smoker, and I don't own any pets. I cook for myself if I have access to a stove. I am not noisy, although I need to use the computer a lot, so internet would be nice. I will most likely be working a second job, if my current internship turns out to be a dead end.

I am totally fine with crashing in a living room or something. It would be currently equal to the situation I am currently in (I'm living on a couch and then heading back to my parent's place for the summer) The reason that I am not living with my parents in this time is because I'm trying to live on my own.

Any help or just suggestions would be appreciated. I'm not looking for monetary assistance, but getting a possible paid internship possible in either the Computer industry or Finance or legal field would appreciated.

College student on gap year, looking for room/couch to rent for 5 months from September to December in NYC.

Currently i am studying a international relations degree in the U.K. However i was wondering how i can spread publicity for this organisation, via journalistic means. 
I am inclined to work for an agency like reporters without borders in the future so this can give me a bit of a test to see what work as a journalist may entail. 

I have a rough plan but i need some extra advice on how to join the dots together. 

1) What would be the best means to report and record down the events i see in Palestine and the work this organisation is doing, Blog ? Video Blog ? I have a contact in Reporters without Borders, could that be a way to further publicise ? 

2) Any other tips in terms of content, what is unique and different i can offer if anything ?? 

3) Is there any general advice for me, from those who have had experience in the field. 

4) Overall i want to serve this organisation as i have a lot of respect for the man who runs it and aim, but also for personal reasons i believe this can give me vital work experience.

1baqoy,7,2013-03-30,I think I'm losing my best friend.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1baqoy/i_think_im_losing_my_best_friend/,"She (and I) has been a Christian for pretty much the whole time we've been best friends. That's not the problem here.

For most of this time, she's been more religious than me. That's not the problem here.

We always said we'd never be like judgemental Christians who give all other Christians a bad name. You know, the ones who criticize everyone else behind their back for doing anything ~~they~~ the Bible disagree with, eg, having sex, being gay, swearing, everything really. Or the Christians who just tell you to ""pray about it"" whenever you go to them for help instead of properly listening. We always said that we'd never be like that.

The problem is, at the start of this year, she started an internship at her church. Now she seems to be turning into one of them. I've been going through a bit of a tough time lately (family stuff) but a few weeks ago I was talking about my guy problems and she told me that I ""need to put boys out of my mind and focus on God."" and that I ""just don't seem to be getting it"". Never mind that she likes some guy from her church and talks about him all the time.

A friend of ours gave up Nutella for Lent. She went vegan for Lent. She complains about how what he did was easy to give up, while *she* rearranged her whole diet.

Then last night we were talking about stuff and she goes on this massive rant about people who claim to be Christians and yet go and have pre-marital sex (and she was talking about a couple who's been together for nearly 2 years. Yes by Christian standards it's wrong, but it's not like they've been sleeping around) and how they need more integrity and are giving the wrong impression about what Christianity is supposed to be about.

Then she goes on this massive rant about how oral sex is degrading and how she's surprised other girls don't think girls who do it are tramps.

I don't know this person any more. I've tried to tell her that she's acting like the type of person she's always despised, but she won't listen. I want the girl back who I used to laugh with for hours, have intelligent conversations and talk about guys. I want the girl back who was accepting of everyone despite their past or what they do in the bedroom. I miss you. The old you. And I want to know who the fuck you are and what you did to my best friend."
1banx4,9,2013-03-30,"It's done (Very ranty, no TLDR)",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1banx4/its_done_very_ranty_no_tldr/,"So I was in a 4 year relationship with my girlfriend, and we broke up just last night. We live together in an apartment and I can't sleep, so I'm typing this out.

She was acting cold/quiet around me for the past month. While she was at work yesterday, I checked her Facebook to find a conversation she has been having with a guy she met 'networking' in her media program. She has been preparing to break up with me for the past month while talking with this guy, saying all sorts of shit to him; mild flirting, talking about her past boyfriends before me, his past long term girlfriend, talking about all the stuff they have in common. The real clincher was after she met this guy at a bar recently, she said that she 'wanted to kiss him' (I was aware of the meeting, and was a little suspicious, but I didn't want to get all jealous/protective when I didn't think we were breaking up).

I was devastated after finding this out. I called friends to talk about everything with them, to reassure myself everything was going to be okay, and discussed methods of how to handle the breakup. I kept reading the conversation, seeing things like ""I feel so bad chatting with you with my boyfriend asleep"", driving myself crazy with the dates of the conversations; thinking of how she would kiss me goodnight, then her stay up late, having an emotional affair with this guy, me none-the-wiser. 

We talked once she got home from work. She was crying, and I tried to keep my composure, but I just couldn't. I bawled and hyperventilated, trying to express myself. It was a fairly amicable breakup, however the emotional affair is what was the extra stab. I don't hate her, and she says there is nothing wrong with me, but she fell out of love with me physically a long time ago. I agreed that I noticed the decline of our sexual encounters, but that I was under the guise that it was due to her self-image issues, and other factors.

Here's the kicker: She is currently in grad school for her media program, and is working less than she usually does. Her student loans have almost dried up, and can't afford rent and groceries. She is saying she wants me to stay because it's easier for me to get to work than from my parents place, and that she wants to stay friends. I tentatively agreed to stay, but I cannot sleep beside her. I tried for the life of me, as I am extremely exhausted, but I cannot turn my brain off.

I feel as though her pleas for me to stay are partially related to her true feelings for me, as she is having a hard time dealing with *my* coldness towards her. She thinks she can just continue to be ""friends"" with me, hang out with me like old times. It doesn't work that way. I don't want to be an ""emotional tampon"" as I have read on here. I have to get out of this toxic environment, and move in with my parents temporarily until I get my shit together. I don't want to be a dick, but I can't live with her here, and continue to be abused with her selfish behavior. I can't sleep. She has work tomorrow morning? An internship to start on Monday? Maybe if you had the fucking balls to dump me 6 months ago, you wouldn't be in this shitty situation.

Sorry about the rant; this is my brain cycling through the emotions."

1ba96c,1,2013-03-29,Depressed need to get feelings off my chest,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ba96c/depressed_need_to_get_feelings_off_my_chest/,"I’m a college senior who has been drifting emptily through my life. I had given up on life for a long time and was just going through the motions. It dawned on me these last 2 years that the end of “the best years of my life” was coming to an end. And all I am is a broken empty friendless unlovable loser who pathetically bruises and cuts themself.

So I had decided I would make a deal with myself, that I would pour all of myself into what I've read on getting better and literally find happiness or die trying. So I took on a job, an internship, several leadership roles, a hard set of classes, several large personal projects, along with adopting a whole host of self-help tips (exercise, mediation, reading, journaling, constant positive affirmations (oh god the stupid affirmations I say)). 

I would work nonstop and not sleep for days; if I did sleep it would be for 3 hours or less. My chest constantly hurt and it was rather scary, but I went on, while quietly hoping my heart would just stop beating. I put so much effort into talking with people. I memorized everything they told me or seemed interested in. I made lists of things to talk about for the people I met and made sure to talk with them using what I've read on socializing. I made lists of jokes and people seemed to like them. I listened and was supportive of people. I went far out of my way to help them. No matter how uncomfortable it was. But I still have no one I would consider even close to a friend. They all leave me out of events and don’t respond when I try to get them to hang out and avoid talking to me in general. I even tried to see if anyone would care about my stupid suicidal quest but no one did.

In the end I've succeeded in everything I took on and even did more. And all I feel is empty and alone. Now I feel even worse because I can’t shake the feeling that no matter how hard I work or how much I get out of my comfort zone I will never be happy.

People even say they are envious of me. HOW? How could you possibly want to be me? I hate myself so much. I wouldn't want anyone to be someone as worthless as me. Whenever I look at myself all I think is “why hasn't this worthless piece of shit killed itself already?” And it takes all my strength not start hitting myself right there in public. No amount of forceful positive thought makes it stops, it still just creeps into my mind and ruins everything.

I've read a lot on how to get better, but I just can’t seem to think I am worth it. I hate myself for feeling like this. I am sure these feelings are the thing holding me back. I know I can be more, but part of me knows I can’t. I feel like I’m split apart and don’t want to continue the ceaseless and pointless day-to-day struggle. I just keep asking why continue? All I feel is anger and pain and emptiness now. The odds that I'm going to get into a job I hate like most everyone and spend decades alone and miserable like I am now is so high. I just can't face that many years of this.

I just want to give up so badly. Most every day is a constant strain on me. I can't shake the thought that ""If I can just give in and stop fighting. Let myself go even farther down than I have ever been. Then let go of the small hopes of happiness. I could finally go through with ending it all."" I don't want to die but it just feels so tempting.

There isn't much point in writing this giant wall of text I guess. I’m just tired and tired of being alone. Posting this is the stupidest and most pathetic thing I have ever done, but I just need to get it out and maybe get advice. I'm probably not thinking all that straight. 

Thank you for your time."

I’ve only told one person about my depression and that was my ex girlfriend and she got me to go to a counselor who just prescribed pills that work maybe once a month so I stopped taking though. She couldn’t handle when I actually came out and told her about how I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for years and that the pills didn’t help. I don’t tell my family because they have no idea because I have gotten really good at faking a smile. I’m a 22-year-old college graduate with nothing left in me. I lost all motivation to do anything anymore, I don’t feel anything anymore, I just have nothing left to me I'm just a waste of a shell. If I had one wish it'd be that I could switch places with someone with a terminal disease because they deserve to have a healthy body. I feel guilty for feeling this way and it’s been so long that I've felt this way. I’ve been praying to not wake up when I fall asleep since I was in the 5th grade. All my friends at one point has either stabbed me in the back or thrown me away for someone bigger and better. I made the mistake once telling a friend my parents were worried I was depressed and he joked about how I should just kill myself and get it over with. I could never kill myself because that is too selfish of me and its not fair for a healthy body to just be given up even though the past years that’s all I’ve been is just a nothing. I haven’t just been sitting in bed all these years, I played sports and had friends but no matter what, since 5th grade everything has been done with a fake smile on my face. At night no matter where I would be laying down I would always be hoping either I have a heart attack in my sleep and I don’t wake up or that tomorrow I’m in some horrible accident that kills me. I’ve always prayed that it only happens to me, meaning that I pray for a car accident but that the car is fine and the other people are fine but I don’t want to survive. Since I have been 16 and been able to drive I’ve always wanted to have the balls to just drive off a bridge or the brakes go out and I run into a wall and fly out, that is why I never wear a seatbelt. I don’t want to talk to anyone because nothing is going to change my mind on this I just want to be dead and I know that everyone I know will be over my death within a couple days. I’ve tried to give myself a better life, I have had interviews with nice paying jobs at cool company’s. My soccer didn’t work out because they said I wasn’t big enough so I didn’t even follow through with the tryouts I got for different college scholarships so I just went to the university everyone goes to where I'm from. I’ve had three internships and the last one I worked 65-70 hours a week and they screwed me on my last paycheck by taking my contracts and giving them to someone else. I stayed in my college town for my ex, we broke up with all the fighting about my depression. She wanted the brake up when I told her that my trust issues and my sex drive didn’t have anything to do against her but me since I’ve never ever trusted anyone to tell them how I’ve actually felt. But still I fought and convinced her not to end it but finally I had nothing left in me to fight for. Why fight to be with me when I wouldn’t even want to be with me, I don’t even want to be alive so why would I want her to be with me. I still do love her and that’s why I don’t want her with me because she deserves better than someone who prays for death everyday and night. To think even typing this id be crying or upset but I’ve got nothing I just don’t care I just keeping hoping I have a heart attack. Thanks for reading if you did I just need to get this kinda off my chest to someone somewhere."

I REALLY appreciate the advice on r/personalfinance - it's a particular type of knowledge that is hard to come by.

Background: I made about $37k in 2012 - I only worked until July and have been a student since August/Sept. I have to file in 3 states.
For 2013, I'll make a total of around $22k from a summer internship. By 2014, I will be married and personally expect to make somewhere between $90k and $120k.

1) I'm borrowing (or will borrow) quite a bit of money - $120k but I've been fortunate enough to borrow on a family member's equity line so I'm locked in around 2%. So it's not exactly a student loan... do I get any tax benefit for this?  e.g., American Opportunity Tax Credit or Student Loan Interest Deduction?

2) any other tips to maximize returns given my lower relative income and student status in 2012 and 2013? 
 - for example, i think it may be smart to convert my $10k or so from a traditional ira (rest is roth) into a roth given my lower income.

My apologies if i didn't provide enough personal info. Also I hope this is a resource for others in a somewhat similar position so please feel free to respond even if it doesn't particularly apply to me. Thanks!

1bcxgp,19,2013-03-31,"If you are a political science major and worried about what prospects you have after graduation, I have some advice.",[deleted],PoliticalScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1bcxgp/if_you_are_a_political_science_major_and_worried/,"I've been thinking a lot about this lately because my alma mater has asked me to speak at a capstone event for the political science department.  
  
What I want you to start thinking about right now is the *utility* of Political Science.  
  
Too often students decide to study political science because they like the courses, which are interesting, but without thinking too critically about what political science means for them.  But if you are a year away from graduation, you have time to make some critical choices that will have an ASTRONOMICAL impact on your ability to get a job.  
  
1) **Decide now if you are going to graduate school.**  If you decide now you will be able to plan for some really important details, there are programs that you can only apply for in your junior year that are designed to get you into a graduate program.  At every school there is a person who's job is to look for people to apply for those programs, get a bug in their ear with your name on it and increase your chances of selection.  Some of these programs require that you be nominated for them by your university which is easier if you know the person doing the nominating.  
  
2)  **Partner with a professor to round out your skills.**  Most political science programs don't have a lot of room for diversification.  You'll take the same types of research classes as everyone else and you'll use the same programs as everyone else.  Unfortunately for you, some of these programs may not be the industry standard, or even be very marketable right now.  If you ask a professor, who likes you, you can usually find out what programs you need to know.  A lot of schools use SPSS for statistics analysis, but I've never met a research professional who likes it.  STATA is pretty much industry standard, but the point is that YOU don't know that.  You need to find out.  Almost every school offers an independent research project that can take the place of a class.  If you are really cool, you can stretch that project out for a whole year into an honors project (doesn't matter if you aren't an honors student).  During this project you can learn how to use these other programs which you can put down on a resume, or gain practical skills like data analysis which you might not get from your degree program, especially at Bachelor level.  
  
3) **Good god, I cannot stress this enough.  GET A FUCKING INTERNSHIP**.  You want to know how political science professionals look at recent graduates with no practical experience?  [I've loved this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_VPGilSNKw) ever since I first saw it because it really hits the nail on the head.  You *need* practical experience.  Get it now.  No one cares how idealistic you are or what ideas you have if you don't have practical experiences that shape your understanding of those facts.  An independent research project is great, but an internship or job that is actually in the field of political science is the holy grail of how to get work as a poli sci major.  Interships don't just get you into the field, they develop networking relationships that can get you actual jobs when you graduate, but you have to foster those relationships.  The people you work with as an intern are usually more than happy to reach out into their organization to try and find a place for you, but you have to ask, and you have to get in the door first.  If internships are in short supply volunteer at a campaign.  You'd be surprised how many of my colleagues got their start working for a political campaign as a canvasser and then stayed after hours to help out at the office and sit in on strategy meetings just to learn.  Nearly all of them, including me.  
  
**And, as always, I'm happy to answer questions that people have.**
  
TLDR: This is why you have no internship prospects, you don't read."

I'm trying to figure out how I'm supposed to manage my taxes since I've never used a 1099.
In January I started an internship and the contract states that Im a 1099 contractor for the company, so I'm getting untaxed wages and I've been putting away 20% of each paycheck for taxes.
I've gathered that Im supposed to pay my taxes four times a year and one of these times is around April 15th, so it's pretty soon.

Should I file this payment myself or contact someone more knowledgeable? I got the 1040-ES form and there's a few things I'm unclear about, such as there difference between 1a (Expected income and profits subject to self-employment tax) and 6 (Enter your expected wages (if subject to social security tax...)) on the Tax Deduction worksheet portion.

Then in the actual 2013 Estimated tax worksheet, point 1- Adjusted gross income you expect in 2013 - how can I figure out this number? My internship will probably end rather soon and I'll probably take up another one or get an entry level position, so am I supposed to make an educated guess at this?

I know all the information is ""out there"" but I'm having a hard time piecing everything together and taxes are one of the few things I really don't want to mess up.

Should I hit up my college for tax help? Is there some software I can use? Or should I just go to a tax professional?"

Since she started her study for nursing, she's been asking way too much of herself. When she had to write a paper that had to be at least 45 pages, she wrote 90. Things like that. Also, she met her boyfriend in Turkey and after a few years he moved to our country, and all the things they had to do gave her a lot of stress and made her paranoid.

Now, after years of stress, she broke down. She's in her final year of nursing and she had to do an internship in the hospital and she was too scared to go. She cried the entire time, couldn't sleep and at first we thought she was just nervous, but now we realize that this is serious and it's gonna take months, maybe years to heal. She dropped out of school and she hopes she can start again in september, but so far it doesn't seem like she will. She is seeing a therapist once a month, but it doesn't really seem to help.

It kills me to see her suffering like that. Sitting on the couch, tired, bags under her eyes. She's knitting the whole day to distract herself from the fears she has. Right now she feels alone, like nobody understands what she's going through. Going out for a walk is such a huge step for her, she wants to go out but her body tells her to stay in bed all day.

So Reddit, please make her feel like she isn't alone. Share your story in here, give her some tips or motivation! 

EDIT: Thanks Reddit! I translated all your comments, printed them out and gave it to her. She related a lot. While she was reading, she was nodding the entire time. She's gonna read your comments when she feels bad, so you really helped her out!

1bcerr,9,2013-03-31,So...I've fallen off the wagon and I'm having a bit of trouble getting back on,[deleted],vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1bcerr/soive_fallen_off_the_wagon_and_im_having_a_bit_of/,"I went vegetarian when I was 13 and went vegan when I was 20. After 10 months of veganism, I moved to Peru for 3 months for an internship (this was last summer). I immediately started eating dairy and eggs, and after a few weeks started eating meat again. This was partly due to the difficulty of maintaing my lifestyle where I was, and partly due to my wanting to try the traditional dishes. 

Anyway, I returned home in August, and have kept eating meat and other animal products since. I have managed to transition myself to 100% vegan groceries when I'm at home, but when I eat out I have continued eating animal products. Because I have vegan groceries, I don't eat animal products very many times per week, but it still happens. 

I keep telling myself that I am going to go back, but then I end up at a restaurant and just cave. I try to remind myself of all the reasons I was vegan/vegetarian in the past, and that if I successfully did it for so long before, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to now, but I'm having difficulty. 

Can anyone offer me some advice/words of inspiration to get back to the vegan way of life?"

I am a Junior in my engineering program, I have a wonderful beautiful girlfriend, great friends, am financially stable, my dream internship, and am respected by my peers. 

Everything in my life is going great, and my peers would be envious of the opportunities and successes I have had. I still cannot help but feel overwhelmed and feel that massive stress has become the my status quo. That I start to question if I even like my major, my life, or anything about me. I overeat to cope with the pressures that are placed on me. I fantasize about exercising, but I either won't stick to a routine because I meet the initial resistance. I turn that hate inward and struggle with my body issues. (I have struggled with my weight all my life, and I would say that I am a normal weight and would be classified as average or chubby.) I guess that I feel like I do not have control on my life because I put all my effort towards my academic and professional career with great results, but I am dying on the inside because I can feel my body falling out of shape and losing tons of self confidence. 

Sometimes I dream that someone would take me away,and just ""fix"" me. Where I could come back attractive, happy, and stress free. Resume my life where I left off. I have been so lucky and so incredibly blessed for everything I have. I have been to a counselor before, but could not begin to talk about my feelings. I have a hard time admitting that I am experience problems. I prefer to pretend that everything is great and none of this is tearing me apart.

I feel like I need to get this out, but I need help..."
1bcbrw,1,2013-03-31,"4-year long distance marriage, husband (29) says he feels confined but loves me.",throwaway08324,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bcbrw/4year_long_distance_marriage_husband_29_says_he/,"TLDR: LDR husband told me he felt “confined”, although the last time I saw him was Christmas. He also said he loves me and does not want to break up. So I’m confused as to what he really wants.

28f, 29m. We met in college and stayed in a long distance relationship after we graduated and went to graduate school/ law school in different states. We got married in the second summer of graduate school and have been in a long distance marriage since then. 

We have had ups and downs, but stayed together. During his three years of law school, he bad grades and often missed classes. This became a problem in the last year because he couldn't find a job after graduation (he didn't look for one because of bad grades). He drank a lot and put on a lot of weight in that year. Around graduation we had a fight because he was going to move home and stay with his parents, making our distance longer. He said he wanted to move home because I was the reason he couldn't have any friends. He said he felt I would get upset if he went out with his friends. I could kind of see what he meant; I caught him cheating several times throughout our relationship and maybe as a result I tend to question his whereabouts. I thought the basic “where are you/what are you doing” is not extreme for a LDR. He questioned my whereabouts too, and never told me I was smothering him. I have been able to develop new friendships, although I did spend most of my nights talking to him on the phone. I thought it was something he enjoyed doing. He never mentioned it was a problem and called/texted me constantly. It was also initially his idea to get married, and I did nothing to force him into marriage at all. It all seemed natural and something he really wanted. We only spent summers and winters together. I visited him about once a month. I don't think this is too much time we spend together given we are married.

We were on good terms for a while after he moved home after graduation. He has been doing an unpaid internship and hopes to find a job this year. He has been loving and told me earlier this year how I am the most important thing in his life how much he wanted to be with me etc etc. He also expressed regrets for cheating etc etc. Recently it went down hill again. After a fight he stopped talking to me for two weeks (this isn’t new as he sometimes gives me prolonged silent treatment when we fight). When we started talking again last week he seemed a bit distant. Although he was still telling me he loves me but he was calling and texting me significantly less. I thought I would ask to see if something is bothering him. This was when he said again he felt like he didn't have any friends anymore, because I would be upset if he went out with his friends. Most importantly, he said he felt “confined”. I asked if he wanted to end the relationship he said no and he loved me.

I felt like a horrible person for making him feel that way, but meanwhile, I am kind of confused as to why he feels “confined”. Last time I saw him was Christmas. Then we just talked like once a day on the phone, is that smothering? If so, why wasn’t this brought up earlier? I feel like I always had to pretend everything is ok between us; if I bring up any concerns I have I ended up being the one apologizing. I’m starting to think that he actually doesn’t want to be with me, but cannot end the relationship somehow. Reddit, what do you think?

1bc68f,5,2013-03-30,Homelessness is making it impossible for me to relax or love anybody.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1bc68f/homelessness_is_making_it_impossible_for_me_to/,"**Long, sorry.**

Finally got around to making an account and writing this. I've told myself I'd do it for months now.

My family is one of those that's just filled to the brim with fuck-ups. Two uncles and a father dead from drugs. Another aunt, uncle, and cousin still living with my grandparents. My brother went to community college for a semster, ""took a break"" and now works at McDonalds scraping by. My mom has the shittiest judgement I've ever known. Two years ago she quit a promising/well-paying job at the local Juvi so she could date an ex-con. That fell through quick and the last two years have been a downward spiral into my current situation. As of June of 2012 we've been homeless. At first it was the living in motels scheme. My little siblings thought it was fun. It sickened me. Now we managed to get this little trailer (I need to hunch if I stand in it) and we stay in a dirt lot next to a fucking bar. A bar. I've had nights were I listen to guys pummeling their girlfriends, shootings, and all kinds of fucked up no more than twenty yards away. We have to stay quiet so the house next to the lot doesn't complain. I think of Anne Frank a lot, and that doesn't help anything at all. I really don't know why I haven't called Child Protective Services on my mother, guilt, pride, shame, hope, who the fuck knows. I wouldn't be so bitter if it weren't for her attitude about it. Whenever I ask how the house search is going she shuts down on me, and I nearly ran away the day she said she was happy with the trailer and *preferred* it over an apartment. I appreciate shit is worse for people, what makes me livid is how okay with our situation she is. It's gone on like this in the trailer for almost a year now. And I can say with confidence I loathe her... hate her. 

During this year though, I've also made more progress then ever. I've coped with this shit by overloading myself with work. My grades have turned into college-material and I got an internship at this non-profit art studio. They let me stay after hours and work. It's where I am now and spend most of my time avoiding that place my mom likes to call home. I refuse to call it a home. I've coped well so far and with the work I made for myself I can feel a life I never dreamed of opening up for me. I nearly cried when I got my two best compliments. They were so brief, but did so much. On two separate occasions these guys (part time mentors at the studio) just sort of walked up, watched me work for a little bit, and said I'm going to go so far. These two are accomplished like no fucking tomorrow, one worked with Matt Stone and Trey Parker on Team America. It's put my professional ego up enough to keep going... But I've still felt like absolute shit. Everyone keeps telling me how great my work is, how nice I am, and how wonderful it must be to do what I do. But I wake up and fall asleep angry every single day. The studio is chok-full of these privileged people who get to go home to electricity, hot showers, food in a fridge, and seemingly half-way decent folks. I loathe these people's complaints, and I beat myself up for doing it too. It's never been outward either, that's what's weird. I'm stuck practicing being a nice person and I almost perpetually have these fucked up and angry thoughts towards people who don't deserve it. It's spring break right now. Breaks are so much worse, I have nowhere to be in the mornings and just sit around and stagnate with my fucked up thoughts. School is where I get most of my food too. Breaks are the times I hate the most. Over the last week or two I've also noticed something *really* different. My eye twitches, A LOT. At least seven or eight times each hour. I think I've gotten my first stress induced tic. Three days ago I cried for about 4 hours in the middle of the night while my mom, her boyfriend (not the ex-con), and my half-brother went and lived it up at another hotel. I never go with them. I don't like the faux relaxation.

It's been college application time and all I want is to move away. Far far away. But I hate myself for doing this too, my younger siblings don't deserve this shit. You know what the most artistic city in the country is? Sante Fe... at least 20 hours away by car. Their art college is practically recruiting too.

I've turned into this emotionally inept person who almost constantly has to put on this air of happiness and confidence. The last time I said ""I love you"" to anyone was my grandma; and that was the not-so-weighty see ya' later type of I love you. That little thing made my stomach wrench. My closest friend who I've known for seven or eight years now hasn't heard a word of this simply because we never had that kind of openness. I think I've begun to resent him too. Just a little bit. He got really sick two years ago and his grades, mentality, and life suffered for it. I try to be sensitive to the fact I don't know shit about what he's thinking, but it's been two fucking years and all he does is mule around his house and hang out with friends. He keeps saying ""When I get a job I'll do this-and-that,"" but he hasn't done shit besides download fucktons of videogames and shows to waste his time. I feel like him and I have become polar opposites of each other. He seems to be living the life and so often he says things ""don't matter"" or that he doesn't care. In fact, I don't know what he DOES care about. Besides him, my closest friends are one guy at the studio who has been through shit worse than I have and my teachers.

I think that's it. Also, if you're reading this and think it's Justin... It is. I hope someone I know reads this. If for some astronomical reason any of you read this... Brian, Jose, Mr.Green, Mr.Russell, Meg, Marcia, Andrew, Jim... Don't confront me about it, just hint at it. When I'm ready I'll come to you guys... For now I have to bitch around complaining to the internet.

Thanks for reading this shit.... It's been a lot."
1bbyxn,23,2013-03-30,"Trying to put together business outfits, can I get some help?",[deleted],femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1bbyxn/trying_to_put_together_business_outfits_can_i_get/,"I'm starting to interview for internships and will hopefully have an internship this summer that will require me to wear business attire. I previously only had some skirts and a cheap blazer that didn't match, so I spent a LOT of money at Express today on a grey blazer with matching skirt and pants and a dress (my boss recommended express for nice business clothes). 

I tried putting some outfits together and I would really like some feedback. No matter what I try it always makes me feel awkward/frumpy. I think part of the problem is that I'm very short and curvy, and the blazer look kind of conceals my curves and makes me look like I'm way bigger than I actually am. Or maybe I'm just being too self-conscious. 

Here's the album of my attempted outfits: http://imgur.com/a/0SVjm

Sorry about the phone mirror pics, but it's really the best I could do since I have no camera and my laptop webcam takes really poor quality.

Some info: I'm 19, 5'2'', about 130 pounds. Bust 38'', underbust 28.5''. According to the calculator I have an hourglass shape. Budget right now is close to nothing. I used up almost all of my extra money at Express today so I'm basically looking for how to do the most with what I have, or if I should return/exchange something. I'm probably willing to shell out another $100 at most do get an acceptable work outfit. I live in the United States.

I also have a few specific questions about the outfits

* Is the blue dress to short to wear in a business environment?
* Should I have gone with black instead of grey? The store assistant convinced me to go with gray but now I'm worried I can't pull it off.
* As you can see in the last picture, the skirt has the slit on the side instead of the back. Is this correct? Am I wearing it wrong or something?
* Where can I get some dressy business blouses to wear with the suit?
* What colors will look good with the grey?

I really appreciate your help :)"
1bbxew,1,2013-03-30,Have experience but would like suggestions on how to go about picking a microcontroller for a new project?,justhadaquestion,microcontrollers,https://www.reddit.com/r/microcontrollers/comments/1bbxew/have_experience_but_would_like_suggestions_on_how/,"I am currently taking an embedded systems class at my university and told my boss at the place that I intern at that it would be cool if I could get a project that involves implementing a microcontroller. He agrees that it we would have a lot of uses for them we came up with a project but the thing is that I am the only computer engineer at the place where I intern at. While that is not that big of a problem for me as I think I can handle what we came up with, one thing that I am having a lot of trouble with is selecting a microcontroller for it. I have starting coming up with a basic design but keep stumbling when it comes to picking a microcontroller. There are so many out there and I am having trouble discerning what the right one for our project is. The gist of the project is that it will monitor a few sensors and open and close air valves based on the readings and maybe send info via ethernet. Rather then tell you guys more in detail what I am implementing and have you tell me what to buy, I was hoping if some people could give advice on how they go about picking a new microcontroller from the thousands out there when they start a new project.

TLDR: Besides budget, how do you guy about picking a microcontroller from the thousands out there?"
