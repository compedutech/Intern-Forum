5ftho1,29,2016-11-30,How do you feel about intentionally being picked for a job/internship/anything because you are a girl or minority?,skkexx,girlsgonewired,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/5ftho1/how_do_you_feel_about_intentionally_being_picked/,"Some backstory. I'm a Hispanic female working on my MS in CS. I had a 4.0 GPA for my core classes in undergrad, and currently have a 4.0 for my MS. I have had internships and fellowships at my university. I'm currently working at a lab as a student software engineer.

When I was doing my undergrad, many males would tell me that I had it easier because I was female and I would just have offers and scholarships ""thrown"" at me. From my experience that wasn't really the case. 

Anyways, I had an interview with 2 different teams at a large software company. It's always been my dream to work at a large company like this. One of the non-technical managers said during the interview ""your resume stuck out to us because we are looking to improve our diversity"". I was totally crushed, I like to think I've gotten where I am (and will go where I go) based entirely off merit. I've worked very very hard and I don't want to get a job just because I'm a female and minority. 

Anyways, the interviews didn't go incredibly well, I didn't study as much as I should have and I was feeling down about it. But it turns out both teams want to hire me. It just... feels like they only want to hire me because of diversity, especially because of his comment and because I didn't ace the interview. has anyone else had an experience like this? How do you get past it? Do you take the job, and feel like a total loser, or do you try to find something that feels like you aren't getting because of your gender? I just wish that interviews and resumes somehow didn't have to reveal gender. 

---
tl;dr I feel like I'm only getting offers from my dream company because of my gender. "
5ftwm4,4,2016-11-30,Long distance ex keeps calling,ScatteredDream,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5ftwm4/long_distance_ex_keeps_calling/,"Hey, so I recently ended a 5 year relationship. She was awesome and we had a great relationship, I could have married her, but last year she decided to go to Vienna to finish her opera singing career, which I encouraged because it had always been a dream of hers. My current situation is a bit complex. I finished a Game Design degree (which was my childhood dream) when I was 21 (2014) and started working but wanted to be an entrepreneur because I've always been active with project and I wanted to get money, so I started an entrepreneurship degree in our native country of Guatemala (2015). I started reading a ton about business, finance, gamification, innovation, and basically fell in love with the career. I haven't been satisfied with my current school (I am the first class of the Entrepreneurship career they have ever had, so basically a guinea pig) and decided to learn a bit more through life. Started working internships in some huge companies while studying, learned a ton and got a great network. Well, her dream was to go to Vienna to study opera, and I encouraged her because the career and success rate in our country is basically non existent. I knew the long distance fan was there, but still went on knowing shit would eventually hit it. We tried to make it work long distance, but it was really tough. Due to the time change, I could usually just talk to her about 5-30 minutes a day (I couldn't talk to her after 2pm from my time zone). In January I got an amazing business opportunity with some really high end business partners and started working on that. I worked on my things and she worked on hers and we managed for a while but then I got deeply depressed and talked to her about it. By March I didn't feel like studying or working and almost got laid off as a business partner because of it. I mentioned a possible breakup as early as April, but we tried to make it work. I started getting major shifts in my life, in my work and studies. My overly expensive school hadn't satisfied me with their classes and felt mostly like a waste of time, while my new business opportunity became more promising the closer it came to reality (the business has been changing models all year and will hopefully, HOPEFULLY, launch around March, but it is a whole lot of cash for me. Meanwhile I've been working my ass off for free). I decided I would either transfer to an Ivy league school in the US for 2017 or try my luck as an entrepreneur without graduating. The uncertainty of the future was consuming me. What should I do? what did I want to do? I couldn't handle the pressure anymore. I'm 23 and she's 22, we're not financially stable to travel often to see each other, she's barely financially stable to keep herself alive and I've had to help her financially out of my own savings (around Q30,000 in 1 year, that is aproximately $4000). So, I would only see her for one month a year when she had to legally come back to Guatemala, and this was going to go on for at least another 5 years. I really do love her, and she loved me back, but on the fist week of November I broke it off. I needed to keep my mind in the game and told her I couldn't handle long distance anymore. I had to figure out who I was and what I wanted while working on my projects. She didn't take it too well, I tried to lay it off easy, but it didn't go well. I tried to break contact with her but she kept talking to me, until I really told her I couldn't talk to her anymore. What's more, she got into some legal trouble about a week later and she didn't have anyone else to talk to and she was scared to death because some who had stolen from her was trying to sue her (long story, and obviously without a case). Well, I listened to her, treated her to a fancy meal, helped her and calmed her down. After that she kept calling and texting, and I responded because I wanted to know she was well. Well, I talked to her today, and told her I couldn't keep the communication up, and that I needed some space.
But she wouldn't stop calling through every social media app or site possible. I had to block her all around, but now I feel an overwhelming guilt. I really want her to be happy, and I would love to go back to our relationship, but long distance was really consuming me in a time where I can't afford distractions. Should I have not blocked her? Should I try to find out if she's okay? I really care for her, but I think it's poisonous if we keep relying on each other for support. Did I take the correct route? Do you think she'll be ok? Please, help, the guilt is killing me.

TL;DR: 5 year relationship was awesome until girlfriend moved to the other side of the world to study, I got really depressed, I was in a transitioning period and needed to focus so I ended the relationship. Ex won't stop calling, she hates her life right now. I'm really worried for her but blocked her because I thought it was the best and now I feel overwhelmingly guilty."
5fu04m,6,2016-11-30,[Help] Will this rescue dog be a good match for me?,corgians,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/5fu04m/help_will_this_rescue_dog_be_a_good_match_for_me/,"Hi, so there's a dog I had been basically social media stalking for the past month now and I've recently been approved to adopt her after finally having the appropriate finances/housing to do so. I'm really enamored by this dog and it kills me that she's been in foster care for this long despite how friendly she is, mostly because of her size and breed(s). I really want her, but I want to make sure I am a good fit for her! So I filled out the 'What Breed Is Right For Me' questionnaire for some background insight. 

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes. I've always wanted dogs, but my family never had the time or space for one. Now that I'm independent and financially secure, I want to finally have a dog. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I definitely want to rescue. 

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, calm/relatively laid back, eager to learn/trainable, affectionate, expressive 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Breed wise, I love a wide variety of dogs! I have a fondness for the spitz type like Huskies and Samoyeds, but also a big soft-spot for PBT's because of their checkered past and the overwhelmingly high number of them in shelters.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic obedience: sit, stay, leave it, roll over. Leash training is a must as well. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I don't really go out much when I'm not working, aside from hanging with friends on occasion, so I have no problem committing my free time to my dog. I come home after 6pm so I expect to spend the rest of the night with them. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I plan on walking my dog for thirty minutes when I wake up and another fifteen minutes right before I leave work (at 10am) and another thirty minute walk when I come home from work in the evening. On the weekends we'd have more time to be active so I could do extra long walks and more playing. As of right now, the dog I plan to adopt is not quite ready for the dog park in a group setting (reason for it is at the end of this post).

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* That is all good with me! The dog has very short (pretty much skin-tight) fur that's sort of coarse in nature, so grooming seems relatively low-maintenance. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium to large

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding or slobber- but barking would have to be kept at a minimum.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be nice- I don't ever plan on letting my dog loose off-leash otherwise. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I want a snugglebug! Nothing too intense or on the verge of separation anxiety, however. I'd like to still be able to do things around the apartment lol.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please would naturally make training more easy, and I'm privy to that. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Being excited and friendly but not jumpy - good front door manners. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. I don't have the experience or means to handle a dog-aggressive pet and it would be very stressful for both the dog and me. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Aggression in general, separation anxiety, and leash craziness. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Eight hours: 10 to 6pm.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live with two roommates. One of them works as a line cook and is therefore hardly ever home- and when he is home, it's not until late in the night. He said he's cool with the dog. My other roommate just ended an internship and will be home while she's in between jobs and has expressed enthusiasm over having a dog and has even offered to look after her for me while I'm at work/she's not working. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* My roommate has mentioned that she wants a french bulldog but it won't happen anytime in the near future - at least not until she gets a job again. The dog I'm wanting to adopt is currently fostered with a Yorkie and a Schnauzer and gets along fantastically with them. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I am currently renting and my landlord allows all animals.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in New York City and there are no breed bans - just a mandatory dog license and leash laws, etc. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* New York: July is the hottest month in New York with an average temperature of 25°C (76°F) and the coldest is January at 2°C (35°F) with the most daily sunshine hours at 11 in July. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* The dog in question is a really sweet Pitbull/Shar-Pei/Mountain Cur mix who's been in foster care for the past four months. She's medium height but wide in girth if that makes sense - at seventy pounds, she's built like a hippo lol. She arrived with a litter of pups and after they were all adopted, she ended up fostering another litter that was found abandoned in a trash bag. She gets along great with other dogs and people of all ages. The only hiccup is that she's kind of a puller on the leash. Last week she was very close to being adopted by a couple until they took her for a test walk to the dog park (they already have one dog and live near a dog park so they really wanted a dog-park dog) and she got too excited, jumped over the fence, spooked the dogs and got bit by one of them. She was the biggest dog there and the only one who got hurt. So while it seems evident that she is not dog-aggressive, it would be wise to continue her leash training so that she does not get herself hurt, which I am aware is something I will have to do. In spite of me being a first-time owner, I feel like I could be a good owner to her because even though she is strong and large, she is overall mild-mannered. Please give me your honest opinions!

5fun29,0,2016-11-30,I [21M] don't know what to make of my situation [19F],BigSurOranges,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5fun29/i_21m_dont_know_what_to_make_of_my_situation_19f/,"So a little bit of background. I have been with my gf for a little over a year now and although it hasn’t been such a smooth ride, at the end of the day we both knew that we wanted to be with each other no matter how hard it was. But lately things have taken a turn for the worse. Over the course of our relationship, we both have had our spats of jealousy, fearing that the other was talking to or seeing someone else. About a month into the relationship I found out she was talking to someone else by questioning who she kept snap chatting all the time. She admitted to what she was doing but she claimed she never did anything with him and I believed her. About two months into the relationship I sent a picture of myself to a girl who messaged me and my girlfriend found out and almost ended things with me. I admitted I was wrong and we moved on. We had a habit of checking each others phones, which we both didn’t like and knew was wrong, but we just had to know for sure. We are both attractive people and we are used to the attention from other people so we both had a sense of jealousy. But over time we stopped checking each other’s phones because we fell more in love and there was always nothing to be found. The jealousy subsided. After a rocky first two months, we went on to have a healthy relationship. We both had busy schedules. I was away at school during the week, and she commuted to school during the day and had theatre rehearsals at night. She goes to a different school than I do FYI. We texted when we could and we saw each other every weekend. We would go on dates, spend nights together, have gatherings with our friends, etc. We were best friends too. We could tell each other anything and everything. Things were great up until our six months. I started feeling less affection from her. She wouldn’t kiss me hello, barely kissed when we were together, barely wanted to go on dates, she was on her phone more and more when we were together, and sex became more of a routine rather than an intimate bond. One Friday night while I was laying in her bed for her to come home from her rehearsal, I browsed her laptop watching Netflix and the such. I got bored, and I don’t know why, but I decided to snoop around. I pulled up her text messages on her computer and I saw loads of phone numbers without a contact name all from the first three months we started dating. I found the one guy I was suspicious about that I mentioned previously and he was texting her about how he was nervous and he thought he used a bit too much tongue and such. Keep in mind this is from when we first started dating. I got super overwhelmed and knew that she lied to me about doing anything with this guy. I decided not to mention anything to her when she came home. The next day she saw that I was browsing her messages since I left it up on her screen and then I confronted her about what I saw. She still denied that she did anything with him and claimed the dates were off even though I knew they weren’t. I decided to just give in and accept that she was telling the truth even though I knew she was clearly telling a lie. That was a mistake. Things didn’t get any better and I confronted her about her lack of affection and she told me she would try more and such. But that would only last a day before she would go back to be affectionless. I spent the second half of my summer travelling Europe for an internship and was gone for 45 days. We still talked every day but she kept telling me more and more about how guys would keep hitting on her and messaging her and what not. But this was never a problem when we were physically together. I logged onto her instagram and saw she was messaging a guy in a flirty tone. Nothing too serious but she had told me she went to a party the night before and then I see this. So I assume the worst. When I came home from Europe, she didn’t seem as happy as I expected her to when I first saw her. After all I was away for 50 days. I got a hug and she still struggled to give a hello kiss. But whatever. I got more and more busy with school and so did she, as she picked up a lead role in a show her school was doing. She would often ignore my texts. We still saw each other on the weekends but it was so dull. She never dressed up in anything but sweats, we rarely went out, etc. It got to a point where I was begging her for affection when we decided to end things. She said she has become too busy and needed time for herself. She said she still wanted to see me but she didn’t want to be involved in a relationship. Although we were broken up, she still claimed that I was the only guy she is interested in and wanted to be with and she still claims that to this day. But that point on, she began to become really close with another guy who she goes to school with and acts with. She started texting me less and less and when we would still see each other on the weekends she was always talking to this guy. She ditched me sometimes at the last minute even when we had plans. We always have shared our locations via a GPS locator on our phones and one night she ditched me when she said she had an unexpected rehearsal when in reality it said she was home all along. They only chatted through snap chat as well even though she had his number. She became obsessed with wanting to work out and be more “body positive.” Every time she would talk to me, it would be about this guy. She said she told me because we were best friends. I took it that she was interested in this guy. She went to a party with her cast one night and they slept on the same bed together. She said nothing happened between them. There was a rumor going around her cast that they had sex together. She would invite him over to smoke alone and she was never a pothead but she was becoming more and more of one. She never told me this until a few weeks ago. I became so invested in finding out if she was seeing him or not because I still had a great amount of love for this girl and she claimed she did for me too. I asked one night to see her phone and she deleted the texts with that guy. Another night I asked she showed me her conversation with him and she was planning to stay up with him at a party so they could be alone. She says it was to smoke and not share with others but I wasn’t too sure. A few days later we got into an argument again about him and I told her I was sick of what she was putting me through and demanded to know if anything was going on. She told me that the night they planned to stay up, he tried making a move on her but she refused to do anything with him. She cried and said she was scared and I genuinely felt bad for her since she had a rough upbringing in that regard. I still thought she was doing something with him. She also has been talking to another guy from her cast often. The other day she ignored my texts for a solid two hours before and the GPS showed she was on a random street that I didn’t recognize. I asked her where she was and she told me she was at this new guys house. The next day she ignored me again and I saw she was there again. I recently told her how she has been treating me and she just doesn’t seem to care. I asked her to stop talking to the first guy and she said she would but she still continues talk to him, as well as the other guy. Just a few hours ago, she said she had to study. But she was tweeting the second guy on twitter the whole time. I don’t know what to make of this situation. I know I should probably move on but I genuinely love this girl. If she didn’t want to be with me, why would she still be seeing me every weekend and still telling me that she loves me. But at the same time, it still doesn’t make much sense as to why she broke up with me. She wanted time for herself but she hasn’t changed a bit. She still claims that she has done nothing with both guys and that they are just friends. But it’s all just too sketchy. What do you guys think? Sorry for the length!"
5funj6,60,2016-11-30,My (22f) SO (26m) just moved in together. Things aren't working out as originally planned. Together over 3 years.,throwitawaynow378,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5funj6/my_22f_so_26m_just_moved_in_together_things_arent/,"We moved in together a little under 6 months ago. This was planned, as we had talked about moving in together for awhile. I wanted to wait until I graduated college and got a full time job before we moved into together because I was worried I wouldn't be able to help out financially. Fortunately, I was able to turn an internship into a full time position right after I graduated. I was very lucky. 

Around June of this year we started to live together in a small apartment. However, I feel like I'm doing the majority of the work and taking on the blunt of the financial responsibility. 

I knew neither of us were neat freaks before we moved in. When he lived with his old roommates, I never saw him be super clean, but their place was never disgusting. At our current place he's not cleaning up after himself at all. And it's disgusting. A few examples:

* He spilled a stout beer on the kitchen counter and didn't clean it up. I was gone for most of the day when this happened, and when I came back at night it was a sticky-goo on the counter and the kitchen floor. 

* I went away for a weekend with two friends. Before I left I did a lot of cleaning, I ended up collecting 3 garbage bags full of crap and asked him to take the garbage out since I had done so much. He agreed. I left Friday, came back Monday afternoon and he didn't take the garbage out and left a 4th garbage bag by the door. There was liquid leaking out of the bags, it was so f-ing gross. 

* He frequently leaves fast food bags in places that I don't often check. He'll leave a bag that still has fries or a half eaten burger in it under the living room table (which you can't really see under due to its design). I may not see this for a day or two, not until I sit in a specific chair in the living room. 

* He brought his cat in to live with us. We originally agreed he would do most of the care for his cat, but since I love this cat too, I would help out every now and then. He stopped cleaning out the litter box and I only noticed when I started to smell cat shit. I have a very, very, very poor sense of smell (caused by a childhood trauma to the nose). When I smelled the cat shit, I was actually quite surprised because I usually don't notice bad smells like that unless they are extremely powerful or really close to my face. When I checked the cat's litter box, it was FULL OF SHIT. Like, I felt bad for the cat. But then felt disgusted thinking of that cat stepping in that shit and then walking over things in the apartment. 

Those are some of the worst examples I could think of that have happened since we moved in. He'll only clean if I ask him to. 

Financially, it's another story. 

Since I was in college and had a low paying internship, he paid for most of our dates and outings. Now that I'm a salaried employee I'm making almost as much as my SO. I now have a CS degree and the base salaries are higher than most, which is why I'm making almost as much as he is right now. He hasn't really being paying his fair share since we moved in together. 

Once I started to be paid a normal salary I wanted to make up for lost time, and for all the times my SO was able to pay for our dates, pay for our weekend getaways, etc. So, I started to take us out more and pay for dates, pay for nice dinners, and I paid for most of a short trip we took over the summer. I spent a lot of money over the summer and early fall. Probably more than I should have, but I was excited to actually have money in my account. It was really nice to be able to do things for my SO. Once I realized I was spending a lot of money and not saving any of it I decided to be smart with my money. 

I told my SO that while I didn't want to stop going on dates or going away for the weekend, I wanted to be smart about it. That we should do those types of things less, and for special occasions. Or, at the very least, we go dutch as much as possible if we wanted to do something fun together. 

That lasted for awhile, but soon he no longer wanted to spend money towards these things but still wanted to eat well and travel. I reluctantly started to pay for these things again, but not as often. He would start to complain about us never going out on dates or doing anything together. I felt guilty, so I'd offer to take us out together. 

He has also claimed to have some financial issues, but hasn't clarified as to what is causing him to lose money. He hasn't had any job changes, issues with his car, health, or anything like that. He just complains that he doesn't have any money. Because of this, I've started to pay my half of the rent plus all amenities and all dates and other things we may need. For the past 3 months he has only paid half of the rent we share. Everything else falls on me. 

I don't know what to do. I love this man, our relationship was perfect before we moved in together. He was always so good to me, made me laugh, made me feel special and cared for. He shows kindness and good will towards others. My parents love him, his mom thinks of me as her own. He's fun to be with and we have so much in common and have so many common goals for the future.  

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: SO of 3 years doesn't clean up after himself, and it's really gross. He won't clean unless I ask. He's also being unfair when it comes to expenses. I pay half of the rent, the utilities/amenities, dates and other while he only pays half rent each month. He claims to have financial problems, but doesn't explain why and I don't know what is draining him of money. How can I get him to clean up after himself more and pay his fair share?"

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

The upcoming 2017 school year will be the first year WKU recruits players from outside of the university. The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our staring lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies. The University’s dedication and persistence in this effort is an institutional priority.

Player Recruitment Form: https://wku.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0OqUiJkK11c26mV Lastly, WKU has many scholarships available for students, including those in the eSports program. Be sure to check out our academic programs and our BEAUTIFUL campus!

If you have questions or to find out more information regarding becoming a player, or a degree and internship as: assistant coach, broadcaster, journalist, or social media marketer for the WKU eSports program, please email: WKUeSports@wku.edu"

5fuzn9,7,2016-12-01,Holiday with a family falling apart,Thefixernomore,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/5fuzn9/holiday_with_a_family_falling_apart/,"I'm really struggling with the holidays this year...my family is torn apart and we just get worse and worse.

Apparently this past summer my ubpd Mom drained the retirement account my dad set up for her. I don't know why he even set it up, after everything she's done. It hasn't been open long but she took the whole  $5,000 that was in there out. Because it was in her name she had access to it.

Well my sister in law is a financial advisor and manages the account and she was the one who realized it had happened. She confronted my mom about it in August because my dad had no idea. I'm sure my mom gave her the laundry list of reasons she felt she was entitled to the money. My sister in law told my mom she felt really uncomfortable with the situation and asked her to come clean to my dad. She didn't come clean and eventually my brother got involved. Many fights over phone calls were had and the anger and frustration has built up over the past few months. 

I have not been involved, my mom doesn't know I know about this. And last night when I called my mom to ask her a random question she was screaming hysterically about how she never wanted to see or talk to any of us ever again. I guess my brother told her they weren't going to pretend things were okay when she was around them. And that they weren't coming down anymore until she came clean. My brother and his wife have a baby- my moms first grand kid...which just makes everything even more spectacularly dramatic. 

Everyone is angry. I wish my brother and sister in law could just not give a shit about the fact that my mom took the money because it doesn't do any good ever to try and reason with my mom and it's a waste of energy being angry because they will never get her to change or admit she's wrong. I asked them to look past it but they can't.

The thing is I was just starting to go back to LC with my mom and had some relatively positive experiences and now it's all gone to shit.

So my brother and sister in law refuse to come down and stay over at the house. My sister moved to New Zealand for an internship, to get as far away as she could. My other sister came home for thanksgiving and had a really stressful time dealing with my mom and her emotions so she isn't coming for Christmas. My Dad, who currently lives with me and my boyfriend (because my mom keept calling the cops on him making up false accusations that he was ""abusing"" her when he was really just detached and trying to avoid a fight when he lived at the house) is supper detached and is basically clueless that all these problems are occurring. 

Christmas is (was) my absolute favorite time of year. I have SO many good memories growing up and even in the not to distant past- of being together with family and having fun... I usually bake 20 or so different kinds of cookies, make tons of perogis, and love decorating and finding gifts for people. ...and this year none of that is going to happen. Everyone has a problem with everyone else. It would feel like we were faking it if we all got together. I just feel like I'm on the verge of tears all the time. I don't even want to put up a tree. I just don't care. 

And to top it all off my mom claims she has no money. She told my brother she took the money out to pay for legal fees for a divorce. She's cried divorce for the last 3 years she just does it to get attention and to try to make my dad to change to whatever she wants him to be. 

We had a snowstorm a couple weeks ago and her driveway was drifted badly and I paid for someone to come plow because she was so upset saying she had no money (this was before I found out about the retirement account money). 

I have no family that I can lean on. No support system. I have spent the last 10 years taking care of my family and trying to fix things and make things work. And now I can't. Both because I realized I can't fix things and because it's just too broken. 

Please, has anyone dealt with this around the holidays- things getting way worse? What do you do? I just want Christmas to be over. "
5fv85z,1,2016-12-01,Potential locales for couples? Prague? More?,Wynonas_Beaver,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/5fv85z/potential_locales_for_couples_prague_more/,"Hello /r/TEFL!

My girlfriend and I have been looking into good places to perhaps move abroad for a year (potentially more, depending on how we like it) after we finish our degrees this year.

We are heavily considering Prague, and here is the post we made in /r/iwantout a few days ago:

We are a couple in the United States looking to take a little bit of time out of the States (maybe even more). She is 21, I am 20. We will both be graduating from a public university in April. My degree is a double-major in English and Communication, with Honors, hers will be a major in English with a minor in Spanish, with Honors. I have communications internship experience with a political campaign and have worked as a resident assistant for three years at my university. I am quite familiar with basic IT protocol including software and hardware, but have no formal training. She has worked a sort-of marketing position for our campus housing department for two years, and has studied abroad at Oxford. Outside of that the only experience we have is in retail.
We've done our research and it seems like Prague would be our preferred locale - we're fairly private, calm, laid-back people and it seems like the culture of the city and the country are what we want to live within, at least for a little while.

Neither of us have any debt, and between the two of us we have savings around $20,000 (could be more, we'd have to run the numbers, could potentially sell some things).

With our qualifications, it seems like the most reasonable and accessible path to expatriation is ESL. We've been doing some research into this. We could both afford CELTA, and there is a course offered near us this summer, but we are curious - does CELTA have any tangible benefits for teaching in the Czech Republic/elsewhere? Or would a cheaper ESL course bring us the same opportunities? We've struggled to find definitive answers to this, and understand here might not be the best place to ask.

We (obviously) want the best experience possible, and are willing to pay more up front for certifications to maintain a living salary in Prague. We understand that teaching ESL is no route to wealth - we don't really want wealth. Preferably, we'd be able to live a more relaxed life overseas than here in the States. That's part of the reason we're looking to make the move.
That brings me to my next question - I've seen some horror stories of expats being unable to find reasonable housing in Prague. Obviously, we will want to live together; we are not looking for anything extravagant. We will be content with modest arrangements. We would be gaining CELTA cert June/July 2017 and hopefully ready to move by late Summer.

We do not have to work together. We would be willing to work at separate schools/institutions. Additionally, we would both be willing to take on other jobs simultaneously, whether it was online ESL instruction, etc. I've been looking into other employment opportunities in the country as well (through expats.cz mostly), but with my limited credentials and fluency only in English, it seems my options are quite limited, especially without EU citizenship.

That's our situation, /r/iwantout. What do you think? Is this a practical road to take? If it is, would it be best to gain CELTA/other TEFL certs here, or wait until we are overseas? If you have experience with ESL (I know this isn't the primary sub for that), would you recommend seeking employment before hopping the pond or trying to find something once we're there? I've also heard that it is possible to make significantly more living outside the city limits? Does anyone here have any knowledge of that? (I'll be posting to other subs, too, but I figured I might as well ask here as well.)


That being said, we are open to other suggestions, but are struggling to find good information about good locales for couples to move to together. As far as we understand, as well, many national programs (such as EPIK) are unable to accommodate placement for couples. This is where we are looking to you for guidance - both in terms of Prague and other possibilities. Saving is not required, but if it is possible for us to put money away we would not turn it down =) Have any of you had experience moving abroad TEFL with your SO? Where did you go? Did you enjoy it?

Thank you all for any help!

5fvo4s,1,2016-12-01,High School Teen Working. Save or Spend?,XcrysdaleHAMAS,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5fvo4s/high_school_teen_working_save_or_spend/,"Hello all,

Before I go into this, I want to clarify that i'm relatively new to this sub-reddit, and realize this may not be the correct way of going about this so at the bottom there is a TL;DR should you be interested. Note: reading the details is not necessary, but gives a little insight.

Details:
I'm currently 16 living with parents enjoying a life of no true expenses except personal impulse buys. At the beginning of summer prior to sophomore year i began working a full time job as an intern of sorts at a company, making minimum wage ($10/hr). Since the beginning of summer I worked for three months for nearly borderline illegal amount of hours, accruing a lot of overtime. At the end of the summer I had made around $5000 after tax, a staggering amount to a minor such as myself (with no true expenses except gas etc...). The only large purchase I can see myself having to make in the future is a new car for college. Sorry that was a bit long winded, thanks for reading though!

Question: 
Is it worth strictly saving money while working as a teen? Or will it become small amount in the future? 

TL;DR
Worked for 3 months over summer to make $5000 as a teen with no expenses. Wondering if saving this money along with another summer's worth of work going to be substantial in my future as I prepare for college.

Sorry again if this is the wrong format or inconvenient to understand, like i said I'm relatively new.

Thanks for any opinions on the matter!"
5fwlqv,21,2016-12-01,"Please just for one day, get out of my damn head.",throwawayoutofmyhead,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5fwlqv/please_just_for_one_day_get_out_of_my_damn_head/,"I can't get you out of my head. 

It's been two months since you admitted you didn't love me anymore. It's been two months since we talked last. I ran into at the gym - first time seeing you since. We didn't say anything. You were my first love and god it hurt. It was shock at first, followed by a lot of intense pain, and then it dulled. 

But I just can't get you out of my head. I'm on my internship without a lot of friends in the city, I feel lost and alone. Every time I do something to enjoy myself it's overshadowed by this sense of greyness and sadness. If I escape for a few minutes without thinking about you I find myself happy I didn't think of you for a bit, then sad that I started again.  

It's not even about you personally. Half the time I'm just trying to convince myself in my head that I'm okay without you, that I'll be okay and I can do this. And I know that I can but christ it feels like so long since I've been happy. I can handle the pain, and the sadness, and the loneliness and the wishing that things have been different. I can understand that we were holding each other back, and that this was for the best. But I can't handle it every day without respite. It's taking it's toll on me. Every day thinking about how I'm going to be fine. Every day thinking about the memories we had. Every. Single. Fucking. Day.

I just want a break. Just one day where I feel happy and okay, where I don't wake up feeling like shit and where I can hang out with someone and enjoy myself without wishing you were there too. Just one goddamn day without you invading my thoughts at every turn. Just one day. "
5fwnb8,1,2016-12-01,Why am I suddenly such an unattractive candidate? (X-post from /r/internships),dejectedintern,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5fwnb8/why_am_i_suddenly_such_an_unattractive_candidate/,"Last spring, I applied for a summer software engineering internship. This was because the company sent recruiters to my school, and I decided ""what the hell, what's the worst that can happen?"" so I sent them my resume and got 3 back-to-back interviews. A couple weeks later, I was offered a position. This was the only internship I applied for because it was my first year of university and I thought it was too early to apply for internships.

This boosted my confidence a bunch. I'm an honors student, a double major (compsci and math), I make good grades, I'm good in my compsci classes especially (i'm generally the one that everyone asks for help when a project in class is too hard), and I even work closely with the Computer Science program coordinator as the Linux system administrator for the computer lab on campus. And on top of all that, now I have a software engineering internship with a Fortune 500 company after my first year of college? ""Wow! I must be doing stuff really right!"" I thought to myself.

I figured after this last summer, I would apply to a lot more internships, and I would look like a fantastic candidate. I still have all of the great things mentioned before, but now I also have a prior internship under my belt. And hey, even if I don't get an internship I like more, I can still go back to the same company for a second internship.
The end of the summer is when everything fell apart. I didn't get a return offer from the company. The other intern on my team (who goes to my school) told me that he didn't get a return offer for our team, but the company as a whole wants him to come back, so they're looking at other teams to put him on. He and I worked on the same stuff, had the same progress, were basically 100% on par with each other the whole summer. Why would they want him back, but not me?

This dropped my confidence a lot. I feel like an ass. I must have fucked up royally not to get a return offer.

But hey, I can still apply to other places.

I reapplied to the same company for a different team. The recruiter (same recruiter that recruited me last time) told me he'd love for me to reapply, and I got an interview. After the interview, the recruiter told me 2 things:

1) I have to apply online so my application is in their system. ""Don't worry, it's really simple.""

2) ""We'll be in touch in a couple weeks or so to follow up, regardless of whether you get the internship.""

Both of those were lies.

1) Their website had HUNDREDS of summer internships posted up that were relevant to software engineering, and I didn't know which one to apply for, or if I should apply for several. I picked the one closest to the one I interviewed for and applied for it. Then I emailed him, explaining what I did, and asking if it's sufficient. No email back (This was mid-October).

2) Still haven't heard back from them one way or another. Again, the interview was in mid-October.

Around the same time, I got two other interviews with different companies. One company I haven't heard back from yet, and another company rejected me. I emailed them thanking them for their consideration and for the interview and politely asking if they had any tips on what I could change in the future, and they haven't responded.

I've applied to 6 or 7 other internships, and plan on applying to more. Other than what I've said, I haven't heard back from anyone. Meanwhile, all sorts of students around me are getting offers left and right.

I feel like shit. I have no idea what I did wrong. I don't know how to fix this. I somehow went from a very attractive candidate to a very unattractive candidate, and I have absolutely no clue why, or how to fix it.

Sorry for the wall of text. I mostly just want to get this off of my chest."

5fx96i,6,2016-12-01,Advice needed - i would be very appreciative for some advice from developers in the field,Matty_cfc,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5fx96i/advice_needed_i_would_be_very_appreciative_for/,"Hello all, I am in need for some advice and would really appreciate some input. I'll give you a little background first. Over the last 12 months I have been pursuing a career change into android development. I am very confident in my skills. Using a number of books, online courses (Udemy - Rob Percival and Udacity), as well as personal mentorship from a mid to senior android developer, I believe I have gained the necessary skill sets to apply for junior/entry level android positions.  I have a few projects that i have worked on that display such skills. 

However, my career is in molecular biology research. I have a masters in human molecular biology and am doing pretty well in that field. During my career I have known this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life, and luckily I was introduced to android development, an industry that I am truly passionate about. 

Recently, a tech internship has presented itself to me. I have not been offered the position, but I feel with my current skill set I can be a top candidate for it. However, the internship is primarily for QA and product development, not so much coding. The employer is well aware of my high interest in getting industry experience, and said there could be an opportunity to spend some time during the internship in actual coding. Although I will be taking a huge paycut, i don't really care (to be expected). I don't so much have concerns about this position, but I would like some advice on the following:

Although I will be getting my foot in the door in a tech company, should I be worried that it's not centered around android dev? I think either way I will learn a lot from the QA and product dev position where I can learn more about the product life cycle, but will that help me apply for future android dev positions?

Does anyone else have experience were they started in a different role but found a way into actual app development? If so, what was your strategy in showing what you can do? How can I show off my skills so that i am considered for future dev positions within that company?

I'm super excited about this potential career switch, so any advice in general would be awesome!"

I do have a ps4 and have a fair amount of games to play on it! So now please I need to know if it is worth it to get one!

I'll try to be vague enough. I am Ellen, he's Clayton. I am 33 and he's 28. We met online through OKC this summer. We're both busy professionals and don't have time to date. Our first date was probably the best I had, 6 hours of talking endlessly. He said it was the best he ever had to. Due to lack of time, our dates have been a bit extreme, we went to California, Washington, NY and Arizona. We went on 2 regular dinner-ish dates before the trips, usually lasting 3-4 days at a time. We didn't have sex until 2 months in. Our relationship is already off to a bizarre start, but it's nice.

We don't communication often, due to work (I work 12 hour shifts, he has grad school and internship). I know some people are baffled by our lack of communication, we email each other once a week, probably text every other day but even then it's something of importance or planning the next trip. We rarely if ever talk on the phone. I've always been this way and kind of set up the guidelines when we first met, I am not a someone who needs to be in constant contact, and he was ok with it at first. But kinda put off by it. 

But when we do see each other it's as if we have never been apart. We can talk and share about everything and there has never been any tension or resentment, no issue for jealously or envy. We are both POC and both very conservative. We are both each other's first and he has never been in a long term relationship (but I have been in one, for two years previously). In October he started to ask these questions about the future, things that seemed important to ask, like ""where do you see yourself in 3 years? Do you want children? Would you be open for relocating?"" I tried to be honest but vague, if I was with the right partner, I would consider and be flexible but it isn't important right now. Maybe I am a moron but it just didn't occur to me that he was thinking there was potential in this relationship. I know I like him, respect him, often think of him, but there isn't LOVE there, I haven't been in a love so I am unsure of if it's happening or not. All I know is I enjoy spending time with him, and I look forward to getting to know him better and share experiences and traveling with him. 

In October he said something that threw me for a loop. It was the post season. My team had one of the BEST games in ages, it was the proudest moment for me and my favorite player, I was beyond happy and shared with him the stats and outcome of the game and he told me ""Whenever you are happy, I am happy, this game is just the start winning it all!"" Of course my team didn't win it all, but that comment really made me beyond happy and I told him even if he didn't mean it, it really was special to me and he said he meant every word that my happiness is his happiness.

He got a job in another state, we went to visit and he asked vaguely if I would come to the state again and if I thought of living here. We were visiting the state at the time, and we had a good time of acting like locals. I did enjoy it and told him I would visit. He said if I got to do everything I wanted to do here and I said I believe so. He got upset and then changed his entire attitude and body language. I could tell he was put off but we were still intimate and while he bed he said we shouldn't be serious and we should be friends. I was shocked and tried to play it cool, I didn't think I was putting pressure on him apologized to him if he thought I was putting pressure. I told him I enjoyed getting to know him and spending time with him. I was happy to be intimate with him and hope we could see each other in the future. 

Later we went out at night and we both have this number 1 rule we don't break due to our cultures, for him it isn't any public display of affection, he won't kiss in public (I assumed he didn't like me for the longest time and asked him about it but he said it was his culture and something he wasn't comfortable with) and I was ok with it, I asked around and learned this was true. But that night he kissed me in public, after the whole ""let's be friends speech"", not just once but at least a dozen times. It was surreal and I was happy. I travel a ton for baseball and he asked ""When I move here, will you visit for a game?"" I said I would be I didn't think my team would play the local team due to divisions, he then said ""They should play each other every day."" I mean, I thought it was sweet but what does that even mean? Does he want me to be with him or not?

We went back that night but we weren't intimate at all and actually left on kinda bad/awkward terms. He apologized saying he was too tired to have sex that night due to upcoming projects in university and the long flight first thing in the morning. 

Later on by email we are planning our next trip, a whole week in late December. He was counting down the days (16 to go!), something I didn't even do. He says he's eager and excited for the trip and I am so confused. Also it was my birthday, we NEVER discussed our birthdays, I am not a gift giving/wanting attention person and he asked my sister when my birthday was coming up, he said he remembered me mentioning it on our first date about how baseball doesn't play on my birthday, so he knew it was in the winter. He said we would have a proper celebration on the trip and wished me a happy birthday on the day of. Why would he break his rule of kissing in public? Why would he be counting down the days? Why would he ask about my birthday? If he doesn't care.

The only thing I can think of is maybe I pushed him away, due to my lack of wanting constant communication, due to not taking his questions about the future and relocation seriously, and maybe due to not being more open/girlish? My coworkers tell me I am really screwing this up by not being more like a ""girl"", showing my desire for him, being eager to see him and letting him know daily and being more flirting/showing affection. Could this be the case? I see the potential with him. I see a future. Should I really play all my cards on this upcoming trip? Should I be more open/loving than I've ever been? But is that even a good idea if he just wants to be friends? Imagine him wanting to just be friends and here I am being loving and holding his hand and he could be confused as to what the hell I am doing. 

I will update this after the trip. I promise!
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Dating for 7 months off and on. LDR? Asked vague questions about the future and relocating? He doesn't like the answer and insists on being friends but doesn't act like friends due to questions/signs of affection. Could I been pushing him away? How can I fix this?"
5fyagn,2,2016-12-01,I don't want to be another girl who compromises her goals for love. Looking for advice.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5fyagn/i_dont_want_to_be_another_girl_who_compromises/,"TL;DR My fiance keeps lying to me about failing classes. He might not ever get a degree, but I'm about to finish my M.A. in the spring. Does anyone have advice or insight if this is going to hurt us in the future?

I've been engaged to my fiance for almost a year now (I'm 23. He's 25). We have a wedding date set for this summer, and we've been together for a total of 2 1/2 years. For the most part, we've been incredibly happy together, except for one issue. He hasn't finished his undergraduate degree. He's currently taking a few online classes to finish his credit requirement, but each semester he lies to me about missing assignments, etc. And by the end of the semester, I find out he's failed another class, and wasted another $1k of our money by not passing. I love him so much, and I've let go of the fact that he might just never get a degree. But every time this happens (this has happened a total of 4 semesters now), the smallest faint idea that we shouldn't be together enters my mind. He's never lied about anything other than school. I love him so much and he's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. But I'm so tired of being lied to about this. And what does it mean that he can't get his shit together enough to just pass a f*****g 6-week online class? Or at least be honest with me about it when he starts failing? My biggest fear is being in a relationship that will make me sacrifice my goals and potential. 

Do any women or men for that matter have advice or insight into my problem? 

A little bit of background about us, and how we got to this point:

We met in undergrad. I graduated in 2015 and am now about to graduate with an M.A. in May 2017. He's in the marketing/videography/photography industry.
He was supposed to graduate in 2014, the year we met, but a series of random circumstances led us to living in Florida for 4 months while I completed an internship and he worked on the side. When we got back, I finished my last semester of college, but he did not. That was when the lying about school began.

He was finishing up some credit requirements at a junior college while living at home. He was taking about 5 classes. When we would see each other, I would ask him how it was going, and he would either find a clever way to change the topic or just straight up lie. He started a new job at a marketing firm halfway through that semester, and unbeknownst to me, stopped going to class. I didn't find out about any of this until it was time to register for the next semester.

When I found out, I was devastated, mostly because he had never lied to me before. But he promised he would get his shit together and that he really wanted to get his bachelors. But then it happened again. And again the following semester. And now it's happened again this last fall. He was let go from his marketing job in September. He used to use the excuse that fulltime work and school was too exhausting, which I completely understood. But now he's only working part time so that he could focus on school, but is still failing.

He has some problems being self-motivated, like with exercising, homework, other tasks for example. He doesn't like to be told what to do, and I absolutely hate sounding like a nagging Mom. But I've tried every incentive tactic, and nothing seems to work. I had to accept the fact that him getting a degree doesn't determine my love for him. I used to be adamant that I wouldn't marry anyone who didn't graduate college. He's so smart, though. A real autodidact. He knows everything there is to know about computers and technology. And he wants to start his own media consulting company once I graduate and we get married/move. So I know he can be motivated to do hard work when he needs to.

I'm mostly worried that working in the media industry and not having a degree will prevent him from getting a job he deserves. I will hopefully have a well-paying job after May. And I watched my dad go through unemployment and changing jobs every 3 years my entire life (he's a veteran turned high school teacher, so the job market isn't very stable). And I don't want that for my fiance. This summer is the last chance he has to finish the classes he needs to finish before he will basically have to give it up forever until he decides to go through the whole process of college again on his own when we're more stable/have more money. 

I apologize for how long this got, but anything is helpful at this point. Am I being overly sensitive? Should I stop trying to push him toward finishing? I'm just so unsure of what to do at this point because after May, everything except the wedding will be so up in the air."

5fyinn,6,2016-12-01,I Feel Like I've Missed out on College,That_Guy403,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5fyinn/i_feel_like_ive_missed_out_on_college/,"This may be somewhat disjointed but there's honestly just a fair amount I need let off.

I feel exhausted by day to day life at the point I'm at now.  I feel like I completely missed out on my window to have fun in college.  I'm a computer science major and all of my friends, even the ones I've known for years, just feel like coworkers who value me as a resource and nothing more.  I feel like I might have chosen the wrong major because even though I get good grades and have a good internship, my actual core skillset hasn't advanced at the same pace as everyone else in the past year and I'm getting ignored more and more by my friends since I'm not as useful.  I feel incredibly busy but every time I've tried to make time to be more social or branch out I've been rejected or ignored.

I just turned 22 and I'm graduating next year, but I feel like my college experience is already mostly over and underwhelming and I don't have any true friends or experiences outside of work or school to look back on.  I'm not extremely confident socially but it's not like I'm terrible at it or anything.  I take decent care of myself and I think I'm okay looking, and maybe it's just the demographic in the CS degree program, but it feels incredibly difficult to meet anyone new or connect at a meaningful level.  There are also very few social events at the University I'm at to speak of, everyone I know just goes to school, goes to work, and goes home.  It really sucks.

Another thing that's absolutely killing me inside which may sound silly is that I'm balding.  I've always had long, thick, reddish blond hair that was a big part of my identity and it's already at the point I can't wear it long anymore.  I was only 19 when it started and I'm scarred of the potential permanent side effects of the drugs, which is the only effective way to treat it at the moment.

That kind of goes back to me feeling like I'm missing out though.  It makes me feel older than I am and I feel like I'll be out of place with college age people before too long.  I just want some genuine friends.  I have hobbies I'm passionate about but at this point whenever I invite anyone I know currently to hang out, come to a game night party kind of thing, or do anything outside of work or school, I'm either ignored or declined.  I put a lot of work into some of the events too and I've kind of stopped doing it since it doesn't feel like anyone cares anymore.

Maybe other people are in a similar situation, I'm just really kind of down at this point in my life and have been for a few years.  I am taking anti depressants now as a side note, which did help a little bit, but didn't solve the underlying issues.

5g07at,2,2016-12-01,[CAN] Graduating next semester &amp; failed to secure a public accounting position after going through recruitment twice in my uni career; offered Accounting Clerk position with potential for growth -- should I take it?,accountingadviceplz,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5g07at/can_graduating_next_semester_failed_to_secure_a/,"A bit about me:

I'm 27 years old and took a bit of a convoluted path to get where I am now: started out as a Comp Sci major for a year, then switched to an East Asian Studies position for a year, took a year off university, went back to school and got a 2-year diploma in Bus. Admin (Accounting), then headed to university to get my B. Comm (Accounting). I'm graduating at the end of this semester.

I have had 3 semesters of internship experience plus worked through university part-time as a ""Project Accounting Assistant"". Most of what I've done is AP, tons of reconciliations (expense accounts, credit cards), worked on working papers for year-end, some project accounting &amp; on-demand reports for project managers, helped prepare AR invoices, helped pull files audits, and helped train students who are less senior than me. I don't mind the work though I kind of wish I could apply my accounting knowledge more. I am currently working there part-time but unfortunately I will not receive an offer upon my graduation due to budget cuts. Not much room there for progression or further learning, so I'd want to move on anyway.

I've tried applying for public accounting positions twice -- once when I was looking for my second internship (applied to 5 then -- mostly Big 4 and National firms) and got 3 1st interviews but no 2nd interviews. The second time I applied was during this past recruitment season and I applied for some Big 4, some industry, and a few smaller firms -- a total of 11 firms. Got 9 first interviews, and 3 second interviews (1 big 4, 1 national, and 1 very small firm). And, in the end, 0 offers.

I've got experience on student group councils, I went on international exchange, and I do some other volunteering. I also have a decent GPA (~4.4/4.5 for my 2-year diploma and ~3.7/4.5 for my degree -- sadly most of my GPA from my diploma didn't transfer over despite me getting credit for the courses otherwise it'd be much, much higher).

I'm also rather introverted and have some pretty nerdy hobbies, especially for a girl -- video games, East Asian culture and language, and some even more obscure stuff. I tried to talk mostly about my love of travel &amp; my experience with my international exchange during my interviews but apparently I have the social skills of a monkey and I know I'm also kinda terrible at telling stories, so I guess I somehow came across as socially inept to the firms I interviewed with despite the fact that I seems to be able to hold conversations with my coworkers (who I chat casually with at work 2-3 days/week). I also generally feel out of place in my faculty and can't really relate well to most students in the faculty. It's really a huge change from how I felt I fit in in Comp Sci, East Asian Studies, with the students at my exchange university, and in community college while getting my diploma. I just get the feeling I won't ever stand out or be more charismatic or be able to compete with (personality-wise) my fellow students in terms of public accounting positions.

One of the firms I applied to for a CPA recruitment position pulled their position, but a couple weeks ago I noticed they posted an Accounting Clerk position. I applied, got a call for the interview, and was offered the job two days ago. During the interview I made it very clear I wanted to get my CPA and progress past an Accounting Clerk role. When I got the call for the job I was told I was shortlisted for the CPA position job interview but they realized they didn't have a specific job to offer at the time so pulled the posting. Then a few weeks later they had a need for an Accounting Clerk so were happy I applied.

A few things about the company:
- Has about 120 accountants, ~50% of which are designated or are pursuing their designation
- Most of their senior accounting staff/managers/controllers seem to have come from a public accounting background, from what I can tell
- They are one of the few industry firms who recruit specifically for CPA positions, meaning they have an established support system in place to help their staff get their CPA. They are also one of the &lt;20 companies who recruit students from my university for CPA positions.
- My job offer includes a specific provision that states they will pay all my CPA tuition, though it has repayment clauses if I leave within a certain timeframe
- The person who called me with the offer told me they prefer their staff to complete their CPA within 5 years
- The salary is fairly decent (to start) and is way above minimum wage. It's comparable to a starting salary for a new staff accountant at a public firm, but obviously way less growth potential
- If I take my CPA via industry I may be locked out of public due to the need to take audit/assurance modules to do public (industry  generally requires performance management and one other module)

My question is: should I take the position? It's literally the 1st position I applied for after coming out of recruitment unsuccessfully. If I don't end up going where I want to go with this company within 6 months I can always quit and try recruitment again (I may have to quit to do it as this company is present at the major recruitment event and would know I was looking for another role).

tl;dr have experience in accounting through internships, graduating with B.Comm (Accounting) soon, failed recruitment hard twice, got Accounting Clerk offer that could maybe lead to career advancement as firm has indicated they will help me get my CPA -- should I take it?"

I started with an undercut and basically grew my hair out from there. I've collected a number of hairstyles that I really like and I'm hoping you could help me figure out which one might look the best.

**What I currently look like**
Without further ado, [here are some pictures of me.](http://imgur.com/a/9mWix) I apologize for the awkward poses or faces, I tried to get some different angles. I have a pretty large forehead and nose as you can see. Also, I will mention here that my hair is quite a bit thicker than it might look. I've certainly noticed this myself, and I've had countless barbers and hairdressers tell me the same.

**Information about my desired haircut**
Here's where it gets slightly more interested. I've recently become enamored with certain current Korean hairstyles. As far as shorter hairstyles go, I certainly prefer a disconnected look. However, I'm rather sick of the more severe look that I myself had and that continues to be popular in the U.S. currently. As far as the undercut goes, the styles I'm about to show you either have a much more blended look or the longer portion of the hair comes down further over the undercut. I probably explained that terribly, but hopefully you will see what I mean. Another aspect of these cuts that I like is the overall roundness to them. Also, I'm aware that Asian hair is different from Caucasian hair, and I have no idea if any of these cuts look normal on someone with white features. Having said that, it seems like people with Asian hair have to get a perm to achieve the texture for these looks, and my hair is already much closer to that final product. FINALLY I'll show you the cuts I'm looking at.

Please help me out with this.

* I have a real name (henceforth called my slave name) that I don't go by. I go by my pen name (henceforth called my name) everywhere I can, because I've been meaning to legally change it for a while. Soon, I will.

* I published two shitty self-published novels that are apparently stuck on Amazon forever, even after unpublishing them. The titles are under my slave name, with initials for my first and middle name, then my slave name last name.

* I then decided to try to re-self-publish them when I found out about Lulu (a cheaper self-pub company). I used the same title names, only they were under the author name of my now new name.

* I found out CreateSpace is pretty much the best self-pub company around, and I should have gone with them. One of my novels is 120k words, and Lulu is only good for shorter novels, so my book is $22.50 on Amazon.

* I want to go through CreateSpace now with both books.

* I just started an internship as a copy editor under my name, the same name I use for my books. (Not my slave name.)

* I am about to publish my first opinion piece post for them. This is permanent and cannot be undone, unlike my blogs that I recently deleted.

* I am confused on how to proceed with writing articles, if I should, or if I should just copy edit as a career and focus on my novels on the side.

* One of the novels has some weird sci fi sex stuff mentioned in the synopsis and I worry that it will be tied to my name.

The only answer I can think of is going by my initial and then last name under CreateSpace, creating a new side of amazon with my books and what I want them to show, and retain my name for copy editing (and possibly journalism). Do copy editors write pieces too sometimes?

5g15hu,8,2016-12-01,[Aide] Concerns about the ethics of the clinic I am currently working for,throwmeaway62662,physicaltherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/5g15hu/aide_concerns_about_the_ethics_of_the_clinic_i_am/,"Throwaway because this is pretty sensitive stuff. I'm currently working at a privately owned physical therapy practice with the floor staff consisting of only one doctor and a team of four aides, including myself. There are usually 1-2 aides working at a time, and I'm the only aide working MW mornings currently until my coworker comes in after lunch. We offers aquatic therapy and has a small therapy pool on the upper level of the facility. We do perform modalities such as ultrasound and e-stim which from what I've heard are not legal for aides to do, but that's the least of my concerns since every clinic I've worked in had their aides performing these tasks.    

My main concerns are mostly about the doctor herself and her practices. She is constantly violating HIPAA laws and saying the full names of patients out loud in front of other patients, discussing patient cases in front of other patients, especially around the patients whom she knows outside of the clinic or other patients she is partial to, and even complaining about some of the patients openly to other patients. If there is more than one patient on the floor, there are times where the doctor spends the entire hour with the patient she favors and leaves the other patient(s) in the care of an aide, so the patient gets no time with the doctor herself. This includes some medicare patients. Also if there is a patient requiring pool therapy, that patient is in the pool for the entire duration of their session, but the pool is always run by an aide and since the pool is on the second floor, the Physical Therapist is not overseeing any of the pool therapy at all.  

There have also been some cases where myself or one of my coworkers have had to deal with verbal abuse from the doctor. She's open to swearing at us on the floor with patients around, and will complain about us and how we are incompetent if we make a mistake to the patients sometimes. Of course, this isn't a daily occurrence but it just makes me very uncomfortable and embarrassed the times I've been called out in front of patients and have openly heard her talking badly about me to a patient she knows outside of the clinic. The first time it happened to me, my fellow aide and the office manager were quick to pull me aside and sympathize with me, explaining that they have all been in similar situations as me at one point or another and it's just how the doctor is, but if this is true then I'm not sure I want to keep working at this facility, on top of all the ethical problems I've been noticing with no HR to speak to since it's a privately owned practice.  

To be honest, I would have left already had my resume looked a bit better. Although I had a physical therapy internship during my undergrad and have worked as an aide at two other locations previously, I had the two other aide jobs earlier this year. Basically I'd sent my resume to a ton of places and landed a bunch of interviews, and was hasty and accepted the first job (another privately owned facility with one doctor). Then the second job called, and not wanting to miss an opportunity, took the interview and decided to take the second job as there were more PT's and also an OT on the premises, so I learned far more there than I would have at the first aide job. This job I ended up taking when the second job was no longer being flexible with the fact that I am taking classes part time to take prerequisite courses in preparation to apply for more schooling, and this place is also closer to my home. But because I have so many aide jobs on my resume now from within the year, it's looking like I'm an unstable employee and cannot keep a job and that has become an issue during other positions I was interviewing for at the same time I was interviewing at my current workplace.  

Basically I would like to leave, but at the moment I can't really afford to but all of my concerns surrounding my current workplace and the doctor are really taking it's toll on me and I know in my gut that some of these practices can't be ethical, but I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm keeping an eye out for other postings while I keep this job in the meantime, but any advice on how to deal with this situation would be greatly appreciated."

1. It'll be okay. You won't fail. Law schools rarely fail students because, well, you got dat $$.

2. Ignore everybody walking out of that room. Don't be that person to talk about the exam. It's done and over with, move on, no one cares what issues you found, what you argued, it doesn't matter. The exam is submitted, and there's absolutely nothing you can do. Once you're done, move on to the next exam.

3. You probably won't feel like you aced an exam. And if you do, chances are, you probably messed up. If you walk out of an exam not sure how you did and constantly thinking how you could have done x, y, and z. You probably actually did well because that's a sign that you really did know the content and were thinking about creative arguments. So, don't stress.

4. There's nothing you can do about your finals now that they're over, so don't worry about them. Once you're finished with all your finals: rest. Get that resume ready for 1L internships, and start submitting to 1L SA &amp; Federal/State Judicial Internships the moment your grades are released. 

5. Enjoy the fact that you're now 1/6 of the way done with law school. (If it's anything like my first semester, it went by pretty damn fast---but probably not soon enough).

Good luck peeps!"
5g1sdh,16,2016-12-02,My stepdad [40/M] called me [18/F] a fat junky piece of shit. How do I manage living with him until I can afford to move out?,throwaway34059834583,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g1sdh/my_stepdad_40m_called_me_18f_a_fat_junky_piece_of/,"I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible. He has been married to my mom for 9 years. I've never liked my stepdad -- and at first, you could chalk it up to teen angst, and while I'm still a teen, my hateful feelings towards him have only grown as I become more and more aware of how he is. I also want to state that we've gotten into verbal arguments before. The most severe one was when I was fourteen and lied about where I was -- he choked me and called me a b-tch. 

I don't really want to delve into why we got into a fight tonight because it is irrelevant to what I want advice for and I feel like it would make the post way too long. To put it short, he goes out with my younger sister (3 y/o) all of the time and never asks me if I want to join them. He has the right to do whatever he wants with his daughter. But if you're going to act like my father for 9 years, wouldn't it be plausible to ask me to come along? I want to spend time with my sister too. He doesn't think so. I brought this up to him and he mentioned that he didn't want to see my face. 

That hurt a lot. This guy will make me feel like shit, and then when I react, he acts very nice, which makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. He has done nice things, only so that he could bring them up whenever he's called out for doing something bad. Ever since I turned eighteen (legal adult), he has seemed to get more passive-aggressive. 

Anyway. I said something that I shouldn't have -- ""fuck you"". I know that I'm going to get comments mentioning how I deserved this since I didn't respect an elder and whatnot, but you're right, I have no respect for him as he has no respect for anyone else. He is shitty to me, he is shitty to my mother, he is shitty. And it was a huge catharsis. I'm sorry but I do not believe that adults have the authority to walk all over children (in reference to my younger years) and demand respect when they are acting outright abusive. I'm not sorry that I said that to him but I can admit that I shouldn't have. 

He exploded. I went in my room. He called me a fat lazy junky piece of shit. For reference, I am fat, because I gained 130lbs due to depression/anxiety/PTSD. I'm 5'11 and am going to the gym everyday and also have a trainer so that I can look like my old self again. The lazy part is in reference to me rarely leaving my room. There are a bunch of contributing factors to that, but I suffer from severe depression and it is very hard to leave my bed sometimes. But I do okay. I intern at a photography studio in the city twice a week and I go to the gym. I am trying to function. I occasionally/socially smoke weed but I'm pretty sure the ""junky"" part was meant to be a jab at the fact that I seemingly don't do anything with my life.

What he said didn't really bother me in regards to my appearance/behavior. I know who I am and who I was and he has nil understanding of mental illnesses so while it hurt at first, it doesn't really mean anything to me. What bothered me is that I'm living with a grown man who is obviously harboring a bunch of hatred for me -- one that has pretended to be nice and to do all of these nice things for me, when apparently he cannot stand to look at my face and I'm a fat lazy junky piece of shit. I feel unsafe. 

I understand that you guys are getting only one side of the story here and I am leaving out bits about my behavior. I'm a very calm and quiet person which I think sometimes comes off as aloof. I have the attitude of I think any 18 y/o teenager. I'm not saying that I'm not guilty for instigating and whatnot, but that reaction was a result of a whole lot of pent up frustration from years of being gaslit by this dude. I could've handled it in better ways and I know that.

He has put his hands on me before and has called me various names, he yells at my mom all of the time and never does anything to help her, etc. I do not like him.

My mom was there when this whole thing happened and she was in shock when he said what he said. She sat down with me and told me that I have to respect him because I live in his house (this is her house too and she makes more money than him. He has never directly provided me with money for anything but I can respect that he is also putting money into this house) but I do not have to talk to him.

And I don't want to. I have no desire to reconcile anything here. Zero. I do not want to talk to this man ever again in my entire life. 

I still live at home with my mother but I am in the works of getting out. I guess I just wanted advice on how to continue going about my day while he's here. And I know that my sister is only my half-sister, but I love her with all of my heart and always want to spend time with her. My mom still wants me around her of course and my little sister loves me but I feel as if this is going to take time away us. I've also heard my stepdad bad-mouthing me to my sister which hurt a lot. I hate him and I still have never done that as he is her father and I want her to have a healthy relationship with him. 

This ended up being long still and I'm not sure if anyone will read this but thank you if you have.

**Edit**: Also, how do I continue to navigate a relationship with my little sister? I'm 15 years older than her but I love her with all of my heart and even when I move out, I want to visit her as often as I can.

I am currently enrolled in college full time to get my bachelor in Computer Science. I am just finishing up my first year and I am working at Domino's pizza as a driver for 25~ hours a week on top of this. So far I have been able to do fine and my grades are decent, but I am on a regional campus and have yet to dive into the degree-relevant and challenging courses.

I have consulted a couple of friends of mine who have already obtained their CS degrees and they warn me that the degree program is quite difficult, and my spending so much time working could have some serious negative implications on my schoolwork (both of them did not work while going to school). They tell me to find a way to leave my job and spend my summers working paid internships. I would really like to make this happen, but it would be difficult with my wife's and my income level.

My wife is currently working part time, but plans on looking for full-time positions or picking up another job. We have no kids and rent from my father at a reduced cost. We are both early 20's, have no debts, 2 cars, and about $30k in liquid assets (mostly in the bank and some stocks). We don't make a lot of money, though (just about enough to come up slightly in the green currently) and are paying tuition out of pocket, which will go up once I transfer from the regional campus to the main campus starting sometime my junior year. I would like to avoid loans if at all possible as we am lucky enough to have money in the bank. I am hoping once I get my degree I will be able to jump right into a good paying job and start making up for the lost work hours (although I know you cannot rely on money you haven't made).

&amp;nbsp;

Are there any steps I can take to make this possible?"
5g4ioz,106,2016-12-02,Discussing code status - What's your spiel?,DamnYellowKnight,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5g4ioz/discussing_code_status_whats_your_spiel/,"Hi there. Medicine intern here.

One thing I've been thinking I need to refine a lot is my discussion of code status with patients, especially at time of admission. Right now, when I ask patients about it, it usually goes like this:

""Now, I have somewhat more serious questions to ask you, and please do not be alarmed. These are questions I ask all of my patients when they come into the hospital.
If, god forbid, anything were to happen and your heart were to stop, would you wish for us to do all we can do bring you back, including chest compressions and electrical shocks?
If, god forbid, your breathing were to stop, would you want us to place a tube down your airway and place you on a ventilator to assist your breathing?""

I've run into a few problems with my approach namely:
1) Sometimes people look at me all baffled and say ""OF COURSE DO EVERYTHING WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT"" even when their condition honestly calls for deep consideration of these questions.
2) Some people seem very averse to the idea of intubation and ventilators, but are totally fine with CPR. So I end up with these people wanting to be DNI, but not DNR...Which my attendings have told me is not really an acceptable code status.

One of my palliative care attendings worded it this way:
""If your heart were to stop or your breathing were to stop, would you like to die a natural death or die on machines?""
Granted, this approach did make people more likely to elect for DNR/DNI, but I feel really icky about it, because it seems to be a leading question in a way. Who honestly wants to die on machines vs a natural death?

I guess I want to know, how do you experienced doctors of meddit have a frank, earnest discussion to establish code status on your patients, regardless of the severity of their condition? I want to have a good way to talk to them about it that is thoughtful, sensitive and yet has them make an intelligent, informed decision. And I feel like a lot of patients probably don't fully understand the implications of what ""doing everything"" means, even when given the standard explanations.

Forgive me in advance if this sounds like a really stupid question."
5g519y,2,2016-12-02,To go back to j-school or to not go back - need advice.,JustinPSports,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/5g519y/to_go_back_to_jschool_or_to_not_go_back_need/,"**TL;DR:** Should I go back to journalism school to complete my final semester or forgo it and try and build my career on my own?

I have the option to go back to journalism school to finish my last semester of college next month after pulling out last year for personal reasons. In most cases, it would be an automatic yes.

Unfortunately, since being accepted in October to come back (I had straight As before I took time off), the school's credibility in my eyes has dropped to the basement floor.

In a month and a half, this school has:

- Had rampant cases of students being encouraged to do stories with obvious COIs. For example, I had to tell the program coordinator one day while I was there it would be a bad idea to assign a story about the issues with the costs of upgrading the city's arena for the Memorial Cup to the host team's intern. Other teachers have encouraged people to do stories on things they have COIs to just to pass.

- I confirmed one student had switched the dates for a past story they did a year prior and submitted it for an assignment last month. They did it while in class. No punishment came from that.

- An ex-significant other who still goes to the school (very long story) told me his profs wanted other people to do some of his tests for him at home - as in, have them tell him what to write and all the answers - so he could pass a math class.

- The quality of the program I have a semester left in has sharply dropped. Because just two people (nine of the 11 students enrolled are from China or Brazil, none majors in anything journalism-related) this year had any type of journalism experience beforehand, they have dumbed down the whole year-long course. When helping out (as a way to get used to the building and to see what to expect), they said they had not done any TV packages up to that point and the editors decided if their stories were good enough to be published or not. None of them look capable of being in the field when they graduate in April.

- The school is in need of thousands of dollars in new equipment, but is completely broke.

- Finally, the tipping point. A student plagiarized part of a story I did for a sports website I co-run last month. They copied one of my quotes word for word and paraphrased a whole paragraph. I have just been told today I can expect a personal apology from that student. He is also on academic probation now too.

Add on the fact that only five people I know of are still in the journalism field who graduated from the program I would be re-enrolled in from the past four graduating classes (three of whom had prior degrees or experience) and how I heard the program coordinator warning a prof that the whole building could be shut down in two years and it's hard to decide what to do.

I've gotten more job opportunities through my freelance work than anything I did from the school since pulling out. In fact, the way they taught me how to use social media almost got me fired from a position  on my first day last month.

Let me also break it down this way.

The benefits of going back are, in my opinion:

- A graduate certificate for the course (not a diploma or a degree)
- Possible connections to the local news outlets
- A chance to learn anything I missed the year prior ... if they teach them and not dumb down the semester's courses

And the negatives are:

- Everything listed above
- Needing a student loan to go back
- Not having a job to pay for car insurance (I work full time in a factory right now to supplement my freelance work)
- Risking losing my credibility
- Risking losing my freelance positions due to the demanding schedule

Then, there's the 'what-if' situation. If I go back and cannot get a job afterwards, I am screwed career-wise and financially. Also, I could be stuck working in this factory for life - just like my mother and my grandmother did for a living - if I do not go back.

I am just really confused right now."
5g5gmr,1,2016-12-02,Where did I messed up?,Wormattack1,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/5g5gmr/where_did_i_messed_up/,"I met a girl on tinder a few weeks ago. She was from Alberta and came to my city for a 1 year internship for the Canadian Space Agency. She was the outdoorsy type of girl, vegan and stuff but she was pretty cool. I invited her to shoot guns and she gladly accepted. I picked her off the metro and we talked a lot. We arrived at the range and she had a blast shooting dozens of SKS rounds. 

After we shot, I asked her: ""So...what made you swipe right?"". She answered: ""Well it's your eyes, they are amazing"" to which I immediately replied: ""Wanna see them up close?"" and kissed her. We kissed a lot but she had to go to her apartment because she was preparing dinner for her roommates (I call bullshit on that) so I dropped her off to the metro and prepared to meet again by the end of the week.

After 2 days, I didn't hear anything about her so I simply texted her how she was doing and if it's still alright for friday. No answer and friday passes. Then by monday of the next week, I simply text her ""Ghosting ain't cool. Just say it so if you weren't interested. Don't waste my time"". She replies the next day that she suffers from depression and couldn't write me back and that now I know her greatest weakness. I texted her if she wanted to talk about it or simply go out for coffee and chill out but she wasn't that receptive. 

At that point, I was a little pissed off because I felt she was just fucking around with me so I wrote: ""Well what were you expecting out of Tinder? Curing your disease?"". It sounded better in my head because she wrote me back how much of a judgemental asshole I was. I don't quite remember what I replied but after a week, I wrote her back that hurting her wasn't my intention and I didn't react well and wished her a happy trip to our city.

The awkward thing is that I recently went out climbing with my friends...at the same climbing center she is going and she did notice me.

Where did I fucked up? Should I go talk to her again? Was her attraction level too low?"

I'm also a full time student studying PR and Enviormental Studies. 

Bottom line, I hate my job. I'm very grateful to have a job, but going to work makes me miserable. The service industry is extremely negative and vile. My coworkers are often extremely curt and my managers don't care enough to change anything. Food doesn't move me the way that it moves them. When I initially took the job, I just wanted something to pay my bills that worked with my school schedule. Since getting the job, I've taken on freelance projects and internships that have shown me that I'm capable of doing much more while I'm in school. Working there fuels my depression and I've gone to bed crying over this job every other week. 

My managers want to move me up to being a server, but I don't want to. I'm currently job hunting for something closer to my majors. I'm also studying for finals. A part of moving forward requires me to take tests. These are tests that I would expect to take for a college course. Extremely extensive amount of knowledge is required for food and beverages and I don't have the mental capacity for it. They want me to take these tests during my finals weeks.

I've explained to my managers that now isn't a good time, but they're hassling me to take the tests. I can't even find the energy inside of me to do so. I just want to be an assistant until I can find a new job. Am I being a big baby?

Last summer as an intern I received a signing bonus and that messed with how I was taxed the rest of the pay periods. I was at a Big 4 Accounting Firm and was told that they prorate the income tax rate off your first pay check. This sounds wrong to me instinctively, but it was a Big 4...

I need advice on the best way to handle it.",mightbedylan,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5g62ic/due_to_a_series_of_unfortunate_events_i_foresee_a/,"Hello everyone, thanks much for taking the time to read this.

My pretty-decent paying internship is coming to a sudden end. I thought I had until the end up this month but somewhere along the line I got some info wrong, and it turns out its ending next week. I've been applying for jobs like crazy and have a few prospects that seem very very very likely, but the hiring process will take a few weeks and I likely won't see a paycheck from a new job for at least a month and a half. Considering the holidays coming up I assume many places won't be doing much hiring until the start of next year, so that pushes things out even further.

I recently purchased a car and have $350/month payments on it plus insurance, phone bill, and some medical bills.

On top of this I am currently living with my mom in small town no where and am definitely going to have to move for any feasible job I've applied for, and that's going to be a large upfront cost.

Recent emergency events in my life have drained my finances, and even this last paycycle at my internship has been nearly cut in half by holidays and being very sick.

So for this next month It's looking like I'm not going to be able to cover most of the bills, and I'm not sure the best way to handle it. I know it's largely due to bad planning, I should have been applying for jobs last month, but anxiety and depression have gotten the best of me.

I really just need a way to manage maybe the next 2 months of bills, and I've been considering getting a personal loan for about $2,500 just to make entirely sure I can cover everything. I have very good credit so I know I could get a decent loan with good rates, but I'm wondering how effective it will be in the long run, or if there are any other options I might look into?

I have a handful of freelance type work that comes and goes that provides a small bit of income, but not nearly enough to cover all the upcoming problems. Under my regular paycheck it all would have been no problem but having such a big gap between paydays is going to be difficult.

So what would be my best move here? Should I tackle a personal loan or seek other options?"

**Toonami Pre-Flight** *episode 93: all aboard the Vindication*    
presented by Gill Austin and Jason DeMarco

Summary:    
**Show review: Blue Dragon**    
- brief background: when his village is attacked by an enemy, Shu receives the power of shadows from a warrior, allowing him to summon the powerful Blue Dragon from his shadow to defeat his enemies                           
- aired for 102 episodes from April 7, 2007 to March 28, 2009           
- premiered concurrently on Cartoon Network and Toonami from March 29 to June 28, 2008 until it moved to Toonami Jetstream for some time        
- based on Blue Dragon, the RPG released on Xbox 360 in 2006      
- Gill and Jason weren't fans of it since the the network forced it to air on Toonami; Jason has warmed up to the show since then    
- two steps away from being one of many card game shows, but it's fairly likeable in its cast and animation    
- based on Cartoon Network's not so great promo, they were hoping the show would have greater appeal outside of normal Toonami viewership; they were wrong    
- often forgotten due to its short air time, you can now find the series on Hulu if you're interested

5g72o7,4,2016-12-02,I'm on to something? Or am I Crazy?,watermelonicecream,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5g72o7/im_on_to_something_or_am_i_crazy/,"Hi everyone, I found this sub a few months ago, I have read many stories and admire how strong some of the people of this sub are. I have commented on a couple posts I could relate to but never posted myself, that being said I need advice on my situation, affirmation or constructive denial is very much appreciated. This post is going to be about my family situation but also about me. I apologize for the length. For context I am 24/M and live at home. My post is going to be all over the place sort of a life story then a current circumstances, for the purpose of advice and support. If it's too long for you to read, I understand. 

Basically my father is absolutely an N, he's immature, possesses no empathy, grandiose, delusional, self-entitled, has racist and homophobic tendencies, a pathological liar, can't formulate a sentence without using fuck or shit as many times as the non-profane words he chooses, he doesn't shut up and when he speaks it's on two topics, either himself or trashing another person. 

This all started when I was elementary school aged I was around 8 and for some reason my father bought my drum set as my 8th birthday gift (picture one of those guys with big hair who played in a rock band in the 80's at 60 years old that's basically my father currently). 8 year old me was confused and unimpressed as he sit there and bang on it, and I guess he was offended by the fact that I didn't take interest is this. Anyway drum set was returned and basically I was ignored from this point forward, all his attention seemed to shift towards my little brother at the time as he was 5 (21/M currently). Life went on and I continued to try and engage is a child does in various ways, I remember specific engagement attempts as I would imagine they're burned into my mind because they were somewhat traumatizing to me. I remember an instance in which I was excited to tell him my favorite baseball player was Ken Griffey Jr. or that I thought NASCAR was cool his responses were all similar, just generic ""Why the fuck would you like that?"" or ""That's fucking stupid.""

When I was around 10 I started playing hockey, I really loved it and I was very good. I tried on out for a select team that traveled regionally and nationally to play in various tournaments. When this happened my dad became very involved and I would say these are the only few years of my life that I had a healthy relationship with him. At around 15 things changed I wasn't having as much individual success and I was cut from the very good select team (partly because kids were starting to get bigger and stronger while I was 6'3 and 140 lbs. soaking wet.) I went to play for a different local team that wasn't very good, and my father's attitude toke a complete 180. It was this big chore to take me to hockey but my mom made him do it if she couldn't because she was busy with work. My dad would basically take me not say a word to me drop me off tell me he wouldn't be coming in the rink to watch. When practices/games were over if I wasn't out of my gear in &lt;10 minutes he would come into the locker room and scream at me to hurry up. I'd get in the car and he would drive home in silence, if I asked to stop and get something to eat afterward I would get yelled at and told I was selfish or taking advantage of him, his favorite phrase was ""I give you an inch and you take a yard."" if I tried to engage him at any point in my life during this time period I would just get one word answers with an elevated voice or an attitude like ""Whatever."" or ""I don't Know"". If I coped an attitude towards him and my mom wasn't around he would basically back me into a corner in the living room and hit me, and I would basically brace myself and cover my head/face. 

Around this time I was also being bullied pretty heavily in school (didn't have many friends) and stopped caring about my grades, my physical appearance, hygiene, I quit hockey not because I was tired of losing but because I couldn't handle the stress my dad brought into the situation (this pretty much separated me from the only friends I had). In high school I had an interaction where I was being bullied by a teacher on a daily basis, an English teacher's (young popular ""cool"" teacher) classroom was right next to my locker. Whenever I had to go to my locker in between classes  the teacher would be hanging outside his classroom and would communicate to me that I was ugly, there was no way any girls where interested in me, ""Your the ugliest kid I've ever seen."" that kinda stuff other kids would laugh or join in. Eventually I broke down and revealed this to my mom who was horrified and called the school. School handled it horribly, sat me and the teacher in this room where the teacher basically started to cry and guilt me into say that I made the accusation up. Anyway the important part of this section is my mom was there with me at the meeting but my father chose to not go, so his child was being verbally abused by an adult and I guess it wasn't that important.

Well high school ended and I started at community college, and pretty much right after started doing drugs pretty heavily. Xanax, adderall, and anabolic steroids. Stopped going to school, bounced around from one shitty job to another. Eventually my mom found all my drugs, syringes etc. She was horrified broke down asked me why was it I was doing these things why did I feel as if I needed these things etc. My dad didn't even flinch didn't come talk to me just went about his life going to work everyday or doing whatever he wanted and only what he wanted. Basically, he's never taught me anything, never once had a man to man conversation with me, no birds and the bees, no here son ill teach you how to shave etc. What was alarming to me was I worked part time at his job when they needed extra bodies (pretty basic general labor) and every one of his co-workers new about my drug issues, so I felt as if he was using my issues to harness attention from his co-workers but never once approached me to talk or anything like that.

Basically my self-esteem is destroyed, I cry multiple times a week, majorly depressed, teetered on the thought of suicide for years but afraid to follow through, may have an eating disorder, have terrible social anxiety, I look in the mirror and all I see is inadequacy, I would imagine a normal person looks at themselves and sees potential. Additionally, this has all manifested into this perfectionism were nothing is ever good enough for me. For example, I need to be 5% body fat, I need to get my haircut every week, I need to brush my teeth after every meal and actively use a teeth whitener each night etc.

Fast forward to this year, I am currently a junior at a large state university although I commute to one of the satellite campuses. I am a stem major have a 3.7 GPA and think I know what I want to do for a living. Although I got a B last semester in organic chemistry and nearly had a mental breakdown because of it (the perfectionism). Even though I am still actively doing drugs I am functional. Still actively being ignored by my dad he doesn't no anything about me, my major, my goals, didn't even know I got accepted to university until my mom told him after which he un-enthusiastically said congratulations and put his hand out, I shoke his hand but really wanted to hit him in the mouth instead. 

A few months ago I kind of had an awakening and realized my home environment is not normal, not for me but for my mother. Basically my dad goes to work and comes home and sits on the couch, my mom has basically been his human slave for 30 years. I actively help her doing as much as I can but If I can't help her because I'm at school or studying She cooks dinner herself, cleans up dinner, cleans the bathrooms, mows the lawn, does the laundry, and works just as much as my dad. So I've started expressing to my father (it not such a nice manner because of all the resentment I have for him) that he has to actually do something around the house and help his wife. This is met with heavy push-back, I am belittled by him verbally. He tells me ""why don't you get a job"", as I'm not working at the moment although I'm a student at university and have been interning each semester but unfortunately the internships haven't been paid., and I have nearly 5K saved from previous work experience. In a recent event he basically told my mother if she doesn't like they way things are she can leave. To that I flipped out at him and pretty much called him every name in the book, my brother then erupted stating that how dare I be so disrespectful to ""the person who decided to bring me into the word"" dad storms out of the house and my brother follows him. The next morning my mom approaches me and basically yells at me and tells me ""You hurt him, he loves you"" and tells me about how my dad tells her how he loves me and is proud of me but he actively ignores me. I feel as if he is manipulating my mom and playing the victim while painting me as some inconsiderate jerk of a son. Additionally, I have finally begun communicating to my mom about my disappointment with the way my father treated me as a child and how he currently treats me and her reaction is ""you need to get over that"" or ""there people out there who have it way worse than you"".

So I basically had another awakening a couple weeks ago but this time finally for myself. I always thought to myself I really got bullied badly in high school and it turned me into this depressed, anxiety ridden, psychological mess of a human being. But now I feel as if I've turned into this psychological mess because my emotional needs have been ignored by my dip-shit of a father all my life and if I say anything to my mom she just suppresses my needs by telling me to get over it or telling me that their is someone, somewhere who has it worse than me.

5g7bjv,2,2016-12-02,I [23/M] made plans with this girl [22/F] thinking she was interested. Now pretty sure she has a boyfriend.,sukizka,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5g7bjv/i_23m_made_plans_with_this_girl_22f_thinking_she/,"Hi Reddit, I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but for someone who's usually pretty even-keel, today's been a bit of a rollercoaster of emotions.

So I recently moved across the country to begin this graduate program in the field I want my career to be in. My one class is a sort of introductory course to the program, so most of the people there are also in their first term like me.

Maybe about 3-4 weeks into the term I ended up sitting next to Layla. I've never really noticed Laylah before this point because she generally is in the back corner and tends not to speak up in class. However, today when she's talking to the people around her she keeps mentioning how tired and awful she feels. I eventually do an ""Aw, why's that?"" and learn about her internship where she works a ton.

I leave at the end of that class generally with the opinion that she seems nice.

A few weeks later, I'm there early talking with my friend, Matt, when Laylah walks over with an ""Oh hey guys!"" and sits down next to us. We end up talking for awhile (we were there really early) about where we're from, where in the area we live now, and I learn that Laylah and I actually live pretty close (school's in a large metropolitan area, so people live all over). We really hit it off and eventually it became mainly just the two of us talking, with Matt kind of pushed to the side.

This is where I start to get a little smitten.

A couple more weeks go by with nothing notable happening until a few weeks ago. I see her outside the classroom as we wait for the previous class to leave, so I walk over to say hi. I'm wearing a sweatshirt from my new internship, so somehow or another we get to talking about our two different internships. I playfully tease her since we quickly realize how much better mine is.

There were a few other small things that made it seem as if she was interested/flirting. A couple times she would randomly touch me, like on the shoulder or back, and when I'd go ""What is it?"" she'd say something like ""Oh I was just feeling what your sweatshirt felt like"" which seemed a bit odd to me. There was also complimenting my (admittedly cool) shoes and an insistence to see them, as well as leaning over into me to look at the basketball game I was watching on my phone.

I don't have a lot of experience in this field, but it struck me that she was more than just being friendly. If I was more confident, I probably would've asked her out that night, but as I said, I don't have a lot of experience, which leads to a lack of confidence, so I went and added her on Facebook instead.

Red flag time! When going to add her on Facebook, I see her profile picture is her sitting on this guy's lap with his arm around her. (Jeez, /u/sukizka you're an idiot, that's her boyfriend!) Naw, that can't be it, she's holding a drink, so this is *obviously* a party, and people are friendly at parties. It's definitely just a friend of hers...right?

So I added her the night of our class, and the next day I went in to work at my internship. My internship allows me to occasionally get free tickets to these games, and my boss had a couple extra, so he offered them to me. Unfortunately I was busy that night so I couldn't go, but you know who wasn't busy that night?! No, not Matt, guess again. Yep, there it is, Laylah. Oh and would you look at that, we're friends on Facebook now, so even though I don't have her number I can message her and see if she wants them. I'm so nice! She's super grateful and happy

""you're awesome""

""you're amazing, thank you again!!!""

Oh yeah, look at all of those exclamation points.

Anywayss, we didn't have class for a little over a week after that because of a holiday, so yesterday was the first class since then. I'm holding the door open for people at the beginning of class because I'm the fucking best, and as Laylah walks in she greets me with a ""Hey there! Thanks for those tickets, it was *so* much fun."" as she flashes her best smile and gives my arm a little squeeze.

The rest of the class was more of the same as the previous one, except even a little more 'friendly'. Again she starts rubbing the sports jersey I'm wearing this time and when I give a 'huh' she says, ""Oh nothing, this just feels really cool."" Hm, okay, if you say so. Yesterday was also the last full class of the term, so everybody's doing the ""So what are you taking next term?"" but when she finds out that we're in the same class, but different teachers, she first tries to switch into my section but finds that it's already full, so she starts asking/telling/pleading me to switch into her section. I say sure, but before I can there's a presentation starting so I have to put my laptop away.

I find out two of our hockey teams were playing against each other though, so I put it on my phone and we watched it together. My team ended up winning after we got out of class, so I wasn't able to say anything. But today's the day after class again, and I'm at work again, so I message her on Facebook again.

I end up sending this super cute little 'sorry your team lost' kind of message and we end up going back and forth for a little bit. There's a big game tomorrow night (we're both big sports fans), so I ask her what she's doing to watch it. She tells me that she's going out with friends to watch it, but ""you should come if you're not doing anything!""

My heart starts beating fast, *this is it, I actually did it.* Play it cool, play it cool...

""I don't think I'm doing anything tomorrow night, so keep me posted! Thanks!""

*Nice.*

(Wait /u/sukizka your title say's you think she has a boyfriend, what possibly could have happened?)

Well, my friend, Facebook is a thing that's full of potential knowledge. Some people might call accessing this knowledge 'cyber-stalking', but I prefer to refer to it as enriching my awareness. A few hours later I'm bored at work, so I decide to open up her Facebook. Facebook is linked to Instagram, which is private, darn, but Facebook does link those pictures to its own album, so let's see...oh here's her profile picture with that guy, let's click on that to totally prove that this is just some guy.

Caption: Lucky ✨

oh.

She means just like she's lucky to have such good friends and that kind of stuff...right? Let's look some more..here's another with the same guy, aaaand there's a heart. Oh and there's like 15 other pictures here of just the two of them.

*oh.*

So Reddit, I need your help. She's dating this guy, right? Should I ask her, or just assume so? What about her behavior towards me? I get guys and girls can be just friends, but it seemed more so than just that. Is she just a super friendly person? Also what do I do for tomorrow? Should I make an excuse that I can't go?

If she's there with her boyfriend I'm going to want to die. If he's not there, but I'm still pretty sure she is seeing him, I'll still want to die. I'm not great at socializing, especially in big groups of people that I don't know, and I'm about 99% sure she's the only person I'll know there. I literally only said I was interested in going because of her, I wouldn't have wanted to go under any other circumstance.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Thought I was flirting with a girl in my class and made plans with her and her friends for tomorrow. After doing so, some looking through her Facebook makes it seem very likely that she has a boyfriend.



Edit: I just realized this was way longer than intended, sorry about that!"
5g7bv0,7,2016-12-02,I contacted a few seconds ago. I regret it. I've never felt more miserable.,killbillvolume3,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/5g7bv0/i_contacted_a_few_seconds_ago_i_regret_it_ive/,"In the back of my head I knew my ex probably wasn't gonna reply. We ended things so mutually, and well, and on a positive note. Don't know why I messed things up.

I can't stop crying. Very hard night. The interaction I had with someone made me so depressed because I just wasn't ready to get hit on out of nowhere by someone who I thought was my friend. I feel alone, miserable, disgusting, depressed, and worst of all, lonely. Very vividly lonely.

I've never had much friends, I've only had acquaintances. My ex was my first real best friend. But there comes a point, like this, in NC, when everything just comes crashing down because something unexpected hurts you, and you're reminded of how good things were before.

I feel guilty for contacting, too. He's trying to get over me, too, right? But I still texted him asking how he was doing, anyway. Because I'm a god awful person and an idiot of habit. Because I'm miserable and the first thing I do when I'm sad is think of him, like a warm flame, who I can no longer be near. I'm just... Terrible, I can't do this, I can't do this, I'm just so, unbearably sad. Oh my god, I was doing so well, too. Why did I have to ruin it? I was doing amazing. I was making money, I'm waiting to hear back from an internship opportunity... Great. Contacting my ex was like throwing my dignity in the sewer. I'm ridiculously miserable right now. Uncontrollably emotional.

I hate everything I just did, I hate everything I just sent, because none of it means anything anymore. If I'm sad, I have to deal with it, not text my ex asking how he's doing because I miss him. Jesus, I hate myself so hard right now. I just wanna throw myself in a pot and boil. God. I don't know what to do with myself. I tried talking to three different people before ending up texting my ex, and two never responded, and one of them changed the subject. I'm overwhelmed by my own misery and sadness and the worst part is, tomorrow, I'm gonna be fine, and then some other random day in the future, I'm gonna come crashing down again.

I'm just crushed by this pressure to be happy and well-off and I can't stop crying because of it

I'm so tired of being randomly, terribly sad and I hope I get better soon"

**Backstory**

I go to a very small, semi-rural college and have been in a friends with benefits arrangement with this guy on and off for the better part of almost 3 years. We never dated, even though what started off as a crush and sex turned into me really liking him and I am still basically in love with him. 

Obviously this was not great for me and my own fault. We never talked much about his relationship(s) with other people, but I know from previously friends that he has had other FWBs before and that there was a girl he met during an internship one winter during college who he was really into (in a city.) 

On occasion when I've (probably unwisely) pressed, after I stupidly felt the need to, again, tell him how much I liked him, the only reason he gave was that he felt like we were in different places, life stages-- that he had ""experienced"" more than I had (whether in relationships or life experience, I'm not sure. He is older and has slept/dated more people than I have), and so he felt like it wouldn't be a match. Followed with...""you're a pretty girl."" 

He even asked once if what I wanted was a boyfriend and if he wanted me to introduce one of his frat brothers to me, which I immediately denied and was pretty annoyed by. He is very blase, and wouldn't have gotten mad at me if I had asked him the same or decided to date someone else or ended things formally with him, so I can't really be mad at him for asking.

Even though he is aloof he has sent mixed messages (or maybe I just read into things because I wanted to). He would do things that were opposite to what he said. For example, when we first started this arrangement he tried to set up rules like ""no sleeping over"" or ""no cuddling"" or whatever to limit ""feelings,"" but we still ended up doing that every single time. There were times when he would care that I hadn't texted him back, etc., or we would have pretty sweet/romantic moments (even though i know this could have just been the sex.) He's also told me he was sorry but he just couldn't give me what I wanted, that if ""I really knew him I would hate him"" and that ""he isn't a good guy"" etc etc and then calling me up anyway when we agreed to ""end things."" This inconsistency has always fucked with me mentally, probably because I honestly want to believe that somehow it is going to work out in the end and that he actually will realize that he does care about me more than a friend.

**ISSUE**

He graduated last year. We never formally ended things. I don't keep tabs on him on social media (we aren't friends on Insta, I unfollowed him and his friends on fb because it messes with my head). However, I must have followed him way back when on Tumblr and recently stumbled across his. He rarely posts and had changed his name so I didn't realize it was him when I first opened it.

He had a bunch of posts (really, POEMS he had written) about various things, including girls...many about various fun ""excursions"" and ""moments"" he had shared with (unnamed) girls. Some of them were scathing (one to an ex from HS who was apparently hitting him up, which took on a weirdly arrogant tone where he was like ""do you know who you're fucking with?"" ""I'm not the same guy who used to date you"").

He also had a bunch of poems which were clearly about (and sometimes directly addressed to) some other unnamed girl who he had really loved (I think the one from his winter internship) who had sort of fooled with his heart, but who he still was in love with and thought about and stalked on social media. There were a bunch of lines about how ""no one around me"" understood him and thought about things the same way as him, about how only SHE (this girl) listened to the same music he did, had discovered the artists he discovered (I won't say for fear of him somehow seeing this). There were all these anecdotes in the poems about him running around the city with this girl, having sex, looking at art, basically having a serious John Lennon/Yoko esque moment with her.

After creeping, I've had some weird emotions. I guess I (naiively) believed when he told me he wasn't interested in a relationship right now. But after seeing all this super deep and semi-sick/semi-romantic (to the point of self-loathing) stuff he is capable of experiencing and feeling and so on, I've realized that he just isn't interested in a relationship with ME...which isn't his fault, or mine, and rationally I know this isn't something that really needs to be explored -- just that we weren't a fit -- I can't shake the feeling that something is wrong with me. 

I had always imagined that when the time was right and you met someone you had a physical attraction to and who you were friends with and who had a pretty good personality, you might think about trying them out for a relationship! At least, that's kind of how I've thought in the past, and what my experience has been! With him, even though we didn't necessarily spend tons of time together, I had a really strange--nagging-- thought that I have never had with anyone that we were supposed to be something SOMEday. 

When he rejected me, I've always thought that it must be because of my flaws and that something was wrong with me, because why else wouldn't he give it a shot? I sort of settled then on the idea that maybe some people like him just weren't interested in a relationship.

We are actually quite similar (same race, same hometown but transplanted into a tiny college town across the country, similar taste in music, both kind of introverted.) However, I am premed and have spent a lot of time in college studying/in the library. He is not and spent more time going out, in his frat, etc. I was in a sorority but dropped out because I wasn't going out and didn't see the point of paying all the dues. 

I'm not naturally an academic. It's just that I struggle with anxiety, depression, etc., and feel like I have to WORK a lot at a class/school to do my best. Therefore, I've prioritized that somewhat over having different experiences that people sometimes have in college, though I tried to balance. 

Anyway, after snooping, I have an idea of the kind of girl he seems to like. 
* He has previously told me that he wants to be able to support his future wife financially so she doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to
* During his philosophical ramblings has revealed to me a lot of existential crises/struggles and the concept that ""Waiting until you get rich enough one day to do all the things you've always wanted to do but put off"" is an illusion and that you should have those experiences now.
* And on his tumblr it's clear he wants a girl who ""gets"" his taste of music, and he's looking for his ""ULTIMATE BAE"" (his ride or die, the ___ to his ____ *insert movie characters*. Some artsy, passionate, transgressive ""deep"" girl who lives in the city and has time to run around with him and see things and experience things and have crazy sex blah blah

The reason this is bothering me is because I sometimes feel like I could have been that girl...or just MORE similar to that, and maybe stood out to him more, if it hadn't been for the fact that I chose a pretty time-consuming subject to study in college and spent so much time on that. I'm not just saying this in retrospect. I've always been torn between what to do for my future career and have wanted to study and be lots of different people/versions of myself, and I guess that's something I'm struggling with too as I'm nearing graduation (regret about the paths I didn't take, the futures I could have.) 

I don't regret the opportunities or decisions I've had, but sometimes wish I had balanced things more. I also worry about whether this is going to be a theme later on-- people and possible relationships not working out because you are just absent (in the library, studying). 


He encouraged me to rush and when I first got into my sorority he congratulated me and said something along the lines of ""we'll be spending a lot more time together."" I sort of started to fizzle out from my sorority shortly afterwards however. :(
  
  ---

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

**We are recruiting for the start of the 2017 school year (Fall Semester).** The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our starting lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies. The University’s dedication and persistence in this effort is an institutional priority.

5g8uyo,5,2016-12-03,[Discussion] Prevent detection of previous installation of app on device,thedevilsipod,jailbreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/5g8uyo/discussion_prevent_detection_of_previous/,"Hi,
I am interning at a media company which offers an iOS app, where the trial period begins automatically after download and creation of a new user ID.

To study their onboarding behavior, I need to make many dummy accounts and begin trials again and again. However, they prevent that by making the app detect that it has been installed before.

I spoke to the iOS dev lead at the firm wh said he does this by storing a randomly generated number on the 'keychain' and when the app is ever reinstalled, it read the number and disables trial if it finds one.

Now, I am trying to circumvent this so I can study the behavior better. I have installed Protect my privacy but there is no access to keychain there. 

Can anyone help me out to prevent this app from figuring out it has been installed before? Thanks for helping an intern!"
5g8zwl,0,2016-12-03,Past relations (long read),znipeswellman,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5g8zwl/past_relations_long_read/,"When I was younger I dated a few girls (at different times obviously). Most of them were one hit wonders and nothing came from them. However, a select few keep popping up in my mind. 

When I dated two, there was no chance of sexual relations, not that it was a main concern. 
The first girl I dated, we went out for over a year. We both genuinely liked each other and I had no reason to leave her, nor was I looking for any. For our year anniversary I crafted a wooden heart, painted it and had our names on it with a picture of us. I still remember it. We were in the gym, our usual spot with a couple friends. I had brought the gift wrapped, and put extra pieces inside to elude away from giving it away that it was a heart. A few people gathered around and she tore it open. And by tore I mean she took her time and made sure not to rip the wrapping. She opened it and she was a shy kind of girl so as soon as she had seen what it was; her face went beat red and she cradled her knees to face so that no one could see. I saw and tugged away at her hands and I asked her what she thought of it. She took a breath through her nose and with a muffled voice ""I love it"". You could tell she was crying. It made me smile but want her to not cry as well. A couple days later, after school, she grabbed something out of her car and it was the biggest chocolate chip cookie I had seen. I laughed when I got it and was overwhelmed knowing she pit in the effort to do something for me. I went home and made sure no one else had any. 4 months go by and everything is still amazing. A week goes by....and I find out she is moving...6 states away. We dated until the day she left. 
The second girl was almost an opposite of the first. We were off and on but with some distance between each time. She was a cool girl. She didn't take any crap from anyone and gave it out as she pleased. She was funny and adorable when it was just me and her. She had me experience a side of myself that I feel allowed me to be more open and relaxed and that is something that really helped me these past couple years. She invited me to go to a Halloween party at one of our classmates houses and I wasn't allowed to go alone so I had my twin brother come along. I Remember arriving and seeing her with punch in her hand and she was the first to greet me. Almost waiting outside for me. The rest of the night is foggy in memory but I remember we went on a wagon ride. It was Halloween so the night came quick and here, it gets colder than other places. I had worn a jacket and she was sitting next to me, without one. So, I took my jacket off, and made sure she took it as she was almost reassuring me that I should keep it. She put it on and warmed up next to me for the rest of the ride. Not going to lie, I was cold and really wanted a sweatshirt, but what mattered more to me was that she was warm. She kept asking if I wanted it back and I always told her to keep it on, or I'm alright. Through school the next day I didn't feel the same and broke up with her. To this day, I hate myself for doing it because I know it was a douchebag move. I knew it then, and I hated myself then. I knew it enough that I called her a few days later and was trying to apologize and get her back. We talk for a little bit and she isn't taking my call so well. Frustrated with myself for doing what I did and regretting it the near instant I did, I start to tear and break down. I'm crying and trying to talk to her and I hear ""I'm making So - So(me) cry?"" in a surprised ignorant tone and giggling at the end. It baffled me that she was saying it and in the way she did. Like I was some grand prize at an arcade to be brought down from the high shelves. I, confused, try to say something but she returns giggling and saying ""I made so - so cry.. huh."" Still confused I try for her again and at some point in our conversation she hangs up. I still had feelings for her but I knew I couldn't act upon them, so I waited a while. Off and on and off and on again. The final time we dated. I was in the gym at lunch playing elimination. She comes in with a couple friends and says ""I need a country kind of guy."" I  didn't understand and asked ""what?"". She then replied, ""if you can't be a country boy then we are done."" Saddened and upset I said "" I guess we are done then."" I wanted to be with her, but I couldn't be who she wanted so I let her go. She's now married and has a kid and I keep thinking about what would've happened if I tried again in the years before that all happened. 

The third girl actually occurred during the first. I never cheated, nor noticed my future feelings for her during my time with the first. She moved to my town for a year. During that year, we got to know each other as friends. My brother and I would get to school a half hour early and just chill at our lockers. Her and her little sister also got their early and they would drop off her stuff first. She was new and so I'd be someone that could be of assistance to her if need be, due to the fact that I went to only this school since forever. We ended up having art together and sitting across from each other as well. She was a great artist while I was drawing full body ""dragons"" that looked like a bird with an axe head, too big of wings and a snakes tail in sand. I know, weird. But she liked one that I drew and decided to give it to her. The school year went on and eventually there was a dance. I went because my girlfriend  (first girl) was going. I'm not big on dancing so I was in the other gym shooting hoops. My plan was to come in on a slow song and have my first slow dance with my girlfriend. While I'm shooting hoops, a couple exes come in with the third girl, all smiley and giggly. I come over and ask her why she isn't dancing. Then one of her friends says ""she wants to kiss you."" At this point time, I had grown to like her. She was cute, funny, and a positive attitude. A happy girl and someone I've spent time with. She would have been my first kiss, and I would have been hers as well. I wanted to. I really wanted to. In addition to this, she was moving back at the end of the school year. Pressure from time, the other girls, and her were on me. My friend who went to see when the slow song started came back and said it was the next song. Oh yay. She was in a beautiful dress. She looked amazing and it would be my first kiss. ""You are in a committed relationship with someone for over a year, and you want to throw it away by a kiss"" was the thought that ran through my mind. I told the third girl that I really wanted to kiss her, I really did, but I was in a relationship and I can't do something like that to her. I said I was sorry and had my slow dance with my girlfriend. A couple years later I remember her. She didn't live too far away so I contacted her. I asked her if she wanted to go to the movies, but it wasn't a date. She agreed and we went and watched The Internship. I watched it twice in theaters I enjoyed it. Her mom picked her up as my mom did as well. On the way home, I texted her and asked her out. She agreed and we were in a long distance relationship so to speak. It was hard for us to meet up so it quickly died down. Our final attempt we were going to go to homecoming together but tickets weren't available. We tried for a while although my summer road trip to Alaska made it difficult. I made sure to get something for her while I was up there and she said she wanted stuffed animals. So I got a moose with a heart and a husky. I gave them to her and we continued on. Her birthday was coming up. It was Saturday of that week. Friday evening I get a call from her. We talk a little bit and next thing I know I hear ""I think we should breakup"". I start to cry because I really like her. I didn't want it to end. She had planned to have a bonfire and I was going to go. I asked her why we should breakup and she said she found someone else....and he was coming to the bonfire. I was still invited though. Hurt and frustrated, I said I won't be coming to see you be happy with someone else and that she could burn the stuffed animals I got her. We talked a little more but soon the call was ended. She's now happily married  and has a kid with that guy. I'm happy for her. 

My question is, how do I get over that. How do I move on from those feelings. Should I get over them? 

P.S. Sorry for the book."

Currently I am in the first year of my ecole d'ingénieur (2 more to go ). 

Here is my Education paragraphe in my resume :

Many of us have come very close to killing ourselves, only to be stopped by some profound sense of ""hope"". That maybe, in a few years, things could get better. Hell, things could be good!** 

Imagine waking up next to the love of your life, jumping out of bed, putting on the coffee, and getting ready for another exciting day at work! Things are busy in the office, but that is good; you love being busy! Plus, you know that some promotions are likely just around the corner! And, most of all, the busier you are, the less time you have to sit around and think. Because bad things happen when you sit around and think. Bad things like... well, never mind that; it's time to go, or you'll be late!

You kiss your love goodbye as (s)he heads upstairs to help your beautiful children prepare for another day at school. Damn, they're so smart! Smarter than you could ever be. And your love is so beautiful; how did you get so lucky?

You open the front door to walk out to the car. It's a brisk morning. Brisk mornings were few and far between in your old town, but that's ok, you like the cold! Besides, you can never move back to you old town. *Never.* Too many... bad memories... But, oh! Look at the time! You quickly scrape the ice off of your windshield and happily pull out of your driveway.

Traffic is a mess, but that's ok! It always is, so you give yourself an extra half hour to get to work everyday. It's nice, actually! You sit in the car with the heat cranked up, listening to your favorite morning Podcast while sipping that new organic coffee your friend got you hooked on. Mornings are nice. Life is nice.

You finally arrive to work. Right on time, which for you, is fifteen minutes early! You say hello to your boss, and he greets you back with a hefty stack of paperwork, due by lunch. That's ok, you understand that all of this hard work is for the greater good! You head to your cubicle, the one that's strategically placed not too far from the bathroom and not to close to the air vent, and get to work! Working is fun for you; you put on your headphones, turn on that same podcast you didn't have time to finish in the car, and get to working! Sure, it's mostly busywork. The same busywork that the twenty-one year old intern gets stuck with. But, what can you say? College was rough; it wasn't your fault! You had a disease. Things were... well, never mind that; there's too much work to be done to think about that!

As the clock slowly continues to gain hours, that stack of paper slowly continues to lose height! You're doing things as fast as you can, when suddenly;

*""Hey, Don't_Want_2_Die_Yet, it's two o'clock; have you finished those files yet?""*

You look at the stack. You've been working all day, and hadn't even realized how late it had gotten. You never even break for lunch; you were working so hard! But, does your hard work ever pay-off?

""No? You haven't? Well, that's ok I guess. That was *a lot* to expect out of you. Here, I'll give the rest of them to the intern to finish up. He's such a hard worker! And smart as the Dickens, too.""

*What you would give to be the twenty-one year old intern! Oh, what you would give for another chance at a beautiful life. A reset button, so to speak. Everything could be so nice.*

The boss gives you an odd look. You can't tell if it's a patronizing look, or a look of pity, but nonetheless, it evokes some gross feelings. Those same feelings that ultimately led you to this job situation in the first place. Those same feeli-

""Hey, you ok? You look tired?"" Says the boss. ""Do you need to take the afternoon off? I've worked you half to death already; why don't you take off? It's Friday anyways, and have you even had lunch yet? I'll see you Monday!""

You *have* been worked ""half to death"", you think to yourself. Why are you always so tired? Maybe it's the office coffee; it's so much more bitter than that organic stuff your friend got you into. You wonder to yourself ""what my friend is up to today."" Wait; isn't he off from work on Fridays? Oh, yeah, he is! Perhaps you can spend some time with your friend!

You call your friend up, and you both decide to go catch a movie. It's a good movie; an action movie with one of those genius top secret agents as a star. You've always been able to relate to those kinds of characters. You're pretty smart yourself. You have a wide array of interests. You're honestly not in that bad of shape. Surely you could be *just like* one of these badass agents if you weren't always just so- well, never mind, the movie is starting!

After the movie ends, you leave the theatre, chatting with your friend about how great the special effects were. Technology has come so far in the past few years! It's amazing!

You say your goodbyes to your friend, and then head to the car with a smile on your face. It's Friday night, and, oh yeah, you and your family always order pizza and play games together on Friday nights! Time to head home; you don't want to be late for this again!

When you get home, the sun has already long been set. You notice that a bit of ice has already started to form on the driveway again. It's going to be cold tonight, that's for sure!

You open the front door to your house, and are greeted by the embrace of warm air and the aroma of pizza (guess that your significant other already decided to go ahead and order the pizza; no worries)! It's so nice! Everything is so nice!

""Hi, honey!"" your significant other says as you walk into the kitchen. ""Want some pizza? We're playing 'Life' in the den. We're about halfway done, so you can just watch if you want and join the next game. Or, you can take my spot, though I wouldn't recommend it!""

You smile, grab a couple slices of cheese pizza (you're vegetarian, after all) and head into the den to spend a warm evening with the family. Everything is just so wonderful.

""Ah, I see you're winning again!"" you say to one of your children. ""And, of course- wait, where is-""

""Oh, yes, that child got in trouble again at school today. He's in his room"" says your significant other.

""Oh- I, I suppose I ought to go talk to him"" you murmur, then head upstairs.

You knock on the door, and then, after no response, you reluctantly open it and walk in. Your child is sitting on the bed, looking at you with brilliant eyes. He looks so much like you. He acts so much like you. How could a kid *so smart* be so troubled? 

After talking with him for a bit, you discover that he skipped class, yet again. His reasoning is that school is meaningless at this point; he's sixteen, and he already knows all of the basic fundamentals of secondary education. In fact, he's taken so many AP classes that he's technically already a sophomore in college! But, as he explains to you for the up-teenth time, he *doesnt want* to go to college. He wants to be a musician. A singer-songwriter, to be specific. And, he genuinely could be. He's very talented, and has already begun this career, managing to garner a small fan base around town and on social media sites.

But, deep down, you know that the odds of him ever making it are very low. Even with his incredible talent. Even if he *did* make it one day, that would obviously be no excuse to give up on school at the present. You try and explain this to him. To help him hear the voice of reason. He nods his head as if he agrees, but you know damn well that he's not listening, but rather, he's off in his own little world. He's left this reality for another, just like you did so many years ago...

As you stand up to head out of the room, you say ""I love you,"" to your child. He looks up at you, thinks for a second, and then says;

""Are you happy?""

You are caught off guard by this question. ""Am I happy?"" you think to yourself.

*""Well, of course I'm happy!""* you explain to your son. You then head back downstairs to be with the rest of the family, still a little shaken by that peculiar question.

""Is he ok?"" your significant other questions, curious about how the conversation went.

""Yes, yes I believe so,"" you lie.

The fireplace is so warm. You sit in your big armchair, and just watch your beautiful family play games for the next half hour or so...

.

.

.


...After a while, the fire slowly begins to die down. Things aren't as warm anymore, but no worries! You take a generous shot of whiskey to warm yourself back up. Your family is so beautiful. Everything is so nice. Everything is so nice.

Your eyes begin to get very heavy. You feel so contempt in that big, fluffy armchair of yours, just sitting back and watching your beautiful family as you slowly drift off to sleep. Everything is just so nice. So nice. So nice....

5gb4hk,2,2016-12-03,I'm headed for disaster and I don't think I care what happens to me anymore.,ghostdogg88,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5gb4hk/im_headed_for_disaster_and_i_dont_think_i_care/,"I've been depressed for so long that it's literally become part of my personality and fucks with everything I try to do to change my circumstances. I'll try to give some details and keep it brief.

I'm a 33/M who graduated from college with a degree in a field I've come to feel just isn't my passion or at least what I've done so far hasn't been very interesting at all. I was doing IT support but lost a few jobs because of my lack of motivation and shitty people skills. I don't have any real friends right now, I have some old friends from FB but I've talked to very few of them in the past few years. Not sure if most of them be considered friends per se, more like acquaintances. I'm a virgin, have never had a girlfriend, and haven't been on a date in year or so. And I live with my mom.

I was unemployed from the end of March until about mid to late September when I got an internship with a company doing web development. But I've done very little actual coding. Now the internship is going to end in a few weeks and I don't know yet if they'll hire me on or if I'll be cut loose. I got the job through doing a web dev bootcamp which is also coming to an end because it's just too expensive to keep going.

I've found that I'm not that passionate about web development either or at least I haven't seen what is that interesting about it. I haven't put my all into it either because of my doubts about it being what I want to do.

So now it's looking like I could be unemployed again and I won't get any unemployment because I've used that up. Now I'll have to get some temp job or something else that I'll probably hate and will ruin me and probably drive me to kill myself at some point. 

Also, the stress has caused me to become addicted to junk food so my health isn't as good. I try to exercise a few times a week but it's not enough. 

I wish I could find some way to escape this but it just feels like I don't have it in me to do something I hate just to survive. Not sure if anything can help me but I just wanted put this out there to make me feel better for at least moment. I just hate how once you slack off on giving your all in life, it becomes a habit and then effects everything else until you find yourself alone, angry, and full of despair (and now, chubby).

General Forrest Crane didn't spook easily. Commander of the Superhuman Research Facility, he had defended it countless times from both the vigilantes and the criminals. The self-styled supervillains would burst in and break out one of their captured allies, or the superheroes would arrive to protest something or other. 
	
Crane let them do what they wanted. The public thought the SRF was weak, but the only thing of any importance was in the deeper levels of the facillity. The research down there was classified beyond belief, protected both by the best security money could buy, and mountains of red tape. If that wasn't compromised, his job was done. The ridiculous shenanigans the upper levels got up to were elaborate distractions. The SRF had an entire think tank devoted to coming up with new performances for it.
	
Which is why he was so concerned now. The man currently descending through his facillity, swatting aside his troops like flies, was completely unknown. No history of any kind, no records of any sort, even when he called his friends at the NSA and the FBI.
	
And he was nothing like the others. Metahumans tended to be flashy and arrogant, striding down the corridors and relying on their powers. This man snuck around lines of fire, took out soldiers from behind and stuck to cover. Thus far, the troops had confirmed he deployed at least two sentry guns and managed to hack into the camera system.
	
“He's throwing flashbangs!” one of his troops yelled over the radio, to be swiftly cut off by an explosion and screaming.
	
Crane suspected the intruder had a military background, but he hadn't killed anyone yet. If the man was indeed a metahuman, it set an uncomfortable precedent for the future. Metahumans with tactics. God, it was like Vietnam on steroids.
	
The screen lit up slowly with more and more red lights, as the alarms on each floor lit up, marking the trespasser's progress. He was on Crane's level now, the last one before the lower floors. His finger hovered over the self-destruct command.
	
But the second set of alarms didn't ring, and Crane frowned. What was he here for?
	
The heavy knock on the door enlightened him. He pressed another of the myriad buttons on the console in front of him, and the man entered the room.
	
“You're a difficult man to find, General,” he commented. His voice came through a digital filter, with static and synthesized lines mixed in with whatever the person was really saying. He was dressed practically, a trench coat and cargo pants. Some of the pockets were less full, expended in the journey downstairs. The highlight was the mask, a mess of gears, screws and cogs, forming a crude fascismile of a face. The contraption whirred gently, barely making any sound. Bits of metal rose and lowered, spun and clicked into place, seemingly in time with the man's movements.
	
“That's the point,” the general answered. “People don't generally look for me, or even know who I am. Best defense against assassinations.”
	
“Well, luckily for you, I'm here with an offer,” the man sat across from the general.
	
“An offer?” the general narrowed his eyes. “From the man who terrorised half my facillity?”
	
“The expendable parts,” the man watched as the general squirmed. “I've just proven how weak your set-up is, after all. Anyone who knows how to properly use their powers would clean house. And this is a facillity specifically designed to repel attackers like me.”
	
“You aren't a meta,” he scowls.
	
“No, and not all the thorns in your side are,” he shrugged. “I have technology far better than anything the government uses. Don't bother trying to reverse-engineer it, the sentry guns self-destruct.”
	
“Alright, fine,” the general sighed. “What's your offer?”
	
“You tell me what superheroes are getting a bit annoying for you, and I can make your little problems... disappear. All I want in exchange is a little help from your intelligence agencies,” he explained.
	
The general nodded. This was his element, negotiation and diplomacy between two very dangerous men.
	
“I've already done meta-humans before. Remember Titan?” the man asked. Titan had killed three and injured eight more in his first robbery. Punching through the wall of the bank, he collapsed the building, killing the occupants. He went on to commit another spree of robberies before disappearing forever. The government assumed Titan had retired with his earnings, reported it as such, and let life carry on. Apparently they were wrong.
	
“Posse and Garrison, as well,” he continued. Two more dangerous metahuman criminals. The man was doing more public good than he let on. Then again, supervillians were quite distinct from superheroes. Especially in terms of morality.
	
“I'll give you a small target first. Show of good faith, that you can do what you claim,” the general rummaged through a file cabinet, extracted a manila folder, and handed it to his newfound ally. “And what should I be calling you?”
	
“Call me Damocles,” he responded, flipping through the folder.
	
“You willing to kill, Damocles?” the General made a mental note to look up who Damocles was. Mythology was not his strong suit.
	
“Yes, but I wagered murdering your soldiers wasn't precisely going to endear me to you,” Damocles deadpanned. “Jewel? That girl who runs about making crystal blades? Interesting choice.”
	
“It's a show of faith, isn't it?” the general proposed.
	
“Don't mess with me, Crane,” Damocles looked up sharply, directly at him. “This isn't a small target.”
	
“Hm?” the general feigned innocence. It had been a long time since someone had called one of his bluffs.
	
“Jewel hasn't done anything yet, but she could easily flood the market with perfectly cut diamonds. Be a bit troublesome for the daddy conglomerate and your widdle pet African warlords, wouldn't it?” Damocles mocked in a childish voice. The static effect over his voice went from slightly unnerving to downright haunting.
	
“Fine,” the general grudgingly admitted. Damocles had definitely established himself as a force to be reckoned with, in both combat and negotiation. Which aspect made him more dangerous, time would tell.
	
“I do this, and you give me a favour from whoever you know at the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and whatever other three letter acronym the government is wasting money on.” He stood up, tossing the file back on the general's lap.
	
The alarms had been reset during their talk. None of them lit up again.
	
The general called in many favours from the CIA, though saving a few as he'd promised. No one knew anything about Damocles, though admittedly, there wasn't much to work with. The myth of Damocles, as researched by one of his interns, worried him. The 'sword that hung over the people in power'. Yet another threat?
	
A week after the incident, an unmarked package was delivered in the mail to Crane's home. His wife knew better to touch any of it, given the ever-present peril of such things. Crane considered calling in the bomb squad, but seeing it had Damocles' name on it, he wasn't as concerned. If the man wanted him dead, he would have made a move back in the facility.
	
The package contained a pair of purple tights, and nothing else. A bit overly theatrical, in Crane's opinion, as he took it out and spun it about his finger. Maybe he could talk his wife into wearing it on one of the nights. Nah, she was far too fat for these tights.
	
His phone rang, and he let it ring five times before picking up.

“General Crane, we've received a package at the SRF, addressed to you. It appears to be a... crystal finger?” The General grinned. He could see a very profitable relationship ahead of him.

---

Damocles placed the domino mask alongside four of its brethren. The least macabre of all the souvenirs he could keep from his gruesome work. Silly that they all used the domino masks, it was so much less effective than one that covered the full face.

He leaned over a piece of paper, running a gloved finger down the page.
	
“Ah, there you are, Crane,” he ticked off the man's name. “One down.”"

5gc3sr,7,2016-12-03,"Code structure problems with raytracer in C, and parallel computing",K3ungy,GraphicsProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/5gc3sr/code_structure_problems_with_raytracer_in_c_and/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a 1 year student in a code school, and i decided to specialize myself in computer graphics. The way my school works is that we are given projects, to do solo or  in small groups. For each project they are requirements but after you meet these requirements you're allowed to add whatever functionality you want to your project. After making a limited rasterizer, a fractal exploration program, and a very basic version of wolf3D (all in C language) i've been given the task of building a raytracer in C.
After 1.5 months of work i managed to understand the key concepts and I've made a little path tracer basing myself on Peter Shirley's book (""raytracing in one weekend"") that handles anti-aliasing, lambertian materials and a very basic soft shadowing algorithm based on proximity to another object.

Here are my problems:

1. After trying to implement reflexions, I've come to the conclusion that my raytracer is a structural mess. My code really lacks flexibility. It also has become too hard to debug when something goes wrong (if you have any advice to give on how to debug graphic programs it would be much appreciated)
And i really feel like i don't have the necessary toolset/skills to fix things. I feel like i want to start over again to try to make it better. What  should i aim for to maximize my code flexibility? 

2. I'm interested in parallel computing and I would really like to be able to learn and use the GPU in this project but i don't really know what API should i use (I'm on Linux/ MacOS) so far I've tried to learn a little bit OpenCL to understand some basics of parallel computing. But I haven't actually tried to apply any of it yet, because as said above, my structure is too messy to try to implement it right now, and that is partially why i wanna start fresh.

3. I would like to work in video game computer graphics, so i'd like to able to have a raytracer that is able to run in real time. Am i aiming too high for a first? 

I have a mandatory 6 months internship in my cursus coming up at the end of this project. My aim with this project is to have something really solid to showcase my abilities and to show companies that i'm worthy of being an intern. That's why I'm trying to stuff that many functionalities in it... But I'm also aware that for now I'm still a newbie in CG and that my goals are maybe a little to far from what's achievable for me in a 4 months time window, so I'm humbly asking for your take and advices on this project.
Thank you for you time.

K3.

Ps: If you'd like to see my code for my actual version of this raytracer, just ask me for a link, I'll happily share one with you :)

Ps2: My English might not be perfect,sorry about that, it's not my native language.

5gc9lw,7,2016-12-03,Any advice for making the best out of your first job?,FrugalKrugman,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/5gc9lw/any_advice_for_making_the_best_out_of_your_first/,"Hi,

In about a month I will be starting my first ""official"" job (after short internship) at a big four (auditing firm). As we INTJs struggle socially and sometimes even productively (we can become quite a lazy mess if we have perfectionism crippling us) I was wondering what kind of tips you guys could give me in order to maximize my experience at a first job. What kind of habits/attitudes do I have to work on? How to treat colleagues properly?

I can tell from my internship experience that I got quite stressed out because my manager kept on adding work (work amount was so unbalanced that even if I did my work 24/7 I still wouldn´t meet deadlines - talking about effective management...) and I also had anxieties for not doing my work perfectly. I don´t know if it is specific to INTJs but I found it frustrating to be surrounded by colleagues and constantly having to be worried about them ""secretly"" staring at me. I guess I just have a slight social anxiety and I hate receiving attention from other people. This probably relates to my low self-esteem but I have been trying to improve it lately. 

I also had no courage to take small breaks and relax other than lunch time and so I was always under pressure (I find it extremely difficult to sit long hours). Frankly, stress was number 1 reason why I didn´t enjoy my internship and I am worried that I will start to stress about the same things at my new job.

In addition, I have high expectations for myself and I don´t want to let people down but that seems to only add fuel to the stress fire. Not a healthy attitude, eh? All those problems make me procrastinate a lot and I just have no idea how can I become efficient work-machine..."

My parents recently moved to the east coast to be closer to my sister and I. I get to see my girlfriend about once a month when one of us visits the other. It is hard but we can manage it. 

Recently I got an internship offer from a fairly well known tech company in the San Francisco / Silicon Valley area. Before this, my girlfriend was planning on staying with my parents and I on the east coast and I would find an internship at an average company around their house. 

If I accepted the offer, I would live in SF. My girlfriend's parents have said she would not be able to stay with me out there. Summer has always been our time to be close because we are away during the school year. 

Do you guys think I should accept the offer and be away from her for even longer or turn it down and get to spend another summer with her?"

Met in April (tinder) and hit it off. Best date ever. He wasn't ready to commit (just out of a long term thing) but neither was I (about to graduate and then found out about an internship across the country). But neither of us ever saw anyone else. I was super healthy at the time and definitely not using behaviors. We stayed in touch every day and called at least once a week for the 10 weeks I was gone. He started to act weird towards the end of that time (not texting as often and being distant). I finally ask him to just tell me what's up. He was afraid I would just assume we'd jump into something serious (I didn't) when I got back. We talked it out. Everything seemed fine. I sorta wrote him off to be more interested in a physical relationship with me. During my time away and upon my return, I relapsed into an eating disorder. I told him it makes me act weird but didn't explain much more than that. I really liked him (knew I would fall in love after the third date) but was terrified of letting him in and was already disassociating from my thoughts/feelings (any one with mental health issues knows what I am referring to). He asked me to be exclusive back in early October and I essentially told him I didn't think I could open up to him like he might want me to (that was the eating disorder talking). He felt rejected but said he didn't want anything to change. My real self really wanted to be exclusive and to be in a relationship so I was torn between explaining and also being controlled by the ED. We kept seeing each other and my feelings continued to grow. He started to become somewhat distant but I ignored it because I can't trust my thoughts when I am sick. I never really tried to open up to him though and Ive been getting sicker. He's no good at opening up either and stopped trying to get me to. So, in mid-November he tells me he wants to take a break because he felt like we were going down the relationship path. I was blind sided. He said ever since my rejection he'd put up this emotional wall to me and hes not sure he can feel the same way about me. He said he didnt think I cared that much about him and I never opened up to him. I explained I did care and didn't think he cared about me (my mind has been lying to me due to the mental illness). I realized that I haven't been emotionally available to him this whole time. Having an eating disorder and trying to be in a relationship is very hard. It's like being in a relationship with two different people. He even said this to me. He said there might be a chance down the road but he needs time to get there. He still wants to be friends but I just don't feel friendly towards him. I've realized how much my eating disorder was present in the relationship and I do know I can't not throw my self-worth into his presence in my life so it's not a good idea to start again now, but I so desperately know that once I am healthy, I want to try again.

I'm struggling with forgiving myself for hurting him and pushing him away. I want to repair the damage I did and try to be friends but I am not sure how to go about that knowing I want to try again. I selfishly don't want to lose him. I can see now how safe he made me feel, how comfortable I was with him. My mind just told me not to let him in. I know I need to focus on myself right now and get better, but I can't stop thinking about him. Anyone have advice on timing and keeping in contact? I am afraid if I open up to him post breakup he still wont regain those feelings for me. I'm just hurting.

(I'll be happy to clarify on any of this.)"
5gd23k,6,2016-12-03,Tech internships in NZ,Zarqu0n,newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/5gd23k/tech_internships_in_nz/,"Hello all,

a bit about myself first, I'm a Computer Science student from Germany and last year I got the chance to visit your beautiful country and I'd really love to go back. In fact, I see myself leaving my home country after I get my degree or a while later, and New Zealand is one of the countries that I'd like to live work in for a couple of years at least. But before I take such a big leap I'd like to get to know the daily life in NZ outside of a vacation better. In the US I think, it's very common for Computer Science students at least to do internships while aquiring their Bachelor degrees at university, and many of those opportunities are well paid as well. Also many see it as an important factor in finding a job later. Whereas in Germany, it's way different, almost all internships are unpaid, fewer people do them and I think people don't puch that much of an emphasis on doing an internship while they're in school.

So here's my question to you guys - how is the situation in New Zealand? Is it common to do internships while still attending university? Also, more importantly (for me anyways), would companies handing out internship offers also look into applications from International candidates? I think for me personally it would be a great way to get to know the country better and also increase my employability whether it's in NZ or somewhere else, but I have no idea if that's even a possibility."

I don't work in an exciting field, I don't get exciting cases; I live pretty well but it's not exactly fun. In fact it's pretty damn stuffy. The rest of my life's pretty much the same way - I work, I jog, I meet clients, and sometimes I have vanilla sex.

Maybe that's why in my downtime I'm spending more and more time thinking about how much I'd love to just *wreck* some of the women in my life. Facefuck them, cockslap them, gag them, call them names, pound the shit out of them... You get the drill, and I'd love for someone to play one of them for my pleasure.

I've selected my five favourites for you to choose from and listed a little about them below. Pics are available of all of them if you need a little inspiration before you choose:

**Kirsty**
The bitchy, bleach-blonde daughter of one of the senior partners. Her family sent her to the best schools, the best colleges, nothing but the best, but she revels in being a bitchy blonde bimbo who knows she'll never have to work a day in her life. She's also a total attention whore who knows her cute looks and important name get her places, and that drives everyone at the firm who isn't getting ahead on name alone absolutely crazy, and even annoys some of her own family!

Scene idea: Her dad cuts off her credit card and the job he got her at an upscale clothing store just doesn't cut it for a girl like her. She decides to make him mad by coming on to one of his employees, but gets way more than she expected - she thought he'd just get told that she was flirting with his employees, but she ends up getting a nasty perverted fucking that she loves every second of!

**Jess**
Kirsty's rock chick younger sister. 18 and full of attitude, she takes no shit and isn't afraid to backtalk anyone. Jess hates Alex's guts and would do anything to get one over on her, and hates that her dad makes her spend so much time at the office stuffing envelopes while her sister gets to spend all the family's money and do absolutely nothing. Doesn't he know that hanging around all these stuffed shirts takes time away from her band?

Scene idea: She's sick of her goody-goody little sister getting all the praise. She's had to work twice as hard for half the attention, and the only way she's going to make up the difference is with shock and awe: Getting one of her dad's employees to fuck the shit out of her in the most obscene ways, and call up her stupid family and tell them what she's doing while she's doing it!

**Lucy**
The studious and preppy intern. A late night at the office is her idea of a good time and anything other than constant study is a wild weekend for her. Though she doesn't really know it - or at least doesn't pay attention to it - she's actually a little pocket rocket; short and cute with dark blonde hair, her boobs are *huge* and no matter how she dresses she can't help but show them off - either that or they're just too big to hide!

Scene idea: Part of her internship here means we get her to take exams. She's so desperate to pass her end of year assessment that, despite all her study, she breaks into the records room when she thinks nobody else is in the building to look at the results previous interns got so she can copy the answers. When I catch her, there's no limit of what she'll do to get me to not ruin her future career.

**Kayla**
Personal trainer for a few people at the firm. She's a pretty, confident blonde with flexibility and stamina to burn. Being 5' 2"" hasn't stopped her being super feisty, and the hours she spends in the gym makes her think that she's a match for anyone, man or woman, who tries to take her on. All those hours spent around toned men take their toll, though, and finishing work super-horny with nobody to take it out on is a common occurrence.

Scene idea: I decide to widen my workout routine and drop by to see her at the 24 hour gym after a late night at work. She knows that the best way to tone up is with some MMA training, so she decides to show me a few holds. Things get a little competitive, one thing leads to another, and she ends up getting used as a personal workout tool!

**Kim**
An ambitious and attractive associate who's more than willing to use her looks to get ahead - to the point of getting herself some big fake tits to either better impress the bosses or better influence judges. She is a stone cold bitch and there's nothing she won't do to climb the latter, no matter who she has to step on to get there.

Scene idea: Its only me and her working late at the office and she wants to get away to go and schmooze at a party for the partners that's happening down the street. She tries to dump her work off on me, first by basically demanding I do it when she doesn't have the authority and then trying to use her looks to convince me. Unfortunately for her she only convinces me to do something else.

All ideas are optional and negotiable, and we can either adjust my scenarios or come up with our own. My main interests are listed above, but today I'm into anything rough and nasty you can think of! (with the usual exceptions of pee, poop and death) 

This is a standing prompt, so feel free to message me any time you find it, and I'm happy for one-offs or for us to work through more than one character. If this prompt is old when you read it, I might even have new characters for you to play - feel free to ask!

Hopefully this isn't too long and you're still reading; if any of my ideas turn you on or you want to know more, drop me an orange envelope.

Happy writing!"

Most people I don't know assume I'm a girl.

My family and friends know I'm transgender.

But once I got even further in my transition... Should I let people know I'm a transgender right away? Is this what is expected of me?

I always planned to simply be a girl after I could go out as one full time, which is pretty soon. But the reality hit me kinda hard, there's a lot of people who witnessed me during my transition, friends, family, people at my internship etc.

Do I tell all these people to hide the fact I transitioned and simply refer to me as a girl later on?

Or should I let everyone know straight away?"
5ggj4s,8,2016-12-04,"Update: Recovered from suicidal mood, mentally closed the door on my ex, etc.",FormerlyWifey,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/5ggj4s/update_recovered_from_suicidal_mood_mentally/,"**TL;DR I decided that my ex is officially dead to me and I've felt better ever since.**

I started keeping an activity log at my therapist's instruction. It's amazing to see how well my mood has rebounded from the emotional nadir of mid-November, from 0/10 suicidal the first week to 8/10 most days. I can laugh at things and enjoy life's little pleasures again.

The turning point came at Thanksgiving, when I decided to burn all bridges with my ex for good. I made the decision after he sent me the last of my things through a mutual friend. I've always been sort of looking back longingly despite maintaining No Contact, but once it became clear to me that there was no hope there, I realized it was time to stop looking back. I blocked him on everything; he's dead to me. My mood lifted as soon as I made that decision. **I'd taken the power back and made it a choice (""I'm done with him"") instead of a circumstance (""I still haven't heard from him"").**

And like the too-cute ending to *(500) Days of Summer,* the very next evening I went on a date that turned out to be far more promising than I expected. I don't want my happiness to hinge on my romantic prospects, and that's something I'm still actively working on, but I can't deny that it's nice to have life throw me a bone (no pun intended) for once after a really shitty couple of months.

Independent of the romance angle, my productivity has improved. I'm not thinking about the ex nearly as much (whenever thoughts of him pop up, my brain swats it away with ""he's dead to me""), so I can concentrate better on schoolwork, gym, and internship applications. My life is finally back to being in full forward motion."

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

We are recruiting for the start of the 2017 school year (Fall Semester). The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our starting lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies. The University’s dedication and persistence in this effort is an institutional priority.

Player Recruitment Form: https://wku.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0OqUiJkK11c26mV Lastly, WKU has many scholarships available for students, including those in the eSports program. Be sure to check out our academic programs and our BEAUTIFUL campus!

5gi5xp,1,2016-12-04,"[PR] You are on a research vessel that dropped anchor near Mariana Trench, and you get a transmission that only says, ""We're coming.""",screw_the_DV-bots,riveting_reads,https://www.reddit.com/r/riveting_reads/comments/5gi5xp/pr_you_are_on_a_research_vessel_that_dropped/,"""At first I thought it was the interns running away with my crappy telling of ""First I'm gonna get cha, now I'm gonna eat cha,"" but the message was coming through an encrypted channel that was military grade. As such, I was more than a little worried, and decided to call in my first mate to ask for his opinion on the matter.
Clark frowns as he looks at the transmission before saying, ""Maybe it wasn't meant for us, a glitch between two high-end machines.""
""I certainly hope you're right,"" I reply, not even remotely consoled by his response. After all, he didn't know about... the program.
As I wonder about whether or not to tell Clark about something that could very well alter this life forever, he grunts and says, ""Oh shit,"" pointing to the monitor.
It reads: Vessel Tech Corp H20 We are Coming
There was no mistake, that was us, Clark needed to know.
""Listen, Clark, we haven't just been studying benthic organisms in the trench, I've been spear heading a program to build something, something that we've almost finished...""
Before I can settle the look of confusion on his young face, our boat lists hard as something connects to The H20. We have no choice but to make our way to the deck to investigate.
Upon reaching the deck my jaw drops. An aircraft carrier of immense size, equipped to the nines in technology I had never seen in all my years of being a doctorate, was now docked with our vessel.
A man carrying an assault rifle dressed in a blue and yellow jump suit with important looking medals jangling into the wind approaches me and says, ""Ma'am I've been instructed to tell you that Vault Protocol FUBAR has been put into place. Nukes are falling and I have important personnel on my craft. You are to take me to your water elevator immediately.""
I look the man in the eyes and say, ""I've been waiting for you Colonel, welcome to Vault H20."""
5gi6bs,25,2016-12-04,Lost some potential years of dating to anxiety and depression. What to do now?,BookerTheWitt,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5gi6bs/lost_some_potential_years_of_dating_to_anxiety/,"So, a little background first. 24, M, had a childhood of bullying and anxiety, I was really fat, had really bad acne and to be fai I wasn't the most pleasant person, although I was fairly convinced otherwise. Went to college, ended up not liking my degree, which only cause more anxity, made me feel into a depression and only two years ago I've started to enjoy more and get my life on tracks. All of the anxiety and depression left me with a really low self-esteem and an extremely low confidence, so I hava never dated or had sex. 

However in this years I was able to get my life around: finished my degree, landed a great internship on one of the greatest companies in my country, bought a new car, lost a lot of weight, got some clothes that fit better and I'm feeling overall confident. I can entertain people easily, can talk to anyone and people say I can talk about anything, so I'm fairly confident that things will change even more soon for me. 

My problem is with letting the past go. In the beggining of the year, me and a friend started to talk a lot and go out often. We never called it dates, we used to go out as friends. The problem is that I ended uo falling for her and it seemed to me that she was doing the same for me. I was wrong and we ended up drifting apart. We still talk and I stll have that feeling about her, like if I still wanted to have something with her, but at the same time I feel like things are being forced. And I know I need to let this go, but to be honest I don't really know how...

The second problem is that I want to find someone, but also have no idea how. Most of my friends are in relationships for a long time, so the majority of their friends are couples as well. I don't think that I could date someone from work, since I don't really want to mix things up. I tried Tinder but even tho I have several matches, most of the girls just post selfies and don't fill the description, so I have no idea on how to start a converstaion with them that is not the ""Hi, how are you"". The few that did fill something on the description and that I used to start a conversation, felt like I was talking to a wall, there was no mutual interest on the converstaion. At least I tried to get to know her and received no interest in knowing me at all, always freezing the conversation until I got fed up with it. 

It is hard to find someone that I really want to meet and that has no boyfriend, so I'm kind of clueless on where to look for. I thought about learn how to dance, not just to find someone but it is something I'd like to learn, but there are no schools around. Maybe a hobby would be something nice, but I have no idea whee to turn with the options I have. 

Well, sorry for the long rant, hope you can help, or something that might inspire me :)"
5gidr1,0,2016-12-04,Not sure what I should do about this friend drama...warning this is kinda long.,HoneyBlah,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5gidr1/not_sure_what_i_should_do_about_this_friend/,"Over the Summer I took time to look for jobs. Like hardcore non stop applying and interviews, so I didn't hang out with my friends(lets call them Friend A and Friend B). I still texted them but I just told them I couldn't hang out when they asked. We've been friends for about 10 years now (we're 24).

So come Sept, at Friend A's celebration dinner, Friend B decides they wanted to ignore me the entire time and the next day I get a ""can we talk text"" in a group text with Friend A &amp; B. I ignored the text because I was starting my internship (I also work a part time job on the weekends) the next day, which I told them, and if I tell them that I couldn't meet they would start an argument with me. Also, I wasn't too excited to be put in the hot seat and judged by my friends. This is a situation that has happend to me before. Mind you I didn't have any problems with either of them until Friend B decided to ignore me at the table.

Like 2 weeks later I was in a car accident and I have really bad anxiety when it comes to cars (I've almost died twice and I've been in several small accidents). I hadn't talked to Friend A or B since the dinner but I tell Friend A about the car accident.

Friend A and I talk and she just felt like I was ignoring her all summer but we clear it up and its whatever. She was understanding and just took it as a misunderstanding. I never talk to Friend B. In the past when I was very sick (I fainted at the gym and ended up with a concussion) she would constantly bring up the fact that I had commitment issues and make fun of me for it. Ever since she got her undergrad in psychology she considers herself a psychologist and thinks she knows everything about everyone. Therefore I'm not comfortable talking to her when I'm in a sensitive state. So I was going to wait until the end of my internship to talk to her because my anxiety is too high to deal with anymore stress right now. I work about 45-50 hours a week and my anxiety has been high since the car accident in October. 

I freak out internally whenever I'm in a car. I used to exercise for my anxiety but due to severe anemia I can't anymore.

And here comes the social media drama...

So Friend A and Friend B are still hanging out. They went to a birthday party together on the same day I went on a Twitter rant about a friend (neither of these two) who had treated me poorly in the past. Friend B took it personally and I get this long text message that night about how she's tried to invite me out all summer and I've just been ignoring her. And when she didn't take the time to talk to me that I didn't talk to her for months.

I immediately call Friend B because I'm not going to have an argument through text message. She comes into the argument with an ""I'm right, you're wrong mentality"" like I thought she would. She goes on about how since she's a future therapist she can tell me that my anxiety isn't an excuse for my behavior and how I haven't been talking to her. Whenever I talk to her about a medical or emotional problems (my fainting due to my anemia or my anxiety) she doesn't see it as a problem so I told her I didn't feel comfortable talking to her at all. She said that she apologized for making fun of my commitment issues when I was sick and that I shouldn't feel the way I do. I explain to her that I didn't mean to ignore her all summer I didn't realize it because I was focused on getting a job. Her argument is that ""people make time for what they want to"" and I agree but if I'm having anxiety attacks and haven't had any time to hang out with ANY of my friends in the past 2 months, how would I make time for you?

On the phone she ""makes me"" confess that I have communication issues and tries to make me realize how disillusioned I am to everything that is going on.

Long story short, Friend B is upset that I wasn't reaching out to her like I did with Friend A. But I didn't do this because I knew she was going to be aggressive and make my anxiety worse, which she did. At this point I don't want to talk to Friend B and I don't want to be friends with her but I feel like I have to be for Friend A.

Comments or suggestions? 

I'm not sure what I should do at this point. I think the entire situation is dumb but I'm not in a good mental state to deal with it and all I do is overthink and rethink and I can't really settle myself enough to deal with it right now."
5gmawt,6,2016-12-05,First time opening up,lightdrumbeat,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5gmawt/first_time_opening_up/,"This is nothing ground-breaking. I haven't had a terrible experience that's worse than anyone else's and it's up there with other first-world problems but I feel lousy, lousy, lousy and it's sucking the personality right out of me, once again. Any words of encouragement or advice are welcome. 
I have a history of depression, nothing diagnosed, but always present in the background since I was 16 (I'm 28 now). I've got a good family, nice friends, always did well enough in school/work/activities. The shit hit the fan about 2 years ago, though. After graduating from college, I got a good job pretty quickly but for a position that typically hires a more experienced person (I'm a social worker so I'm ashamed twice-over: that I haven't been able to put into practice what I preach to get out of my funk and that I've waited this long to reach out). I lasted about a year and a half until the boss asked me to leave; despite trying hard and 2 separate meetings with the boss to set up goals, I just wasn't able to handle the workload, to be thorough and effective enough. She graciously transferred me to another department program because she said she thinks I have potential and was just maybe thrust into a job that I needed more experience for (the job is notorious for not attracting new social workers too). During that year and a half, I was a totally different person than my usual averagely-happy self. Crying every night at home, anxiety through the roof, couldn't concentrate or remember anything, negative self-talk, doubting my ability to do anything, taking any criticism really personally. I absolutely felt like a professional failure and like social work was the biggest mistake of my life, especially bc i previously had a business degree in HR but decided to switch career path for social work (i never worked in business). I'm usually a jokester, pretty charming, go out of my way to talk to friends and family, etc.  I got pregnant quickly after starting the job in the other department and have been home on mat leave for the past year so I've had this time as a breather. I should mention that I excelled at the other social work job, my new boss commended me regularly, I wasn't stressed out of my mind and generally liked going to work in the morning. My mood lifted instantaneously because that work stressor was just lifted from me. I decided to be proactive and use the time off to apply for business jobs to get out of the social work  field but to no avail yet. I've been applying for jobs online regularly for the past few months and contacted a few associations and my former university for help getting internships since I have no business experience but nothing has turned up so far. I contacted community organizations that work in career help but haven't gotten called back for an appointment.  I know I could be doing more like going to career fairs, etc. but I'm at a loss right now bc I don't have any contacts in the field either. 
What gets ugly is that this is affecting my relationship with my hubby. Off the bat, he's a wonderful guy but not sensitive. He doesn't ""believe in depression"" and meds and is of the attitude that people should pick up their socks snap out of it, that mental health problems don't really exist. His reaction is unpredictable when I talk to him about this job thing; he might listen and offer suggestions but if I repeat the same argument, he'll snap or leave the room and say he's tired of listening to a broken record. For this reason, I confide moreso in my mother bc I feel like a clear burden to my husband when I talk about feel like shit. He's said before that he's married to a child who's complaining, etc. Something else that looms over us is that even before all this work depression stuff started, my husband wasn't big on having sex often, from when we got married (we were a lot more hot and heavy when we were dating so I know he's interested and I know he masturbates to porn a few times a week, he told me). I literally had to beg him to sleep with me. Now it's even less often and always at my initiative. I've been rejected countless times and we've discussed this calmly over and over and he always says he'll try harder to initiate, that from ""now on"" it'll be different, he'll try to be more excited. 
Yesterday, we had a big argument because I said I could understand why ppl are suicidal in situations like this, that feels like an escape from being consumed by all this bullshit and worry. He suggested I write this post on reddit and when I told me it was a good idea but that I was too embarrassed and ashamed to do it, he lost it. He said I've done nothing to ameliorate my situation and kept bringing up his friend who did so much netowrking, etc. to get his new job. We broached the topic of him not being supportive and he got more mad. We confronted the elephant in the room about the no sex and I blatantly asked him if he doens't want to sleep with me bc he's annoyed at me for being a crybaby burden and he said yes it plays into it. I tried to make him understand that over these years of feeling shit bc of my job, his not wanting to be affectionate are a huge part of me being upset, that I take is personally and feel rejected from the one person whose judgement and caring I care about the most. 
I'm going back to work in about a month and this is what I'm seeking encouragement about. I'm on the on-call list so when I go back, I'll be given a job in whichever service program needs an employee, basically with any clientele dealing with their associated issues. I'm not super-enthused by the field as a whole but I think what's really eating me is my fear of being incompetent just like at the first job. I've read so many books over the time I've had off to like ""study"" the different clienteles I might meet. I keep having to tell myself that I""m not just gonna be open-mouthed and dumbfounded by my clients and have nothign to say to t hem. I'm a reasonable person and even though my self-esteem is low, I know I'm a good friend, helpful to my family, I go above and beyond for the people I care about, I'm a good mom to our baby, heck, I work out and feel great in my body too after a c-section. I know my job doesn't totally define me even though it takes such a huge chunk of time from my life. I'm usually able to kick up my feet and rationalize this situation: keep applying for jobs, keep a positive attitude, read self-help books. I keep telling myself that if I was successful at the new SW job, I might do well at the new one. Nonetheless, I feel like garbage, like this impending doom is looming over me, and like i'm a huge whiny burden to my husband. 
I wanted to talk to someone at my local CLSC (I live in Montreal, a CLSC is a local health centre for medical and social health and you're assigned to get services in the one in your neighborhood) but since I work at my local CLSC (surprise!) I'm afraid of being recognized my coworkers when I go back to work in a few months.  I know that's an excuse and that they probably have procedures to mask my identity for confidentiality in cases like mine. I just feel like I'm losing my mind and totally consumed by feeling like garbage. I can't get out of this funk. 
I feel like I'm just ranting now and repeating this story over and over in different words. I perpetually feel like this. I feel like a different job will just solve the problem of me feeling like a failure and that I'll be able to rest easy not having to worry about how I'll do as a social worker when I go back to work.  Other than this issue, I've always felt like i'm reasonably good at the rest, confident enough in my other abilities. Any words of advice or help are welcome. Thanks. Felt good to put into words and get off my chest instead of ruminating and reliving all the work incidences again. "
5gmcds,1,2016-12-05,Massachusetts Solar Power Advocates Rally at State House - 2 Dec 2016,ShaunaDorothy,BostonIndie,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonIndie/comments/5gmcds/massachusetts_solar_power_advocates_rally_at/,"by Meghan Hassett
02 Dec 2016

BOSTON, MA – With solar power on the rise around the country, a national network of fossil fuel and utility-backed organizations have joined forces to put the brakes on this fast growing pollution-free energy resource. Trade groups and think tanks backed by deep pocketed anti-clean energy ideologues and fossil interests are bankrolling campaigns, promoting model legislation and media campaigns to provide cover for anti-solar campaigns across the country, said a new report released today by Environment Massachusetts Research &amp; Policy Center.

Student activists joined Environment Massachusetts and MASSPIRG Students at the State House to share the findings of the report with legislators and urge officials to eliminate limits on solar power and support a goal of 100 percent renewable energy for Massachusetts.

“Pollution-free solar energy represents America’s most abundant energy resource,” said Meghan Hassett with Environment Massachusetts. “For our climate and our environment, we can’t allow special interest forces in the fossil fuel industry to pull the plug on the bright potential of solar power.”

The report, Blocking the Sun, documents 17 fossil fuel backed groups and electric utilities running some of the most aggressive campaigns to slow the growth of solar energy in 12 states.

Of the findings, the report documents how the Koch brothers have provided funding to the national fight against solar by funneling tens of millions of dollars through a network of opaque nonprofits; the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) provides utility and fossil fuel interests with access to state legislatures, and its anti-net metering policy resolution has inspired legislation in a set of states; utilities in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, West Virginia, California and Illinois have undertaken extensive campaigns to revoke renewable energy policy or impose new charges on their solar customers.

In mid-2016, there were at least 84 ongoing policy actions in U.S. states that could impact the growth of solar energy, including through limitations to net metering or new charges to make rooftop solar power less economically viable.

In Massachusetts, officials voted in April to lift the caps on net metering, a program that ensures fair compensation for the energy that solar panels provide to the grid. As a result, Massachusetts can add enough solar panels to power 100,000 additional homes.

Utility companies had lobbied to keep the caps in place and cut the value of solar net metering credits. Legislators cut the value of the credits by 40 percent for most categories of projects, including shared solar installations serving low-income communities, renters, and people whose roofs can’t accommodate solar panels.

“Solar power is the future of energy, sustainable economic growth, technological innovation and job creation and should be available to everyone. We can’t allow Solar to fall victim to regressive forces trying to bring back a dirtier energy world,” said Roger Freeman, founder and Managing Principal of Massachusetts-based solar company Solventerra. “We’ve come too far to see the solar industry stall out waiting on regulations to catch up. For example, SREC II should be extended until a new program is in place so businesses like Solventerra can continue to grow and drive innovation and opportunity in the Commonwealth.”

Advocates are pushing to eliminate limits on clean energy and adopt a goal of getting 100 percent of Massachusetts’ energy from clean, renewable sources. Studies from major universities and institutions have shown that 100 percent renewable energy is within reach, using technologies that are available today.

“Solar is finally catching on and providing tremendous benefits, reducing pollution, saving consumers and businesses money, and revitalizing local economies,” said Alecsandra Steele, Environment Massachusetts student intern. “Now, more than ever, states must lead the charge on a transition to solar power and renewable energy.”

The report urges state decision makers to recognize and resist utility and fossil fuel industry influence that seeks to undermine solar energy and to instead encourage the growth of solar.

“From damage caused by extreme weather to harmful pollution, Massachusetts is already feeling the effects of climate change,” said Vincent Maravantano, Executive Director of Massachusetts Interfaith Power and Light. “Solar power is a fantastic way to do the right thing for creation and for future generations. Lower income folks who pay more for energy and are harmed more by the effects of climate change must have equal access to solar power.”

“Massachusetts has a history of leadership in protecting the environment and providing for economic opportunity with renewable energy, and we can and should do more to free up the sun,” said Cathy Ann Buckley, Chair of the Sierra Club Massachusetts Chapter. “We can’t turn down technological progress, a stronger economy and a cleaner planet just to line the pockets of the fossil fuel industry.”

Many times, I have tried to learn or do something. However, I have failed at it.

As we are currently speaking, I made a mistake by taking up an intern offer at a startup.

I realized that my priorities weren't in order.

I have managed to get some positive energies behind Machine Learning.

But this small hiccup has all but destroyed my motivation.

US Application is supposed to be my top priority but I didn't dedicate any substantial time to it.

The seriousness of the matter is not striking me.

That makes me feel sad about myself.

I have always done this.

Get a good thing going but then fuck it up by distracting myself with something else in the end.

I am going to correct this.

I am not an entirely negative person. To be honest, I haven't felt negative in a long time. So this feeling is weird. It is sticking because I love weird.

I am going to talk with a counselor tomorrow finally. Proposed a final schedule:

Finish 1 university application every 5 days.

I accepted an internship for this summer with RSM after I did their leadership program in Philadelphia; however, I haven't heard from them since about a start/end date.  Should I have?  Should I email them and ask?

I'm getting nervous and would also really like to start planning my summer.

Thank you!"
5gnn7x,2,2016-12-05,Advice on future for MS Geology candidate,Trogbad2,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/5gnn7x/advice_on_future_for_ms_geology_candidate/,"Hi all,

I am currently a first-year graduate student in geology at a large state university with a BS degree in physics from a small, but prestigious liberal arts university. As I am finishing my first semester, I am starting to think ahead towards the next few years of my life. Currently, my goal is to finish up an education and join the oil &amp; gas industry as a geophysicist, as it melds my two academic interests (physics and geology), and apparently pays well (I want to be financially well-off). 

As a 22 year old grad student, I have only really known what it is like to be in school, and have next to no work experience (my summers have been spent doing undergraduate research and taking classes). I have recently been glancing at job offerings at oil companies to see what kind of requirements are recommended. I found that most jobs require a MS degree (on track), as well as work experience (none). I am, however, planning on getting some sort of summer job working for my current adviser's former student, who works in geotechnical consulting; not my intended field. I am assuming that the deadline for summer internships at oil companies has passed. I didn't apply because the positions required resumes and my resume is empty since I've been busy filling my CV to gain admittance to graduate school. 

I would like to ask for advice on a sort of game-plan for my next few years. A few questions I would like answered are: 

1. Would a summer working in geotechnical consulting improve my chances at landing a job fresh out of school, or would I have to work several years in consulting to fare well?

2. What significance does the OPEC deal have for career prospects in the short-term and long-term? Higher price is great, but doesn't lower production mean lower employment?

3. Should I broaden my prospective career path outside of the energy industry?

4. What are salary expectations in energy vs non-energy vs non-geology?

5. My thesis topic is in planetary modeling. How important is a thesis topic for job prospects?


Any thoughts and general advice are greatly appreciated. If you need any more information, just ask. Thanks!"

Married for 2 years, engaged for 2 years. It's taken a long time for me to put my finger on this and why it has bothered me, but I've finally got it. My wife is a passive participant in our relationship (sexually and otherwise).

A little background on us. We met in college and I was two years ahead of her in school. Actually, come to think of it by the time we started dating I had already graduated and was into the workforce. She had three years of undergrad left because she changed her major. In 2011 she ended up graduating and then she went to grad school for another 3 years. So from 2008 when we met to 2014 she was in school that entire time. I worked, did internships, and went to school part time for a masters between 2012-2014. When she went to grad school she went to a school about 1.5 hours away from where I was working and living. For those three years I would drive to see her just about every single week. Sometimes even twice a week. It was rough, but we made it. We got married in 2014 after we were both done with school. We moved in together earlier that year and there was some adjustment, but we made it thorough that as well.

Our sex life the past 6 years has been rough on me. The combination of birth control pills, anti-depressants, school, etc. really made it tough. For a number of years we would go 1-2 months between sex. At some point I'd had enough, and demanded we go to sex therapy, when also ended up turning into relationship therapy. Since she started working things have also not been great. Her first job she ended up working late into the night, coming home around 9 or 10. It was awful, so after a year she took another job, and it was even worse. She would get home most nights around 11, many nights around midnight, and some nights not until 1am. It was absurd, and we spent a TON of time talking about it in therapy. Finally a few months back she got her third job, and this one is much better. She gets home much earlier now, but since the job she took is 1.25 hours away (something that was contentious when she was considering it) she's tired and ends up going to sleep almost as soon as she gets home. She'll sleep form say 8-4 and then get up early in the morning to do paperwork before heading back into work.

In terms of sex, I am the real driving force. Working with the therapist we've settled on ""appointment"" times, most of which seem to get pushed back not only to the next, the next, or the next day, but also most to the very last possible time in the day. We've talked about making sex more enjoyable for her, about things she can do to make sex more enjoyable, communication, etc. I can't tell you how many books I've read on the advice of the therapist, most of which have been good reads. But if I didn't insist on having sex we'd never have it, I don't think. All the things we've agreed upon working with the therapist I've had to do. Read some erotic stories together, sure as long as I read them..she won't. Try a vibrator..I bought it, she does does not use it. Her trying masturbation to figure out what she likes..has not done it. From what I can gather, thus far 3 years of therapy has resulted in her getting a back massage before sex and me turning on some music during. She literally won't communicate during sex. If I ask her if it feels good, she say ""it feels nice"", but her voice says it in a way that seems more like a ""that's nice, dear"" kind of way, as to not hurt my feelings or something. If I ask her if she has any fantasies, she says she doesn't. If I ask her what she's in the mood for, she'll pause and say ""whatever you are"". After 8 years, I honestly have close to zero insight into my wife's sexual desires and preferences. I've opened up to her a lot, including telling her some of my fantasies that were hard to say, but from her I get nothing.

The relationship seems much the same way in terms of effort. With her work I've tried to free up chores and whatnot to try to make time for us to spend together. As of right now I do the dishes, the laundry 90% of the time, vacuuming, grocery shopping, any bathroom cleaning, anything related to the cars, taking out the trash, walking the dog etc. I mean that is no fucking joke, I absolutely do 90% of the house work despite us both having full time jobs. When it comes to us doing things together like going on a walk, seeing a movie, getting diner, going on a date, etc. it's a real fucking pain to get her to go along. If I asked her 10 times if she wanted to see a movie with me, 9 of them she'd say no. Same thing for working out together, or anything else. She seems to be able to find time to have a weekend brunch with former co-workers, and to get together with friends a couple times a month, but for her and I it seems like there is never time. Any maybe this will sound superficial, but she rarely makes a point to look nice for me. I don't want to be an ass, yeah I think my wife is beautiful no matter what, but once in a while I don't see the harm in putting some effort into make up for me. Or during sex, she knows that I LOVE when she wears lingerie. She has plenty, it takes what, 1-2 minutes to put on, but she won't do it unless I expressly ask her to.

I really feel like she is just passive, and not an active participant in our relationship. The combination of general relationship and sexual stuff make me fell really undesired most of the time. What hit me was thinking about the situation in reverse, as if a woman was describing these things in her husband (works late, going to sleep when he gets home, no effort made for sex, no effort made for chores, no effort made to spend time, etc)...in that situation I think most people would say ""girl, you deserve better then that"". And don't get me wrong, there are days that are great, where I really love being with her. Right now though, there are more days where I don't feel that way. I've thought about divorce, but I love her and am much more interested in making things work. With all we've done in therapy though, I really am starting to wonder how much actually will. It didn't always used to be like this, but it has slowly morphed. I honestly think that because I have always sacrificed and been willing to pick up the slack (mostly by circumstance of grad school and her job) (and not to get all Freudian about it, but that is what her father would have done before I was the main man in her life) I think she's not really come to understand the idea that relationship and especially marriage requires significant ""work"" on the parts of those involved, and I don't think she understand what that ""work"" looks like.

Last night at about 130 in the morning there were some words exchanged. They were mostly related to the fact that over the weekend twice we had planned time for her to do her paperwork (normally takes many hours) while I took care of other things so that we would have time together, and while I did those things she failed to get any of her work done. I got pissed and told her I was sleeping in the guest room. In the morning I apologized for getting angry at 130, and she apologized ""it being what it was"", and I told her we would talk about it later. I think it might be time to just open up entirely and finally using the terminology ""I'm not happy"". I have not expressed such direct words in the past because I wanted to keep the conversation in therapy about ""us"" rather than me. But I'm not sure there is anything else left to do but outright say that I'm not currently happy in our marriage, that I want things to change, but that I don't think they will until she starts making an effort."

At our high school we have an internship program where our 11th grade students spend the month of January at a full time internship rather than coming to school.  It's obviously difficult to find contacts in every industry willing to host high school students for this kind of internship, and sadly despite some of the great companies for game development in San Diego we do not have any contacts at any of them.

If you want the details on this particular student I'd be happy to share his story via PM but feel uncomfortable posting it.

So if anyone has any contacts at a game development company or similar field here in San Diego that might be interested in hosting a talented and competent intern please leave a reply or contact me via PM.

Thanks for your time and happy holidays!"

I'm 22, and I was supposed to graduate college in the summer of 2016. But due to personal complications I dropped out during my 2nd semester of Junior year; so I do not have my BA/BFA (Bachelor of Arts/Fine Arts)

I'm in the Motion Graphics industry/field and I got an internship this fall and it's almost over. They really like my work and they are offering me a freelance position. However, I have about $30 in my bank after paying my final month of rent. So if I were to take up the offer I would have to permanently relocate; which I cannot afford in my current situation. 
Granted, if I become a freelancer my pay would more than triple in regards to what I was receiving as an intern. But I don't have any money **saved**. My mother has been helping me out as much as she can but we don't have a lot of money between her and I. My father and I do not have the healthiest relationship, and for him it's either I go back to school or nothing; he will not financially back me if I decide to take the freelance position.

I recently was given the option to go back to school, and start again as a 2nd semester Junior, which means I have 3 semesters, or a year and a half of college to complete.

To be completely honest I would prefer not to go back to school, but I am not ruling it out and can be convinced otherwise. I've been trying to weigh my options and it's been very difficult and stressful. I know that whichever direction I choose right now will have a huge impact on my life later on and the weight of that knowledge is not making my decision-making any easier. I just need opinions on what you guys think, or if anyone has gone through anything similar."
5gond8,2,2016-12-05,Accounting College/Career Advice Desired,Skcuhc1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5gond8/accounting_collegecareer_advice_desired/,"Hello,

I am currently a Junior in a State University. I am dual majoring in Accounting and Finance (Separate Majors), and minoring in Information Systems. With my two majors I am expecting to earn 135 credits and my minor will earn 15 credits, which in my state is the required credit hours to sit in for the CPA.

I am posting here to ask two questions:

1. Are my choices of majors/minors enough to make me marketable? Is there anything else I can do to make myself more marketable? I understand GPA is important and I am monitoring it, but I am attempting to make myself as marketable as possible so I can hit the ground running when I graduate.

2. How much of a struggle should I expect to find a job? I would like to try to secure a job a semester before my last so I can transition from college internship to career. I am still open-minded on the kind of Accounting I can do, as the only experiences I have had with accounting so far outside of classes are my internships (Auditing and Staff Accountant internships). I live moderately close to a large city in Pennsylvania and hope to move closer to that area for the short-term future following graduation.

I am paranoid of going unemployed, especially since the Accounting field should not yield that kind of result. Thanks!

I just wanted to share that in 7 months, I will officially be graduating Computer Engineering. I am currently researching for some companies and I am thoroughly excited for my Internship. Apparently, I wrote that i should've graduated earlier. But hey~

My team finished our Engineering Thesis, and I am off to have our book hard-bound today!

I am also doing nothing at the moment aside from finishing my Electrical Engineering courses before my 3 month internship starting at March 2017. So, I am in the process of making my Web Portfolio and hopefully it will be in tiptop shape before January starts! Maybe I'll take a certification if I get enough money for it.

I wish everyone could be as excited and happy as I am today! Love ya, guys!"
5gpskb,2,2016-12-05,Just need to shout into the void about a girl,feel_test,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5gpskb/just_need_to_shout_into_the_void_about_a_girl/,"There's a TL;DR at the bottom if this novel get's too boring to read. Also there's a sexual assault in this story, so if that's something that's going to bother you, best skip this one.

So whenever a situation gets a bit too overwhelming, it helps me to write out my thoughts. This is one of those times.

As I would later find out through talking to both mutual friends and Emma, and then stitching together the timelines, Emma had recently broken up with her long time, long distance, boyfriend. He was her first everything. They had dated in early high school, broken up, seen other people, and then gotten back together again at the end of their senior year but, from what I understand, hadn't put a label on things. He went to school in the US, far away from FSU, and she went to study abroad in London for her first year. This is where Emma met my friend, Jake. I know that she went home with Jake twice, but they never had sex. This is mostly owing to the fact that Jake is an idiot (and that's putting it nicely) when it comes to women, which you'll see later in this story. I've never asked her the details, but at some point she and her high school sweetheart decided to formalize things and the sleep overs with Jake stopped. As far as I know, the relationship went uninterrupted until slightly before winter break at which point they broke up again, but this breakup was short lived. They got back together a couple weeks later while she was home during break. After that they stayed together for almost a year. Emma was now at FSU in her sophomore year. At some point in October, she and her first everything ended things for good. Now I say they, but really it was he who broke up with her every time. Remember this, it becomes important for understanding my reasoning later. 


Now of course when Emma and I first met, I had no idea about any of her backstory. She was just this girl that I instantly clicked with. In fact, when I first started talking to her I didn't even realize that she was the girl my friend had been crushing on for the past year and a half. That first night we ended up sitting on a couch talking, which turned to kissing, which turned to sneaking off to Jake's room to have sex. This particular move, as I would find out later that night in the form of a drunken slap to the face, was not appreciated by Jake. But like all best friends, we got over it in five minutes and were back to our usual selves.
Emma had to leave early the next morning, so I didn't get to say goodbye, but we had exchanged snapchats and began to communicate through pictures continuously. I soon got her number, and quickly she became the person I was talking too the majority of the time. Even at a distance, we still had great chemistry. She was talking as if she was interested in dating, saying that 4 hours, which was the driving time between our schools, really wasn't that far and that I should come down for parties and that sort of thing. This is also when we found out that we were both only each other’s second sexual partners. I had only experienced a spark like this only once before, but I was just an introverted teenager at the time and didn’t really understand what to do with it. That girl and I quickly grew apart, as high schoolers do. Given this, I was definitely maybe interested in Emma.


We talked throughout all of break, and even got close to sending each other nudes at one point, but she backed out with the excuse that she didn't like to send nudes because the last guy had shared them with someone. This is another one that will be important later.
Once we went back to school and the next semester started the conversation began to die down. We still talked every day, but I began to sense that she just wasn't interested anymore, which was to be expected at a distance. When we finally got a long weekend, I went down to FSU primarily to visit Jake, but I also saw Emma and while we held hands and smiled it just felt off... My suspensions would be confirmed later that month when we lost our best friend heart on snapchat, meaning that she was talking to someone else, who in my mind was certainly a guy, more than me. 
I broke. I was finally forced to admit to myself that I sorta kinda actually really liked this girl, so I did the only thing I could at the time and just asked her about it. She told me it was another guy, but that she wasn't interested in dating him. This is also when I found out the date that her last relationship had ended, and that she just wasn't interested in long distance right now as it was too soon. After thinking about it, I agreed and we decided to just be friends with benefits. 
The conversational lull lasted for the rest of the semester, and at one point she completely stopped responding late on weekends, so I figured she was hooking up with someone. Even though I knew this shouldn't hurt me, it did. We were only FWB and it wasn't like I wasn't hooking up with other people too, but somehow the idea of her with other guys felt like a punch to the stomach. 


So the end of the semester comes about and our conversation picks up again, we even sporadically get the best friends heart on snapchat. I have an internship in NY so I'm there for most of the summer, while both she and Jake are taking summer classes at FSU. During this time, quite a few things came to light time through our conversations. 
Firstly, the complete timeline of her relationship with her high school sweetheart. Secondly, that she had slept with her other high school boyfriend over break, but that she was embarrassed by it. As far as I know, I'm still the only one that she's told. Finally, was that she had hooked up with a guy she met in a bar on her birthday a few times, but that he was too old (25) for her, and that she didn't want to be with someone who had to go to a college bar to pick up girls after having already graduated. 
This last revelation was sparked by a conversation that we were having about medicine in which I found out that she was on birth control and anti-depressants. Fearing a little bit for my sexual health if we hooked up again, I asked her if she made guys use condoms to which she responded no. I asked her if she wasn't afraid of STDs and she responded with ""I have a YOLO attitude because I hate myself"". Having just learned that she was on anti-depressants this was a concerning phrase to say the least. It made me realize that this girl has probably been through some stuff, but even someone as curious as me knows there’s some questions you just don’t ask.


Of course hearing that she was sleeping with other guys made me feel sick again, especially that she slept with an ex while at the same time talking to me like we were about to start dating. But I kept telling myself that “we were only friends so it was okay.” After about two weeks of feeling sick I finally convinced myself that that phrase was true, and I let that punch to the stomach feeling go. 


As the summer wore on it became apparent that my dad, who was planning to come up to NY and drive back down with me, would not be able to make it, so I would need a friend to come up instead. Emma and I were having great conversation at this point and I was foolishly falling for her again, so I invited her up for a road trip. I was excited about this until I learned that Emma was once again seeing other guys. Two guys in fact. It wasn't anything serious and she wasn't sleeping with them, but it still hurt and made me really think about whether or not I still wanted to go through with this road trip, as I wasn’t sure that I could keep her in the just friend’s category in my mind. But again I told myself the distance was too much, and that I wasn't being fair to her, which was true. I began to get over it once again, but then another blow struck, Emma finally decided to start sending me nudes. 


Amazing right? Well it was until I realized that something was off... ""Emma"", I asked, ""how many guys are you sending these to?"" I got the answer I didn't want to hear, there was another guy from high school. They had both liked each other in high school but the timing had never worked out and it was one of her ""biggest regrets"" that she had never just kissed him. It came out that this was the guy who had shared her nudes the last time. She told me that there had been one other guy at FSU she sent them to, the guy who we had lost our best friends heart to, but that she wasn't talking to him anymore. It also came up during this conversation about how much she had loved her ex-boyfriend, and that if she hadn't left home for school, she would probably be marrying him soon. This is where him breaking up with her every time is important. It made me think she wasn’t entirely over him.


To her credit, she was honest and I can never thank her enough for that honesty, but I felt like utter shit. Here I was, falling for this girl and meanwhile she was sharing these sexually charged intimate moments with other guys, one of which was the whole reason she wouldn’t share these moments with me in the first place. To me there was one inescapable conclusion, she only thought of me as a stop gap until she could find a way to fulfill her high school fantasies. What. The. Fuck. I had to find a way to get out of this trip. I felt used. 
But then everything changed when woke up to a series of drunken texts from her. She needed help, our mutual friend Jake had assaulted her.


They had been drinking and smoking together and she'd had quite a bit. She was lying with her legs across Jake's lap and Jake took this to mean she was interested so he made his move. She didn't stop him and even kissed back a little according him, though he later admitted he was too drunk at the time to be certain of particular detail, so they went to the bedroom and well... you get the rest. The only problem was that Emma was NOT AT ALL THERE. She had no idea what was happening and when she came to, she was terrified and tried to get me of all fucking people to help. Not her ex, not her old high school crush, me. 
I was asleep and didn't wake up until she had already driven home, dunk and scared (so drunk she doesn't even remember driving). I told her to call me as soon as she woke up. We talked for a few minutes and I determined that she was okay but would refuse to go to any authority. Not being able to do anything I just kept talking to her about nothing while she stayed silent. I listening to her heavy raged breathing the whole time, the breathing of someone I cared about more than I wanted to admit and yet who I couldn't be there for. Eventually she fell asleep.


I immediately called Jake and asked told him what I had just heard. He said he had no idea she wasn't into it, but he realized that something was wrong when she had left. He howled like a wounded animal once he found out what had happened, and then through tears just kept repeating ""I'm a fucking predator, I'm disgusting."" Emma didn't want me to do anything so I respected her wishes and just impressed upon Jake the gravity of what he had done, and that if I even suspected that he was lying about having ""no idea"" we wouldn't even be talking right now. Emma just wanted it to go away though so that left me with only one choice, which was to accept Jake's mistake and move on. I haven't yet been able to forgive him though...
It was at this point that I realized what an ass I had been. Emma, for whatever reason, had decided to trust me of all people when one of the worst possible things had happened to her, and here I was sad that she didn't like me the way I wanted. This girl who had something in her past (remember those anti-depressants from earlier?) was just hurt again in a horrific way. This girl who by total chance had become one of my best friends needed me. My FRIEND needed me. Of course she was coming to NY and we were going on that road trip together.


The events that transpired that night did put a damper on things though. When I had first thought of this trip, I had a secrete hope that I could use it to let her know how I really felt about her, but this event drove that idea from my mind. She needed a friend, not confusion right now. All the flirting we had been doing stopped for a few weeks, and Emma informed me that she probably wouldn't want to have sex. I completely understood and this wasn't a problem for me at all. I think it was during this time that she stopped seeing those two other guys, but I never heard the whole story on them.
As the weeks wore on and her flight up to NY drew closer, the flirting picked back up again. I was trying to keep her in that ‘just friends’ part of my mind, but I couldn’t. She would jokingly get mad at me when I didn't respond to a text because I was asleep, and at one point she even called me ""bae"" but quickly doubled back on it, saying that she called everyone bae. The teasing, waking up to those texts, it made me feel amazing, like there was someone who really cared about me. Then the night before her flight we had a long skype call in which she teased and teased me. We talked about the types of things we were into when it came to sex, and she got very turned on. 


Right after the call ended she sent me a picture of her lacking clothes, but covering up all the important parts... but something was off again. I asked her if she had only sent that to me, and she told me that it had also been sent to her old high school crush. And once again I felt like utter and complete shit. She had used me to build up all this sexual tension, to satisfy her need to know that guys thought she was pretty, and then she released all that tension with the guy she really wanted to be with. I was just the conciliation prize.


But I told myself that this was just me being selfish again, that she was just a friend, and I quickly found myself looking forward to her arrival. The day my internship ended, I picked her up from the airport and we went to my cousin’s house where we had a queen air mattress in a room all to ourselves. There was some initial awkwardness after only having met in person twice and having not seeing each other in person for a solid six months, but it soon subsided.
We cuddled that first night but nothing else happened. The next day was a special day though, it was my 21st birthday. That morning I got something I had wanted for so long, and probably my favorite birthday present to date; waking up next to her. It’s hard to explain what it meant to me to be able to hold her close that morning.
We began making out, which quickly progressed to sex, which ended with us collapsed on the bed. It was amazing to finally be with her like that again. It was the chemistry that had been lacking with every other person sense Emma and I had met... or so I thought.


Maybe a minute after we were finished I went to the bathroom to quickly relieve myself. What I saw when I came out will forever be burned into my mind. She was just sitting there, replying to a snapchat from her old high school crush. We had finished having sex less than three minutes ago, and I was gone from the room less than a minute, but that's all it took for her to forget about me and start talking to the guy she really wanted to be with. She never replied to my snapchats in the morning, but for him, anything. I was worthless, I wasn't wanted, I was just a fucking filler while she waited to be with someone else. All I wanted was to be with her for one day and all she wanted was to be 1000 miles away, back in her home town so she could fuck the guy she really wanted. I walked out that bedroom at one of the highest points in my life, and walked back in at one of the lowest... on my fucking birthday... 


She hadn't even bothered to put her clothes back on before snapping him.
It was at that moment that I knew I had made the right choice not telling her how I felt. She didn't like me the way I liked her, and she had just hurt me in way I had never imagined to prove it. I stayed calm though. After all, this was all my fault right? I wanted her in a way that was unfair so now not only was I hurt by her, but I was also fighting myself. I had to keep telling myself, ""it's your fault, it's your fault, it's your fault"" on repeat. Do you have any idea what constantly telling yourself what a shitty person you are will do to you? It hurt me and I don't know that I can ever forget it. But I wasn't wrong, I still stand by the idea that it was my fault.


The rest of the trip went as smoothly as it could, given the circumstances. Of course it still hurt every time I saw her snapping him, but I knew to expect it now. The cut from that first night wasn't healing though, in fact it was being opened wider and wider. The next day I still wanted to hold her every time I got close, but my heart would stop me. It knew the risks of getting too close now. But the heart, as I found out, is quick to forget. By the time we made it to Washington DC, a mere day and a half later, it was already starting to want her again, so this time my brain stepped in to stop me being stupid. Having my heart want one thing and my brain want another only served to cause me more pain and frustration. Despite this we still flirted and hooked up a few more times.


At the end of the trip I was more hurt and confused than I had ever been, and seeing her go was both one of the greatest reliefs and greatest pains I've ever felt.


With the next semester came a new school for me, as my degree required a transfer my junior year. The school was in my home city, yet another four-hour drive to FSU, and much more prestigious than my old school. I began meeting a lot of people who were just a nerdy as me, and for the first time in a while I felt at home and emotionally safe. I continued to talk to Emma, and time began to heal the wound that was that entire trip. She even started sending me nudes again, and I was beginning to forget. So, when a hurricane hit FSU about a fourth of the way into the semester, I was happy to offer her and her friend a place to stay. 
They came up on a Friday night, and I was actually excited to have them visit for a few days. The first night was surprisingly great. We went to a party, we danced, it was fun. But the next day, all that pain and confusion came rushing back. I became distant, barely talking, just waiting for them to leave. Emma noticed something was wrong with me and asked me what it was multiple times, but I just had no way to explain to her that I liked her too much and because of that she had hurt me. That it completely wasn't her fault, but even though I logically knew that, emotionally it hurt to even be in the same room as her. I never did thank her for asking and caring about me…


After they got power back, which was just two days, Emma and her friend went back to FSU. We still talked regularly and I began to come to terms with the fact the pain I was feeling was mostly self-inflicted. She was too far away, and everyone knows distance doesn’t work right? If I could just be friends with her, that should be enough. We even made plans for her to visit for a festival which was taking place in my city and even possibly spend thanksgiving at my house, but then the conversation began to dry up and the nudes stopped. I had seen this pattern before and I knew what had happened even before I asked, Emma had found a boy to be with.


I asked her how things were going in her romantic life, and she told me about this boy from her home town that her friend had told her about. They were both going to FSU so they met just to meet, and they got along so they kept hanging out until eventually she ""slept over"" at his place. To me this sounded like a shitty cover job for ""we met on tinder"", but how they met wasn't what was really important to me. It shouldn't have mattered, I mean I was hooking up with people at my new school, but the fact is that she had met someone she was actually interested in. I all at once realized that I was still not over it and could not be around her at this point. She told me, she wasn't really serious about him and she, didn't know where it was going, but even still it was too much. I wanted to get out without hurting her.


My solution to this was to stop talking to her as much as possible, and let this new guy fill the void. That way it would be a seamless transition and she wouldn't be hurt. This action of course had the opposite effect. Once I pulled away, Emma finally began responding to my limited snapchats and texts again. She was even starting conversations for a change. She eventually asked me what was wrong and if she could still come to the festival. I lied and told her I had just been busy and figured she would be to, and that she and her friend could still come. In truth, I was a little hurt by the fact that it took me not ignoring her to get a real response from her. It was only after I stopped initiating all the conversations that I realized what a chore it had become to send a funny picture or link, and just get ‘yes’ as a reply. I liked talking with her, not to her, if that makes sense.
I also learned, around this time, that she wouldn't be able to visit over thanksgiving as she was going home. ""Probably for the best"", I thought to myself.


There were still a few days until the festival and during that time I managed to force myself to understand that none of what I was feeling was Emma's fault. I had never told her how I felt, and it wasn't fair to expect her to wait around forever for me to do so. With this thought firmly in my mind, I actually enjoyed her and her friend's visit this time. We went to a party the first night that had of course already run out of alcohol, but it was still packed. We were forced up next to each other, and it may have been my imagination, but it seemed like she was leaning back into me. I smiled. 


We went to the festival the next day and watched a movie together that night. At the start of the movie, I had jokingly leaned on her and been pushed away, but by the end of the movie she was leaning on me. This just made me confused, “why are you leaning on me if you like this other guy?” was the thought in my head. Then all too quickly it was over.
She went back to FSU and her new boy while I was left alone again. We briefly had the snapchat heart again, but soon she stopped responding. I again felt taken for granted. The only way to get her attention it seemed was to ignore her, so she must have only wanted me for validation I thought. I decided that I really and truly needed to stop talking to her this time because knowing that she was sleeping with someone else was just too much and she didn’t really seem that interested in our conversations anyway. This time though, I had to do it right, I had to let her know why.


I started by telling her that I had a confidence booster for her. That if we had lived closer together when we first met, I probably would have tried to date her, but that I didn't think it would have worked out. I expected her to say aww thanks, and then I could use that as a starting point to explain why I needed some space, but her response surprised me. She said that she would have dated me too and that she thought it would've worked out. I had no response to this so I dropped the topic until later.
When I brought it up again, I let her know that I wasn't saying I didn't like her, just that I thought I would have been the bad one in the relationship, which was true. This sparked a whole conversation in which we admitted to each other that we liked each other. When I pointed out that there was still distance, she said ""then what's the point saying that we're both interested if there's nothing we can do?"" This was the first time she'd actually outright told me she was interested in me... I was shocked. Up until then I had only thought she wanted me as a stop gap while she looked for something else, or tried to relive high school, or just needed validation. I had felt used and unwanted, but this made me see things in a completely different light. Maybe I had this all wrong... I had to get her perspective to know for sure. With this new information I suggested we wait until we see each other over winter break to talk about it.


Following this conversation Emma opened up to me. She explained how the whole ordeal with Jake has kept coming to the forefront of her mind as of late, especially the two times she had slept with her new guy. She explained that she trusted me, and that when one of the worst possible things happened to her, I was the one she called. She really wanted me to know that she trusted me, and to know that I trusted her. This is what made me realize that no matter what decision we come to over break, I still want her as a friend. There are very few people I can open up to like I can to her.
She even at one point texted me ""I miss you"" … ""A lot"", which is something I've been wanting to hear for a year now. I smiled like an idiot.


But it's not all sunshine and roses by any stretch of the means right now. It still makes me feel like shit that it took her becoming interested in someone else for me to finally tell her how I felt. In my defense I was trying to bow out gracefully and not cause this whole mess when I told her. Also, it still kills me that even though we've both said we're interested in each other she's still sleeping with this other guy. I can't blame her for it, but I fucking hate it. It makes me feel like she isn’t really interested in me. She apologized once for mentioning him, no idea why though because I was the one who brought it up, but my heart just wants to shout “how can you feel bad that you mentioned him, but then turn around and sleep with him like it’s nothing!?!?” My brain is smarter though, it knows it’s not fair to only tell her how I feel after she meets someone else and just expect her to drop it, especially sense neither of us are sure that we want to follow through on these feelings.


Let me make this very clear, because it is important: I’m not mad at her, I’m mad at myself. I’m mad that I’d let another guy who might just be a fling bother me like this when I was only ever supposed to a one-night stand. I’m mad that my logical side can’t overcome my emotional side. I’m mad that I’m dragging her into all of this. I’m mad that I care so much when we haven’t even talked about what we want to do yet. I might talk to her and realize that this just isn’t going to work. She may very well tell me it just isn't going to work, because she actually likes the other guy. In either case then all I’m right now is making an ass of myself. But then again, and I don’t know how this is for other people, but I’ve never been able to control who I like. It just happens.


Good news is that I’m completely over the flings because when I look at it, they just don’t matter; bad news is that I’m not quite over her old high school crush and her current boy. I know it shouldn't bother me, but that doesn’t change the fact that I feel like there’s a hole in my chest every time I think about her with them. Every time there’s a gap in our conversation, I know it might be that she's sleeping with that other guy, or sending them nudes, or just something that’s going to tie my stomach in a knot. It’s hard not to let my emotions get the best of me and feel like shit, like I’m being used, in the face of that. But once again, this is my fault, not hers.


So here’s where I am right now. My perspective has completely changed from the idea that she was just using me, to the idea that we may have both just been very confused and neither of us knew what we wanted. In fact, I'm still not 100% sure what I want. The only things I’m certain of is I like this girl, and that I don't want to lose her as a friend. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying I love her or anything like that just yet… but I am saying that every time were together I feel a spark, that I see potential there for something amazing, and that I don’t want to pass up the chance we have now for a “maybe someday” just because there’s some uncertainty or doubt.


But having said that, I need to make clear that the things I don’t know far outweigh those that I do. Do I want distance? Does she want distance? Will distance work? How long has she actually liked me? Is she still interested in other guys? Was she ever hurt by me like I was by her? What's her story? 


""What's her story?"" That’s the real question isn’t it? Up until last week I thought I had this all figured out, but now… now I realize that I may have been seeing things completely wrong. She may have been just as hurt, upset, and confused as I was. I have no way of knowing. She’s a very closed person and she doesn’t let just anyone in. I know she’s liked other guys, but I don’t know if they’re still a factor. I know she had something happen in her past, but I don’t know if it relates to what is going on with her now. I know that she likes me, but I don’t know what that means to her. The only way that I see for us to get our friendship back to normal, and possibly get something so much more, is for us to hear each other’s stories from start to finish and truly understand where we each other stands… So that's what I'm hoping to accomplish over winter break.


TL;DR: Met a girl through a friend, but she goes to school four hours away. We both decided that's too far and have been seeing other people. Recently though we've talked about it again and want to reconsider, but at the same time she's sleeping with someone else. I'm very hurt and confused by all of this."

The training also seemed very mediocre, and I'd really like to break into tech/software sales.



I've recently been doing some research on companies with renowned training/growth opportunities &amp; from what I've gathered so far the most common companies I see are:

- Salesforce
- Oracle 
- Xerox 
- Amazon 
- Microsoft 
- Apple 
- Google
- ADP
- Facebook



Now obviously pretty much any Fortune 500 company would have great growth &amp; training opportunities, however, I was just curious if any of you guys know of any companies that are fairly well recognized, has good growth &amp; training opportunities,  &amp; is known for hiring new grads/interns/entry level salesmen. 



Also, I thought it might be worth mentioning that at this point in my career (being a student/intern &amp; all), even though my current preference is in tech/software sales, I'm still not 100% sure which industry I want to dive in to, so all suggestions are welcome.  



I'll be starting to look for another internship soon and would just like to get an idea which companies to pay special attention to when I start my job search.

5gqbsw,36,2016-12-05,But its a foooootball game with faaaaaamily!!!!,Murvi04,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5gqbsw/but_its_a_foooootball_game_with_faaaaaamily/,"Hey guys!  I need to rant...(warning-looong) My parents are driving me crazy, and I'm going to go crazy if I have to have the same argument with them every damn week.

Recently I accepted an internship for this summer in a state 16 hours away from my family.  I did not talk with my parents about the decision, however I spent a lot of time thinking about it and talking to people at the company.  I do admit, I should've discussed it more wiht my parents, but the first thing my mom did when I initially told her about it was say ""that's a great opportunity"" and then go off to say every negative thing she could thing off, including how the weather is bad there.  Wat.  I had been really excited and she basically shot it down, so I hope you can see how I didn't want a repeat of that again.

We have been having repeat arguments about this for a few weeks, where she repeatedly freaks out over the ""unknowns""-aka apartments and transportation, which I have 6 months to look into.  She and my dad don't understand how amazing this opportunity is, they think I have my pick of internships.  Fyi: I DON'T!  I have applied to dozens of internships and only heard back from a few.  As soon as companies hear that I am a freshman, they write me off almost immediately.

This past week, it was the same argument, but with another argument attached.  The day before, I talked to my mom about going on vacation for a few days over break with my BF and some friends.  She was surprisingly but completely okay with it!  Because we wanted a discount and the rooms were being bought quickly, we bought rooms that day.

The next day, it was announced that my college and my mom's alma mater would be playing football against each other in a bowl game, in the same city where my internship would be, at the same time when I was going on vacation.  I was a little disappointed that I wouldn't be able to road trip it to the game with my BF, which we were considering, but I knew we would still have a great time on vacation.  My parents requested that I call them that day, and so I did, a little later than expected because I was in the library for 5 1/2 hours doing papers.  This was whole 'nother freak out on its own.  Apparently the whole day my mom was in a pissed off mood and took it out on my siblings because she hadn't talked to me yet and I asked to push the conversation back by 2 hours.  My sister has started texting me every week telling me to call my mom (I know, a bit flying monkey...) on her specific day requested because my sister has had to deal with it.  I feel for my sister, because she has had to take on the fights with my mother that my mother and I used to have, along with dealing with a concussion and pneumonia.

After arguing about the internship a bit more, my mom tells me that they want to take the whole family to the bowl game. I told her that I had already agreed to a trip with my friends and I couldn't just bail on them.  Both my parents thought I could.  They expected me to just not go and make my friends pay the difference with no second thought. At first they went from the internship side and said it was a great opportunity to tour the facility and meet the people which I do agree would've been nice.  However, they just want to know every single detail about the internship and the people and every freaking thing in my life.  I wouldn't be surprised if my mom would've asked to go meet the people I'd be working with, with me, which is completely unprofessional.  She kept repeating ""you need to get your priorities straight"".  Like bitch please. My ""priorities"" being faaaaaamily.

Then they showed their true colors of wanting to spend time as a faaaamily.  My mom told me that she wanted to watch the game ""with me on the tv or in person at the game"", saying that either way I shouldn't go on the trip.  I can barely stand my mother for just a few hours at a time, let alone an entire car ride.  If I went on that trip it would be pure family hell, and not the fun student experience my BF and I had wanted when we originally were planning to go to the bowl game instead of going on my friend's trip.  She just got so crazy about spending time with family!!! Eventually they just gave up and said let us know by Tuesday.  So I get to deal with yet another blow up when I say that I am sticking to what I have always said-the trip with friends.

I'm going home soon for four weeks of this, and frankly I'm terrified.  I love the independence I've gained over the past four months, and I don't want to go back to a house where I get zero privacy.  I am so ready to not live there ever again.  (And that is saying a lot because my kitty is there :( ) Plus my BF will only be there for about 2 weeks, so I won't be able to escape with him.  Please send help.

I call the flavor ""Carne Soldado"" and I actually stopped making it because my coworkers wanted to buy it all at about $2.50/oz leaving me with not much for myself. I can handle about 4lbs at a time but have to wait for a good day off to mind it.

I made some a couple days ago and one of my interns loved it so much he was very insistent that I use some of his haul from this hunting season to make ground venison jerky. My plan was to use wax paper and a rolling pin rather than a jerky gun but I haven't done anything ground before and haven't done venison. He's giving me about 4lbs of the stuff and I want to get it all done in one shot with a mixture that sounds like it will probably work. If it comes out bad I'll just make him some beef later and we'll be square so really it's just my pride on the line here. I'm viewing this as a challenge.

Questions I have for you: 

How close can I get to my marinade flavor with just dry seasoning?

How do I need to change my process to accommodate ground meat?

How much will venison change things? Can it be seasoned the same?

Thank you very much for your input.

5gt9vl,9,2016-12-06,More depressed now than i have been in years,iactus_absens,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5gt9vl/more_depressed_now_than_i_have_been_in_years/,"This is a throw away account, because of reasons a specific reason i will soon get into. 

This may also just be a venting post as i don't really have anyone to take to about it and just really want to be able to tell someone, with or without advice, it doesn't matter.

A background: I'm 33, male, been on ssi for good while now for depression, ADHD, Bipolar. I use to be depressed really bad years ago, living under the same roof as my dad(when he was alive) mostly, a span from like 15 years old to 27, since i was 15 i always felt as if my dad never treated me as his son, but rather just some guy that he had to take care of, not an only child, im the oldest of 4, i have 2 sisters and a brother that is the youngest; yes i am biologically his son. Out of the 4 of us, i was always forced to do all the chores of the house while my siblings always got to do things and rarely had to do chores, almost like i was literally there just for the work. My they got to go to friend's birthdays, had sleep overs, got to go skip school to go to amusement parks on multiple occasions, too many things to list, while i always had to stay and do the work most of the time, if i got to go out to play growing up, i basically just walked around the block without much to do because i wasn't allowed to go far, let alone a friend's place. Then i got on SSI and started having to pay rent to my dad of 500 a month and had to share a room, this was in my early 20s and continued until i was 27(my dad always told me that i would never find a better deal than what he was giving, and this wasn't the worst part) when my dad and mom had a blowup and he took off across the country, leaving us all behind and told us to follow if we wanted, and my mom sold the place we were living in to a family friend, and i decided to stay and not go and worked out a deal with the new owner to rent from him. Up until then, i was still doing literally every chore of the house and if it wasn't to my dad's satisfaction, i had to do them again, even though i was paying rent. A lot of this just added to my depression especially when i he would threaten me with kicking me out if i didn't do stuff, which also eventually leading me to pull a knife on myself in front of him in the driveway in an act of desperation. It was the first and only time i had ever thought about just ending it all right there, but he acted like i was pulling the knife on him and saw that he didn't really care that i was threatening my own life so i threw the knife into the dirt of the garden. 

That was my lowest point until today. And still is so far.

Before my dad had moved, and i stayed behind, the therapist i was seeing at the time told me that i seemed so much better now that i didn't have to deal with him. And at the same time, i was going to college, learning graphic design and related arts, i don't want to be on SSI forever, i want to make my way. I spent a couple years learning, doing well. And i had to move, and ended up having to cut some classes out because i couldn't make them anymore, but still went. Then a year past and had to move again, and had to stop school, but i learned a good deal, and was even good enough that some of my instructors wanted me hired so i could TA in the Art department, and i was kind of excited and actually started to feel happy that i was actually being valued enough to want me in that position. Until i found out that the school actually had to let some of their TAs go because of cutbacks. So until i had to stop going, i just helped in the classes that i had.

After leaving school, its been close to around 4 years now, it feels like time is just passed so fast. Within that first year of quitting, my dad came to town. My mom and dad had finally divorced earlier that year and she has been back in the state for a while. And literally 2 days after my dad came to visit, he died. I had dinner with him and then get a call from one of his girlfriends 2 days later, on the phone my dad was using and told he died. Apparently i was really the only one in my immediate family that even talked to him occasionally. 

Now in the time between then and now, i find that its hard to get motivated to do work. And i don't mean motivated as in a reason, i mean motivation as in the will to do it. Sure i know that i could get paid to do this, or sure i might get this benefit of doing it, but unless i necessarily have to, or if its really important, i still end up doing it last moment, or doing it late and i really don't understand why. And when i think about this, it makes me even more depressed because i don't know how to fix it.

And then i get to the reason why i'm making this post. I have dated in the past, though, i never really had my first actual date with anyone, literally until i was 28, because life, as you can guess, living under my dad's rule was not easy, and i only very lightly went over it. But i have dated, never really had a relationship last more than 6 months. And it was always kind of the same, as how it is with the rest of my family, and that is that i'm like the black sheep, nothing in common with the rest of my family, and didn't have a lot in common with the girls i have dated. I think the only things i have had in common with anyone in my family was that my youngest sister, my brother, and i like anime, and my brother and i also like some of the same games; besides that, they all like outdoorsy stuff, dirt biking, camping, all that, and i just don't have fun with any of that, so it can be hard to find any real common ground. So my dating life kind of goes the same way, in that they kind of lose interest after a while, i don't go out much, i dont mind it much but i feel out of place in large crowds, etc. 

So, last year, i'm browsing reddit, replying to some posts, and things and i randomly get a PM from someone i have never talked to. It's the first and only time its ever happened, and im extremely skeptical that its someone messin around or trolling or something. But as it turns out, its this girl that was just randomly looking for someone to talk to and make friends. I still was skeptical for a while, but she was serious, so we continued to talk. That was early july 2015, we continue to talk for a couple months, she's pretty awesome and we become close friends, and i kind like her, but she literally halfway across the country, and she is in college and i definitely don't have the money to be able to see her, so i just continued  as a friend. One night she messages me drunk because she is out with some friends, and tells me that she thinks that i like her, so i told her that we can talk when she doesn't have so much alcohol in her system. So we talk later and i explain that i do like her, we have quite a bit in common, and she tells me that i get her more than any other guys she knows right then, but we agree that because we are so far apart, and our current situations doesn't really allow us to be able to be anything more than friends, so we continue as friends, albeit closer than normal, and i think if anyone were to read our conversations, that they would think we were together; nothing sexual, none at all, but if i had to describe it, our conversations could be seen as a bit romantic in my opinion,

Come christmas last year, i dont have much money, but i do have my graphic design skills with photoshop and illustrator, i actually felt motivated to use those skills and made her a rose for christmas. Following christmas, a month later, i helped design something she needed before leaving her internship. And in February, i had made sure to save and sent her Flowers and a bear for Valentines. I guess i was the first guy to ever give her flowers. And a few months later the 1 year anniversary comes around from when she first messaged me, and i remind her of it and tell her how skeptical at first i was. Up until then, we had literally never gone more than a day and half without talking, if i hadn't messaged her that day, she would have messaged me. Since we were so far apart, we couldn't go to the movies together, couldn't sit on the couch and watch a movie, or anything like that, so once in a while, we would watch a movie on our computers, at the same time, using teamspeak, watching the movie at the same time, she would be in bed as well because she was 2 hours ahead, and sometimes she would fall asleep before the movie ended, but we had open mics and could hear each other laugh or talk, or hear her start to snore when she fell asleep. Later in july her birthday rolls up and i had sent her flowers again and some chocolate covered strawberries. At this time she had just bought a house, and starting to work some extra hours so she could pay for some more of the extra expenses, and would still talk every day even if it was to say goodnight, because she was tired from the extra work.

Then a month passes and started not getting any responses except every couple of days, which i assumed was from the extra work, no big deal. Then started going an entire week without any responses, then finding out she finally got a roommate, making it easier on her. Then, not only was i not getting any responses but once a week, it would be single message responses that i got no response to my follow up message and would be another week before i would get another message. Then it expanded, the same thing, but once every 2 weeks, until yesterday. And she tells me that she's been busy, and then tells me that she excepted someone as her boyfriend. I'f be lying if the thought didn't cross my mind, she is gorgeous, and really smart, i mean, she has a masters in electrical engineering now, she's funny, and she's the only girl i've ever felt this connected to. And of course we talk for a few minutes, and she knows how i feel about her, at least she knows i like her, and told her i would have asked her out properly if we had any way of seeing each other, and i have no doubt from what she said that she would have loved that as well. And of course i had to be the good guy and tell her that i want her to be happy. No matter how much i want that happiness to be with me. And now, being the guy that is interested in her romantically and was sending her flowers before her starting to date this other guy, i have no choice but to take the back seat and possibly not have much contact with her anymore. And the whole situation just started hitting me so much harder than i thought it was going to. I just start randomly crying, i feel like i want even less to see anyone that i don't have to and just lock myself in my room, leaving to use the restroom and grocery shop. As you can tell, the reason i can't post this under my normal account because we met through reddit. I don't know if she ever stalks my account or not, but i can't really take that chance.

On one hand, i want to tell her how much she means to me, tell her i want to be with her, and try to convince her. But then i risk looking like a douche and looking desperate. And on the other hand, i really want her to be happy, and i think she deserves at least to see if she can get that with this other guy. It makes me feel so torn. It makes me feel depressed, almost as bad as back with i lived with my dad. And while talking with her, my motivation was definitely increasing, and i was more productive, now its at an all time low, to the point of not even wanting to click on a simple youtube video and just blankly looking at the page, not really reading or doing anything."

I've been unable to stop crying because I did badly on a test and will probably get a C in the class. I know there are so many greater problems out there in the world, and I feel ashamed that this one is making me feel this terrible, but I can't help it.

I'll try to give some details and keep it brief.

I'm a 33/M who graduated from college with a degree in a field I've come to feel just isn't my passion or at least what I've done so far hasn't been very interesting at all. I was doing IT support but lost a few jobs because of my lack of motivation and shitty people skills. I don't have any real friends right now, I have some old friends from FB but I've talked to very few of them in the past few years. Not sure if most of them be considered friends per se, more like acquaintances. I'm a virgin, have never had a girlfriend, and haven't been on a date in year or so. And I live with my mom.

I was unemployed from the end of March until about mid to late September when I got an internship with a company doing web development. But I've done very little actual coding. Now the internship is going to end in a few weeks and I don't know yet if they'll hire me on or if I'll be cut loose. I got the job through doing a web dev bootcamp which is also coming to an end because it's just too expensive to keep going.

I've found that I'm not that passionate about web development either or at least I haven't seen what is that interesting about it. I haven't put my all into it either because of my doubts about it being what I want to do.

So now it's looking like I could be unemployed again and I won't get any unemployment because I've used that up. Now I'll have to get some temp job or something else that I'll probably hate and will ruin me and probably drive me to kill myself at some point.

Also, the stress has caused me to become addicted to junk food so my health isn't as good. I try to exercise a few times a week but it's not enough.

I wish I could find some way to escape this but it just feels like I don't have it in me to do something I hate just to survive. Not sure if anything can help me but I just wanted put this out there to make me feel better for at least moment. I just hate how once you slack off on giving your all in life, it becomes a habit and then effects everything else until you find yourself alone, angry, and full of despair (and now, chubby).

I'll be graduating with a first in computer science by the end of the year, and I've been keeping an eye on internships and grad jobs to see what opportunities are available.

I've applied for a couple of positions that are starting at the end of 2017, but I'm eager to start getting some experience working in IT before then! I'm currently in a retail job, and feel like I'd be stuck in limbo in a way that doesn't let me develop my skills if I stay in retail for the better part of next year. 

I have experience with software engineering and Java from my degree course, as well as other modules. I'm particularly interested in software development or engineering roles. 

Does anyone have any tips or know of any positions - voluntary, internships, whatever - in IT companies in NI that would be available early next year? 

Many thanks in advance!"

I was a semester away in graduating with both of them as majors, but I decided to not pursue furthermore. I graduated from an ivy league engineering school, but my GPA is sub 3.0 (can be rounded up to 3.0) and my cGPA is near the same. I have not had any internship experience, but I have had three summers worth of research experience in labs (unfortunately, no publications). In addition, I have taken the major computer science courses except for elective credits in my CS curriculum. 

I have thought about applying to R&amp;D jobs, but my research experience is supplemented with biology knowledge of a sophomore, so I don't know if I'd have much to talk about in an interview/application. Majority of my programming classes were taken in my last year, so they kept me busy enough such that I haven't engaged in an independent or group project out of class. I have used ASPEN/COMSOL within my ChE curriculum, but do not know how any other ChE related languages. In my CS curriculum, Java is my strongest language, followed by C, some android programming (Java), and Haskell.  

I admit that I have not applied to jobs, as I have needed somewhat of a mental break after 5 years of this coursework; however, looking on this sub-reddit, it makes me feel very grim about the job application process. I have looked heavily into my career services, but they basically post consulting/business/finance jobs since majority of the class applies to them, leaving me 3 or 4 jobs to apply to. What jobs/sites/locations would be best for me to look into? Should I pursue chemical engineering jobs, or are there programming jobs that I could look into?"

I'm looking for some books related to:
 -Audit (I have a full time internship lined up for the summer after I graduate)
 -CPA Prep (any books that will give me some insight and prep)
 -Cost Accounting (taking a tough course this spring, professor is a hard ass and difficult to understand)

Any material helps! Even if just a personal favorite. Almost everyone said to take my mind of things and relax for break, but simply reading and staying on it is what relaxes me! "

The reason I probably decided to do this is because my mom absolutely blew up on me a few days ago and I am very upset.

So.. here's my situation. I was diagnosed with ""Dissociative disorder with a depressed mood"" at the age of 16. My form of depression feels like a ""chronic"" version rather than a ""severe"" version. Basically, it's something that kind of hinders me every day but is not enough to cripple me. There's rarely a day where I go without thinking about wanting to die, but I would probably never really do anything unless pushed to the extreme edge. I think one of the main problems is my parents could be the very cause of my depression. I have tried taking medication(I've tried over perhaps 5 different kinds) but none of them worked and I decided to quit on that front and never bothered to see a real psychologist again because frankly seeing one only once a week and paying the $ didn't seem worth it...

I grew up with your stereotypical ""Asian parents."" I know deep down they wanted what's best for me, but their method to convey that is EXTREMELY WRONG. Everything I did, unless it was perfect felt as if it meant nothing at all. No matter how well I did, if it was not a 100 my parents felt it was a disappointment. They always thought by telling me I had to do better because my current scores are not good enough was suppose to motivate me to do better and try harder. Aka ""Talk shit to someone so they will think to do better next time"". Instead what this really does is make me feel even LESS motivated and more depressed. I remember one time I even received a 100 on a test and my dad replied with, ""What did the other people get? If everyone got 100s, your 100 doesn't mean shit."" I felt at some point in my life, subconsciously I stopped caring about life in general. It got to a point where you could say I was a ""video game addict"" and it may still apply even now. I don't feel I am because I always prioritized important things above video games. The thing was if something did not seem mandatory I ended up playing video games just to waste the time away.

The thing is from that psychological evaluation I also found out my IQ was 115. I kind of feel like it is being wasted. I did graduate college with some struggles. I started off in a major I didn't like and switched to Statistics around my 3rd year, it took me 5 years to graduate. During my school years I had never really ""Studied"" as well. Even if I tried it felt like I couldn't focus on studying. However, for some reason in my last 2 years of college, I actually  made an effort in my major. I ended up with a 2.96 cumulative GPA but a 3.62 Major GPA. This was a HUGE disparity. I thought a bachelor's would perhaps be enough and tried to look for a job but found out that in my field the majority of people wanted someone with a graduate degree.

Instead of doing something about it quickly... I ended up wasting my life away playing video games the majority of the time while trying to look for a job. This lasted for 4 years.

Currently, due to some connections, I was allowed to first volunteer(in which now I am being payed a little standard ""intern"" rates), but this is only temporary, my time is up at the end of December and this will probably NOT turn into a permanent position. From doing this work, I had realized that perhaps it was true that I needed to learn graduate level material. My parents had wanted me to go to grad school since the beginning. I finally had made a little effort(TBH I really did not make a dedicated effort) to studying and taking the GRE exam.

I ended up with a 151 Verbal score(51% percentile), 161 Math score(79% percentile), and a 4.5 in Writing(83% percentile). My mother thinks this score is ABSOLUTELY NOT GOOD ENOUGH and wants me to retake it. I felt this score was ""Average"" when compared to average GRE scores of accepted graduate students in the schools I was planning to apply to. The main reason she blew up on me was because of this. I really do not want to retake it because it is very hard for me to actually be motivated and focus on studying but she is essentially screaming at me to do it.
This is also due to my GPA being under a 3.0. I had talked to a graduate director who said that 3.0 is the minimum but not necessarily. So now I'm basically stuck in this situation....
My main issues is finding a way to be ""motivated"" and being able to focus on doing anything(I do NOT have ADD/ADHD though). I can do my current job decently it's not like I haven't been doing a good job either. I just feel like I'm better at actually doing something and experiencing it for myself rather than ""studying"" and looking through a book to learn things.

Sometimes I just feel extremely lonely and my parents aren't a help. My parents don't believe in depression, they think you can just ""think"" your way out of it. My mother associates depression with sadness which pisses me off whenever she mentions it. She keeps trying to say ""Everyone gets depressed but they get over it.""

I can't even tell the last time I felt ""happy."" At this point in my life I'm not sure if my personality is just this way or if it's due to my depression. I don't get ""Excited"" about anything, it feels like most of my emotions are negative(sad or angry mostly) and I sometimes feel incapable of ""Good"" emotions.

How/What can I do to try to move forward in life?"

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

We are recruiting for the start of the 2017 school year (Fall Semester). The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our starting lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies. The University’s dedication and persistence in this effort is an institutional priority.

Player Recruitment Form: https://wku.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0OqUiJkK11c26mV Lastly, WKU has many scholarships available for students, including those in the eSports program. Be sure to check out our academic programs and our BEAUTIFUL campus!

If you have questions or to find out more information regarding becoming a player, or a degree and internship as: assistant coach, broadcaster, journalist, or social media marketer for the WKU eSports program, please email: WKUeSports@wku.edu"
5gxosa,3,2016-12-06,"I (42/M) don't know how to let go of my (29/f) wife, who is obviously horrible to me.",Tiredasfuckofthis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5gxosa/i_42m_dont_know_how_to_let_go_of_my_29f_wife_who/,"So I say “wife,” but she hasn't married me.  Which sucks.  

Anyway, I just don't know how to do this.  She's really pretty shitty to me.  Starts fights over everything.  The last time (this past Saturday) was because I expressed concern that we were buying the kids (2 mine, 2 hers, 13, 11,10, and 8 in age) too much for Christmas.  She railed on me, saying I didn't give her an alternative.  Honesty, I wasn't asking for an alternative, just expressing concern.  The kids have everything already.  Just worried about spoiling them.

I'm a man well into my career.  Not long after we met, I took a job in Virginia where I made about $90k/yr.  I left that job to move to Nevada to be with her, but the job I took here makes only about $70k/yr.   We could've fought her ex in court to be able to move where I was, but I guess I just took the path of least resistance.  Found a job out here making less, but thought that as long as we were together, everything would be ok.  Probably a huge mistake.

We've been together for 6 years, 3 of it was long distance.  She's always been extremely jealous.   Found extremely ridiculous reasons to accuse me of cheating on her.   Didn't answer the phone?  Must've been with another girl.  Mistakenly included a pair of my 10 year-old daughter's socks in a package I sent back to her?  Obviously another girl's socks that I had been fucking.  Stuff like that.

One thing you should understand is that this woman, while she may be unstable, is extremely smart.   Although she's 29 (teen mom that never got to realize her full potential), she's just now in her senior year of undergraduate studies.  She has now taken the LSAT twice and plans to attend law school.  I know her better than anyone in the world, and know she'll have zero problem getting her JD and passing a bar exam.  She's easily the smartest person I know.  Actually, another thing you should know:  She's stunningly beautiful.

She's an intern at a local county courthouse.  The good people there are amazed by her because she's smart.  The others there are amazed by her because she's gorgeous.  I accepted the fact a long time ago that when you're with a beautiful woman, guys are going to hit on her.  Whatever.  I get that.  What I want is for her to react to that the way she'd  want me to react in the same situation.  I'm moderately attractive.  I'm a 7, she's a 10.  It's been this way forever.  She makes all these “I'm fat and ugly” comments all the time, but honestly, she knows better.

Several times, she's gone out with a girlfriend of hers that I hate,  This girl has repeatedly encouraged her to cheat on me or find someone else.  To tell the truth, I think this girl hates our age difference.  Has previously tried to set her up with other guys. Many times.  We'll call this girl “Laura,” 

After this last argument, my wife has informed me that she's going out with Laura Saturday night.  An occasion around here where girls get dressed up “sexy.”  And I've had enough of this shit.  

She treats me terribly.  She has zero compassion for how I feel.  It's obvious  she doesn't love me like she used to. Here I am taking care of her kids (even though they call me “dad” and have for years), while she's out spending time with a parole officer for her internship.  She already has enough hours for her internship this semester, but is still out with some male probation officer for “the experience.”

 I know I need to leave,  She's awful to me.   I've tried expressing to her numerous times how I feel, but she just doesn't care.  Her defense mechanism is anger.  She knows it works, and if she fights about something, she knows I'll do anything to avoid it.  

My question is, how do I do it?  How do I remain strong enough?  How can I tell these kids goodbye when I love them?

There are so many other details, but I've been long enough.

Can someone from experience tell me how to do what they know is right, even though it hurts?
 

TL;DR - She hates me, how can I hate her back?"
5gy55r,8,2016-12-07,What has *actually* helped you recover? My therapists are garbage,Queen_E,rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/5gy55r/what_has_actually_helped_you_recover_my/,"I'm curious to know if there are recovered survivors on here who feel like they have recovered. I was raped 10 years ago for the first time. I haven't dated since. 

My friends have tried to be helpful but many are too freaked out to listen to me. The main thing that seems to have helped is reading books from experts who have extensive experience with rape via clients and also often personal experience. 

I've gone to a dozen or so therapists in the meantime and they have been hot garbage humans. I think most therapists are frauds. 

I have found that even though many therapists say they deal extensively with rape and trauma, they don't seem to know about a variety of promising therapies or techniques. They drag me through individual therapy promising me they'll hook me up with an EMDR specialist or a group or a great psychiatrist or whatever, but these are empty promises. I had a therapist drag me along promising me she'd find me a group (RAINN couldn't find any free or cheap ones, other groups required bundling individual and group and cost double). After two years, she dumped me and I never found a group. 

I can't afford a therapist who is trained. A lot of therapists are frauds. It sucks recounting your rape dozens of times to new therapists every time you are interviewing them. I've done intakes and then had to recount my rape again when I was assigned a new therapist. I'm currently with a group where I've had to recount my rape to an intake person, the therapist I was assigned (an intern who is so inexperienced, I can't handle it), and now the EMDR coordinator. I'll have to recount it again for EMDR. 

I'm so sick of this. Please let me know if you have techniques that have been helpful. It's been 10 years and I'm still fighting on a daily basis to not kill my self. Everyone says if you get raped, you need therapy. This is fucking bullshit. I've been to a dozen therapists and they're fucking frauds. I need solutions not con men trying to take my money (and not my insurance). "
5gye8q,1,2016-12-07,Advice - 1,jizaenthapus,TimeBugDJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeBugDJ/comments/5gye8q/advice_1/,"For graduate school, the most important parts of your application are your letters of recommendation and any research you have done. (Plus, if you're on the programming/practical side, examples of your work. On the theory side, programming isn't very important.)


I would think the same would be true when applying for internships.


So, letters of recommendation and research.


For letters of recommendation, you obviously want people who will write good things about you.


You also want people with whom your academic interactions have been as close to what you are applying for as possible. A letter from a CS professor is better than a letter from a history professor. If you're applying for theory stuff, a professor focused on theory is better than one who focuses on software engineering.


As a second-year undergrad, your academic interactions so far with professors is probably limited to taking classes. Anything you can do beyond that is a big plus. Where I am a grad student, professors are often willing to work with undergrads if they express an interest in the professor's area of study. Second-year is a little early but it never hurts to try. Just having a recommendation letter from a professor you've done research or independent study with is a big plus, and if it leads to a publication, it's an even bigger plus."

I have been prescribed ketamine capsules for about 5 months now. I take four 30 MG capsules each night right before I go to bed. I am a 134 lb female and in my early twenties. I have been diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) and the ketamine capsules are for treating the crops. I have also bee diagnosed with U.C. I have been in and out of the hospital for endless UC flares. And now my GI doctor has considered that something is wrong with my pancreas. I get bad random sharp pains in my left lower side above my hips kinda in by my ribs. I have bad heartburn and troubles swallowing food and now even water- I always choke. I have bad nausea randomly and anytime after I eat it is always painful with sharp pains and gas like pain.
The compound ketamine caps are a trial and error type of thing interns of treatment.
If anyone knows anything about anything that relates to this I would love to hear from you. This is a really hard and painful time for me.

I will be moving to Prague for 1 year for my internship tomorrow. But I was wondering which Mobile operator would suit me best. Here in Belgium I pay 15 euro (around 400 CZK) monthly for 4 GB of data, 10 000 free texts and 0.30 euro (8 CZK) per minute. 

Considering that not every Czech operator has an english website I'm not entirely sure which one would suit me best. Could somebody please give me some advice and insight in the matter?

I would now like to challenge myself in something more than a personal/testing project. I know there are many open source projects I could contribute to but I don't think that would be my best fit as a starting point.

I would like to join a single developer (junior/senior doesn't matter) or a small team and work as a *part-time free internship* (~4 hrs/day) to get my hands on a production application: being it commercial, open-source or personal.

I would consider this as a job and for this reason I would like on the other end to join someone who will actively work on the project (so *weekend-only* projects are excluded).

Is there anybody out there that could be interested?

*Please consider I cannot simply get a full/part-time job as a developer since my current job does not permit that.*

Thanks!"

I'm living in a highly populated city in the Netherlands as a student studying communication &amp; multimedia design. I have one and a half years to go until graduation and I've been wanting to have my own place for the longest time. Now as you might imagine, theres not much to rent in this city, and if there is, people jump on it immediately. In a facebook group for renting here theres even a whopping 18.000 students looking through the offers. Theres simply too many people and not enough places. 

Now recently, I saw an offer come up with not alot of response. It's 30 square metres and has 2 huge windows and a seperate bedroom (inc. in the 30 sq. metres). One small problem, it's 526 euro's per month. It includes gas, water and electricity though. As a student I can currently get 348 euro's as a monthly allowance for being a student (not sure what the English word is) and an extra 190 euro's if I move to my own place rounding up to 538 euro's. On top of this I am making roughly 2-300 a month from 2 webshops I own and I am currently doing an internship making another 300 a month but this ends soon. BUT they offered me freelance work making me 12 euros an hour but the hours could vary alot obviously. 

I want to live on my own and the place is amazing, should I take the risk knowing I might come short and have to borrow some extra or get a job in the eve? I am thinking it's worth the experience and I might regret not taking this oppertunity later on.
Do any of you guys barrely make enough per month on your own?

I wanted to know about my faith, I frequented Islamic forums. Yet, ever since puberty came, I was trapped and caged by PMO. No matter what I did, no matter how more ibaadah I did, I kept returning to PMO. This led to a state of hopelessness. At the age of 18, I was introduced to Purify Your Gaze and I thought I would be fine from now on. Yet.. still I kept returning and returning until I stopped private counselling with him. I remember that Zeyad Ramadan (my counsellor) told me on the very last meeting that I hadn't yet decided to quit PMO...

Time went on and I did an internship abroad in an Islamic country. Masha Allah it was amazing and I felt I no longer needed PMO. And it went natural! I could actually leave it. The atmosphere was so spiritual. Upon returning back to my home, soon I engaged in PMO again. Had't I learned anything from my time abroad? Or was it my environment?

Now.. fast forward, things have escalated so much that I have visited prostitutes. I used to be so happy that I was a virgin, that despite PMO I atleast didnt engage in sex. I feel empty, I hate myself, I loathe myself. I feel useless, as if I can't do anything good. As if I belong to the majority who will go to Hell.

I don't even know what to do anymore. I got so many advices from genuine people, yet I failed to have the strength.
I fear my Lord, not in a good way, rather that I am ashamed in front of Him and scared to ask forgiveness or even make du'aa. I feel as if I don't belong to Islam. as if my Prophet will hate me (referring to the Hadith that our Prophet sees our deeds every thursday). All this sweet talk to others was of no benefit. All these times in Ramadan in i'tikaf suddenly seem so hopeless.

Dear reader, if you have read this, please don't let it escalate this much. Oncd you're at the stage where I am, its gonna be so hard to become pure.

I ask of your du'aas dear brothers. Perhaps a sincere soul amongst you will make du'aa for me to help me wake up from my heedlessness and hopelessness..."

**quick background**: I am a PMP with 3-4 years experience with project coordination, project management (as a PM), and PMO analysis and development  (PMO Director's right hand man). However, I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

On my way to gain more experience, I was working for one of the Big Four for a couple of months before a debilitating medical condition ruined me for the better part of two years. I was doing part time independent consulting while working with the top doctors, but they were 4 month engagements (small business work). Eventually, the doctors gave up till one suggested moving to a different region of the states as the climate was shown to help my condition.

**The dilema**

I moved and settled in my new location around Q2 of this year. Since then, I have applied to countless jobs but have had no luck, except for a couple positions that have had me waiting since September to ""ramp up"" on boarding. By the start of October, I lost hope and started taking tutoring positions (PMP exam prep and math) while going to school part time to expand my technical knowledge  (my background is economics).

I have a very promising position lined up, however they won't be ramping up until January. However, prior to hearing about the ramp up in January (originally scheduled for November), I was looking to move 8 hours away from the job to take an internship while I continue to diversify my skill set.


**Basically**
The thing is, there are some hard deadlines about commiting to the classes and internship coming up around the same time as the scheduled ramp up.

Do I wait to see if the promising position leads to anything? Do I continue down the path to increase my skill set?

After such a long hiatus in my CV, I am worried that waiting will only hurt my chances of getting back on track more, so I am thinking about moving and continuing my education while making some small cash on the side.


**However**

This position  (in a fortune 500 company) will not only get me career going again, but I won't have to start back in square one.


**If any, more exprienced individuals could chime in**

So I'm in the process of getting an internship for Summer 2017 for a Representative and I'm trying to figure out what my best options are in terms of housing if I end up getting it. I've seen in a few places that WISH sucks, but why is that the case/what rules do they have? Can you sign people into your room? I was looking into the luxury condos, which don't look so bad, but I'm curious about what people think. 

I'm looking for ideally a 1 bed/studio apartment in DC, I'm definitely looking into places outside WISH that do short term as well, and price isn't really a big issue for me as long as it's less than 10k for the summer.

Anyone have insights or thoughts? I wouldn't mind doing intern housing because it would be cool to make friends and stuff right away, but I want to make sure I have my own bedroom at least, and I'd like to be in DC (not Arlington/Bethesda or anywhere outside the city) for sure. I also plan on having a friend visit at some point for a weekend so if WISH prohibits overnight visitors that will be an issue.

I manage data migration at a startup here in town and we're in need of more team members. I had a great experience hiring from /r/vegas last time so I thought I'd try it again before posting the position on other job boards.  Here's the basics:

We manage data coming out of a variety of case management softwares and migrate it into our own. We work almost exclusively with law firms so familiarity with law firms or legal case management software is a big plus. (though not required. You can learn how law firms operate.)

The job requires a lot of time spent with spreadsheets (or SQL databases if you're into that) so you must be comfortable handling excel.  Having some SQL experience is a big plus, but not required.

This would be a great position for any very technically minded law firm employee looking for a change, or for CS students wanting to intern at a startup.  Recent CS Grads may fit here as well doing some database management work, with possible opportunities for advancement as the startup grows.  

The opening is immediate.

Filevine is a case management software solution for plaintiff-side law firms. We have experienced massive growth over the past couple years and our userbase has grown exponentially. Of course, we need an ever increasing team to help our users.

Our office is located around Tropicana and Arville. We have a relaxed work environment with a fun team.

There is a troll out there that frequently writes about ""scams in China"". These scams usually have to do with either internships in China, TESOL courses or teaching English in China.

All of his work is done anonymously under different usernames and on different platforms. He never reveals his true identity. He frequently attacks companies, people, websites and programs. He has attacked big names like ESL Cafe, Echinacities and The Beijinger.

He doesn't typically use the same platform for long, but all of his work links together. He creates articles on different sites and then links them all together. If he uses your site he is doing it for his SEO.

He also frequently spams and replies to his own posts with different usernames.

**Like here:**

Here's another example:

You'll see that many of those link out to his sites and posts listed below like scam.com, chinascamwatch.wordpress.com, etc.

**How to identify him?** As mentioned he writes about the above topics and he never reveals his true identity.

**His sites:**

I'm a college student paying my own rent ($300 per month).

I had a part time job that was paying quite well till now ($1000 a month) so paying rent was easy. But I didn't manage my money too wisely and only have about $500 in the bank. 

Right now I don't know for sure if I would be able to continue with the job next semester. But I do have an offer for a summer internship (starting late May) that would pay quite well.

I recently got an Amex EveryDay card that has 0% introductory APR through November 2017. I'm wondering if its a good idea to pay the rent using this card and carry a balance till I start my summer job.

Just to clarify, I'm thinking of doing this only if I can't return to my part time job for the spring semester and don't find any other source of income.

Thanks!

Edit: There is a $5 fee if I pay the landlord using a CC."

I'm currently studying abroad, and I have one more semester of undergrad left before graduating in May. 

I'm counting down the days until I head home (4) but instead of being excited, I'm just really overwhelmed with the idea of going back to the ""real world"" 

Life here has been so easy. It has been easy to restrict, it has been easy to not binge. (I'm living in a dorm and I don't have a car and I don't trust myself on the local public transportation, so outside of the really bad school food, there is almost no way for me to get food. It's been amazing.)

But I'm going home, and home is not this easy. Home is where the pressure to constantly look like I have everything put together is. At home there are classes, an internship, a job, my family, all these things that need balanced. And there is food... everywhere. Every social event, every drive home from school, in the house that I live in. It's everywhere.

For the past three nights I've dreamt about food, and eating, and restaurants over and over again. 

I'm so incredibly anxious. I don't trust myself around food. I already feel shame and guilt and anxiety of the binge I just know is going to happen. 


My family is going to want to take me out. I'm living with them again (until at least May). My parents are both teachers, so they'll be home all day during Christmas break, and I don't currently have a job to escape to. Then there is Christmas and holiday food. Then family dinners all through the spring. 

I know I don't have a choice, but my inner self is throwing a tantrum and screaming ""No, I don't want to!""

And in the end, I just get really sad. I want to think about going home and seeing my family and be all warm and fuzzy inside because of the holidays and be excited about graduation, but instead I just think of the food, and the pressure. And I hate it.

I'm here today to ask for a game that might fulfill a gap in my heart. Tomorrow is my birthday, and for the reasons stated below I decided to ask for a game. Hopefully some kind heart (or opulent fellow hunter) will be touched by my request.
___

Quick info:

What I want:[God Eater Resurrection - PS Vita [Digital Code]](https://www.amazon.com/God-Eater-Resurrection-Vita-Digital/dp/B01HJ149LI)

How much does it costs: $19,99

My PSN ID: [War_Machida](http://psnprofiles.com/War_Machida)

Okay, it's been a while since I really felt like I was *playing videogames*. I mean, I've tried so many games, wasted so much money this year... Like, I know that this is an unpopular opinion, but I couldn't get into The Witcher 3, played Overwatch in the free weekend, borrowed some games... but it never feels *fun*. Thankfully I made a good friend in my last internship as a teacher, somehow I convinced him to purchase a PS4 and we played through Bloodborne together, we even got through those nightmarish Chalice Dungeons and we both got our prized Platinum trophies. This was an amazing experience, I was laughing at all times, even dying for the last DLC Boss (also, I have to thank this sub for this DLC cause I requested it here) uncountable times.

But, besides Bloodborne, I feel like my gaming collection is always *empty*. Like a girl that has nothing to wear (or myself, sometimes I could use a new t-shirt or two), I look at my gaming library and it feels like nothing is really interesting. Just recently I sold some Wii and PS3 games so I could buy Titanfall 2, but still it wasn't what I was looking for, and felt like I wasted money once again. Unfortunately every single gaming purchase that I made in the past 6-8 months was physical, so I can't sell them to get new games. Fortunately, for this same reason, my gaming library isn't shrinking as hard as it was, so I can always redownload something that I might try again and find it interesting this time.

But, guys, nothing, ever managed to replace one game in my heart. This special game is called MONSTER HUNTER! (""wait, I thought you'd say God Eater"").

[As you guys can see in this picture from my personal Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/4aJeS3NNBp/) - and I apologize for not knowing how to download this picture and reupload it on imgur ^but ^it ^is ^really ^me ^^and ^^I ^^can ^^prove ^^it ^^^so ^^^it's ^^^fine ^^^^I ^^^^guess - I was very addicted to Monster Hunter back in the day. I got a 3DS XL solely to play Monster Hunter while waiting for class in college, back in my first degree, and even though I purchased other games for the system, the only thing that made me stop playing MH3U was the release of MH4U.

I was so goddamn addicted that played it until my last day with this 3DS XL system. It hurts me till today, but I decided to sell the console, with every game I owned (and that included SMTIV's special edition, that I never got past the first boss), for a generous amount of money (that I believe I used to get MGSVPP and Bloodborne, and I believe the change was converted into clothing for my girlfriend, but I'm not quite sure since it's been a while). When I sold everything I was counting on a MHX (or Generations here in the West) release for the Wii U, or even a future Monster Hunter game on playstation platforms, but this never happened and this MonHun desired was never fulfilled.

I jumped on some games like Freedom Wars and Soul Sacrifice Delta, they're very good, but never achieved the status that MonHun has in my heart. I believe that **COOP** was a very important feature during my MH experience, and it was absent from other games. Despite these Vita games having online coop, I could never enjoy them quite well because I used to meet some friends at the local shopping center and play MH all day.

My request for God Eater Resurrection comes because said internship/Bloodborne friend is also willing to pick this game up, but will get it after I purchase the game myself, so we could play together like in Bloodborne.

He is a huge anime fan, and I'm getting into it with some dedication (recently watched Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, Madoka, Gundam the Origin and I'm ready to tackle more anime), and he has some God Eater experience. He said that the anime is pretty good, and he played a getto-esque, PSP-emulated, cheap controller-binded version on his PC and LOVED IT despite the technical difficulties, and said that, judging by our tastes, this game could appeal both of us, and it is long enough to occupy our free time in this long holiday break, since both our classes and job opportunities only start in February. He'll get the PS4 version, but I believe the Vita version is best suited for me (and the game has cross-play!).

I'm really into this game's design, soundtrack, gameplay mechanics... I believe it is the game that I could play for AGES before putting it down to study next semester. It is worth mentioning that I received 3 honorable mentions by my BA in english with licensure course, so gaming is not ruining my studies and I'm actually trying my best to improve myself, get a nice job and go on with my life.

Tomorrow I'll turn 24, with no job or any opportunities in the horizon, my money is barely enough to pay for next semester (saved during this whole year of internship, that I had to quit and now they closed their school for some reason), so I can't really go on spending loads of money. I still have to get a couple gifts for my girlfriend since her birthday is in 10 days from now, had to ask for *momnetary* funds for those, and already asked my father for some books, so here's my only option.

Or, if you're unable to fulfill my request, wish my a happy birthday! I hope you guys enjoy these holidays (snowy or not), play tons of videogames and eat a bunch of delicious food!"

I recently moved to Brussels for a 6 month internship and need some advice regarding the internet here.

I initially wanted to go with Scarlet, but turns out they dont like foreigners... So in my area I wold pretty much be stuck with Proximus. RIght now I am connected via a Proximus Fon hotspot (probably to my neighbor) and have a decent 30/10 WiFi speed for 30 EUR/month. It also seems to be unlimited (can somebody confirm?).

The other option would be a promo pack from Proximus (Familus M) for 50 EUR/month and 100/15 ""unlimited"" internet and some other goodies I would not really use. It is only that cheap for the first 6 month, but I do not want more... 100GB limit on their ""starter"" pack is too small and the ""maxi"" pack has an installation fee of 59 EUR...

I need to decide between playing it safe and getting the Proximus pack or praying that I will be able to access the Hotspot for the rest of my time here and safe some money.

What would you do? Anybody has any experience with both options? How easy is it to cancle a subsription with Proximus?

It is reportedly accurate enough to detect the difference between a North American of African descent and an East Indian from Mumbai so that the name ""Nigger Jim"" in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is correctly altered to read ""Slave Jim"" and ""Dalit Jim"" 95% of the time. A spokesperson said it wasn't quite ready for release as its AI was still having difficulty with the meaning of 'politically correct'. For instance, when used by a tester wearing a Hilary Rodham Clinton mask, the device immediately replaced multiple emails with blank spaces. When a technician wearing a Donald Trump mask tried to use it, a copy of the U.S. Constitution was replaced by a single tweet which read ""Unacceptable. Unreadable! Totally biased and not funny. Needs to be drained."" It is rumored that the device did also the same thing when an intern accidentally left his moldy lunch orange in front of it."

Part 1

Hello, my name is Skrillex—I mean, Damien. Before you read the rest of this horrible, ungodly tale, make sure you are alone. Make sure the lights are out. Make sure there is no other sound. Make sure you are wearing a diaper. Make sure your nipples are duct taped down and you have a condom on. Make sure you have a muzzle on—so no one can hear you scream. Make sure your hands are tied behind your back with a rope, so you don’t try to jump out the window. Make sure there are no lethal weapons nearby, so you don’t commit suicide. Make sure you have a cup of water in case you get thirsty, and we will begin.

I was working at Nickelodeon studios as an intern in the golden years of Spongebob, before the theatrical movie was made and the series went to shit. I mainly just delivered Stephen Hillenburg’s coffee, but the job did have some perks—like Assassin. Assassin was overpowered, and I could never get Extreme Conditioning, Recon or Sitrep to Pro six, but anyways the BEST perk, was, of course, watching the brand new, unedited Spongebob episodes.

One dark and stormy day, I was called in to see a strange episode that had been found in the archives but never officially finished. Me and two other people—Stephanie, and Bob—poor, poor Bob—entered the viewing room and I asked, “What the fuck is this one about?”

Bob, godforsaken, sad, noticeably handsome but not in a gay way Bob, said, “We have no idea. It’s actually a VHS somehow. I know that doesn’t make sense because we’ve never recorded Spongebob on VHS, but we found this. It’s labeled: “Episode 777: creepybob.wmv.”

I replied, “Well that’s fucking retarded. Let’s watch the motherfucking thing already.” I know, I had a sailor’s mouth. What can I say, I was 19 at the time. SUDDENLY the door to the room slammed shut and locked itself mysteriously, and the tape began playing by itself. “What the--? Is this some kind of prank?” How little did we all know.

Bob sipped his coffee, and replied, “I don’t know. I guess we’ll just have to watch this thing, right? I mean, how bad can it be? It’s friggin’ Spongebob.” That right there must have been the ironic foreshadowing. It’s just Spongebob, right? No. This was so much more than that. But you will learn for yourself soon enough.

For some reason, the theme song didn’t play. It just skipped right to a creepy title card—instead of the usual fun, blocky font it showed the words “creepybob.wmv”—all lowercase and in a gothic font against a blood-red background. Then, instead of the usual happy bubble transition, it melted away like a kitten’s face would melt if it were splashed with hydrochloric acid.

It was already too much for Bob. He screamed, “I CAN’T TAKE IT!!!” and shot himself in the face. You would think someone outside would have heard the gunshot and the splatter of meat and bones back against the wall and come in to see what the hell was going on, but no, now it was down to me and Stephanie. Stephanie was shivering as if she had the flu, and then she vomited all over her own lap and started crying. Pieces of the donut she had eaten earlier were mixed in with the slimy gunk that had been projected out of the mouth that, up until then I would have wanted wrapped around my penis. Stephanie was pretty attractive.

Strangely, I wasn’t fazed by the haunting imagery. I actually chuckled. Something about it was empowering me, vindicating me, liberating me…I had no time to question my sanity. My erection would soon triple in size when I witnessed the first true scene of this lost episode. It was like it was calling out to my very soul….

It showed Spongebob with a spatula outside Squidward’s house shouting, “Ready for work Squidward?” with a big goofy smile on his yellow, porous face. Goddamn I hated that smile. Nobody deserved that kind of happiness. It made rage build inside me. It made me wish I WAS Spongebob. Maybe I was. Then the episode took a sharp turn for the worse. Spongebob’s voice turned deep and demonic, like G major in Sony Vegas. “I said are you ready for fucking work, Squidward!” I smiled. Yes! This was the Spongebob I had always secretly fantasized about. An angry, conflicted, possibly confused Spongebob.

Stephanie vomited again and began beating her head against the wall, her tears becoming mixed with blood. I didn’t care that we were trapped anymore. I cheered this new, profane Spongebob on. “Go, Spongebob! Do what you’ve always dreamt of! Show us the power and freedom of cartoons that doesn’t exist in real life!” I swear Spongebob winked at me briefly. I jumped out of my seat and began jerking off furiously.

Squidward finally opened the door, and Spongebob lunged at him and snapped his neck swiftly yet brutally, with a sickening, blood-curdling CRACK that seemed to echo throughout the room I was in, as if we had HD surround sound. I laughed out loud. What was happening to me? Perhaps I was the chosen one…I would soon find out.

Spongebob dragged Squidward’s limp, dead corpse into his pineapple home and layed him down on a table in his living room. Strange. I never remembered that table being there in the regular show. I was jerking so hard that I was sweating bullets now. My casual T-shirt was matted to my skinny back in stinking perspiration, but I didn’t care. This was glorious. This was a sexual experience unlike any other. I never expected sex and violence to mix for me, but now I realized why I had found it so hard to arouse myself recently. I had tried every fucked up type of porn the internet had to offer—scat, loli, guro, yiff, feet—and more. But this was it. This was that magical video that fulfilled all my deepest, hidden sexual desires—hidden even to myself, apparently. I wasn’t ashamed. I tightened my hand’s grip around my iron hard, meaty cock and tugged like it was the cork in a wine bottle. Then I started fingering my asshole. I don’t know why, something just came over me. This pleasure was better than any video game I had ever played, any music I had ever heard.

Stephanie looked at me in fear and disgust. I didn’t care. It was like I was becoming a different person. Who was I? I felt incredibly, wonderfully filthy, perhaps like a serial killer bathing himself in the blood of his seven-year-old female victim who he had lacerated multiple times with a rusty, dull knife while listening to Mozart in a basement. Wait, what? I don’t even know. Oh, right, Spongebob. Spongebob’s next, even more evil actions would further fuel my lust.

Spongebob took out his trademark spatula, kissed it gently, rubbed it’s shiny steel, and then plunged it into Squidward’s thin neck. I screamed “YES!” as Spongebob began laughing hysterically, maniacally. I started jerking rhythmically along with Spongebob’s feverishly furious hacks at Squidward’s neck. Finally, Spongebob had successfully detached Squidward’s head and he pulled the decaying tongue out with one yellow hand, then pulled his square pants down revealing a hairy, veiny, flaccid penis. He rubbed Squidward’s rotting, dead tongue against his dick slowly, and started gasping and moaning. I gasped and moaned too. This was wonderful. What kind of awful demon had possessed me that day? Who the hell animated this crazy lunacy of a Spongebob episode? I didn’t care. All I cared about was that heavenly self-stimulation in my pants. And just when I was about to shoot my load.

Patrick knocked on Spongebob’s door. “Spongebob, are you home?” he said in his dumbass voice. Spongebob put down Squidward’s head, and took out a katana. He headed to the door and opened it. There was Patrick. Spongebob sliced open Patrick’s stomach, and reached into it. He yanked out Patrick’s intestines and wrapped them around Patrick’s neck before Patrick could react. Then he strangled Patrick to death, with his own intestines.

A new feeling arose in me. One of fury. My orgasm had been cut short. I turned away from the screen, and it seemed to pause for me. I said, “Stephanie.”

Stephanie huddled in the corner of the room. “Wha—what, Damien?”

“I want your pussy. Come here. Now.”

“No!”

“Get over here or I’ll shoot you like Bob shot himself!”

Stephanie clutched the silver cross she always wore around her neck and took a step towards me.

“WAIT!”

“WHAT?!?”

“I want you to crawl. Crawl like you’re my slave.”

“What is WRONG with you, you SICK FUCK!”

I picked up the gun and pointed it at her beautiful face. “Do it, you stupid cunt.”

She got on her knees, and crawled to me. Meanwhile, Spongebob was raping Sandy anally in the video. Yesss. This was perfect. I dropped my pants and underwear, and shoved Stephanie’s face into my sweaty crotch. She squealed like I pig being electrocuted. I said, “Suck it dry, bitch,” and pressed the gun against her lovely hair.

After Spongebob ejaculated in Sandy’s furry ass, he strangely let her go. Then he headed to his final destination, the Krusty Krab. Mr Krabs was waiting for him. “Spongebob! Yer late! What’s the problem. Is that…is that blood you’re covered in?”

Spongebob’s eyes were bloodshot. His teeth were gritted. He raised a rubber mallet, and struck Mr. Krabs thin arm, crushing the bone like a beetle. Mr. Krabs screamed. He tried to fight back, but couldn’t. Spongebob bashed away at him, and then the episode abruptly ended. The image just burned away. And then I realized the room was on fire.

I said, “Shit.” I pulled Stephanie’s mouth off my cock. “Where is your Christ now, Stephanie?” Before she could respond, I blew her brains out. The building’s fire alarm went off, and I pulled up my pants, angry that I had never been able to cum.

That’s all I remember. And now, here I am, sitting in a prison cell, writing this. Yep, they caught me. I suppose justice was served. But it was worth it. Just for those sweet few minutes of untold pleasure. Well, told to you, now. Why am I writing this? I don’t know. This isn’t really about Spongebob. It was about the sinful forces that overcame me that day. Maybe the whole tape was a mere hallucination. Maybe I had finally caved, sick of being a failed writer and delivering those goddamned coffees for Stephen. But that’s my story. Maybe they’ll never find this. Maybe

The story cuts off there. The rest is unknown. Sweet dreams."
5h52td,15,2016-12-08,I got a wake up call today.,badstudent101,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5h52td/i_got_a_wake_up_call_today/,"Today, I had an assignment where I had to attend an event and complete a short worksheet and hand it in at the end. The event ran from 1 to 3, so I had plenty of time to get in there, complete the assignment, and get out.

So my lazy ass, who just so happened to relapse the night before, FINALLY rolls out of bed at 2:30, throws some clothes on, and heads on over there. I underestimated the length of the walk, and when I finally walk in, it's 2:50, and the event is going to end in 10 minutes. The presenters that I was supposed to evaluate are packing up their stuff, and my worksheet is completely blank. Luckily, I was able to find a guy who was willing to stay late, and he gave me some great advice regarding internships.

I thought I was safe until I just so happened to run into my professor, who was rightfully a bit angry. I gave her my worksheet, and she told me to come sit in her office.

She chewed me out, saying that I'm really making this whole thing too hard on myself. I handed in many assignments far too late, and I was just BARELY slipping by in her class. She told me that I better knock her socks off next semester if I want her to even consider writing me a recommendation letter.

So, sweaty, gross me wanders out of her office, feeling pretty damn sorry for myself. Finally someone had confronted me about my lazy tendencies, and you know what? It woke me the fuck up. I started NoFap over the summer but never really had a good enough streak to brag about until around October, where I lasted a month. My long distance girlfriend cheated on me, and I just completely fell out of control, and I relapsed and binged over and over again.

I'M FUCKIN' DONE. I'm not masturbating for at least a fucking month. The laziness is a direct result of my addiction, and I'm tired of it. I want my energy back.

Don't be like me, don't wait for that one person to give you that wake up call. Give it to yourself. Stop jerkin' off."

5h5zn7,39,2016-12-08,Tales from an IT Callcenter part III: the ballad of gay Joey,demonsdencollective,talesfromcallcenters,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/5h5zn7/tales_from_an_it_callcenter_part_iii_the_ballad/,"In case you were missing out:

[part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/5e3km7/tales_from_an_it_callcenter_i_rise_of_the/)
[part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/5e9o8j/tales_from_an_it_callcenter_part_iirevenge_of_the/)

Now back to the story:

I'm sure most of you working in callcenters have receptionists at the entrance of the company, right?

We had 4 different ones that cycled on different days.

We had (and yes, these are codenames, if this gets found, I don't wanna be a deadman 100%):

-Jane, a young lady who always had some funny banter

-Alison, who would often joke that if I didn't shave soon, she'd stop allowing me into the building

-Melinda, a bit of a cougar situation who also often threatens to block entrance if I don't shave

-Joey, who is extremely gay, about whom this story will go



Now, we were moving from one end of the building to the other with our IT callcenter.

No clue why, it's actually kind of annoying, but I'm just an intern, so I have to go along.

So we're in the IT storage and I bend over to pick up a box. I can feel a stare from behind and Joey says

&gt;""Has anyone ever told you you have a very nice and well rounded ass?""

I had a very heavy box in my hands at that point, but I swear to god, I had superman-like abilities, standing up straight in NO TIME.

I stammer in my words and reply

&gt;""Actually, it's a first time. Thank you?""

And he chuckles, saying

&gt;""You're adorable when you're shy like that.""

And I just lose my fucking shit at that point. I thank him for the compliments and get the fuck out of there, saying I had something else to do, but in reality, I had fuck all else to do. I'm not homophobic or anything, in fact, I'm bi as hell, but that creeped me the fuck out.

This isn't the end of the ballad of gay Joey, though. Oh nonono...

We had to go and bring all of our unused shit to the dump, a whole truck load of the shit.

Guess who wanted to come along...




Oh yes, Joey... It was extremely awkward, naturally.

On the way there, he started talking about his new boyfriend, and I thought it would be the end of awkward flirts.

Hell no, that'd mean something good would happen to me once...

No, he started talking about how he was buff, but had no ass and how he wished he had an ass like mine.

The colleague who was driving the van began snickering, couldn't hold it back.

At this point I'm at the same point of ""I'm gonna stoop so fucking low and I'm not gonna give a fuck about it"" that I was in Part II and straight up say

&gt;""Well, that's too bad, keep dreamin' 'bout this booty, boy, 'cause this booty ain't neva gon' be yours.""

in the most gay sounding accent I could... Both Joey and the colleague were absolutely laughing their asses off and I could feel embarrassment sinking in like a big bottle of vodka downed on a lonely evening.

&gt;""We're just messing with you man!""

Said Joey... So I began laughing too, acting as if I was in on it.

&gt;""I know, I do a pretty good gay guy accent, right? Hahaha!""

I say, trying to save my skin, hoping it worked.

To date, he still teases me about it and no one knows I currently have a boyfriend.

Gay Joey is alright, he's a cool guy, he just comes on stronger than a bus hitting you head-on.

I blame this whole incident on myself... Mostly 'cause I have Aspergers. But still, they played a long game if it was really all just a joke.

Still unsure if he was really hitting on me or not..."
5h60ta,6,2016-12-08,I'm a college student who went from 20-40mg of Adderall every few weeks for exams to 600mg in 24 hours,_Creatine_Shits,StopSpeeding,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/comments/5h60ta/im_a_college_student_who_went_from_2040mg_of/,"I've been in college for 2.5 years now.  I never had to try or do much in high school. 
Shortly after I got to college I realized that wasn't the case.
First and (most of) second year, I bought and took it less than once every month or two at a reasonable (20-40mg) dose and had no side effects.  Then, about 8 months ago, I decided ""why buy it when I could just easily get a prescription and just use it for exams?""  That's where it started.
I worked an internship over summer I **needed** to excel in, so I took my two 15mg IR's I was prescribed/day both in the morning, and one in the afternoon.  It yielded phenomenal results and made me **love** even Excel spreadsheets.  I made due by not doing it on weekends and just getting over it and drinking coffee if I ran out.
Once school started, I couldn't do without it.  I have classes I can't dick around in or not study for.  Worse yet, classes that require knowledge of my previous classes which I've adderall-crammed the night before every exam for and don't remember shit from.
I also have to do standardized exams to get a job in my field, which luckily I can continuously retake without consequence of failing.  Which I've done twice on the first one.  The first time, I took 30x20mg IRs in the span of 24 hours.  Last time, I was out of addy and just didn't study.
Now it's gotten to the point where my once a month prescription is done within 5-10 days, about 120-250 mg per day (but usually either a 40mg baseline day or 500+ study day).  I've probably spent $2,000+ in the past 6 months to make up for this.  
I've also gotten to the point of not actually getting anything done when I take it, just sitting and watching TV. But if I don't take it it's unbearable.  I've been able to resist stealing some of my roommate's stash, or letting my girlfriend or roommates really notice, but they're catching on.  Booze and THC and occasionally bars help the days when I can't find any and am out.
I fully realize I'm addicted.  But what's worse than that is that I feel I can maintain it.  I feel I make enough money to compensate, can get my scrip bumped, etc. and I have those ""good"" off days where I don't feel like shit and can handle not having any (but will find some if it's available). And it scares me shitless.  Because when I'm on the stuff and logically thinking about it I know how bad it is and make plans to stop, but when I'm not the only thing in my head is that it can and will be maintained because I need it.  My pure-obsessional OCD and mild depression become 10x worse, I feel like shit, and I feel absolutely unable to do legitimately anything except go to the corner store and be disappointed when the Red Bull yields no effect.  As you can probably tell I'm on some now.  Vyvanse actually.  It feels like the only time I have a shot at helping myself or calling out for help.

I'm new to the sub and it seems like mostly discussion about the more illegal forms of amphetamine, so I hope I'm okay to post here.  I don't know how relatable an over-privileged lazy college student's issues with adderall are, but any advice is appreciated.  "

My friend is coming to the US for an internship for one year and will be in the greater LA area which means she will need a car. However she will be leaving after the year. She doesn't mind purchasing a car for slightly more money (15,000 or under) if that means it won't depreciate much and she can sell it after the year, but the less money the better.

I was thinking that she could purchase something off of CarMax due to it being easier than purchasing from a private party and then selling it to a private party after the year is over. What are your opinions on this?

She doesn't have any preference for cars other than it being safe and not problematic.

A few cars I am thinking that may be nice that I found on CarMax:

2013 Honda Civic LX, $15,000, 11000 miles (very low)

2013 Volkswagen Jetta, $13,000, 24000 miles

Any help is greatly appreciated! "

Part 7: Revelations and Recuperation

 
Through the course of many interviews with their suspect, they learned the truth from John about everything. He had been going to college across the country, in Washington, and had almost finished with his degree. He had come home to his mother after deciding to intern at a business in a nearby city. After driving his dark blue 1980 van home he then began to indulge in a little hobby he’d acquired in Washington—watching, stalking, and abducting children.


It was my misfortune to be his “type.” It wasn’t the first time he’d abducted a child, but when he had, back in Washington, he’d just had his fun and then released the child back into a park or in the parking lot of a small business or strip mall. He’d attempted to take me but was stymied by those open doors. However, that did not discourage him completely. He would wait for his moment. I had been the “prettiest little girl” he’d ever seen and “needed to take (me) for his own.”


He’d spotted Rhoda at the grocery store down on Main Street and had followed her family back to their neighborhood. With his free time, he’d surveyed her home and waited for the right opportunity. He’d lured Rhoda to his van saying his dog had just had puppies and did she want to see them? He’d kept her in a small hunting shack that his father had once used in the woods, until her tears and crying had driven him to strangle her instead.
He said he wasn’t afraid of being caught until that woman had tipped the police off about his van. He’d panicked and tried to destroy the photos he’d taken of Rhoda before killing her. He’d botched burning them because he could hear people in the woods, presumably that father and son duo who had happened on the partially burnt photos. He’d scaled a nearby tree and waited for them to leave before he left.


It was at this time that his mother figured out what he’d been doing. He’d been giving her all sorts of excuses about where he was and what he was doing. He’d kept his bedroom door locked when he wasn’t there but the day after that news broadcast detailing the discovery of the burned photos and once again, the blue van with the engine whine that she’d broken into his bedroom while he’d been out. He’d strangled her in the hallway as she’d tried to run away from his sudden reappearance, and attempted to bury her in the garden, underneath the bushes late one night.
 

The day that I discovered Mrs. Forsythe’s exposed hand he’d been planning on taking me that night. He knew that it would only be a matter of time before someone would notice his mother’s disappearance and the object of his obsession, the “one that got away” could not escape him or his desire any longer. He’d been planning to take me back to Washington, or disposing me somewhere along the way if I proved to be like Rhoda.
 

The coroner confirmed that Mrs. Forsythe had been strangled, and was about 48 hours deceased when found. The police investigation soon wrapped up and then the case went forth into trial. I was eight years old when I testified against my would-be abductor. That was almost as scary as the attempted abduction and discovering Mrs. Forsythe’s hand. It was my testimony, the testimony of my parents, and the testimony of the woman who’d first spotted and heard his van that clinched the case. The jury had been subjected to his extensive body of work, and the only other time I had to confirm that I was part of the evidence chain was when the prosecutor brought up on the projection screen one of the photos that depicted my frightened form in bed and asked if that girl in the photo was of me. My entire body shook with terror and emotion as I confirmed it was.


John Forsythe was convicted, guilty of all charges on Monday, November 29th, 1993 and is still rotting away in the maximum-security prison he was regulated to. Occasionally, I check his status on the website that caters to such records just to confirm that he’s not eligible for parole, as that was part of his conviction. I need to make sure that I will not be in danger of waking up to the flashbulb of a camera going off in my face late at night.

 
It’s taken many years of survivor’s guilt, nightmares and their subsequent treatments and therapy sessions to make me the person I am today. The events of my childhood have made me fearful, but not afraid. Living in fear is not living. I refuse to let that man quell my desire to live.
If the events of my childhood have taught me anything, is that curiosity is not a sin but can be dangerous. That strangers can hurt you. That nightmares, sometimes, can be real.

I am an international student in the US. I am majoring in mechanical engineering and will graduate on Dec 2018. This year I was lucky enough to find an alternating Co-op internship at a fortune 500 company. I am engaged to an American Citizen and we plan on getting married on summer 2018. So far I have worked a total of 10 months under CPT for my co-op. I will have my third rotation during summer next year, which will bring my total CPT time on over an year of full-time employment, there is also a possibility of a fourth rotation summer 2018. From my understanding If I do more than 12 months of full-time CPT I will not be allowed to apply for OPT.

My questions is: What are my options for getting a job on 2019 once I graduate on December 2018. I will get married on summer 2018, will that give me enough time to get my green card and be able to start working on january as if I was an american citizen? Is there a temporary work visa that would allow me to work in the US while we wait for the green card? Should I try to work only 2 months during my last rotation so I do not pass that 12 months OPT threshold?(This is not ideal because my employer would like me to work as long as I can since I will have so much experience for my last rotation). Can you guys help me with some other options that would allow me to work as soon as I graduate?
Thanks for your time in advance, any help is greatly appreciated!"

Will have been clean ~70 days from last time I smoked. And as far as I can remember I've only smoked once in the 90 day period, though I might have smoked twice. Either way, very small amounts smoked.

So I started doing hella research and came across lots of advice forums and the macujo method. Most people said if you've only smoked once or twice you'll be fine, but this test is for an internship that I need to take in order to progress in my major and graduate on time....so I didn't want to take any chances.

I've done the macujo four times now. But what I'm really worried about is I just got my hair cut today and told the lady to go in short and...SHE WENT IN SHORT.

I started freaking out when I got home. Macujo'd again just to be safe. Then plucked some hairs from all over and measured them and my hair is at an average of 1.25"" - 1.375"".  The longest hair, in the front, is still over 1.5"".

Should I be worried that the clinic might not accept my head hair because it's too short? I regularly keep my armpits and pubes trimmed down, but should I shave my chest and legs just to be safe?

Am I completely overreacting? Will the current length be enough?

I am in med school (Mexico City) and in July 2017 I have to pick a hospital where I will be doing my intern year. one of my possible options is one in Mérida, Yucatán (far from mexico city) because I got family there and I could get more personal growth from living alone (without my parents).
I don't know how to discuss this with my SO. He obviously wants me to stay and be with him, but I'm not sure if the hospital I would choose here would be the best choice for me. I told him that Mérida is one of my options but I still don't know what I will pick yet. I've also told him I've taken wrong decisions because of relationships before and I'm scared of doing that again. Because of that I'm trying not to weigh my relationship into the decision, to be the most objective as possible.
Last time we talked he was pretty pissed off ,sad and thinking that he doesn't matter to me. He matters so much in so many ways, I love him so much. Of course I will be sad if I leave, but the growth I could get from leaving could be so much more.
Being in a long distance relationship is a no for me.

Everbody will be sad in the end.

How can I handle this?

5hbkoh,73,2016-12-08,"Okay, my sisters in NMIL land. I need your help with my family, so I don't become a JNMIL.",sukiskis,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5hbkoh/okay_my_sisters_in_nmil_land_i_need_your_help/,"I read your posts about how your DHs (or DWs) put up with their mothers for so long and then you (DW or DH) come along and open their eyes to the dysfunction of their families. They had gray-rocked into a lifestyle choice, ignoring their misbehaving mothers. Or maybe their mothers didn't misbehave that much until a challenge came along, but still, they were willing to ignore, ignore, ignore until it became a problem that meant they had to make choices and decisions. 

Oh, how that does that happen, you ask yourselves. Well, let me give you some inside scoop. 

I didn't start reading JustNOMIL until my kids were in late high school/college. It was a relief to hear that my dislike of 36 million gifts at Christmas were a problem, or about 140 placements given over 18 months were a problem that others shared too. It's nice to see that I wasn't alone in the struggles I had years before and that this was something that happened to other people. 

My son is the family soul. He was born watching and listening, offering empathy and spirit and love at everything. He has been the heart of our family and the person who you go to when things are bad. He's a big guy and will wrap you in a hug that will squeeze the pain away. 

We all got together over Thanksgiving at a strange place. Our kids are in college across the country, coincidentally in the same city this fall as our son has an internship in the city near where daughter goes to school. As daughter only had a few days off, we went to them and stayed at a friend's house who was out of town.

It was an okay visit. Daughter is stressed because of hard classes, son is stressed because of end of college and we are in a strange place. There were moments where everyone acted out a bit, including me. 

Son, as usual, twisted himself in knots trying to make everyone happy, but one of my frustrations was with son himself, so he was particularly wrapped up.

Son wants to change his name to the nickname I've called him his whole life. Nickname was from a character in a book that he looked like when he was a kid. It was thing between us, I only called him that name when we were alone. It was our shared thing. But he wants to officially change him name to that name. 

I have told him multiple times that it is his life and his choice if he wants to change his name, but I'm not thrilled with the idea. Husband and I talked a long time about his name. We researched family names, and gave him a name that had deep family roots as well as the name of his deceased maternal great-grandfather, beloved by everyone and died too young. His grandmother, my MIL, and her whole family were touched by the middle name and his paternal grandfather's side were touched by the first name. It was a special thing. And he became his name. 

I changed my name when I was 18. However, my parents gave me the shortened version of a long name, as in, for example, my name was Lizzie, a shortened version of Elizabeth, except just Lizzie. So at 18, I gave myself the longer version and called myself by that. 

I get it, the end result is that I changed my name. He is doing that, even with a name that is mine, so I should be happy. Except, I'm not. I think his reasons are flawed, I think he's being a typical romantic, as he does. 

BUT, whatever I think doesn't matter, it's his name, his life, he gets to make those decision. I just don't want to talk about it. Make your change, I will adapt to it and call you whatever you want and eventually my frustration will dim because it's not murdering babies and I will get over it. 

Except, my dear sweet boy agonizes over his mother being unhappy at his decision. That's an easy one, don't talk with her about it. But he brings it up and I snap. I explain it to him again, it's your choice, it's your life, why do I need to be happy with it? 

We whinge and recover, we do that. 

He was driving me to the airport, just us. DH took a flight from a different airport. He agonized again over my unhappiness. 

""You are not responsible for my happiness."" I tell him. ""I will get over this and I will be fine, I just don't want to talk about it.""

""But I don't like it when you are unhappy with my decisions."" He said. 

I get it. You want your parents to be delighted with everything you do. I told him, ""You don't get to decide how we or I will feel about anything, that is up to us. However, you do have a right to ask us to keep our unhappiness to ourselves. It is your life and your choices and we should support you, sometimes we may not be happy about your choices, for whatever reason, but that is irrelevant. Stop asking me to be happy about your decision. I support it, I endorse your right to do it, I'm just not happy about it.""

He would not be dissuaded that he wanted my happiness and I cannot summon that. 

So, my JNMILs, how do I handle that? 

And, more importantly, how do I handle a family that seems to want ""happiness"" with decisions vs. support for their decisions.

Most importantly, I think there's something to be said for how enabling, even unwanted and un-needed enabling, allows dysfunctional behavior to flourish."
5hc7um,5,2016-12-09,"If Publishers Only Make 10% Profit Each Year, Then How Do So Many Companies Start Up?",makeit234,publishing,https://www.reddit.com/r/publishing/comments/5hc7um/if_publishers_only_make_10_profit_each_year_then/,"I understand that there are failing publishing companies, but there are also A LOT of very successful new publishing companies that don't make mathematical sense to me (e.g. Pandamoon Publishing and Microcosm Publishing). 

I actually read an article by the owner of Microcosm Publishing. He said that publishers should only expect $2000-$3000 from every book published per year. This makes no mathematical sense, because it costs $2500-$3000 simply to have each book edited. Add employee costs, ISBN costs, and cover art costs and you are making very negative revenue. 

What is scary is that his value makes some sense. Consider that the author gets around 10%-15% of the book's sales, the distributor and retailer get a total of 55%-60% of the sales, and the publisher gets a mere 30%. We'll use paperback novels for example. The goal in length for a novel is 90,000 words and the average page length for a novel is 250 words per page. 90,000/250 = 360 pages. Printing a 360 page paperback novel would cost around $3.50 if you print 2000 at a time (which a small publisher won't do) and it would sell for about $15 on the market. Remember that publishers get 30% of the sale. (0.30 x $15) - $3.50 = $1.00 to the publisher per sale (for all those authors complaining that publishers are hogging all the money, realize that you are getting the same if not more revenue per sale of your book). Average amount of sales of one book for an indie press is 3000 copies per year. $1 x 3000 = $3000 per book per year. This means that all those indie publishers that publish 8-12 books per year are getting $24,000-$36,000 per year? 1: They can barely hire 1 employee on that salary. 2: They are losing money from book production costs (so they technically can't even hire an employee). How do those guys even live?

Other sources say that most established publishers get 10% profits and start-up publishers get 5% profit if they are very good at it. 

Here is what I have found from doing my math. A startup for a publishing company that is connected with a distributor costs a minimum of $50,000. That assumes that you have no office space and are paying only 1 employee (an intern who is getting a mere $20,000). To get connected with a distributor you have to be publishing at least 4 books a season (8 books a year). Publishing 8 books all on your own is nearly impossible (hence the intern that is required to assist). Remember that it would be you and the intern doing all the marketing for the books. Keeping all this in mind, we will say that the start-up cost is $50,000. 

Let's be nice and say that they are getting that 10% profit like the established publishers. $50,000 x 1.05^(50 years) = $5,869,543 revenue per year after 50 years in the business.

$5,869,543/10 = 586,954 profit per year after 50 years in the business.

Here is what this math says. It says that with 10% growth from profits, your company will have a revenue of $586,954 in profit after 50 years of existing. So how is it that companies like Tor are making millions of dollars in profit only having existed for 35 years? None of it makes sense to me. All these people explaining the industry are simply confusing me even more. 

Note that in all these calculations, I didn't include taxes (and believe me when I say that employee taxes are very harsh on businesses).

Here is what confuses me the most, though. When starting up a publishing company, how can you even make a living? Starting up that company is a full time job! You don't have time to work another job (not even a part-time job) considering that you are maintaining your website, maintaining social media presence, reading hundreds of queries, preparing books for publishing, contacting distributors and retailers, and MARKETING the books. The only option I see is scrapping by in a trailer park for the next 15 years and eating out of a garbage can. So how do these people even support themselves when starting their publishing company? It all doesn't make sense to me."

I need your help, I am an alcoholic and have been this way for approximately 5 years. Things have become increasingly worse since a breakup and bad internship experience that I had two years ago. I am a perfectionist/ overachiever and I defined myself by both the BF and the internship. In short--even though I tried my best in both situations--they did not work out how I had hoped that they would. I became deeply depressed and lost my drive to succeed which has been the bread and butter of my personality for many years.  I was already trying to get better with my alcoholism, but after my ex BF stopped talking to me I lost all hope on most things. It was hard to find things that I still enjoyed. I wanted everything in my life to turn off and melt away. I am not sure how much makers mark and coke I have consumed at this point. During the breakup I lost 15 or so pounds because I was ferociously exercising and trying to be the best person I could be in hopes of winning him back. But then when things were really over, I spiraled into this deep depression and gained 40 pounds. Also almost every time I drink my face and neck get really red and I feel very anxious. 

I currently have a job in software, but I feel like being perpetually hungover really affects how people perceive me and how I perform on the job. Also, I have driven drunk countless times and as of now nothing bad has come of it but I feel like I am an accident waiting to happen. I don't know when I will get a DUI or hurt someone. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about my problems for fear that they will judge or abandon me.  

I want to quit. I went to an AA meeting, and plan to go to more, but there is this little voice inside of me that doesn't want to stop drinking all together. The rational voice knows that if I have one drink more will follow, but the drinking voice tries to convince my rational voice that it will all be ok in the end and one drink wont hurt anything. It's like a constant battle in my brain until the drinking voice wares down the rational one by 5pm or so. 

Reddit, how do I quit drinking and be happy again so I don't hurt myself or others? Sure I've yacked in a few cars, and on myself, but how do I stop this before it reaches a super dangerous level?

kindly,

A concerned citizen with problems"

I succeed to install my PfSense recently, but I have now a basic problem, which maybe make PfSense not the solution I need.

I'm in internship btw, I'm not a professional for the moment, so pardon my lack of knowledge for some things.

What I need for my project : 
- We want to deploy Wifi 
- Each Access Point (AP) will have 2 SSID, one for the employee, and one for the guest. 
- In my country I need to kept internet connection logs from my guests.

So my idea was : 
- To install a captive portal so my guest have an account we can manage.

- Use this account to create logs of each visited website with the package squid.

- Use the transparent proxy parameters because I cannot modify the guest machine to add my proxy in his settings.

- Squid provide a transparent proxy, but I can't have an authentification and a transparent proxy.

So, what can I do? Does squid have an authentification parameters?
I wanted to use local user manager but it's seems that it's not doable, maybe with the Radius method it is more convenient? Internal FreeRadeus or an external one?

A seconde machine with a transparent proxy (maybe a second PfSense with Squid package), where I associate manually the IP address?

It's just for guests so I don't need something complicate.

It was a dump filled with empty chlorine bottles, nets and broken furniture, but at least I did not have to run into her father around every corner, so I did not say a word about it.

Lily got to cleaning right away. By cleaning, I mean, she melodramatically threw all the rubbish out of the door, and made sure that she made enough noise for her parents to hear her. Her mother, most likely out of guilt, showed up ten minutes later with the maid and black rubbish bags to clear whatever Lily threw out. 

She did not stay long but left Jessa, a tall and elderly brunette, to deal with the rest of it. I helped with the heavier things and received more than a few dirty looks from Jessa. Lily kept throwing things out until only an old mattress remained in the room and her footsteps echoed. I did not quite expect the place to be so large but once everything was out, it looked to be as big as the entire lower part of my house, with an open plan kitchen and a dining area. 

We could have been quite comfortable here but I did not want to stay very long and get sucked into their family drama. I had enough of my own and by the grim look on Lily’s face; I could see that she regretted coming here too.

“I told them he was mine,” she said, sitting on the edge of the mattress with the clean sheets on her lap. A shiny layer of sweat covered her forehead.

“That’s alright,” I said. “Probably better that way.”

Lily turned suddenly and began to crawl toward the back of the mattress on all fours. When she reached the wall, she pushed a cushion against it, sat down with her back pressed into it and folded her arms over her stomach. Something was bothering her, it had been since we left the half-way house, but I thought we sorted that out. It might have had to do with being her back home, but I had never fared too well with emotional support, so I waited until she was ready to tell me, instead of asking.

“I hate it here,” she said, looking around the empty room. 

Peter crawled around outside with Jessa chasing after him. I stood close enough to the door to always have him in my sight. I wasn’t going to ever trust another human with him. 

Occasionally, I’d see one of the curtains of the house open upstairs and one of Lily’s parents peeking and following Peter with their gaze. He was their fifth grandchild. Or so they thought. 

“I always did.” 

She did not look at me. It felt as if she were speaking to herself. What should I have said, “I told you so”? I did not want to come here in the first place. 

“She had me at forty and by the time I turned eight, she already had three grandchildren from the twins, and spent most of her time running around and catering to the new mothers. I mean, I know they needed her too, but she just left me to the maids. You’ve met Jessa,” she said, gesturing toward the woman with her head. “She was a bloody tyrant when I was growing up. Used to have this wooden ruler she hit my hands with when I did something she did not find proper.”

“Do you want to go?” I asked her. My governess used to split my skin with a leather strap for stealing biscuits from the kitchen. I sympathized on one hand and on the other the wooden ruler just sounded normal. The anger over the abandonment I understood but lately Lily found issue with everything. I could barely keep up. Two demons left her be but many more remained.

She sighed. “Where to?”  

“Anywhere.”

“I thought she’d be worried about me,” she continued, ignoring my suggestion. “She didn’t even know I left the asylum.” She shook her head in disbelief. 

I walked around the bed and extended my hand toward her. “Come on, let’s go.”

“Where to?” She glanced at my hand and then up at me. “A hotel? What’s the difference between there and here?”

“Okay,” I bent down, pushed her legs away from the edge of the mattress, and sat down, “then what do you want to do? Tell me and we’ll do it.”

“Nothing, it’s alright. I’ll survive.” 

“Please, Lily. What do you want me to do? I feel like we’re going around in circles. Always ending up in the same point, your unhappiness. Am I the problem? Do you want me to go? Tell me what to do.”

She took my hand, swirling her fingertips over my knuckles. “I’m sorry. No, it’s not you. I just can’t seem to settle in. I thought I’d find my place here but they might as well be strangers. I’m so out of place here. It’s almost as if this isn’t my home. I really don’t like being disposable and it kind of feels like I always am.”

“Knock. Knock,” her mother called from the doorway. She must have heard much more than she would have liked to. Her jaw was clenched tightly behind the fake smile she showed us. “I found your old basket in the attic.” She put the white, steady looking—definitely not straw—basket against the nearest wall, and looked over her shoulder at Peter. He and Jessa sat on the grass, very closely inspecting a daisy Peter had in his hand.

“He looks like your grandfather,” she said. “I think it’s the nose.” She put her finger against her own.

“Does he?” Lily cocked her head. “I don’t think so.”

“I’ll bring you a picture. You’ll see.”

Lily shrugged. “If you say so.”

“Hungry?”

“I’m not, but can you have someone bring something for Bael and Peter?” 

She hovered a moment, out of place in her own yard, then wiped at her pants as if to straighten a crinkle. “I’ll send someone over.”

I put my hand on Lily’s knee. “You’re not disposable,” I said when I felt her mother was far enough away from us.

She smiled. “Oh, but I am.”

Lily did not speak much for the rest of the evening. Jessa had been called back to the house to fetch dinner for me and Peter and I had to pry him away from his flowers. We fell asleep rather early. He fit into the basket almost perfectly and slept all the way through to morning when her mother came by the door again, inviting us up for breakfast.

They had a high chair at the table and took Peter out of Lily’s hands as soon as we walked through the door. Her father barely looked at both of us but her mother asked constant questions about Peter. This cheered Lily up quite a bit. 

She was a bit stiff at the start. I’m sure it was because most of the questions her mother asked Lily could not answer. Not without lying, anyway. She eased into it later, though. Told her the name of the hospital, how she gave birth—in a bath—and all about the day we met. In a park, three days before her birthday, I bumped into her on my way to work, and couldn’t let her go without asking her out for a drink. 

“Wasn’t it raining, dear?” she asked me, and I nodded between bites of French toast. 

Nothing about this supposed meeting sounded like something I would do, but it made Lily happy and I found my mood vastly connected to hers these last few days. 

“What do you do, Bael?” her father asked. This had been the only thing he looked up from his plate for.

“You spent nearly an hour with him and you didn’t ask?” her mother noted, looking at her husband as if she was awaiting an apology.

“Slipped my mind, dear.”

“Repossession,” I said when he turned back to me for the answer. Lily winked at me and bit into her toast to hide her smile. 

“Is it a lucrative business?”

“Yes, father, they pay him in gold and diamonds.” Lily rolled her eyes. “We’re not worried, though, are we, Bael? Not with my inheritance waiting!” She clapped her hands, and pressed them against her chest. 

“Lily!” Her mother covered her face with her hand in exasperation, throwing down her fork.

I was just about to cut into my bacon—trying to keep myself out of the line of fire by not looking at any of them—when Jessa walked into to the living room and announced that someone had called for me. 

“At the house?” Lily’s father asked. I had been just as surprised as he was. 

“Yes, sir. Someone named Mae, she’s still on the line.”

Her father shot me a confused glance. I avoided looking at Lily. Having Mae phone me at her family home felt like some sort of betrayal. Lily knew about her. Mae popped up in every story I told. She was a hard subject to avoid. But this news brought a jolt to my heart. I almost skipped the pleasantries and pushed passed Jessa to search for the phone. The only thing that stopped me was guilt.

“I left my cellphone charger at work. Lily gave my colleague your home number while we were on the road. I hope you don’t mind, if she’s calling it must be important.”

“No, please, go ahead,” her father said, gesturing toward the door Jessa had come from. She nodded once and asked me to follow her to the phone.

She led me through a long passage into David’s officer. I wondered if she was trying to spite me somehow. A house this big with one telephone? It was as if she knew somehow that I lied back there and that Mae wasn’t just a colleague. Maybe she compared me to David. Thought I was exactly like him when she heard Mae’s voice. 

“Through here,” she said, and closed the door behind me as I entered.

I picked up and just stood like that for a moment, feeling her presence. I knew she heard the knock of me picking up the phone but she stayed silent too. 

“Are you alone?” she asked after a moment.

“Yes.”

The ruffled of her wings sounded to the right of me. “Hello,” I said. 

Her hair was a mess of curls. It looked as if she just combed her long fringe out of her eyes, and it got stuck in a constant motion of nearly sliding back down. Cheeks pink from some sort of exercise; she could never look poorly, even in ruffled circumstances. 

“Have you seen Deborah?” she asked.

“No, why?”

“She’s gone missing.”

“When?”

“Since yesterday.”

“Are you sure? That’s not much of a—”

“They gave me her post.” Her eyes begged me for an explanation. The only thing that came to mind was my run-in with Lucifer. 

“Did they say why?”

“No, they just came in this morning and said that I had to take over. I just came back from . . . there.” She started to pace. “When I took in the first demon, he asked me why the office had been closed yesterday. Bael,” she rubbed her mouth, “it has never been closed before. Not once. Not even late. He said it arrived but no one ever opened the door.”

“I’ll see what I can find out.”

“There’s one more thing.”

“What?”

“Possessions. I heard one of the interns that works in the Exorcism Department mention that the number of possessed humans increased almost tenfold overnight and that the numbers kept growing.” She came closer and touched my hand. Since she joined the program for the second time, she had been very reluctant to be near me, never mind touch me. The feel of her skin still made my chest stir and warm. “You need to be careful. It’s got to do with you, I know it does. Keep that kid of yours close. Don’t even trust . . . her with him.” There was bitterness to the way she referred to Lily. I did not intend to create the friction but I can’t say that I did not like that Mae still felt enough to be affected by people I spent my time with.

“I’ll be careful.”

“Good.” She hesitantly lifted her hand to my face—watching my reaction closely—and caressed my cheek. Then, like always, she disappeared right before my eyes.

5he1bg,1,2016-12-09,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5he1bg/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. 

Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5hed25,2,2016-12-09,Industrial Applications Internship Admissions?,GD1634,CarletonU,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarletonU/comments/5hed25/industrial_applications_internship_admissions/,"Hi there,

I'm strongly looking into Carleton computer science and this internship really interests me. I have a fairly strong average out of high school (~92) and very strong extra curriculars (which I'm unsure if Carleton looks at). I'm aware it's not something you apply to directly, you go through a separate process, and that only about 11 kids got it last year. 

Is there any info out there about what kind of applicants those 11 were? Were they very elite students with upper 90's averages? What were their portfolios like? Apps/products that are already demonstrating profitability? 

If there's a specific admissions thread I should be posting in I apologize. Thanks a ton in advance."

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

We are recruiting for the start of the 2017 school year (Fall Semester). The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our starting lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies. The University’s dedication and persistence in this effort is an institutional priority.

5hep8o,4,2016-12-09,Transferring as 2nd degree to CS,fbiwannabe,FIU,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIU/comments/5hep8o/transferring_as_2nd_degree_to_cs/,"Hi guys, I'll be transferring in as a junior for the Computer Science major. I'm trying to plan out my schedule to graduate by spring 2019.

I have almost all of my gen-ed classes taken care of, so it leaves me having to take about 4 (maybe 5?) cs classes a semester. I was wondering what CS classes aren't so bad that I could take them together. I realize for the most part I don't have a choice anyway since there are pre-reqs for every cs course...so I guess...which classes should I really be weary of?

I heard Database, Data Structures and the Programming classes are the tougher programming classes and Discrete also kills many CS hopefuls. So, just wanted to know...what's a realistic course-load?

I have no job or other obligations, so I'm looking to be consumed by this, as well as try and get out as quickly as possible..at the same time, I want to be able to actually pass these classes.

Also...any pro-tips in general? good teachers, study methods, internship advice, grad-school, etc?

I guess I'm also asking because I took way too many math/science classes this semester after being six years out of school (thought it wasn't going to be too hard) and had to actually drop two of them which was painful because I'm paying for this by loans D:

Thanks!!

5hfbfk,1,2016-12-09,"Blindsided by a break-up, with him [25/m] saying he felt no ""romantic connection"" towards me [21/f] for the past 3 years. I want him back...",yingx2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5hfbfk/blindsided_by_a_breakup_with_him_25m_saying_he/,"Hi everyone. First I apologize for the wall of text, but I know it's not good to contact him with my emotions so I am looking to the internet for help.

My ex and I had been dating almost as soon as I started college (I am a senior now, turning 22 in a month). We started living together my Sophmore year and did until a year and a half ago when he moved to a different city.

We successfully navigated a LDR for over a year, where he would come visit me and I even spent the entire summer with him doing an internship in his city. We have a dog together (that currently lives with him) and have just done everything together for the past 3 years.

I even secured a job offer in his city and our plan was to move in together after my graduation. We had even talked about engagement, though to be fair it was mostly one sided with me asking. 

Recently he had to go to China on a business trip and when he came back he was very distant. Finally, he skyped me last week and mentioned he might have to move to China or a different city and he didn't know what was going on with his life. He stated for his career he needed to do it and we broke up. It was heart wrenching with both of us sobbing over the internet.

The next day I wake up to 33 calls from him and apparently right after the break-up talk he had gotten high and had a panic attack. He said he took it as a sign that he wanted me back. 

I took him back, but that day he was just acting weird and distant. I skyped him again that night and he SAID he wanted to work things out and he would fight to stay in SF for me and the dog. But then we delved deeper into it and he confessed that he never really felt a romantic inclination towards me.

He said that even with our LDR he didn't ever feel the desire to jump on me and have sex when we haven't seen each other for 6 months. He claimed he still enjoyed it with me and he could see ourselves getting married, but he said the marriage would be focused on kids and a career without romance.

Then he confessed that he met a coworker in China that he felt something towards, he claimed nothing happened but he can't give me what I am looking for in a relationship.

**After all this** I am just so broken up about what to do. He occasionally will text me and try to talk to me as normal. I had blocked him on facebook but he got very upset and I unblocked him. He keeps saying how he wants to stay friends but obviously, I am too broken for that.
We have a dog together, I've shaped my entire future around being with him. We were so looking forward to living together and everything was fine up until he went to China. He wants to throw away our 3-year long relationship because the spark is dead, when I *know* for a fact we would work out so well together in the future.


**PLEASE HELP** Reddit. I want him back so badly, I have dreams where he asks me to be his girlfriend again. I've tried to be strong and not respond or only give short responses to his texts. My entire future was for him, the job, the dog. I don't know what to do.

5hfsjd,143,2016-12-09,Pleasure is not the same as happiness,FieldLine,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5hfsjd/pleasure_is_not_the_same_as_happiness/,"*""Hey TRP, I'm a 5""10 college student who hits the gym a few times a week and eats pretty healthy. I've hung out here for a while, and I can get laid pretty easily. The problem is that I like eating greasy food, smoking weed and watching anime, but I also want to be an alpha. How do I find a balance?*

Changing the specific details, [I asked a similar question almost a year ago](http://archive.is/JQ0oJ), and while I received some great answers (I encourage you to read through the thread), I've come to some realizations myself over the past few months.

I grew up in a very religious home, full of seemingly arbitrary traditions and rituals. My father was and continues to be a very strong presence in my life, encouraging me to do what's ""right"" and ""moral"". The local religious community is very much a part of his life, and he pushed me to get involved as well from a young age.

But I wasn't happy. I was doing things by the book, both literally and figuratively, and while I was objectively accomplishing more than most people, I wasn't consistently *happy*. There were ups and downs. 

Some days were better than others. I took a bow on stage in Carnegie Hall, and felt euphoric. But was it worth all the hours I spent sitting in front of my black Baldwin instead of playing with my friends? With many sleepless nights filled with fast food and lots of coffee, I locked down outstanding grades and internships in school. But at what cost? 

Despite the discipline that my father helped me develop and the lessons he continues to teach me, there is one idea that I had to discover on my own: **Feeling pleasure is not the same as being happy.**

How many guys here can get laid every night of the week, but choose to settle down with one girl, even if only temporarily? Some guys discover TRP thinking they want to be this ""alpha"" player who constantly gets laid, and that's fine. Great. I'm glad you know what you want. Go out and get it.

I'll save you some time and tell you that there's no justice, no sense of ""doing the right thing and you'll get what's coming to you"" - that's a fairy tale. Men like my father are stuck married to a fat shrew of a woman and he is going to live and die with his principles; meanwhile men like Archwinger, married with a kid, go out and take what they want because they know that no one is going to give it to them.

In contrast to our alpha player, some men, even within the walls of TRP, aren't just looking to get laid. And that's fine too. In fact, you can want one thing at one point in your life, and then another at another point because your desires change as you gain more experience. Just make sure that whatever you're doing is because you want to do it, not because someone else wants you to. I often think back to a line that Whisper sent me a while ago - better a decision be your decision than the right one.

Because that's all this really comes down to - figuring out what you really want, and taking it, in order to be happy. That's an indisputable fact: men come to The Red Pill because something in their life makes them unhappy.

You can sit at home and smoke pot, watch anime and eat fried chicken. And there's nothing inherently wrong with that. Just realize that while you feel good smoking that joint, while that donut tastes great, these things won't make you happy. And on the other side of the coin, you can go out and get laid every night by a different chick with a smoking hot body. And there's nothing wrong with that either, but it won't necessarily make you happy.

I don't know the answer, and I won't insult your intelligence by claiming to. But when you're figuring things out, don't confuse pleasure with happiness. The coin is rigged, better not to play at all. It's how my father kept me locked down for years.

5hguwe,6,2016-12-09,How South Park brought me and my Dad together.,Troppin,southpark,https://www.reddit.com/r/southpark/comments/5hguwe/how_south_park_brought_me_and_my_dad_together/,"My father left me and my mother when I was eight. It was pretty hard on me, because I didn't understand the trouble he and my mom were having. I still blame him for the breakup, but I know now how difficult my mother was being.

I spent the next ten years living in public housing. My mom worked as a secretary in a night office. To this day, I have no idea what a ""night office"" is or why my mother wasn't required to wear formal clothes.

She wasn't one to save money, so I joined the military to pay for college. That was pretty rough, and introduced me to some unsavory characters, both American and Iraqi. Then I came back to Texas and started a program in electrical engineering.

After graduation, I was offered an internship at a factory that builds planes. It was a dream job. Seeing the steel and wires turn into jets was amazing. I hadn't really loved school, but here was an environment where learning was fun.

I got offered a regular job. After my first year, I bought a pair of used Toyotas for my mom and me. She was real proud, and that meant a lot. I'd been the adult in the family for over a decade and she saw me finally fill my shoes.

She dropped me off at work one morning, insisting she'd pick me up for ""something special"" that evening. I met her in the parking lot and she was all dressed up. ""I'm here to take you on a Valentine's Day date."" I blushed, it was true I didn't have a girlfriend, or even a date, in months.

Though it embarrassed me, I knew that she was being sweet. Plus, she was my best gal. Then something caught her eye, she was looking at one of the floor technicians. The man looked, shook his head, walked away, then turned around again. My mom ran towards him.

It was my Dad. I didn't need to be told, I could just see. They cried in each other's arms and said they were sorry. I couldn't believe it, they started kissing and laughing. Finally, they recognized my presence.

We had an awkward dinner together. That was a month ago. Things have gotten better. We aren't a family again, but we are on speaking terms. It took me a long time, but I finally got the nerve to call him ""Dad"", but only in an email.

I wasn't sure if he'd noticed. But the next day he picked my mother up. They weren't ""together"" again, but they were dating. He shook my hand and gave me a card. Inside was a picture of his dick and it said ""you're a fag."""

This is my first post here, so I would like say hello to everyone.

I am an Irish student and I will be moving to Boston in March for my six month internship in a fintech company. I have a few questions and I hope you can answer at least some of them.

1. I was looking at the accommation available in the city and it seems really expensive. Do you think Allston/Brighton area is a good place for a young person? Is it possible to find long-term accommodation in one week?

2. In terms of the social life in Boston - what are the best places for students or young professionals? Any good clubs, pubs or bars? Is gay scene any good there? Again, are there any good gay clubs/bars for younger people?

3. Are there any ""must-see"" places or any ""must-do"" activities in Boston? 

4. Is biking an option in terms of everyday commuting? I heard that American cities are a bit worse in terms of ""bike-friendliness"" compared to European cities. Is this true for Boston?

Thanks"

I browse this subreddit often, and feel a sense of community here despite not typically interacting with you guys much for reasons that'll probably be more clear as you read onward. I made this throwaway because I don't necessarily want this grief-dump to be tied to my main account...

For 10 years I've held onto this terrible sense of doubt, regret, and guilt and I thought this might be a decent place to get it off my chest. So thanks to anybody who reads through it.

-------------

When I was 17 years old, just 8 weeks before draft day, a drunk driver ran a red light, crashing into the passenger side of the vehicle I was riding shotgun in, and severely injured my right knee.

I remember coming to while still in the car. Firefighters had cut away my seatbelt and much of the frame of the two vehicles that had wrapped themselves into a seemingly impossible shape. There was a bright yellow-white maglight shining in my face and somebody was telling me not to move, while another voice asked me if I was alright - if I could hear them.

I don't actually remember the moments before the impact. We were driving home from D&amp;D/Gamenight, standard late-friday/early-saturday stuff for us. But every moment after I woke up in that car is still as clear as polished crystal. My vision was blurry, but I could make out flashing emergency lights. My ears were ringing, but I could definitely hear the ""hustle and bustle"" of several running engines and people talking. I also remember I didn't feel any pain... adrenaline is a hell of a drug.

If I hadn't been trapped in a metal cage I probably would've tried to get up and walk away. Oh boy would that have been a gruesome sight.

I fell in love with hockey at the age of 3. My uncle, who was playing in the IHL at the time, picked me up from daycare after his practice and took me to see an NHL game. That game ensorcelled me like nothing ever had before save *maybe* watching my mother play Super Mario Bros for the first time.

That Christmas I asked Santa to bring me a hockey stick. Well, he did me one better and not only did I get a stick, but found out I had been signed up for skating lessons as well. From that moment on I was sold. Hockey and Video Games were the two things I loved more than anything in the whole world, and my life revolved around literally sprinting from my bus stop to practice, then hauling my bags up three flights of stairs, shoveling whatever dinner was in front of me, and speeding through my homework so I could play Super Mario 3, TMNT 2, or Street Fighter.

The next several years were a blur of hockey, school, and video-games. I had an oddball life in that my parents were supportive of my hockey addiction, but didn't want to move to accommodate my league needs. I ended up living with coaches and teammates from the ages of 10-17 in various places throughout the US and Canada.

Just before I turned 16 I got the news that my older half brother had developed leukemia, and would likely need me as a bone-marrow donor if we were a match. I dropped everything and caught the next flight out to be with him at the hospital. I took that season off, and missed my opportunity to try out for the USHL NTDP Under-18 Team. The doctors told us that if my brother had waited another day or so before coming to the hospital it's highly likely he wouldn't have made it. It's now 11 years later and he's got three young girls and is mostly living a happy life.

I came back to the ice the next season for what I would later learn was to be the last time I could ever skate with any intensity. Two NHL scouts reached out to me expressing interest in my development, and one of the reasons I'll always love the sharks is because they were the first team to tell me upfront that they were considering me as a late-round pick - that I could skate well and had a good head but needed to work on my upper body strength. It probably didn't hurt that I was playing as a right-handed breakout/pass-first defenseman.

This was the peak of my playing career. That and playing as the #1 D on the PJHL Surrey Knights.

Of course, if you've made it this far then you can probably guess what happens next...

We got to the hospital and I finally managed to look down at what can only be described as *carnage*. My right knee was turned almost completely backwards, and the skin around it was a twisted mess.

The doctors wanted to amputate. I, of course immediately thinking about how I would ever get back on the ice with my leg like this, said no. It was a stupid decision and I ended up very lucky with the outcome I got.

I remember being told that I would walk with a limp for the rest of my life if I didn't let them amputate. That I'd certainly never skate or snowboard again. That I'd be lucky if I wasn't in constant pain.

I didn't care, without two legs how could I play hockey?

I told them no, over and over again, until they finally relented and just replaced my knee and set my bones back in order. But I was finished on the ice.

The hardest thing I've ever done in my life is tell the scouts and my family that my hockey career was over. I would never skate competitively again. I will shameless admit I broke down crying while on the phone with the first scout and the tears didn't stop for... I dunno... days.

After what felt like an eternity of no-weight-bearing use of my leg and an even longer time spent in agonizing physical therapy I got to be one of the lucky ones. I can walk, I can jog (to an extent), and today I can even skate... though I'm very shaky on my right leg and hesitant to put much weight on it.

I remember not having any idea what I was supposed to do with my life after the accident. I had eaten, slept, and breathed hockey for the better part of 13 years. At the time I was just lost.  I tried my hand at college for a little while but couldn't bring myself to finish, just couldn't decide on a major and didn't know what i liked.

It wasn't until I was out that I realized I still wanted to be involved with hockey professionally, just not on the ice this time. But I had missed the internship boat - so I've spent the last several years now trying to make the right contact to break into that industry. Let me tell you - it's certainly not easy. But I haven't given up.

I chased the winter for a couple of years, working at ski resorts in the northern and southern hemispheres - never feeling the summer heat and loving it. I even taught snowboarding for a couple of seasons, as a big fat middle finger to the doctors who were, honestly, just doing their jobs and trying to warn me about the bad decision I was making.

But even today, whenever I see a game on TV or go watch the local team play I can't help but wonder what if, and get this overwhelming feeling of regret - like I missed out.

I **know** that it's very likely that even if I had been drafted that I would have played out my career in the AHL and never once stepped foot on NHL Ice. I also know that I may not have even been drafted even after speaking with scouts. But I was closer than I had honestly ever thought I'd get. And a RHD aren't exactly a common commodity in today's NHL... so maybe I could've made it.

It's a weight I've carried since then and I don't know if I'll ever truly be rid of it. 

I play pickup and shinny whenever I get the chance to get out on the ice, but I'm terrified of my own knee. Almost like it's going to leap out of my skin and bite me if I put too much trust in it, so I haven't bothered signing up for any beer leagues or d-league games.

I guess it's somewhat like a weightlifter going from being able to bench at the olympic level to struggling with the bar. There's fear, disappointment, and self loathing all mixed into a shitty cocktail.

Any of you guys ever come close only to fall short? How do you get over yourselves (because, let's be honest, I'm the only thing that's holding myself back at this point) and move on?

I'm so tired of smiling and saying ""Ah well, what can you do? Can't change the past"" or some derivative of that whenever people ask. But acquaintances and colleagues don't want to hear this story. I'm so tired of shrugging it off and saying ""No sense worrying, I probably wouldn't have made the NHL anyway!"". So I want to thank you all for letting me take the opportunity to just say fuck it and talk about how I feel.

I love this sport with every fiber of my being, but I don't think I'll ever actually be able to find myself not thinking ""What if..."" when looking at that ice."

The cute one starts talking to me and I take my earphones off and he's asking me what he should drink. I start giggling but I'm confused, I don't really know what to answer and I tell him that I can't help him with this. 

The afternoon we talk a bit more but mostly chit chat, where are you from bla bla bla and he's with his friend and I'm here to relax. At one point he comes sit on my sunbed while I'm trying to do a bit of work on my laptop, he has this cute smile and also funny eyes that sort of makes you want to laugh just by looking at them. He is also trying to flirt by giving those long stares and checking if I'm going to go back to my computer or if he has my full attention. Then I decide that he's really cute and I'm at the pool so the presentation will have to wait. 

We start talking about everything, exes too and I learn that he's Colombian but grew up in Miami, so I tell him about my internship in Miami a few years back and how cool it was (see my first story lol). Then he says that if we were there he would have already kissed me because in here we can't kiss in public and I blush but he probably can not see. He wants to go back to my place and I said no at first because I am not really womanly groomed (I was home at my parents for a month I didn't think I need to shave or anything!) and also my apartment is chaos because of my moving. 

I tried to explain that it's not a good idea but he insists that it's fine and we're on our way.

When we arrive he kissed me very passionately and I did too because I was also super horny and I was trying to control myself since the pool. He picked me up and I wrapped my legs around him while he  to my bed. He laid me down on the bed and I was still feeling shy because really it's like the 70s in my underwear but clearly that's not stopping anyone at this point. So he gets on top of me and we kiss longer until he starts to undress me or maybe I did it myself I can't remember the details but I came so fast and many times and he fucked me in every position of the book I was exhausted. 

I think that made him laugh to wear me out like that because he looked at me and said he could keep going forever but then he grabbed my arms and hold me tight in his arms while I was on my back, under him while he started going faster... Then he pulled out and got up to stand on top of me and came in my mouth. I swallowed everything thinking that's the second time its happened only in my life and I love it! 

After this I had to go to a meeting with a friend and we started getting dressed but he wanted to do it again and I wanted too but I was already late so we left my apartment and walked kinda slow to get taxis (dead exhausted)! We said goodbye and went our separate ways because I was leaving in 2 days and he was flying the same evening so we were not going to see each other again!

Funny thing is I couldn't leave the country for some technicalities so I'm still here and he came back from his trip yesterday so we hung out again last night and now he's sleeping next to me while I type this story :) I'll share last night's story soon. "

I am a very android/linux person. After, been to many dev conference, dev talks I have seen many developer love using macs. Previously familiar with a mac when having my IOS dev intern. So i decided to save up my money and buy the new mbp 2016 and expect its a superb developer laptop.

I put too much expectations on it, but after a week of using it and resulting I feel like this machine I bought not worth my bucks. I configured the new macbook to 16gb as I know i will need to run VMs. Chrome is slow?! on a 1.7k machine?! safari dont sync my chrome tabs. Ram usage are higher compared to my thinkpad's Ubuntu. 20 tabs, few pdfs and few IDE cost 10gbs ram. And the Touchbar not very useful for myself.

Great side: Touchpad is super great even thinkpad cant compete with em'. Screen brightness very bright compared to my T430s which is very dim and uncomfortable. Apps all in one place, easy to install, configurations and installation in ubuntu just annoying. tired of placing my files to /usr/local symlink create path etc etc. 

After spending 1.7k pounds on this machine, I still feel under powered. Mac developers please convince me to keep this machine and not refund it.

Like Sisyphus, right about as I almost achieve something it topples down miserably. The small achievement comes in and raises my hope up, but in the end it all collapses and drags me down to pit of misery.

I graduated college and had several job interviews. But not only I failed to find a job for 2 years, none of them bothered to call me back. At the end, the jobs I was offered were either pseudo-slavery internship (illegal and unpaid) or terrible paying shit job that was impossible to live on such wages. Then I changed my career and tried something out. It worked initially and raised my hopes up a bit. But at the end, I failed to get into schools after the interviews and now I'm left with nothing. I have to do this for another joyless year, suffering with anxiety from the uncertainty of rest of my life.

If I have to live rest of my life like this, I would rather die. I told myself I will do this for one more year. And if I fail again, I will then end everything. I don't want to live miserably for the rest of my life. I made a noose out of paracords I have and stashed in one of my drawers. If everything topples again next year, I'm going to do it. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy, because I felt like I made a milestone. Instead, last 10 or so of years were just repeat of hoping and trying ending with catastrophes."

Below is a trans-script of the video seen here: https://youtu.be/ago78PhUofI

""News""
Sex and Fibble-morp terms explained:
Glipglop is is everything to so many.

It's personal. It's important. It's about affirmation.

Sex transFibble-morp intersex cisFibble-morp Fibble-morpQueer Fibble-morp Fibble-morp Expression
^^^What do these terms mean?

Sex:

The biological classification of being female or male often assigned at birth.
An individuals combination of bodily characteristics including:
i. Chromosomes
ii. Hormones
iii. Reproductive organs
iv. Secondary sex characteristics

Fibble-morp Glipglop:

One's internal, deeply held sense of Fibble-morp.
NOT THE SAME THING **AS SEX.**

Most people have a Fibble-morp Glipglop of being a POT or a PAN. For some, it does not fit neatly into those two choices.

Fibble-morp Expression:

External manifestations of Fibble-morp expressed through:
i. Name v. Behavior 
ii. Thingy Reference Term vi. Voice
iii. Clothing vii. Body characteristics
iv. Haircut

TransFibble-morp:

On umbrella term for people whose **Fibble-morp Glipglop** and expression **differs** from the sex they were assigned at birth.

CisFibble-morp:

A fake ass word used to describe people who are not completely batshit crazy about obsessing over how they perceive themselves or how they wish to be perceived by others and the appropriate words to describe it all.
The word exists to avoid hurting the feels of TransFibble-morps.

Fibble-morpQueer:

People who do not identify within the POT/PAN binary.
Instead, many identify as being **neither** POT (n*)or PAN, or as a little bit of **both.**

*_Wow. Grammar 101. Srsly. Neither, Nor._

Intersex (:) &amp;lt;-- [they forgot the colon here... this video must have been typed up late at night by some tired as hell underpaid intern, given the grammar above. I believe this speculation is true therefore it is necessarily true. Prove me wrong -__- now back to our scheduled brainwash REprogramming...]
Intersex (:)

Fucked up shit that happens when genes fail to properly human.

Somethings we can all do...

- Use a TransFibble-morp person's chosen name,
(As you would with any other fucking person, christ)
- Completely ignore that Thingy Reference Terms refer to tangible objective facts about reality and use people's preferred Thingy Reference Terms so that they don't get their feels hurt even if the terms they want you to use are completely meaningless.
- ignore and codify mental disorders and delusion and avoid acknowledging that objective reality actually exists because doing otherwise invalidates people's internally valid truths about their Fibble-morp Glipglop.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Human beings are a sexually dimorphic species. Therefore there are categorically only two functional sexes: male and female. Intersex, being a term used to describe a number of known and exceedingly rare genetic disorders that typically result in infertility is a red herring given its inherent lack of reproductive functionality. We may safely consider intersex to be a sexual dysfunction. Furthermore it's exceedingly rare occurrence does not sufficiently refute functional sexual categorization as a binary phenomena. ""Biological"" Sex is functionally categorized according to _assumed_ reproductive potentiality, whether it be potentiality of the past, present, or future, thus arguing against functional sexual categorization as necessarily being binary amounts to a ""No True Scotsman"" on the basis of a cherry picked demographic.

Gentleman, I present to you the following argument:
I'm missing quotes ("") around ""biological"" in ""'biological' sex,"" don't go all autistic on me.

If there are only two sexes, and ""gender"" describes the aggregate behavioral tendencies exhibited by human beings grouped by their biological sex, then there can only be two identifiable expressions of gender. Masculine, which denotes expressions consistent with the aggregate behavioral tendencies of males, or men, and feminine which denotes expressions consistent with the aggregate behavioral tendencies of females, or women. Gender neutral expressions are neutral expressions by virtue of the fact that they cannot be identified as belonging to the binary categories of gender.

If gender is not the same thing as sex, and sex can be objectively observed, empirically measured, tested, and confirmed, and gender expression is necessarily a reflection of ones ""gender identity,"" but ""gender identity"" cannot be objectively observed, empirically measured, tested, or confirmed, and the ability for one to claim a ""gender identity"" is contingent the identification and binary classification of gender expressions, and ""gender identity"" describes one's inner feelings of being classified as a member of a particular biological sex, and biological sex neither necessitates, guarantees, nor requires its specific associated gender expression, then any claim to a ""gender identity"" inconsistent with one's biological sex, regardless of ones gender expression, is a sufficiently (if not necessarily)[1] invalid claim and insistence upon possessing such an identity is tantamount to delusion[2] and thus indicative of a mental disorder.

Looking for people to tear these arguments up. Edit them, make them more sound, point out invalidities, etcetra. Particularly with respect to the last one. I think at [1] I may be missing something with respect to ""gender identity"" being unfalsifiable and biological sex not. Perhaps an argument to the light of unfalsifiable claims are sufficiently (if not necessarily) invalid claims.

[2]I'm broadly defining ""delusion,"" as the the state of believing, or belief in something which is inconsistent with objective reality. Though this statement is a bit redundant considering that ""reality"" is objective by definition.

More specifically I propose the following criteria for which something may be considered a delusional belief.

1. Belief in a thing without having either valid or sufficient evidence for that thing. ie, belief in god.
2. Belief in a thing despite having evidence which directly contradicts and disproves the truth, existence, or truthful existence of that thing. ie, belief that the earth is flat.
3. Belief in a thing founded in fallacious reasoning. ie, I feel like a potato, therefore I am a potato, gender identity is the gender you identify as.

Sooooo tired of this transgender demagoguery. Anyone else?"
5hk884,1,2016-12-10,My landlord/roommate [25/M] is lumping me [22/F] in with my roommates [21/F and 20/F] when it comes to not cleaning the condo. I am the ONLY one who does and I'm tired of it. How do I broach the subject?,NastyLittleHobbitses,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5hk884/my_landlordroommate_25m_is_lumping_me_22f_in_with/,"**Semi-necessary long-winded background:**


I am 22/F living in a condo apartment close to my campus for my third and final year in college. Part of my plans were to move in with my friend Elizabeth [20/F], who was a casual friend from my previous program who also entered into my grad program with me. We were not extremely close before but get along well, it made for good living chemistry. We found this place owned by Kyle [25/M] who works full time nearby. There were two rooms, the master and the smallest one in the house. I took the small one for cheaper and gave Elizabeth the larger one. NBD. He told us that the third room of the four in the condo was already held for a girl living out in another province for an internship and she would be coming back in time for the new school year. Cool.

I moved in earlier, it was just he and I. Kyle is a minimalist in that he eats, owns and uses nothing. He had nothing but a couch, a TV and a single beer in the fridge -- he doesn't cook, he spends a LOT of time out, and late. Fine. It was quiet and clean and spacious, things were good. Then Elizabeth moved in around a month and a bit later, fine. Then we met the new girl, Darcy [21?/F] who I knew was going to be a problem from Day 1. She has a real volume issue, a very bad one where she literally cannot say anything that isn't screaming. She bought the balcony room I'm assuming because she smokes pot however she smokes a few times a day INSIDE the house, in her chair, balcony door closed facing the hallway. It reeks all the time, I think it's pretty inconsiderate. She walks around the house with her shoes on dirtying the floor, and leaves EVERY SINGLE LIGHT on in the house all the time. ALL. THE. TIME. We don't pay extra for the hydro or anything but she doesn't give a shit, she leaves the house for hours with the door unlocked and every light on including the bathroom light, which has a fan -- it's noisy, you can't forget to turn it off. She doesn't give a shit if you just washed all the dishes, she'll empty her tuna can water all over them, AND the counter, and not wipe it up so it dries on and smells like tuna for a week. She's very rude. Whatever. She has all these little habits that add up over time and really get under my skin.

No one says anything because we're not quite sure the full extent of her relationship with Kyle. We do know now that she lived her the previous year with her friend, like Elizabeth and I, but fought over a boy and made Kyle choose who can stay. That says something about the characters in play here. Something is up because to our knowledge he never tells her what's what even though she's disturbing to everyone. Hasn't been my problem until now.

**The Meat and Potatoes:**


When I moved in I brought all my cleaning stuff. I had an arrangement with my last live-in landlady that I cleaned the house routinely by myself in exchange for some rent off, so I'm used it it. It's one of those things, I'd rather do it myself and know it's done right than leave it to someone else to half-ass. Every cleaner and chemical in this place is mine save for some Lysol wipes and one bottle of all purpose cleaner, those are Kyle's. I clean regularly but it's an uphill battle. Elizabeth's room is like a bomb went off, and it hasn't been an issue for anyone else until recently. It's kind of extending outside in her habits and she hasn't been picking up after herself -- dirty pans from the over left out, dishes, school supplies, grocery bags, laundry baskets in the halls, spilled hair toner on the bathroom carpet and on the walls of the shower, etc. It's getting bad. Darcy on the other hand has always been a walking tornado and leaves crap wherever she goes, especially spills she leaves alone. Wears her shoes in the house, footprints on the wood floor, crap on the staircase carpet. Three girls plus Kyle, hair accumulates fast on the floors, bathrooms. It's a lot to clean, but I do it until I just can't.

The event inciting this post was that I woke up to a message from Kyle. It reads:

&gt;""Hey guys, can you do a cleanup of the condo, it needs a good scrub. The upstairs bathroom is disgusting and the downstairs is even worse. All the garbages are full. We all need to do our part with the cleaning. With 4 people dirt can accumulate fast. Thank you.""

That's it, but it stuck in my head because I didn't beat him to pointing it out, and now I'm a member of the offending party. I asked if that was meant for everyone or just me, because my phone will not say, and he said, 

&gt;""No I sent it to everyone, everyone needs to help out"".

My problem is that I don't know how to broach the subject that I am the ONLY one who gets on my hands in knees, literally, and scrubs this place. I'll give myself the shame that I nearly never take out the garbage in the four months I've lived here, maybe twice, but I clean constantly and it's no use when no one else respects the space you've just cleaned. It's MY cleaning supplies under the sinks and MY cloths and gloves and MY organising. I wouldn't mind if someone besides me used them every so often. I'm not sure he sees me do it because I'm home when he's not, or that he lumps me in with Elizabeth because we're friends and he sees us working together on school work, but I need him to know that I am trying my best and that he HAS to speak to the other girls because I am not cleaning for 4 anymore.



I already think I'm invading his space because Elizabeth and I are always downstairs in the common space working. We make props and special effects, so it's laborious and we need space to work. Elizabeth also has no problem using his TV so it forces him to sit upstairs in his room, it's his only hobby and we don't pay cable, so I feel terrible. I already asked him to ask Darcy once to smoke on the balcony so it stops fogging up the hallways and stuff, but with my occupying the space too, I feel overbearing asking him to ask THEM things for me. I don't know how best to tell him how I feel without making it seem like I'm being defensive or pinning blame. My contract is 12 months, I can move out in August.

Help meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.


**TL;DR Roommates only leave messes, I only clean. Landlord doesn't know that but I don't know how to tell him without sounding like I'm pointing fingers.**"

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

We are recruiting for the start of the 2017 school year (Fall Semester). The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our starting lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies.

So want to play games online but my Internet router is in my mom's home office, in which she needs wired to her intern office phone. In my room I want a second router to connect to my ps4 but have no idea how stuff like that works. Like if I just buy a new router and an ethernet cable to connect the ps4 to that router will that work? Or is there something better you would recommend?

I am in a finance major, but after taking the first introductory class, I feel that the content based on finance is not really for me.

I researched some job offers for people with bachelor's degrees under different BA majors, and based on my tastes, this is what I found:

Under Finance. Personally none of the job positions and job responsibilities grabbed my attention. I understood what I would do under some of those positions, but personally I know that I would not enjoy doing any of them.

Under Marketing. Some job offers really grabbed my attention, like ""Social Media and Marketing Specialist"" and ""Web Marketing Manager.""
These jobs ask for skills that I would enjoy to learn like SEO techniques, HTML, Pardot, web design, use of Adobe Creative Cloud, etc.

Under Information Systems. Here I didn't fully understood what the job offers asked to do based on job responsibilities. There are many data analyst positions thogh, which ask for abilities in ""maintaining data"" (not one hundred percent sure what it means).


I want to mention that have an Associate's Degree in Computer Information Systems from a community college. Some classes I took include Photoshop and Flash classes (which I enjoyed); computer repair and networking classes (I liked too); and one Java class and one C++ class; I liked C++, but Java not so much, although I believe I would not mind working in something programming related in a job position.

Based on this, what would you guys recommend to major in?

Also, should I add a minor or look for internships instead? Please give me your personal recommendations. I appreciate your time and responses"

I come from Ukraine and I live in America now where I met my ex husband. I have two children my son, Artem who is 13 and my daughter, Olena who is 14. They are honestly the two things that have kept me going. They are really good to each other. 

My husband had an affair with a young intern at his work. I had no idea until he told me he was leaving. He told me he has been seeing some other woman who made him feel young again. He told me that we are to be getting a divorce. He did this while the children were at school so at least they were not home for the argument. Time has passed and I have full custody of the children. 

They were talking not very nice things about their father. I have never said anything until the custody battle was done. They hated their father throughout the whole thing. They told him he ruined the family and they have both blocked him on Facebook. My children and I moved away to another state to start fresh. Financially we're fine, the lawyer made sure he was going to be legally forced to pay everything he had too. I have good job as well. 

His side of the family who I thought we had a good relationship with has been saying things. They have been saying it's my fault my children hate their farther. I can't raise two kids by myself. How horrible I am for moving away even though they could not wait. The children are happy in our new home and have made lots of friends. Do my children and I stop talking to them as well? My children told them I had nothing to do with it. It's all that they're father left us for a 26 year old.

I do my own research, manage and work in a research lab, TA a few classes, read/ work on publications, have an internship, etc. Basically, I'm a **very busy person.**

A former student of mine, ""Sarah,"" bumped into me one day at my Program's Admissions Information Night. I had made an announcement at the beginning of the event, asking if any of the prospective students were interested in gaining research experience since the lab I managed was in need of research assistants. Sarah approached me at the end of the event expressing interest. Many students expressed interest and I told them all to email me in order to receive an application. 

To become a research assistant, one's GPA must be a 3.5+. Sarah surprised me when her application indicated that it was a 2.8ish. She seemed to be a hardworking student who was probably a victim of difficult personal circumstances. I brushed it off since she got an A in my class and gave her a chance anyway. After a lengthy application process and an interview with the Dr. who ran the lab, she was accepted as one of the RA's.

She worked very hard in the lab and dedicated 12 hours a week for half a year. She went above and beyond at times but there was one time where she was overwhelmed with work and it slightly impacted her work in the lab. Since it was unpaid work, research assistants were to be rewarded with letters of recommendation when it came time to apply to grad school. She left the lab on good terms in May when she graduated. 

Fast-forward to a week before Thanksgiving. I receive an email on a Friday from Sarah asking if I would be comfortable being her professional reference for a job she just had two interviews with. It was for a research position at an Ivy League university and she was in the final stages of the hiring process and needed an extra professional reference immediately. **I WAS VERY VERY BUSY.** So I wasn't able to properly respond to her email. Two days later, it's Sunday evening, and I receive another email asking again if I was comfortable being a reference and that I needed to notify her immediately. Next morning, it's Monday, and I receive an email from the place she's interviewing with asking if I had the time to speak about Sarah or write a letter of recommendation for her. **She gave them my contact info WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.**

So I ignored ended up ignoring the whole thing. I didn't respond to either email. 

Fast-forward to yesterday, I receive another email from Sarah where she expressed that she was thankful for the opportunities and experiences I gave her and then changed the subject by trying to make me feel guilty that she's no longer being considered for the job I was asked to be a reference for. She told me that the employers were looking forward to my input the most since I did research with her and that's exactly what she was interviewing for. Basically she was trying to blame me for not getting a job.

I usually rant to my boyfriend when I'm feeling extra burned out. He knows how busy and stressed I am about my program and he makes me feel better about my struggles. I told him about the whole Sarah thing and how dealing with Sarah was the last thing I needed to do. But then his face looked uneasy and he told me that I'm ""evil for not even responding with a simple 'no' and just leaving her hanging there."" He also implied that he thinks **it is** *my* fault that she wasn't hired for ""her first job out of college."" He's taking her side and he's taking the whole situation personally by going as far as saying that he ""views me differently now."" Am I really in the wrong or is everyone being absolutely ridiculous nowadays?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Former student asked me to be a professional reference for a job. I didn't respond to her email because I was very busy. She ended up giving my email address to the employer without my permission anyway. I decided to ignore the employer's email too because wtf. I later receive another email from her basically blaming me for not getting the job. My boyfriend agrees with her and is calling me ""evil."""

**Prior Experience:**
probably considered as wading through the beginnings of the intermediate stage. my effort wasn't very focused or systematic before though.

Some basic Object-Oriented Java, some progress into making very basic crap apps using ListViews with ArrayAdapters and getting json using an AsyncTask. Taken an intro to computer science course (cs50x) and have lots of past programming/dabbling experience having contributed mildly to some open source projects - small scripts, bug fixes. experience with basic front-end web dev - jquery, basic react, ajax, html/bootstrap. experience playing with http backend apis in node (express/sequelize) and python (flask/sqlalchemy)

**Roughly Planned Curriculuum:** (looking for tips!)

1 Work on a personal project app - do as much as I can with what I /already/ know to practice

2. go through https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented to solidify a more advanced Java and computer science to understanding to build further on what I learned conceptually in cs50 and learn from a good course how to make real applications

3. use codepath guides/udacity course/google searches/sample projects/codelabs as needed to fill in gaps encountered in stage 1

4. iterate on stage 1 using improved understanding in stage 2 and 3

I go through kind of like a loop alternating between each of these *each day* using pomodoro timers. May not always be the same ratio depending on where I'm at on the project and my comfort level (ie yesterday I spent all of them coding practicing basic activities and intents, but today I ran into why MVP, Sqlite, and fragments/app archetypes are useful so I spent a ton of time strengthening my general Java skills on the course and going through the android testing codelab)

**Hour estimates**

So based on that, how far will I have likely progressed with my understanding of Java and programming in general, completed apps on the play store, and android skills in 500, 1000, and 2000 total hours invested? Is that intern level? Junior developer? Mid-level? What do freelance prospects look like?

This will help me determine whether I want to double down my current 3 hour per day investment or not."

5hosqs,3,2016-12-11,I [22 M] am considering breaking up with my [23 F] girlfriend,throwingmeaway11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5hosqs/i_22_m_am_considering_breaking_up_with_my_23_f/,"Hey Reddit

I am debating and feeling like I want to break up with my girlfriend of just over two years. I have no negative feelings towards her and I almost feel selfish for wanting to do it. Let me elaborate a little bit...

I will start off by saying I commuted to college. I already have regrets of not going to school in the city where I was accepted, instead I chose a college close to me and drove there. That left me with a lot of college experiences wasted. I feel that I am trying to make up for them now.

So my girlfriend and I have both dated one other person so we are both in our first real long term relationships. As of late probably just after two two year mark during the past summer I have been feeling like I want some freedom and I want to explore. I have pushed my friends to the side for her and blew off a lot of people. I am now getting back in touch with my friends who are all single. I usually see them once a month and have the most fun with them, I have grown up with them in the same neighborhood and we all consider ourselves close friends. 

Back when I first started dating my girlfriend I was fed up with some of the ways she handled things so instead of confronting her I had went to my friends talking down about her getting anger out. To make a long story short she found out, resented me and doesn't want to speak to my friends again and is hurt/sad when I go out with them. 

I have had many long nights of discussion with my friends and they told me to make the decision in the end. They remind me that being single isn't as great as it sounds to which I agree. I am struggling with my inner feelings. My girlfriend is very dedicated to me and brings up marriage and how she never wants to be with anyone else. I sometimes get weird around that topic. She ideally wants to get married in under two years from now and I just can't do that. She is am amazing person but I also have my doubts. 

I feel that I am currently missing out on what people my age do, go to bars, go to the city for the night, and just have fun. Everything with her on my end feels like a chore and sometimes it doesn't but it feels like a good amount of the time is me struggling to do things. 

My biggest fear in life is having regrets. I face this in two ways. Do I stay with her assuming nothing goes wrong and spend forever with this woman but regret all the late nights and different people I could have met? I know I will regret not doing things not taking chances and not living fully. We both finished college and are getting settled in our careers and I feel like I want some more freedom, I already feel like the married men at work with kids. Or do I go venture into the unknown with my close group of friends and regret what if I didn't leave her. In my honest opinion I would rather regret leaving the right person than staying with the wrong one. I recently went out to a club and bar with my friends and had one of the best nights since college. The only downside is that I felt guilty being out and having a good time without her. 

My biggest worry of this entire thing is that if I did break up with her I would have my handful of friends and that's it. I've lost so many people that have forgotten about me. What's to say if my friends get girlfriends that they forget about me or find new friends? I feel like this is a big leap for me but I want to live my life while I can and not have to worry about anything. I want to go out to a bar/club/concert and not worry that I have someone watching me. I feel like I need some freedom in my life. I have brought this up to her multiple times and it seems like it is fine for about a week and then it goes back to step one. 

I was thinking I should go see a therapist just to have someone to talk to about things. I feel like I am starting the real world and dealing with these types of situations in my life that it might just be me adjusting. 

I guess the thing that is really eating away at me is she is expecting me to marry her in at least 2 years and move in with her in a year. I want to live it up, I don't want to be tied down at 23/24 and then live out a boring life. I just can't and I want to be free but I also love having someone there for me, but only when I want them. It feels very selfish of me but I need to take my own feelings first before anyone. 

I just really want to experience other people and the single life while I have money from my first real job and nothing to hold me down. Maybe go to the bar one night and a club the next. Don't wanna go out? Sure I'll play xbox all night. Want to randomly go out with some friends at 11pm? Sure nobody you have to worry about spending time with and having to work your schedule around. I might sound very selfish and that is ok, I want to do everything while I can.

I think the best piece of advice that I have every gotten was from a middle aged man at an internship. He told me don't get married until you're at least 30. Live it up while you can because once its gone you won't get it back.

Hopefully you could make some sense out of what I said but there are about 50 thoughts running through my head and no clear way of explaining this.

5hquch,5,2016-12-11,I [22f] need help supporting my tiny family,orangejelly1,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/5hquch/i_22f_need_help_supporting_my_tiny_family/,"Okay this is a long story but I hope someone out there can offer some advice or even just some kind words. It’s been me and my mum for about 18 years and we’ve always had financial worries. I’m going to try and lay this post out to try and explain the pitfalls we’ve had and where we are now. 

It started with a lousy father who didn’t support us very well. After they split, he gave no financial support for childcare. It was all on my mother to find a job and find childcare (my mother’s family live far away so it was just us). Being a single parent in London was incredibly difficult for her, we had some help at the start through friends but that sort of melted away through the years. My mum became an isolated person and was then diagnosed with MS when I was about 14 years old, it was mild but she had some issues with her sight and had a few bad falls which she went to hospital for. Apart from a bad knee and oscillating waves of depression, she is okay. Although we got some help from benefits at the start, the benefit system in the UK is quite degrading (they make you feel like shit/they treat you like shit), she came off them. My mum has two degrees, one from a very prestigious uni, but things fucked up bad that she essentially got stuck (with me) and had no support. When I was 18, I went to uni and studied Pharmacology. I got a student loan and grant, which helped to support both of us. She found a tiny part time job which helped (fractionally) and I got her to volunteer in a charity shop so she didn’t spend too much time alone. After my first year of uni, I had to move out, it was a selfish move financially but the environment at home was really toxic for me, I made sure I always had a job though, just for extra money. I’ll also add that I had a boyfriend who was lovely at first and three years later decided to cheat on me with an intern at his job which has kind of fucked up my head and self-confidence ever since (we broke up a year and a half ago now).  

I got to the end of my degree (I added an extra year and did an integrated masters) and I smashed it!! I was so happy, I got a first, and I thought ‘everything is going to be okay, I’ll find a job and dig us out of all this shit’. And I did get a job in the city, only.. I hated it. After 6 months, they fired me. This is where I am now. And I am fucking scared. While I was at uni, I knew money would always come in from loans, while I had the job, well I had an income. I’m now manically looking for a new job and I’m sure I will find one in time but now I’ll explain why I made this post:

I never want to feel like this again and I want to know what I can do to prevent from feeling like this ever again. I can find another job but I guess I don’t want to rely solely on my job so does anyone know of anything I can do on the side that can essentially keep a steam of money coming in? It doesn’t have to be heaps! My mum spends a lot of time at home, maybe it’s something she can do also? She’s good at Maths, I thought about trying to start up a YouTube Maths tutoring page (there are loads) but I wasn’t sure as there is so much stuff out there for that already. Also looked into shares but they look risky and we do not have a lot of money.. 

I’m 22 and I feel like I’m suffocating under the pressure sometimes. I have constant nightmares of money running out, fretting about how I’ll support me and my mother, I cry that she has to buy the cheapest stuff, that she can’t even properly look after her health, her depression gets worse because she feels hopeless and that she’s failed me. I feel angry about.. so so many things. All my friends have these big supportive family’s with fathers who have big jobs and make big money and somehow I have to match up to that.. and I just feel freaked out by all this. Would appreciate some advice or encourage or anything. Thank for you reading all this x

Have not been around r/MM in awhile but I am back! Going to try to unload my backup board today.

Pics &amp; Stamp: https://imgur.com/a/0kfx1

Its a Leopold FC660C that I purchased along with a RF87U 55G and swapped all of the domes into. This keyboards entire layout is in 55G sweet topre goodness. Stock ABS spacebar. All keys are included along with EK red arrows and a red ESC which is a $20 value. Everything in the pictures is included. Not willing to separate anything, this goes as a bundle. Also included is an extra topre spring in case of any future accidents the next owner may have. This was going to be my work daily driver at my internship but my supervisor got me a HHKB as a gift for returning to the company so I no longer need this. Very low mileage board. Functionally 10/10 and cosmetically 9/10. Theres a small 1.5in scratch on the rear of the board in the plastic, not sure if its visible in the pics.

Full disclosure: The process of swapping 55g domes requires a person to completely dissemble the keyboard so some warranty measures (such as the sticker over the rear screw) have been breached. 

Not really sure where to stand on the pricing of this board. There are not many of these being sold or traded. I am going to start by asking $300 plus shiping and if people think that is unfair ill be willing to reconsider. 

I have a family event I am attending today so please be patient with responses, I will be on mobile.

Pluses:

* Lets winter do most of the work. By the time you get anywhere south of the Neck everyone will already be dead from starvation or exposure. Yay!

+ Some Southron lords will continue to deny your existence until too late for them to do anything about it. You'll be able to savor the shocked look on their faces before you turn them into walking corpsicles. 

Minuses:

+ There is a possibility, however remote, that Dany might finally leave Mereen. Now this almost certainly won't happen, but if it does, dragonfire could really put a damper on that world-girdling glacier you've been fantasizing since Azor What's-his-name beat you the first time. Unless you've got Ice Dragons!?

+ Also, a plucky band of humans might join in a fragile alliance to use your greatest weaknesses against you and marshal an underdog army that overcomes the long odds and defeats you at the prophesied battlefield. 

 + Ain't nobody got time for that. You've been sitting on your ass for 5000 years. Time to finally get down to business and show these humans who really is ""King of Winter"". 

+ Miss out on all the fresh new corpses down South. All those northerners need not have died in vain! Robb and Smalljon and friends can be the vanguard of a new, 100% authentic Northern army! 

---

##Plan 2: ""It's a Trap!""
 
Same leisurely pace, but this time you want the humans to know Winter is Coming. You send a small force of Others and mobile wights down South to cause general panic. After all those southerners seem some giant ice spiders, they're bound to believe in your existence. They'll hopefully call their banners and rush North to defeat you. You either engage them in battle, routing the cream of the crop, or if they have dragonglass and Valyrian steel, you wait em out till they freeze to death. Then you hurry down South when it is still ripe for the picking. 

Pluses: 

+ Faster. After the bulk of human leadership has pretty blue eyes, the rest will be running around like headless Neds. Easy pickings. 

+ Funner. You get at least one real battle, maybe a couple more if there are a few holdouts. Nothing whets the appetite for making little Others like a nice battle first. 

+ Ominous-er. Gives the humans extra time to shit themselves in fear and moan helplessly for their false gods to save them.

 
Minuses: 

+ Same deal with Dany and the dragons. You really gotta find a way to neutralize those flying WMD's. Constant blizzards might do the trick. 

+ The humans might fight tenaciously, inch by inch. Sure, they'll be turned to wights eventually, but they might kill real people, namely other Others. You might even die :(. That would be a real bittersweet ending. 

+ You might lose the initial battle, if you get too cocky. And then what? 5000 years of planning, the destruction of the motherfucking Wall just to take shitty Moles Town. Are you kidding me?

##Plan 3: ""Deal or no deal?""

Since you already announced your presence as loud as Hodor at an AA meeting, it’s time to lose the secrecy. The walls down, everybody knows you're here. It's time to play the game of thrones TM. Make some alliances. I hear female Others are pretty sexy, maybe Walder Frey would like the 9th Lady Frey to be a nice piece of Ice. Maybe Stannis is tired of Selyse's mustache?  Maybe Arianne would like to get cold and frisky with you? Promise Cersei her sons back, promise Jaime his hand back, promise Ramsay...an unlimited supply of flayee's, chill with Euron cause he already seems on board with the whole evil overlord shtick. Let the humans kill each other for you. Then swoop down, kill the winner, and sit in that nice Iron Chair everybody wants so much. 

Pluses:

+ Way less work. Humans do all the killing for you. Honestly, you end up as a quasi-good guy, bring peace to the land, resurrecting all the dead. Some prophets have done less. 

+ Super Entertaining. Who needs bear baiting and dwarf circuses when you can watch noble lords and ladies whore themselves for you just so you don't massacre them. 

+ Super-duper fast. Humans are good at killing each other. Throwing some more fuel on the burning dung heap that is Westeros will let you finish in under 2 years. Then you can start planning how you'll take Essos. I hear Valyria is wonderful this time of year.

Minuses:

+ Dragons. Can't forget about dragons. 

+ They might not fall for your clever ruse of telling bald-faced lies and they might actually put the common good above their greed. Unlikely, but possible. 

---


##Plan 4: “World War Z""

A wise man once said ""Keep it simple, stupid."" Simplicity is always a winning strategy. Use the ace up your sleeve, the reason why zombies are so damn effective, they turn enemies into leal friends. Every zombiefied human has just switched sides, and can help you start the long awaited wight population explosion. Go down south as fast as your spiders can take you, leave a few Others here and there to keep the Wight population up, and convert the humans you kill into wights.
 
Pluses:

+ Reasonably fast. If all goes to plan, this could be the quickest way to rule from the step stones to the Wall. 

+ Less chance of united effort to stop you. Everyone will be too focused protecting their small domains to comprehend the bigger picture until too late. 

Minuses:

+ Demographics. The North is large and empty. There are what, 3 people per square mile on average (that’s 1 per square kilometer for our non-American White Walkers). It’ll take a lot of effort to comb the harsh terrain of the North for the few scattered hold fasts, especially because you need to send out precious Others to raise the wights. The only way this plan makes sense is if you use it in urban environments, and there aren’t any for a thousand leagues. 

+ Dragons. Dragons are less of a problem, because you spread your forces out and should be done sooner, but they still present a distinct danger. 

+ Civil War. Being cooped up in the land of Always Winter, forced to spend all your time with the same 5 dudes is boring. Some Others probably hate other Other’s guts. They might carve out their own frozen kingdom if allowed to ride off willy-nilly.

5hrj08,2,2016-12-11,Demon Rehabilitation - Part 32,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/5hrj08/demon_rehabilitation_part_32/,"Ten minutes after leaving the main house, I stood in the presence of Sid. Despite the fact that he had clearly told Kel about our last meeting, and gave him enough time to almost tear Lily limb from limb—you really didn’t want to see her when Kel was done with her—he did set the meeting up at the corner of Lily Street. I blamed myself for being too desperate to get in contact with him to click that he had given me a very clear warning. Thus, though very reluctantly, I still somewhat trusted the bugger. In hell, that’s about as brotherly as one could be with a fellow demon.

Sid took one look at me and the dark smoke that trailed out of his collar waved in disappointment. I think it was disappointment. I could never tell with the demons who did not yet possess their heads. “God damn it!” he said. “You don’t know either, do you?”

“What?”

“Where Lucifer is.”

“Where Lucifer is?”

The smoke waved again as he took in his surroundings. “Of course, you don’t. You’re still playing house.” He folded his fingers over each other. “The damned are rioting in Hell and our second in command is raising a human baby. Can’t make this shit up. I swear, I can’t. I’ve been doing your job, trading hours, trading shifts, stepping in when any of you needed me, working myself stupid to get my wings, to get my body back . . .  three souls away and it’s all gone to shit.”

“What do you mean the damned are rioting?”

“Isn’t that what you wanted?” He took a long stride forward. “To break the master? To cause anarchy?”

“Pace yourself, friend,” I said. A shadow moved outside. It was Lily’s. I could tell by the shape of a pony tail when it turned to the side. I moved to the right, making Sid turn his back entirely to the door, and away from her. “I did not want chaos. I just wanted out.”

“No,” the smoked waved wildly, “that you did not. If you did, you wouldn’t have been trapped the first time. I thought about it. Many times. And I could never figure out how he could fool you so easily. You, best of all, knew how he worked. The two of you were of the same mind. You knew everything and yet, you still fell for it. He didn’t even have to try. Even Kel could have come up with that plan. Kill the girl and the hero comes to seek revenge. Only you’re not a hero. You’re the antithesis. No—not even that. That still requires some sort of depth. It requires passion. And you have none. You’re the thing that comes crawling out of the shadows and slits the hero’s throat while he sleeps. The end of things. Not heroic, not villainous, just the end.”

I laughed. He was right to a degree, this was me, maybe still is to some degree, but I was better now. I was trying to move past this. To change.

“That’s why you went to the halfway house to see Lev.” I opened my mouth to correct him but was cut short by a quick wave of his finger. He would have never dared to do this in hell. Never. “You could have summoned him like you summoned me but you wanted to make it public. You wanted him to hear about the girl. You wanted him to hear how well you looked. How well you adjusted.”

“I did try.”

“Did you?”

“Yes.”

“Because Lev was only held captive for two days. Two.”

I had to convince myself that he was wrong, but his words rang true. Why didn’t I try harder? Why did I show myself there where every soul knew exactly who I was? Was I trying to break him? To get back at him? What for? “Sid, I know it’s easy to blame me, but I had a right to leave and I had a right to have a life after I did.”

“But you dragged him into it. You didn’t have to. And now look at the mess we’re in.”

“I’m sorry.”

“If you are, come back with me.”

I took a step back. A minute ago, I thought he might jump me, and now he wanted me to go back with him. “What?” I asked, baffled by the question. He must have heard me. I specifically said that I wanted out.

“You’re the only one they still fear.”

“I haven’t been there for months and Kel has taken my place. Where is he? Why isn’t he the one doing anything?”

“Kel? You think any of us listen to Kel?”

It dawned on me that this could be another trap. Maybe Deborah had gone missing because they took her. She was the only one from heaven that I had contact with apart from the interns and no one would share any information with them, nothing important. This was a trap. It must have been. I had been away for too long. Forgotten how Lucifer worked. That last meeting . . . He was tricking me.

I looked behind Sid. Lily’s shadow was gone. I tried to remember if I had seen her holding Peter, but I don’t think I even paid attention to that.

“You need to leave,” I told him.

“Bael, we need you.”

Sid, pleading? Sid did not plead. He did not ask. He only came to reclaim his favors.

It made sense now. Lucifer liked to play with his prey.

It made sense. How little he involved himself with my affairs. I only ever saw Kel. He tricked me into believing that this was going to be easy. Gave me a false sense of safety. I’m supposed to be smarter than this, I thought. But, clearly, I was not. Me breaking Lucifer? My ego certainly had not faltered here on earth.  

“Thank him for me, Sid.” I smiled.

“What?”

“I said, thank him for me.”

“There’s no one to thank. The halfway house is closed because heaven is scared of the damned escaping. The office was closed. Go check for yourself, take your play thing with you if you’re scared that something might happen. Haven’t you wondered why he hasn’t involved himself with the child?”

“I have and now I know.”

The only thing I was worried about was that I had believed his sorry state enough to tell him all about my weak spot. I wanted to show strength here and no run out of the pool house as if it were on fire to search for Lily. It took all my damn strength to not do this.

“I can play dirty too.” I’d move him into a church where they could not touch him even if they tried. Share all my knowledge with the nearest priest. I should have done this to start with. Have Peter become the model altar boy. Know his scripture off by heart. Hover over his shoulder every time he stepped out of the church until the day he died and have him be the only sinless human in existence. His soul already had a life. I would be robbing him of nothing.

Sid’s body began to fade. His image moved as if he had no longer been solid. Parts of him swayed and lost focus. “I’ll be back to talk about this. Someone is calling. Maybe he’s back.”

*****

I sat in the living room. Mother was beside me with Pepper. She cooed, and bounced him on her knee. There was something on her mind. Every time I glanced her way, she had been staring at me. Giving me that squinty disappointing look she liked so much. How little changed.

I held a piece of tissue paper between my fingers, tearing at it nervously as I waited for Bael. That demon wanted him back. I think a part of Bael wanted to go back too. There were times where he seemed profoundly bored with both me and Pepper. As if we were too mundane for him, too human.

And then that call from Mae . . . The way he spoke about her, I couldn’t help but feel a sting of jealousy. I know it is silly; so far I had been nothing to him other than a glorified babysitter. I had no right, no claim.

God, I hated feeling like this. Scared of starting something, scared not to in case he went off searching for something else, scared of losing him, scared of not being enough. Mae didn’t sound like the type who would worry about such things. Maybe that is what he wanted. What he liked.

The last relationship I had was in the sixth grade. Keaton Elders asked me to be his girlfriend afterschool and never spoke to me again. I had no idea how these things worked. We were alone so many times. Surely, if he wanted me, he’d have done something by now.

I could not stomach listening to them any longer. Fearing—again that damn word—that he would say yes, leave and take Pepper with him.

I’d have nothing. Dad would dress me up in proper clothing and make me stand behind Dave when he gave his speeches. Put me on display and thank him for going to such great lengths to fix me. Give him all the credit for my recovery. Saint Dave can even cure mental illness! I could almost hear them shouting it already. They’d be relieved that Bael and Pepper were gone. Wouldn’t even ask me where they’d gone.

“Have you thought about marriage?” mother asked.

I let out a dry laugh. “No.”

“I don’t like that you’re in a relationship with this man—have a child and are running around like some squatter with him. Maybe if you show daddy that you two are serious he will help the two of you settle.”

“He’d have to want me first.”

“Don’t say that!” She put a hand on my knee and tapped it gently. “You’re the catch here, sweets.”

I did not need to look at her to know that she had been scanning the walls of the living room. Counting their wealth in her head. Maybe not, maybe she meant what she said and it had nothing to do with bribing Bael into marriage. I turned to make sure. She was smiling at me. Her hand tightened on my knee. I wanted to cry, to shout and get it all out of my system.

“Don’t be so hard on yourself, Lily. Look how far you’ve come.” Her hand moved up to trace the white patterns of my scars. It wasn’t me. I wanted to tell her. I didn’t do this. “If you’d just noticed how he looks at you.” She shook her head, her eyes distant. “All these years, we’ve all wanted to fix you, to help you, make you better. I look at Bael, and he just wants you.” She tapped my wrist. “He’s good for you.” Her eyes glinted. “I’ll have to thank him sometime.”

We heard footsteps in the hallway and turned to the door. Bael came through, eyes ticking from Pepper to me. He exhaled a heavy breath. Growing almost an inch shorter with it out of his chest.

My hands felt like cotton. I went cold allover. I did not want to hear what he had to say. For once, I wanted to act without fearing his reaction. I stood up; gripping the arm of the couch with all the strength I had in my fingers. “Don’t leave with him . . . or with her. I need you.” My brows furrowed. I couldn’t believe the words, nor could I stop them. “You asked the same of me no long ago, and I stayed with you.” Mother had better been right, because Bael looked like a deer caught in headlights.       

Then, as if I had imagined it, he walked over with unfaltering, confident steps. My heart lurched up and drummed in my throat. He stopped right in front of me and searched my face. I felt paralyzed. Mother and Pepper made no sound at all but I don’t think I would have been able to hear them even if they did because the only part of my body that seemed to function in that moment were my lungs, and barely. He kissed me. Lightly at first and then his hand wrapped around my neck and pushed me closer to him. The hairs of his bear prickled my upper lip and chin as he moved his lips. I released the grip I had on the couch and folded them around his chest, feeling blood rush back into my fingertips.

I felt the sting of his beard long after he let me go. My lips felt hot and swollen. I did not know where to look. Mother and Pepper were no longer in the room. I had not even heard leave. My chest felt broaden, open. I could breathe again.

“We should go away together,” he said.

“You don’t have any papers.”

“I know a guy.” He raised a brow. “A few actually.”

“Of course, you do.”

“Where would we go?”

“Somewhere with sand and a lot of sun.”

“That sounds awful.”

“Alright, somewhere with snow and no sun at all.”"
5hs2vr,22,2016-12-11,Me (21M) with my twin brother (21M) – would it be irreparably weird if the two of us had a threesome with a friend of ours (22M)?,twinbrotherweirdness,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5hs2vr/me_21m_with_my_twin_brother_21m_would_it_be/,"Okay, so throwaway because I am more than aware that this is pretty damn weird. I totally get that people are going to judge but at this point I have no idea where else to find advice. And this is all going to sound weird and unbelievable and soap-opera-y. Trust me, I know.

I’m still wrapping my mind around it, so sorry for the disjointed post.

So my brother Thomas and I have always been pretty close growing up, and we maintain that closeness today. As kids we were almost inseparable; as teenagers we ended up in different classes and separate friend groups, but we always made time to hang out together. I can honestly say he’s the closest friend I’ve got. We’ve always been able to communicate really well, even during disagreements or sibling “fights” and we don’t share all our interests but we do have some shared hobbies that we like to do. Now we’re both going to the same college across the country from our parents (different degrees, though) and we have our separate friend groups but also a couple of friend groups where we hang out together. I just want to say this right off the bat: we’re identical twins. It’s relevant because it probably makes it weirder?

I don’t think any of this so far is weird. Uncommon maybe, identical twins I know (we know 2 other people with identical twins) usually feel overshadowed by the other and from what I see on reddit twins aren’t usually very close, probably less close than normal siblings even? Maybe that’s selection bias, I don’t know.
 
Here’s the thing. One of our friends Cindy (19F) drunkenly mentioned wanting to fuck us both at the same time. I know fucking identical twins is a fantasy for loads of people if movies and anime are anything to go by, but we’d never been propositioned before. The next day she apologized for how inappropriate it was, and how creepy she knew her incestuous fantasy would be outside of her head. We were both present for both of these discussions. This was about two weeks ago.

Truth is, I was kind of considering it (and later I found out my brother was too). It’s kind of been a fantasy of mine since I was a young teen. I never really did anything with that, or discussed it with Thomas; it’s the one thing I never did discuss. I came out to my brother as bi at 16 (and my parents a couple of weeks later). My brother came out to me and then my parents a year after I did – which my parents thought was really funny. Haha identical twins, both bi, haha – they’re accepting folk but that joke got old fast.

Anyway I was always kind of disgusted at myself for having fantasies that concerned my brother, and we live in a pretty damn conservative place (my parents are super chill thankfully,) so I kind of conflated liking men and being gay (because bisexuality wasn’t an option at the time) with being a huge sinner, and that combined with my fantasy just wasn’t a good mix for me, and that combined with my brother also being bi just fucked me up for a while. It took me a long time to stop conflating the two and stop hating myself for being interested in men.

(For the record – the fantasy is fucking someone *with* my brother, not *fucking my brother*. Trust me, I’ve thought about that long and hard about it and the distinction and I definitively don’t want that. The situation is probably still weird/creepy/incestuous but it’s still a relevant distinction I’d like to make, for my own sanity if nothing else.)

Cindy making that comment – and then stepping back from it – kind of brought a lot of that back up for me. The fantasy never left but I’d also stopped thinking about it or doing anything with it and kind of pushed it to the back of my mind. Thomas could tell I was getting kind of distant and made a comment that I was a bit distant right before I came out, too, so I ended up spilling the truth about Cindy’s comment and the fantasy. Thomas was quiet for a really long time before he quietly admitted that he’d also had these fantasies which is fucking crazy. We decided to shelf it so we could both think about it and sleep on it and feel a bit less overwhelmed and talk about it better the day after.

So the day after we talked about it a lot and both made the distinction that we didn’t want to fuck each other, just someone else between the two of us and it was a surreal conversation. Thomas mentioned that Mark (a friend of his that I’ve met but don’t hang out with) actually also asked Thomas for him and me to fuck Mark. As a side note Mark is super nice and casual and positive about sex, always safe, a pretty important/well known person in the LGBT scene here for advocating for safe sex and always looking out for younger gay kids and doing lots of organizing and volunteering and he’s also very good looking. Now we’re kind of seriously considering going through with it and we’re going to talk to Mark in a week or two depending on his internship schedule.

I’m kind of freaking out. On one hand I think if it’s harmless and makes us happy then we should go for it, but at the same time I know this shit is vaguely incestuous at best and morally wrong and really fucked up. Worst case scenario one or both of us realize the fantasy is much better than reality – which we can deal with, communicated about, and wouldn’t break our relationship or anything. But I’m kind of scared that we both really enjoy it and want to do it more or something. I feel like there’s a huge reason why shit like this is frowned upon (to put it lightly), but at the same time we’re both fully consenting adults. I’m just having huge trouble organizing shit in my head. I don’t think my relationship with Thomas will suffer, and Mark is crazy casual and liberal about sex and stuff so he wouldn’t mind if I backed out, no hard feelings, no expectations or whatever.

But I’m still having crazy anxiety and I don’t know why. I don’t know what it is or if/how I should communicate it to Thomas, or if we should just talk to Mark and see where my anxiety is at that point. I don’t even really know what I’m feeling or how. Reddit, I’m looking for advice. How irreparably weird and creepy would it be if I went through with this? Even if my relationship with Thomas doesn’t suffer for it, what the hell happens after this? I know this is all super weird and crazy and I just don't know where to go with this. I can't really ask friends for advice with this. How do I move forward navigating the situation? Not only the sex itself but after, if we go through with it, and how do I deal with the information this gives me?

**tl;dr** my identical twin brother and I are very seriously considering having a threesome with a friend of his. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it. What do?

5hsax4,1,2016-12-11,Me [16 M] with my Parents [50s M/F] who refuse to let me date in High School.,throwaway_or_two,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5hsax4/me_16_m_with_my_parents_50s_mf_who_refuse_to_let/,"First off, new account even though I only lurk on my main.

Hi all, and thanks in advance for any thoughts or help. The basic situation is that I'm a highschooler in the Midwest US, and my parents, mom in particular, are strongly opposed to me dating, kissing girls, or interacting in any sort of exclusive way. My parents won't give any hard answers besides the following-
 a) both say they didn't date at all until college or later, and are thankful they didn't deal with the drama in high school.   
b) they say that dating and being in a relationship is a timesink that can distract me from school, my athletics, and especially from scholarships and acceptances into College
c) my Mom in particular asserts that I'm not mature enough to handle the emotional distraught of a breakup, being cheated on, etc
d) my parents have what I think are outdated views of high school relationships that are really much closer to what was happening in my grade in middle school (ages 11-13 for the nonUS readers). What I mean by this is that, for example, my mom says that only the ""slutty"" girls or people that are obsessive over their image want to date in high school.
e) My mom hasn't explicitly said this- but I later overheard her arguing with my dad (who has a more moderate position but won't go against her) about the risk for pregnancy, etc.

I think a lot of these are valid points, and if we could talk about it openly, that would help. But whenever we discuss this, things tend to get very heated between me and my mom- and crying and anger comes out on both sides. Lots of this is from my going behind my parents back with going on a movie date and ice skating date last year- which I partially regret. Primarily I regret going behind their backs- but I still feel like I should be more assertive with my freedoms as a 16 year old/ high school junior. Following this ""dating"" incident last year, my mom was angry enough to stop cooking my meals and driving me to social places, because I had ""so much free time"". As well, some of their arguments don't hold any merit whatsoever- at my High school last year, the tied valedictorians actually were in a long term committed relationship with each other (all four years of high school!), and the salutatorian was in a gay relationship with another strong student. Lots of my friends are in relationships, and some of them are strongly religious and I'm certain at least want to remain abstinent. It's also worth noting that my school is REALLY liberal, well educated, and white- which might paint me as either more sheltered or as more grounded, I don't know. To counter the grades point, I'm actually currently class ranked #1 (out of ~300) and care about school a LOT. I have an unweighted GPA of 4.0, and have taken a moderately difficult schedule, including 3 ""AP"" classes (weighted more heavily, more homework, and smarter peers). The only responsibility piece I really haven't stepped forward into is a job- I've never been employed. I don't know if I have 10+ hours a week to devote to a part time work, but will definitely work at a fast food place, local butchery, or internship the upcoming summer. 

I'm not really the party sort of person, and can count on one hand the number of people I've kissed (almost never drink or do drugs either), but I feel like my parents would rather not deal with any of the teenage growth whatsoever. Some of this is from my older brother, who is probably asexual? (or possibly just low libido or something). I've never even heard him express any sort of interest in girls even in private, (or boys either). He was SUPER obedient to my parents, more so then me even, and didn't push any boundaries in any areas. 

My girlfriend (wooooo, I feel a rebellious rush of adrenaline like a drug running through my veins just typing that) has much more liberal parents who even let their daughter take her previous boyfriend of one year on a vacation to Canada last year. So I'm confident they won't have any problems with me. 

I feel very guilty for sort of entering the dating pool with the baggage of having predisposed disapproving parents, no matter the girl- and I realize it's really unfair to the girl I'm dating rn to expect her to sneak around my parent's back. 



(as a sidenote, I feel like this post might give the impression that my parents are really conservative- which.... they aren't. Both of my parents are very much pro gay rights, pro choice, pro exploring the world &amp; putting off marriage until later, etc. *side note- both were raised in extremely conservative settings- farmland Ohio and the south, respectably. Maybe this makes their default positions to be more right than otherwise?* They have really reasonable and good advice on most issues, and I trust and love them a lot. Yet on this one thing, nearly all of my friends, my older peers, the internet, media, and parents of my friends seem 100% on board with teenage dating. So I'm feeling really conflicted, and might even go in to my school councilor next week to discuss it with another trusted figure)

the only two girls I've seriously dated have been multi month relationships based on more than physical attraction, and I also find discussions insulting when my parent's stance is that I'll be a horny teenager going after idiotic bimbos.

Sorry for the rambling style of the post, I just wanted to include lots of relevant information to help any readers- thanks for sticking it out. Feel free to ask any clarification questions in the comments, and even advice supporting my parent's position would be appreciated. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My parents really don't want me to interact with any members of the opposite sex for fear of distraction and irresponsibility. I feel like they won't budge and regret going behind their back on this, yet still stand by my position that I should be able to experience new things as a teenager without micromanagement and helicopter parenting.

5hszbq,2,2016-12-11,[TH] A Glimpse Into the Infinite,russo_af,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/5hszbq/th_a_glimpse_into_the_infinite/,"Angelbloom: An Unfortunate Coincidence 


Andrew Richton had for much of his adult life remained detached from what he saw as a veil.  Colors and sound seemed to drift in directionless motion with a never-ending charade.  To his parents’ credit, they did recognize his unique individuality—though putting it into words had proven difficult.  As a poor mining family from western Pennsylvania, they’re own intellectualism was below average.  They sought the word and the power and the glory of their Almighty.  And as a result, Andrew suffered.  It wasn’t until he finally turned sixteen that he was able to escape their prison and start a new life in the rapidly growing business corridor of Northeastern Massachusetts.  He found work as an archivist for a small team of scientists interested in the secrets held within the rock.  There he developed a deep appreciation for the dead, neutral and timeless…  

He and his team of geologists were approaching the deepest portion of the Pinchbeck when they began to hear the moans.  What began as a faint whisper and mistaken for rebounding echoes had now grown into a bone-chilling distress call that set everyone on edge.  The caves were old.  And they hailed from a time of change in prehistory that churned the Earth well.  Secrets once buried in the subterranean caverns of limestone now dared show their face.  And Dr. Richton was eager to jump at the opportunity of discovery.

Aside from the half dozen scientists elected to stand watch at the mouth of the cave, not a single member of the team had strayed very far from Richton’s lead.  Their mission was to analyze and if at all possible collect a rumored deposit of angelbloom said to have developed at the rear of the Pinchbeck—an ancient, forgotten tomb of decrepit limestone and stale clay stalagmites.  On paper, this was just another day for the Richton Group.  After a less-than-ideal meeting with the detached locals of the Tennessee Appalachia though, things began to feel more uptight.

As the team found steady ground once more from yet another jagged cliff face, Richton quickly raised his right arm and formed a fist to indicate halt.  The rest of the group responded naturally and formed a loose, half-circle spread at his flanks.  With their flashlights positioned to provide total three hundred sixty-degree illumination, Richton slowly crept forward.  Before them, foggy crystalline flowers decorate a half-ton boulder, which had been broken into three pieces.  Moving ever closer, Dr. Richton eased at the familiar sight of gypsum.  It sprouted like something organic and live and moving.  Raising his flashlight towards the nucleus of the mineral however, he was suddenly caught off-guard by what he saw.

As if some prehistoric geometric were entrapped in fossilized amber, a prism of innumerable sides did reflect from within the gypsum.  It was every color imaginable and almost seemed to breathe.  Collecting his thoughts, he gestured for the woman to his right and spoke in a whisper.

“If you’d please, Melissa.”  The woman in her early thirties shined her flashlight towards the boulder and joined Richton at his side.  As Richton expected, she quickly faced him.

“Gypsum.”  She declared.  “Appropriately so considering the amount of limestone in here.” 

“Yes, you are very correct, Dr. Wilde.”  Said Richton as he gently guided her flashlight back towards the blooms.  “Now please, offer your second opinion.”

Dr. Wilde squinted at Dr. Richton before slowly turning back towards the stone.  She leaned forward and removed her hard had to allow her curly, soft brown hair fall her to her shoulders.  Andrew knew what she was doing but he didn’t care.  Everything would fall in place soon enough.

As Dr. Wilde carefully took notice of the mineral, she suddenly fixated on the core and observed the same entombed prism.  Each beam of light from her torch returned a brilliant ray of yellow, green and blue.  Her lights lit up and she only barely spoke when she did.

“Andrew...”

Dr. Richton reached Dr. Wilde and placed a hand on her shoulder.  He then nodded slightly before removing her from the immediate vicinity of the rock.  Removing a stone file and hammer and chisel, he got to work on the gypsum.

With each tap, Dr. Wilde and the rest of the group anxiously shifted their position.  The work seemed louder than was perceptively naturally, and after a while the cavern walls even seemed to writhe in discomfort.  Dr. Richton must have been aware of the collective apprehension, and although it was worse he began to chip away faster at petals of the flower.  As he neared the final one though, he paused.  

He had been miles beneath the earth hundreds of times throughout his fifteen-year career.  He had learned to demonstrate a basic air of respect and gratitude towards the places he went.  One of the more appreciated habits was to obstruct only the area of operation.  This meant smell, moisture, residue, and most importantly, sound.  And as Andrew drew his hammer once more he strained to notice exactly how deep his work had gone.

The tool struck hard and smooth.  There was still a substantial racket made.  But it would die quickly and not travel so far.  Dr. Richton quickly returned the pair of instruments to his pack and removed his gloves.  As he carefully produced a utility knife and drew the blade, he took notice of how the prism did in-fact pulse like the a beating heart: rhythmic, steady…alive.  With a quick, gentle flick of his wrist, the prism fell to the middle of his palm.  Immediately, a jolt of blood awareness and blood pressure coursed through his already fidgety body.  He felt what was almost a sense of clarity and beamed as he turned to his group.

“Ladies and gentlemen!  May I present to you what had thought to have been forgotten with time and lost in legend: anglebloom.”

The group’s stern, resolute demeanor quickly melted away and was soon replaced by broad smiles and subtle exclamations of joy.  Turning to Melissa, Dr. Richton spoke softly.

“Tell me Dr. Wilde,” he said, gesturing towards the formation before them, “In the end, was it worth it?”

Carefully removing her hardhat and pack, she neared closer to him.  Then, with a foxlike grin, she drew him in close and the two warmly embraced.  Behind them, the team clapped and cooed.  One of the team, Dr. Taft, removed a bottle of Pol Roger and began to unravel the neck.  Each of the team produced their own flute from their respective packs and came together to form a tight circle.  Dr. Richton, arm-in-arm with Dr. Wilde, spoke in his usual quiet tone.

“I just want to say, that for these past two years I have watched this team learn and grow.  I am honored to not only consider each one of you my friend, but my family as well.”

Dr. Melissa Wilde continued to grasp tightly around Dr. Richton’s waist.  Every now and then she would look to his face and appreciate the man she had come to know and love.  He had been through much and she was sure not everyone dealt his hand could have persevered as he did.  Much of his shoulder-length, light-brown hair covered his face.  But through it she could still make-out the bright, hazel-blue eyes that managed to shine even in the darkest cavern.  In this moment she was perfectly at ease and knew he would only continue to bring her peace…

“Alright, alright!” said Dr. Taft whilst struggling with the bottle of champagne, “I’ve got it.  Ok, here…she…goes—!” 

The cork shot out of the bottle with tremendous speed and rebounded several times against the chamber’s smooth walls.  The POP from when the cork was freed now reverberated throughout the cavern and Dr. Richton knew the sound wave would penetrate the deepest recess.   Melissa now saw the face of the man she loved begin to turn to worry and this put her senses on high alert.  She squeezed him just hard enough to draw his laser-focused attention away from the darkness of the cavern below.  

“What is it, Andrew?” She asked, “Please, tell me.”

As if in response to her inquiry, a distant bone-chilling shriek suddenly came sounding from the cavern’s deepest tunnels and chambers.  It was not dissimilar to the sound of a lioness that had just lost one of her cubs.  Melissa remembered as a girl going on safari with her father and being awoken in the middle of the night not able to put the terrible cry out of her mind.  It was a haunting wail and Melissa felt her blood run cold once again.

“Andrew…” whispered Dr. Taft, “Please, enlighten us.”

Dr. Richton turned to face his team while dread slowly overcame him.  Raising his arm he gestured for total silence and motioned for the group to begin their way back to the surface.  

They each worked like drones programmed for this situation.  As a group they increased their pace and went almost completely silent, each member taking particular care for every next step.  As they began a quick climb up the face of the larger of the two drop-offs they had encountered earlier, each paused to pair up and strap to their partner a small red tracker.  Melissa made sure to secure hers securely to Andrew’s dorsal D ring.  Andrew moved with precision and made sure to get as close to her as possible.

“It has never been my intention to hurt you.” He said.  

Melissa was caught off-guard and her wide-eye expression gave her up easily.  Oddly enough, Andrew smiled briefly and gave an affectionate peck on her cheek before hoisting himself up another three feet above her. She regained her senses after a few seconds and was about to attempt to catch him when the shrill moan came again, this time much nearer.

Dr. Taft and his young assistant Dr. Marcus both managed to reach Andrew and kept a short two-foot birth from his lead.  Taft they removed their flashlights and signaled to him on the wall above that their pursuer was closing fast.  As the rest of the team neared the top of the ledge, Andrew lifted himself up and quickly turned his ear to the cavern below.  Somewhere between the short grunts from his team and the sticking and scraping sound of their gear against the drop-off came what sounded like a feral thing struggling for breath.  Andrew looked towards his group and noticed there would be no escape at their current speed. 

He removed a small, smooth gray device from a compartment on his pack and began rubbing it against the cave wall.  The cylindrical object began to glow orange against the side worked upon the ground.  As the last member of his team finally reached the top, Andrew through the device as far back into the cavern as he could manage.  Within a few seconds there was a large flash of white light that engulfed the entire previous room.  And as silently as it went-off did respond an ear-shattering cry that brought many of Andrew’s team to their knees.  Many cried-out and were noticeably affected by the noise even after it was over.  Melissa made her way to Andrew and the two began to help the others back to their feet.  

“Andrew,” spoke-up Dr. Flynn, the oldest member of the team at sixty-one, “Tell us what we’ve disturbed.”

Andrew looked at him with remorse.  Though Flynn may have looked at old as some of the rocks he’d studied, he was extremely fit for his age.  He had spent more than half his life in caverns like this one.  He was nimble and could predict changes in the cave’s terrain just as well as Andrew.  When the two had met some twelve years ago, Flynn saw Andrew’s potential and realized it was a particularly well-honed talent simply lacking a bit of direction.  And for a while, Flynn took Andrew under his wing.  It wasn’t too long afterward however, that the teacher quickly realized whom it was exactly being taught.  An ever-humbling man, Flynn acknowledged the young man’s ability and gracefully took place at his side.

Andrew was appreciative and had a particular affection for Flynn.  It wasn’t as much a fatherly resemblance as it was more professional than that.  Andrew continued to see Flynn as a teacher and valued his insight.  What he felt now though filled Andrew with a feeling of failure, uncertain of his friend’s future.

He sprinted to the head of the pack and signaled for the group to hold at the base of the next cliff face.  As they gathered in a loose spread and began to adjust their gear for the final climb, Andrew spoke up in a soft, nervous voice.

“The few locals that know this section of Pinchbeck don’t have a name for it.  Those who have had similar experiences are divided on what it may be.  Similarly consistent reports describe what is most probably a large mammalian between 250 and 500 kilograms.” 

The group looked at each other with shock and slight disbelief.  They had accompanied Andrew on numerous expeditions to some of the most remote recesses of the world.  They had made groundbreaking discoveries in the face of the death before.  But they could not accept what he had just described: death did not come like this.  They hesitated and again came the terrible roar.

Andrew gestured for the group forward.  They were nearing the surface again and as they reached the top of the cliff, distant light shone like a beacon.

“Keep together!  And do not lose focus!”  Andrew commanded.  They started to become spread thinner with each step.  Their pursuer’s hefty lunges could now be felt and the cave floor seemed to wretch against its weight.

As they neared the first of the last few collections of jagged boulders separating them from the exit, a blood-curdling scream came from the rear of the group.

“PHILLIP!!!  HELP ME, PHILLIP!!!”

It was Dr. Taft’s young intern, Dr. Craft.  As her still unseen assailant pulled her violently to the ceiling of the cave, her headlamp came loose and fell to the ground.  

“OH GOD, NOOO!!!  HELP ME, SOMEBODY!!!”

Her screams went set against a pitch-black backdrop.  The sound of her clothes tearing became coupled with the thing’s grunts and snarls.  What came next caused Dr. Wilde to pause and hold her stomach.

“AHHHHHH—!!!”

Her cries of pain were abruptly cut short by the sound of the separation of bone.  Her limp body was tossed just far enough towards the light so the group could make out a large puncture wound on the back of her neck.  Whatever the thing was it killed like a cat.  It’s use of the corpse to insight fear in the rest of the group…that was the problem.  It then quickly snatched the girl’s body into the darkness leaving a trail of smeared blood against the rocks.  

Andrew had seen enough.  He quickly gathered the now completely distressed Dr. Taft and motioned for Melissa to make for the exit.  The group sprinted towards the light and within a few minutes was once again aboveground. Exhausted and terrified he still kept his composure and Andrew made sure they kept up their pace for another half kilometer before finally seeking refuge in the thick brush of the Pinchbeck.

Melissa and Flynn were heaving while attempting to keep Dr. Taft as under control as possible.  She looked back at Andrew with a pair of glassy, baby blue eyes.  Andrew had come to adore looking into his wife’s eyes and absorbing all the good that she was.  For eight years he had strove to protect and honor her through his work.  His adventurous spirit didn’t always win her heart.  But she shared a similar love for nature and the beautiful gift’s it sometimes gave to those daring enough to witness all of Earth’s natural wonders.  They were a team and above all else a partnership of two people who cared very deeply for one another.  And now, for the first time, each of them sensed doubt.  And it showed.

“Andrew…” came a course whisper.

Dr. Taft had become unnaturally calm and as he sat upon his bent legs, merely swayed back and forth.  Once again he spoke.

“Andrew, please.”  

Andrew walked slowly over to where Dr. Taft was sitting.  He approached his side but still kept some distance.  He took responsibility for the situation he had put his group in but he would not become subject to physical confrontation.  Dr. Taft was a colleague of eleven years and Andrew knew he had lost his friend’s trust.

“The darkness we have disturbed…” he said softly, “It will haunt me forever.”

Andrew looked to Melissa for any kind of signal as to what to do next.  Her expression made it clear it was now his place to simply listen.  As he turned back to Dr. Taft he jumped slightly as he was met with a pair of beat-red, foreboding eyes.

“You, too, my friend will share in this suffering.”

5htwf0,3,2016-12-11,"New triggers/challenges living in a city. ""Sponsors""?",Brydude92,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/5htwf0/new_triggerschallenges_living_in_a_city_sponsors/,"I just want to start this like I imagine most ""___ Anonymous"" meetings start. If any of you here have been to a ""Sex Addicts"" meeting or anything equivalent I would love to hear what it was like, it's something I aspire to get the courage to start going to. Do people have ""sponsors"" in this subreddit? Just someone to check in with at the end of every day to talk about struggles, avoided temptations, distraction techniques.

I'll front load a TL;DR and write my story below for those who want to read it:

**Goal**

*No relying on porn or other unhealthy sources of arousal for 7 days

*Ultimately break a 6 year stretch without sex (24 years old)

**Motivation**

*Be less disgruntled, stressed, irritable at work

*Be less depressed about my past and current sexual and social failures 

*Ultimately have a relationship with someone I love

**Unique Struggles**

*Living in Manhattan sexual activity is all around me as an unhealthy, envy-inspiring, depressing trigger

*Recently had a relationship end with someone I loved who was restricted from having sex due to her Catholic upbringing. I think about her every day and am struggling moving on. (Relationship ended because her internship in the city ended at the end of the summer. We ended on a good note which is the worst way to end a relationship for two people in love.)

*No social life in the city (I work outside of the city). No friends I see every day to talk about this with

*Worried about loosing sexual drive by giving up on porn

**Story for those who care**

My goal at the moment is to go this week without porn and other unhealthy sources of arousal. The ""other sources"" I am referring to are not new to my life, but they are inescapable now. I moved to Manhattan early this year, which I had always dreamed of doing. In my apartment building there is a girl who is extremely vocal during sex. There are some weeks where every morning and night, this girl and her partner have sex for nearly an hour. Her vocal feedback cannot be escaped in our apartment, it comes through closed windows facing the echoic light well, it comes through the floors. Their sexual activity is expected by now because of how often they do it, but every time it has a drastic effect on me, it is my most feared trigger now. My heart pounds, I hold my breath to hear them better, I tip-toe-run from window to window trying to hear them better. Across the street I can see a different couple having sex with the blinds open and lights on at night. These are both triggers that are a direct result of living in a city, a place that I am the most comfortable living in. But I moved here for ~~sex~~ love, why are these things bothering me so much? Envy, expanded on below.

I have a roommate who I have mentioned these occurrences to, he does not share my feverish enthusiasm for them. He has a healthy sex life, multiple no-strings attached partners over the past year. I have always been fixated on sex, which I am learning at 24 years old, isn't uncommon to a degree, but I tend to overshare and out-perv people when friends start talking about how much sex plays a role in our lives. I started watching porn very early, probably 10 years old. I was molested when I was in 2nd grade. Such a big deal was made out of what happened to me that sex held a lot of importance in my mind growing up, it sounded like the most important thing in the world. Today it is the main motivator in my life. But I haven't had sex for 6 years and counting. 

I have the dating apps, I've gone on about a dozen dates from those apps, Bumble is responsible for my only relationship since I had a girlfriend in high school(The only person I've had sex with). I am confident, attractive, in-shape, comfortably employed. I get frustrated and angry when I see slobs, dickheads, brainless guys dating seemingly respectable girls. I'm sure I'm projecting my negativity in to their relationship to make myself feel right about judging them out of envy. This is anger coming from my envy thinking that that guy gets to have consistent sex with that girl, a goal I've been trying to accomplish since elementary school.

Being critical with myself lead me to accept that I am obsessed, driven, addicted to sex. I think once I can get a handle on that I can break through whatever social obstacle there is to having more opportunities that would lead to a healthy relationship in which sex is still a large part of, but is not the initial and sole motivator of. 

Thanks for reading guys. Feel free to critique my mindset and approach to this addiction. Like I mentioned above, I'd be up to buddying-up with someone to have a daily debrief about the struggles you've overcome throughout the day."
5htyzy,6,2016-12-11,Summer internships in the Netherlands?,themapoe,thenetherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5htyzy/summer_internships_in_the_netherlands/,"Some background: 
I am an electrical engineering student (undergrad) at an American university. I'm in a dual degree program where I study engineering and German, but I'm not very far along in the program, so I don't speak German yet. In America, it is common for students to do a short, 3 month, internship during the summer when there are no classes. Fun fact: If you are an American and you are planning on being in the Netherlands for 90 days or less, you do not need full work/residency permits. You can see where this is going.

I've been having a very difficult time finding any type of short term ""internship"" position in your country, mainly because I'm guessing it's not customary for ya'll to do summer internships. Should I start reaching out to company's HR departments directly? Also, which degree is ""better"" to have in your job market; electrical engineering or computer engineering?

5hu0fm,5,2016-12-11,Accounting Internship Advice,cavanaughnick,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5hu0fm/accounting_internship_advice/,"Hello all, 

So I'm new to Reddit. I'm a senior in college, and for my last semester I also just got hired for an internship at a smaller CPA firm. This particular firm does accounting services, tax prep and planning, QuickBooks consulting, payroll services, management, and IT consulting. I'm really determined to do well at this internship and I want to impress and look professional. My first question is: does anyone know of any apps/programs that it would help me to download? I'm looking for some apps that I can use to help learn a little about accounting/consulting, both concepts (a la accounting for dummies, or some kind of handy pocket reference app for formulas and such) and also news that I should be keeping to date on. Anything that could help me learn QuickBooks would be helpful too. While I've gotten pretty good grades on my accounting and business courses in school, I still feel like I have a lot to learn and I don't feel super confident in my abilities.

My second question is, what should I expect? This is my first real-world job so I'm looking for any kind of advice. I'm looking at getting a messenger bag of sorts to carry notebook, pens, and such (laptop if necessary). Which brings me to my next question about electronics. Will they ask me to use my own laptop? Will they give me a desk/work computer to use? How liberal/strict will they be on customizing the work computer if they provided one at my desk? (Alternate browsers, downloading Pandora/Google Music programs, custom wallpaper, and so on.) I also have a Samsung Note tablet that I'm hoping to use as a productivity device since it has a built-in stylus, so I could take notes and sync them to my phone/computer, not sure how common a work tablet would be at a CPA firm. 

A lot of the stuff I'm wondering about etiquette-wise depends on the specific place you work at, so I'll have to wait until I start working there to gauge a lot of it. 

TL;DR- new accounting intern looking for apps/programs to help gain an edge and look good at the workplace. Also wondering about how accounting internship ls usually work with offices, computers, work tablets, etc. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Like I said, I'm new to both Reddit and (soon) accounting so id love any information, suggestions, or help you guys could give. Thank you!!"
5hu0kh,8,2016-12-11,Computer Science student gift?,snoogl,raspberry_pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/5hu0kh/computer_science_student_gift/,"My cousin is a computer science major at his university. When I asked him how he's doing in his 3rd year and if he's been looking out for internships or anything, he said that's what he wants for Christmas.

Seeing as my job has nothing to do with tech, I was wondering if a raspberry pi would be a good present for him. He could practice some coding or build something following a simple protocol and maybe be able to talk about it or include it on a future interview or resume if he comes up with something good? Are there any comp sci peeps here that would have any insight whether it would be a good idea? I'm afraid it could either be too basic since he's already learning it at the university level, or that he wouldn't initiate and do the research on his own on what projects he would do and it would just collect dust somewhere.

Maybe I could include a booklet of ideas with the gift so he could see a few of the potential projects he could do with it?"

5hu9mj,24,2016-12-11,[lifestyle] Selling belongings I don't need while I prepare for a move has been exceptional.,Dave_the_Pigeon,minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/5hu9mj/lifestyle_selling_belongings_i_dont_need_while_i/,"I'm currently a computer science student studying in Boston MA.  Recently, I negotiated an 8 month internship in Mountain View CA (at a small blockchain startup) and had to figure out a living situation and simplify enough to move to California.  

The bulk of my belongings were winter clothes, which I boxed up and sent home.  However, as a CS student I'd accumulated a lot of things that I used but didn't necessarily need.  Moving into a 4th floor walk up really showed me how much heavy unnecessary stuff I had.  For instance, I had some servers I bought at the MIT Electronics flea market freshman year I was quite fond of along with some desktop hardware.  Although I used these things from time to time, my newest server (a converted Dell C8220 Blade server) is incredibly small and quiet and actually fits in a small duffel bag, so I sold most of my other computing hardware and simplified by purchasing a single 15"" macbook pro.  Yes, it was expensive but it allows me to do everything development and media wise without compromising while relegating all of my compute intensive linux tasks to my personal server and Amazon AWS if needed.  I'm subletting the remaining portion of my lease to a friend in Boston and he'll be using my only other large belongings during the sublet.  Which are a Muji body fit cushion, tuft and needle mattress (no frame) and a single CB2 metal desk and chair.

Bit of a rant, but it's amazing how great it feels to not have a ton of server hardware that I used, but not often enough to hold onto.  Feeling like I'm not weighed down by these things is amazing."

5hujzw,20,2016-12-11,"My Jeep story, the short version. [Long]",jlocher92,Jeep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/5hujzw/my_jeep_story_the_short_version_long/,"Do you remember Christmas morning when you were just a kid and what you've wanted all year was just sitting there in the living room just for you? For me it was a gameboy color. I remember the feeling specifically, it was a mix between excitement, nervousness, and anxiety. 

Later that year I lost my gameboy. Apparently I had hid it from my brothers under the couch. I still don't know why I did that, they had their own gameboys. About a week after losing it, I finally found it while vacuuming and I had that feeling all over again. I completely ditched my chores to catch up on Pokemon because my brothers were so far ahead of me. 

I remember this so specifically because that was the last time I felt something like that until I was 19, freshman year in college four years ago. I was driving a 2012 RAV4 and I remember being so *bored* with it. Don't get me wrong, it was a cool car. Had a 3rd row seat and Bluetooth and stuff. My mom wanted it. She was driving an old 1999 expedition that dad bought back in 2000 so she wanted the Rav. (It's a long and confusing insurance-type story why I had it and she didn't). I didn't want the Rav. 

What I really wanted an old rusty Jeep, but insurance was too high. I begged for one so much and dad told me to save up. I saved all of my Christmas and birthday money plus a part time job at minimum wage for a while and saved up $1,000. Every day there was a yellow wrangler parked outside of my dorm and I'd go outside and just stare at it and pretend it was mine (I hope the owner never saw me do that). 

Dad finally caved and pitched in to buy a 1997 Wrangler SE. It had no carpet, half doors with hard upper doors, the 4 cylinder engine had zero power and it sounded like dads old Ford tractor. The stereo was busted, the speakers were shot, the odometer read 235,000, the hood was held down by a bungee cord, and Mr. Clean's head had more tread than those tires. Let me tell ya, I fucking CRIED when I drove it for the first time, you would've thought I was just given a winning Lottery  ticket. 

My whole world changed that day, and that's an understatement. That old Jeep gave me heaven as much as it gave me hell, and I *LOVED IT* . Trips home from college on the weekends took twice as long, $4/gallon was a bitch, and it damn near broke down on me every other week. 

One day the engine exploded on the highway with 240k miles on the dash and dad drove an hour with the Rav and a rope and towed me all of the way back home 70 miles away. This incident forced me to quit my part time job at the mall. Dad taught me how to swap a motor that week so frequent trips to Autozone led me to apply for a job there for cheaper parts. 

Once we swapped the engine, I listed it on Craigslist as a joke just to see where it would go. Someone made a *generous* offer and dad pushed me to take the money for a better Jeep. I hesitated so much that I started telling the potential buyer *everything* that was wrong with it. He didn't give a shit, so that sale went through and the next day I bought the next Jeep I found on Craigslist. A 2002 Wrangler X Apex edition with 100,000 miles.

I worked at the Autozone closest to campus for two years until I finally got my first engineering internship and I started making real money. With this, I had some BIG plans for the jeep. First things first, I needed some maintenance. I took it to a shop I became familiar with through Autozone and got $1,200 worth of shit done in upkeep and maintenance. 

I picked up the Jeep two weeks later and totaled it on my way home. Some lady had ran a red light and there were no witnesses, so she said I ran the red. So her insurance only forked up a couple of grand and I had two choices. Take the little money and find another jeep, or fork up the rest of the money to fix *my* jeep. After a few days of thinking, I called the shop it was towed to and told them to just fix it. That was the very last of my internship money, $13,000 down the toilet. 

This led me to decide to get the fuck out of that rotten city and head back home to go to a university there, where I acquired my second internship and met the girl of my dreams. I still have that 02 TJ as my daily, I'm fixing to graduate soon, and I've been doing a little ring shopping. The TJ still breaks down sometimes, but I'll never sell this one. 

My Jeeps have literally driven me to success and I can never thank you enough, Dad. "
5hv8e8,0,2016-12-12,Current SCM student here looking for advice for internships over the summer.,Aconley15,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/5hv8e8/current_scm_student_here_looking_for_advice_for/,"Hey guys. This is my first time visiting this subreddit so please forgive me if I am not following rules correctly. The rules page won't load on my phone.

Anyway, I am currently a sophomore in college majoring in SCM. I've had previous summer jobs but I would really like to get my foot in the door this summer to learn the basics of SCM. I've come across two opportunities for internships this summer that I think could help me achieve my goals and teach me the ins and outs. The first one is for a very small local company that specializes in technology for businesses and residential areas. The company does work ranging from simple in home tv wall mounts, internet, computer issues etc. and also business tech such as registers, server installs, and cameras. The company has expanded rapidly the past year with jobs opening up in neighboring states for businesses such as big lots, Taco Bell, and department stores. I've grown relatively close with the CEO of the company and he has told me that he is completely over extended. His inventory is a mess (not having the right tools/parts for jobs), he also wants to drive his prices down with his distributors but simply does not have the time as he also is one of the main guys in the field. I believe that I could really help get his company organized and run more efficiently. I'm assuming that I would have a lot of responsibility on my shoulders without a second line manager guiding me through tasks. This is actually one of the main reasons I would like to take the job so I can get as much hands on learning as possible. 

As for the second possible internship, my family is very good friends with a guy who is pretty high up in a large part distribution company. He told me that if I wanted an internship he would have one waiting for me. The benefit would be mainly having a well known company on my resume, however I am worried I would be stuck on a line job for the summer and wouldn't learn as much as I would with the first job. I'm completely fine with putting in hard work, but I would like to gain as much experience as possible.

I'm looking for advice as to which path I should take or if there's another department or business sector I should look into so I can get my resume built up early and gain valuable experience along the way. "

5hvf19,11,2016-12-12,i feel like ive wasted my entire undergrad,[deleted],uAlberta,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/5hvf19/i_feel_like_ive_wasted_my_entire_undergrad/,"throw away account bc reasons

3rd year BA psych student here, recently ive been feeling like ive wasted by entire 3 years i spent here. 

i have a few chronic mental illnesses, and during my second year i had a big crisis because of that + family issues. I wanted to apply for honors in my degree but i was too busy with cleaning shit up from said crisis and missed the time to apply (and i doubt i wouldve gotten in anyway, as my second semester grades were pretty shitty because of it), and didn't get any chances to get a summer internship/research experience either because I was in hospital for majority of summer. 

I also feel that I've taken several wrong courses last year, so im planning on taking right pre-req courses for coming spring/summer, but im afraid that by the time im done with them there won't be a space for classes that i want to take in fall/winter and would have to wait another year to take them

now i'm halfway through my third year without really having accomplished anything and it seems all i got are the consequences of bad life choices i made so far. most of my ""experiences"" aren't even related to my subject matter, as they're in fields such as graphic and game design - which i immensely enjoyed, but i feel like they won't be considered valuable when applying to grad school or jobs in my field. to make up for the loss ive been volunteering a lot this semester, and i'm participating in a research this coming semester and planning to do more for next year. but im so afraid that at the end i will have accomplished nothing.

i want to go to grad school, but it seems that they don't even consider students who aren't in honors or specialization, and my gpa isn't that great either (~3.5).   in fact, searching up different grad schools and looking at their admission requirements and stuff actually make me have meltdowns. I try so hard in every course, but sometimes i feel like im just too dumb for any of them. I was thinking of applying for internship, but my doctor thinks it's a bad idea since i'm ""unstable"" and she thinks that my conditions will get worse under work stress. 

i just feel like ive lost a big portion of my life to my illnesses and while i know that they were inevitable at the time, i'm still bitter and angry at myself for not pushing myself harder. idk, i guess im just ranting bc i don't really have anyone to talk to about this. i tried to go to school counseling service but the person at the reception was pretty rude and i had to leave bc i felt like i was going to have a panic attack. 

anyway if you have stories similar to mine or have any advice, i welcome them"
5hw1x4,35,2016-12-12,How I Started Working For Myself In Marketing/Started My Own Agency [NO LINKS],Aussie_Golfer,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/5hw1x4/how_i_started_working_for_myself_in/,"So first of all I want to address that I am keeping this all ""in-house"" on Reddit, no links, no external videos etc. This goes back to my post a couple of days ago, about bringing you guys value. I don't want to mislead you into clicking a link for my own gain.


Disclaimer: I am not a marketing guru, I don't guarantee businesses 4000000% ROI and all that bullshit. I am about keeping it real, I produce some good results for my clients, but we are talking nothing beyond 170% ROI generally. I have had some freak campaigns that have hit 400% upwards. But that is it. I am just a guy who is passionate about marketing and loves it, and wants to pass that onto my clients and other marketers. 


I also want any of you that have questions to comment or feel free to message. Like I said, this is about bringing value to this community.


So here is my little story as to how I have started my own business in marketing. 


**1) Get experience at an agency or a company**


I see so many questions about how to get a job in marketing, even just intern work or entry-level jobs. You need to show these people value and you need to ""hustle"" a little bit as well. Think outside the box when applying for marketing jobs. Use your social media profiles as your resume, target an ad towards an employer, create a landing page explain why it would be effective, audit their work and explain how you can bring value to them. That is just a few ideas off the top of my head.


If you can get work at an agency or company this will help build a platform to propel your own freelance career/business. It gives you a great understanding of how everything works, especially from a client perspective if you get the chance to work at an agency. 


Get into the smallest agency or company that is offering a marketing job. You will get so much more experience from this.


**2) Can't get work experience? Don't fret**


Study up, whether that's through formal education or self taught from online. Then start approaching small companies like start ups and mom and pop shops and offer your services for free to start building some case studies and building clients and testimonials. You could also offer it in exchange for goods or services of theirs, this adds more value to what you are doing. 


Initially I approached cycling start ups. I am a cyclist so this meant I was passionate about what they were offering consumer and I did it in exchange for products, which was great for me as well. But that is what really propelled me initially. 


**3) Work Hours aren’t just 9-5**


When I first started I was working 7am-9am on my own gig, then working 9-5. I got home and from about 6pm-11pm I would grind away again. Now I am not saying you have to do those hours, you need to find what works for you. If only doing an extra 2 hours a day works for you, then do that. We all operate differently. You don’t want to ruin friendships, relationships or mentally ruin yourself. It needs to be sustainable. Unless you have won the lottery you will need to put in some hard yards. 

**4) Clients, you need them. They don’t need you**


When you first start out, you are a nobody to potential clients. They won’t be approaching you, you need to approach them. Emailing and cold calling needs to be left behind I BELIEVE initially. Approach these people where there attention is.


I got most of my clients from sending them Instagram DMs….. I got an extremely high response rate (roughly 20%). Now you may want to approach potential clients by email or phone, but the way I see it. You need to go where the noise isn’t. I found that Instagram DMs there wasn’t a lot of noise there for these companies so I was likely to at least get a response.


I got my first 6 clients through this. 3 working for free, 3 I did for exchange of goods and some money.


**5) Cool you have done some client work now**


Now that you have done some client work, you can start to build a portfolio and case studies. This is essential in being able to get some clients and work towards retainers. 


Build 2-3 good case studies on what you did for some clients, make it visual (I find this very important). I recently landed a $4000 a month retainer simply from a case study that took me 2 hours to make. They were impressed with the work I have done for this other client and now I ahve a 6 month contract with them. 6x$4000 = $24,000 from 2 hours of work. I charge my work out at $100/hr. So for $200 of my time I have managed to land $24,000 in new business so far. 


With these case studies/portfolio and testimonials you can now approach bigger companies and ask for them to give you a chance.


**6) ALWAYS put the client first**


I live by this with my business, caring is the most important thing you can do. If you want to be successful (at anything) I truly believe that you need to care. It can’t be all about the money and flashy lifestyle. Care about your clients and they will care for you.


I will give a perfect example how this reap you MASSIVE ROI. One of medium clients was being a pain in the ass. But I still cared, they pushed me as far as they could. But I went above and beyond for them. Got some great results and made them extremely happy with what I did for them as a person and from a customer service perspective. Turns out he knows a region GM for Pandora radio, and he referred me to him to assist them with some social woes they were having.


**7) Larger companies
**

The bigger the company the more they want from you in terms proposals and docs before they will sign a contract with you. You will need to get 2-3 previous clients that would be prepared to provide a written or verbal testimonial/reference for you. As this will be a requirement sometimes. So have that in your arsenal in case you need it.


Larger companies are all about smokes and lights, Facebook marketing campaigns may seem plain and simple, but you need to dress it up for them or else they won’t be interested. 


**8) Time**


Once you have a number of clients on board, your time is thin. You only have so much in a day, you will need to start rescuing some of it back. 


Hopefully one you are 10 clients deep, you should have money you can invest back into the business. Outsource work and finds way to automate tasks. 


For example, I now outsource all my Facebook Ad creation and my Reporting is all automated. Requires an hour of setup in most cases and generates and sends reports weekly, monthly or bi-weekly. 


This frees up more time for me to go after new business and tend to meetings, conference calls and all that stuff….


**9) All the stuff you didn’t think about**


I thought working for myself would be awesome, that's when I was just thinking about all the marketing work (I LOVE THIS SHIT). 


But what about all the other bits and pieces like bookkeeping/accounting(this especially). You also need to manage other employees or contractors. Once you start to grow you may want to look at office space or something similar. If you are working within your country, travel is another big thing you need to account for.


**10) Enjoy it or get out.**


Now, not all of us are built to do run our own business. Some of us are better equipped to be awesome Marketing managers, or CMOs in life. You need to assess what is right for you. Some people function and work amazingly when there is structure for them, not when they have to create that structure. 


That is for you to work out.


TL;DR: DO SHIT YOU LOVE AND BRING VALUE TO OTHERS


ANY QUESTIONS, and I mean ANYTHING. Please leave it below or feel free to message me.

5hwkkn,2,2016-12-12,I Just Need to Vent,sadclod,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/5hwkkn/i_just_need_to_vent/,"I've had a lot weighing on my mind recently and I need to get it out.  
  
I'm an unmedicated college student. I was diagnosed when I tried to get help with depression at my school's clinic, but once they realized it was more than that, they couldn't help me. I live in a state where resources do not exist unless you're disabled.  
I have repeatedly told my mother about my diagnosis as well as my depression and she ignores me. I don't get any financial assistance from my parents at all for anything. I'm 7k more in debt per semester. I tried to pay out of pocket for a while, but I quickly went broke.  
  
Obviously, since I am unmedicated this illness really affects my life. My relationships are horrendous because my friends don't know what to do with me. There have been three or four times when they're debated calling 911 on me because of how suicidal I was, but I begged them not to because I wouldn't be able to afford it. This leads my friends to not want to be around me which only increases my depression. It's understandable.  
My grades are also affected. I have terrible memory loss for whatever reason, so I have a problem recalling terms and even words. I made two A minuses this semester because there were more than a couple days where I was too depressed to get out of bed.  
  
I'm incredibly unhappy because I hate my line of work. I work in politics because it's the only thing I have experience with and as an English major, I'm not sure that I can start over. I always wanted to work in film and television, but those internships are never paid. I'm also a writer, but with politics I never have time to write. It feels like a prison.  
Even if I stay in politics, I have to do campaign work forever because considering I'm unmedicated and don't see any doctors, I wouldn't pass the character and fitness portion of the bar exam. I'm also generally not mentally healthy enough for law school.  
  
I'm so unhappy, scared, and alone. I don't see how it's going to get better. My life is at a dead end and I can't get help. Unfortunately, I realize it's probably going to end in a situation where I'm hospitalized and I'm anxious and scared. I don't know. I'm in this fight alone and feels like it's never going to get better. I just needed to get this off my chest. It's almost 8 AM and I haven't slept."

I have a fucking desk in the middle of the building and constantly have people walking by my fucking computer and or sneaking up on me. I've given up on trying to move forward here. I've been an intern for two years and they show no signs of wanting to keep me. I constantly have to deal with these women talking loudly to each other in a blissful baby voice while trying to get some fucking work done. They either pile on way too much work on me or they don't give me enough work and then get mad when I finish it early. This bitch makes me do the most tedious time consuming tasks and never says thank you. She is not at all directly rude to me she always has this simpleminded bliss to her, but that honesty makes me even angrier. It's so frustrating that I have not gotten a raise or any advancement. I have been looking for a new job and even been to some interviews but all with no success. Whenever we have a stupid company event, I can pretty much never go because of school. But the annoying thing is they will ask me over and over if I'm going (when I already said no) and then they want an explanation. I wish I could have some more success"

However, next year is getting a little interesting.  I've messed around on the IRS Form 1040, and want to make sure that I've calculated my 2017 tax burden right so I can fix my withholding. Here are my rough numbers, 

* Income (line 22): 36,600 
* Adjusted Gross Income (Line 37/38): 36,000 (no big change here)
* Standard deduction + exceptions (Lines 40+42): 12,600+(2x4,050)
* Taxable Income (Line 43): 15,900
* Tax (Line 44, from 1040 tax tables): 1593

However, my wife doesn't work and attends school full time, so we would apply for the American Opportunity Tax Credit max @ 2500. This would reduce our tax burden to 0, and get a refund of 1000 from the AOTC.  So my W-4 withholding should be high next year (right now its at 7) to account for that tax credit and refund?  I want to avoid any under-withholding penalties and this seems to be the best way to optimize my paycheck every month.

Also, if my wife gets a summer internship, would I just add her (estimated or actual) income at the top of the 1040 and work through it to calculate our new tax burden, and figure out withholding her/us?  

Anyway, thanks for listening to my ramblings. "
5hy8z9,3,2016-12-12,Concerned about admissions for a PhD program.,GeneBean401,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/5hy8z9/concerned_about_admissions_for_a_phd_program/,"I am in my sophomore year (third semester) of college majoring in molecular/cell biology. I have always had plans of getting a PhD, as I really enjoy research. I joined my schools BUILD program this semester, which pays me to do research in my mentors lab. The program also sets me up with a summer internship working in a lab of my choice at an R1 school. I say this because I know research experience is important for admissions into a PhD program, but what I am concerned about is my GPA.

Ill just say this past semester a lot happened in my life and I suffered from depression which prevented me from focusing fully on my course work. Instead of dropping out of my more difficult classes I decided to stick with them. As a result, I will most likely end the semester with a C in organic chemistry 1 and a possible C or lower grade in physics. 

I have overcome my depression and am looking forward to a better semester next year, but I would like to know how bad this will effect my admissions into a program. Also any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated. "

I am a junior working towards my BS in health policy &amp; administration. I enjoy the classes and know it's the field for me but I want to narrow down what career path I will take. I have been looking at healthcare compliance and it looks like it would match my strengths, but it's unclear what the career path is to get there.

Are there even any entry level jobs in compliance? It LOOKS like you can work as an associate with a bachelors degree but I'm still not sure. I'm planning on getting a MPH in the future but as of right now I need to figure out what I can do with a bachelors.

Is the field particularly competitive to break into?

What can an undergrad do to strengthen their resume and get into a compliance position?

Are there any compliance-specific internships out there that you know of? I have been searching and for undergrad I only ever see general administration.

Are there any related entry level healthcare admin fields you think I should like into?

Edit: Bonus question: If you are working in healthcare compliance, what do your days look like and what has been your career path?

Any advice?

It would be really great to hear back from people working in compliance but anyone with insight will do. Thanks so much!"

5hynba,3,2016-12-12,Car rental nightmare. What are my options?,_please_help9876,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5hynba/car_rental_nightmare_what_are_my_options/,"Over the summer I had an internship for which I needed a vehicle because I couldn't find housing a reasonable distance from the company. Before the internship began I made a reservation with some horrible company (Avis) and used the company's discount code. 

I was told by the agent making the reservation that the discount code would waive underage fees. The agent told me the rental for two months would cost about $2k. When the agent handed me a printed out quote, it was charging me $4k, instead. The agent said something was wrong with the system, but that he couldn't do anything and suggested I call customer service. 

I did as instructed and customer service said that the source of the discrepancy was the underage fee. They removed that and sent me an updated reservation. I asked to make sure that I would not be charged the underage fee, and the customer service representative confirmed.

Later, when I arrived at the rental desk to pick up the car,  the agents at the desk again confirmed that I was not being charged an underage fee. There was some confusion on the price and I again heard a number around $4k. However, by the end, I was being charged $2k and again confirmed with the agent that I wasn't being charged an underage fee. 

I later realized that I was charged $2k because the rental was split into separate 30 day periods and the $2k was for only one period. Frustrated that Avis was attempting to charge me $2k more than we agreed upon, I attempted to call Avis. The national phone line informed me that I had to deal with the local branch from where I had picked up the car. 

I tried calling the local branch literally dozens of times with no one (not even a machine) answering the phone; after a minute or two of ringing,  the line would disconnect. Eventually, I was able to speak with an agent who told me that I needed to talk to a particular manager. I left my number with the understanding that the manager would call me when he got in. He never did.

I waited a week before attempting this process again. Each time, I had to call at least ten times before I was able to speak with anyone. The manager I needed to talk to was somehow never there. 

After going through this process dozens of times over the course of a month, I decided I would again attempt to deal with the company at the national level. After several conversations, I eventually talked with someone who said that they would refund me the underage fee. All I had to do was submit (to a certain email address) documentation showing the total amount I was charged and the amount I was told I would be charged. 

Of course, I complied. I received an automated email saying that I should expect a reply within 10 days. I waited. I never received a reply. I sent another email asking what had happened. Thus began an email exchange in which every email from Avis was sent at least 5 business days later than it was received. At the end of this email exchange, it became clear that Avis had no intention of issuing a refund.

Frustrated with the long delays in the email, I tried calling the customer service line again. I talked to someone who again said this matter had to be dealt with at the local level. I called the local branch literally one hundred times and was unable to talk to anyone. 

Finally fed up, I disputed the charge on my credit card and explained the situation to the credit card company. The credit card company ruled in my favour and performed the charge back.

Now, I've received a bill from Avis demanding the disputed amount. Perhaps I should have realized this was possible after a chargeback, but I must say it seems like a chargeback offers no protection, since the company can pursue debt collection afterwards. 

The bill includes instructions on how to dispute the charge, and I intend to follow through with these. I expect this will be unsuccessful, though. If so, what are my options? Obviously I can pay the amount, but I would much prefer not to, both on principle of being lied to and because $2k is fair amount of money to me. 

I apologize for the long story, but I wanted to give lots of details in case any of them are relevant. 


**TL;DR:** Overcharged $2k and jerked around for months by car rental company. Successfully pursued dispute with CC company. Car rental company is now trying to collect disputed amount. What can I do?"

Prior to the internship I was dead set on getting a Phd or trying to get a masters and work in public policy but news-writing really spoke to me. 

During college I worked at a student publication producing video for almost a year, and I copy-edited a doctoral dissertation.

Since then I've been pursuing entry-level positions and internships with companies in New York. I've come close on a few of them, getting to the final stage of the process on one before they went with a candidate that was already in NY.

In the meantime, as I work part-time at a coffeeshop while living with parents, I feel that with each passing day I'm becoming less and less tenable for any kind of professional journalism work. 

Is this a lost cause? Any suggestions on how I might be able to stand a better chance of getting a position in online editorial? "

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment.
Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5i3h7z,3,2016-12-13,Joining the club,Shakyor,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5i3h7z/joining_the_club/,"So, I feel like I just started a process and just want to share my enthusiasm. I hope that is warrented. 

I originially started medical school and I was doing fine. However, I was extremly unhappy since I just never felt I could live up to it in the hospital. I never felt I could give the patients what I wanted for them to have. It destroyed me inside. 

So I made the jump to computer science. I worked very hard, did lots of internship and side practices and am now finishing my thesis before average time. 

I had lots of job interviews and recieved an offer from every single one. I was confronted with salaries about 30-40% above what would be expected from a computer science grad in germany. So much in fact that I felt obligated to read up on personal finance.

Originally I thought it would be tedious, but necessary. First i read up on the tax situation in germany, and common ways to save money. That part did indeed suck, but I feel like i learned some important adult skill. Then came real personal finance. And so far I am loving it. I was introduced to alot of concepts which felt very cool to me. 

I always did not care much for material possesions. So I always said money is not important to me. However, I realized that it is, because it will enable me to not worry about material things. I dont need to go for what money can buy, but the freedom in can enable. 

So i read up alot. My current situation is that I will work for half a year and then my girlfriend and me will go to scotland for our masters. It is expensive, but only a year compared to two in germany. And an experience we really want to have in our life. However, that means that I will not feel comfortable investing my savings long term right know, because I might end up really needing them abroad. So its better kept as short term savings. But this community enabled me to form these thougts.

Although it still sucks, because I know all these knew stuff like index funds and stuff I wanna start getting experiences with. But patience is a virtue after all.

I already notice that I think differently about stuff. Cooking at Home once now, can be going out for food 4 times in 40 years. Or that often it is best to really sit down and calculate some things. For example, when its time for my girlfriend and me to settle down, we sure as hell will look at a house we could buy and a place we could rent happily, and calculate the financial realities of it. 

Also when I was offered an expensive company car as part of the salary, I respectfully declined and asked for cash instead. However, I think I will leave myself more budget for travel, visiting friends out of town and going for dining out and theater and stuff than other people here. Its still a choice and these are some things I want to have for all of my live, even if it takes a few more years for FI. Especially travel is something I want to do every year and also its different when you are younger. 


Anyway, was a bit of a rumbling. But I feel happy and empowered and wanted to share this with you guys :)

5i4cqb,6,2016-12-13,Fantastic Four MCU idea,abc2k,Marvel_Movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel_Movies/comments/5i4cqb/fantastic_four_mcu_idea/,"Feedback would be greatly appreciated
It's long so thanks for reading. 

So everything starts off with the end credits for spiderman homecoming. 
You see a crowd cheering and screaming with someone speaking. The speaker says things like Today dawns a new beginning. We shall lead the world in our conquest...stuff like that. Eventually the dude ends saying ""All shall feel the might that is Doom"", and cuts to showing Doom putting 1 fist to the air while everyone cheers....

Movie starts here
It maybe called Fantastic Four, but they should push for Dr. Doom to be the main focal point of the movie. simple plot points
starts off with flashback of Doom's childhood of him holding valeria's hands at his mother's funeral. Borris rides on horseback coming and telling Doom and his father the King's men are coming. Doom and his father begin fleeing from Latverian army. His Father gives him a green blanket, and he flees while his dad runs back to fight of the guards

flash forward to the future (around the beginning of Iron Man 1). This is shown on a television stating Tony Stark had been kidnapped. Reed says if only Stark would use his genius to progress science rather than create war weapons, which leads to a debate between Doom and Reed. Doom and Reed work for Franklin Storm on a secret mission to study cosmic rays that appear near earth. Franklin Storm knows something is not right with shield and is able to keep the secret mission from shield.

Doom is fascinated by magic and attempts to recreate the Tesseract he has read about in mythological stories. He creates something like it, but Reed tells him his equations are off. Doom doesn't take Reed serious. He turns on his device, and a portal opens showing Asgard. Doom attempts to walk through it but his device explodes causing him to be flung towards the wall. He runs out in shame.

On his way home Reed is stopped by 4 guys telling him give them his wallet. Reed tries to run, but they tackle him down and beat him up. Ben Grim Yells for them to stop. They tell Ben Grim they aren't on Yancy Street, and for the old man to get lost. Ben takes them all out. Ben helps up Reed and tells him he was never much of a fighter. Ben has been there protecting Reed from the tough streets they grew up in since they were children.

Reed lives with Ben Grimm. Ben is depressed as his life is going no where. Reed asks Ben if he would like to go to space. Ben doesn't think Franklin Storm will let Ben go along, but Reed says he will tell Franklin Storm that Ben is a pilot. Ben says that wont work because Ben is a forklift driver. Reed feels he owes Ben big time for being there for him since they were kids, and Reed tells Ben to just play along. Reed talks to Franklin Storm but he says no. Doom backs Reed and pushes for Storm to allow Ben to go with them. Franklin finally caves in and lets Ben go. Doom tells Reed, Reed owes him a favor.

They are introduced to Johnny and Sue storm, and Sue is excited to meet Doom, as she has read his work on wormholes. Reed introduces himself to Sue and tells her about his work with anti-matter, but she doesn't know who he is , and thinks he is Doom's intern

Johnny sneaks into he ship and hides in a crate as he also wants to go to space. The crew eventually come in later. Ben puts a picture of Captain America up on the walls, to which Doom mocks him for believing in the lies of the tale of Captain America. Ben moves towards Doom, but is stopped by Reed. They fly up to space and pass by the moon. Ben tells Doom he saw a video on the internet about super-powered humans living on the blue area of the moon. Doom mocks Ben again.

They eventually reach the cosmic radiation. Reed is shocked at how much energy it is giving off. Johnny jumps out of the crate, and Sue berates him. Franklin Storm tells them to continue the mission even though Johnny is there. Doom tells Reed he is going to now use the favor Reed owes him. Doom pulls out his Tesseract replica, and tells Reed to fly the ship as close as he can to the Cosmic Field. Franklin Storm tells them not to do it. Doom turns on his device anyways. The blue light of the replica begins to flicker violently before turning green(space stone turning into time stone). The cosmic field engulfs the ship, and communication is lost. Franklin Storm, thinking both of his kids died, separates himself from the world, and moves to the forests.

The ship reappears in the future. Around the time of the most recent movie released by marvel studios (Infinity War Part 1 or captain marvel maybe). Johnny is on fire, Ben has turned to rock, Reed's body is stretching all around, Sue disappears and reappears, and Doom feels as though his face is being burnt. They crash land on an abandoned town in Latveria. Doom runs out hiding his face with his father's blanket. Doom runs into one of the houses and finds bandages and wraps it around his head completely covering it. He finds rope to tie his father's blanket around his shoulders. 

The crew crash on Latveria. They all get out of the ship and are unsure where they are. They are shocked at how Ben looks. Only Doom knows where they are, but he ran off. Moloids being to come out of the ground. Ben knows they are not friendly, and rushes them. Ben fights them and is able to take out a lot of Moloids, but they keep coming. Reed grabs Sue and Johnny and pulls them all on top of a truck. Johnny says he would rather fight, and focuses on releasing his power. He flames on and goes to help Ben. Sue tells Reed to fight, but Reed says he isn't much of a fighter. A moloid comes towards them and Reed is able to stretch a gigantic fist and knock the Moloid out. Reed goes and helps Ben and Johnny, and Sue protects them with shields. Doom, eventually comes out and creates a ball of energy which sends energy all around hitting all the moloids. They all retreat.

Johnny flies around before landing. He picks up an old newspaper showing Captain America and Tony Stark after they have defeated the Chitauri. The headline reads Tony Stark and the Avengers save New York from aliens. Ben says the world has gotten really weird since they have been gone. Reed sees the title of the newspaper as the Hassenstadt Tribune. Reed asks if this was the Capital of Doom's home country Latveria, and Doom says it is. Johnny says he's never heard of Latveria, and Doom replies that Latverians are doing their jobs then. 

The crew begin to walk together in hopes of find someone to help them out. Johnny starts rambling on about what to name the group. He names a few things before saying the Fantastic 5. Ben tells him to stop as all those names are cliche nonsesne. The Latverian army helicoptors arrive where they are. Soldiers come out and point all their guns at them. Doom teleports away and leaves the group. Johnny jokes that the Fantastic 5 just became the Fantstic 4.

The army take the Fantastic 4 with them. Doom goes back to his old home. His house is in ruins with trash everywhere. Doom goes into the shed outside. Doom tries his best to focus all his mind on the door. Doom puts his hands out and spins them in a circular motion towards the door. A secret door of magic opens up leading to Doom's mother's old hideout. Doom goes in to find his father's old technology, and his mother's magic items. He finds a wooden mask that belonged to his mother. Doom puts it on.  Doom finds his mother's diary and reads it.

Doom uses his mother's writing to create a seal of a red hexagram shape of light on the ground. Doom steps on top of the hexagram and is transported the realm of Mephisto. Doom finds Mephisto, and tells Mephisto to free his mother's soul. Mephisto tells Doom he should be thankful for Mephisto's service, as it is the reason Doom turned out the way he was. Doom tells Mephisto that Mephisto lied to his mother on the deal. Doom's mother was given absolute control of her full magical powers, but also gave her a cancer that spread throughout her body eventually killing her. Mephisto laughs, and says there is always a catch to his deals. Doom sends hundreds of beams of energy towards Mephisto, but he deflects all of them. Mephisto strikes Doom down with one strike. Mephisto tells Doom he pities Doom, and tells him Doom he will give Doom freedom once a year to come to Mephisto's realm and fight him. If doom wins, then Mephisto will free Doom's mother's soul. Doom gets sent flying out of the realm, and lands on the ground outside the shed. Doom goes back into the shed, and creates his armor and turns his mother's wooden mask into a metal mask. Doom's quest for ultimate power had now been realized.

Cut back to the F4. The Latverian Army General interrogate them asking if they are Avengers. One of the soldiers says they apparently call themselves the Fantastic Four, and Ben tells them they never agreed to that. The General tells them to imprison them, as they are Americans, and no outsiders are welcome in Latveria. Reed goes on to say he knows what might be causing the moloids to spring up.  The general listens. Reed pulls out a pocket size device, and turns it on. The device turns into Herbie. Reed tells Herbie to check for any strange frequencies that maybe causing interference. Herbie scans and says there are really low frequency sound waves coming from underneath the city. Reed then goes on to tell them of Harvey Elder otherwise known as the Mole Man for his peculiar appearance. Reed tells them he can help them with the Moloid Infestation if they help the F4 go home. They army agree, but tell the F4 they can't tell anyone of Latveria. They all agree.

Valeria eventually finds Doom at Doom's old residence. She checks up on the house every once in a while to make sure the shed doesn't get destroyed. She finds a badly injured Doom working on doombots outside the shed. Doom is happy to see her. She tells Doom about the Moloids. Doom tells her he will save Latveria, and she doesn't believe him, as he is severely injured. Doom goes through his mother's spells trying to find a spell which would heal his wounds. It takes him a few days but eventually he finds one, and heals himself. He puts his armor on with Valeria's help, and turns his  Doombots and other robots on. Valeria tells Doom Hassenstadt is the only remaining city standing, and everyone in Latveria is there. 

Eventually Reed is able to create a device using his and Doom's work on Anti-Matter and Wormholes. The device is able to send anything within it's path to the negative zone. The F4 go down underground to find the Mole Man. Eventually they find the Mole Man. The Mole Man is using his staff to send low frequency sound waves out and causing the mole people to attack Latveria. The Mole Man turns it on to max power, Moloids begin to spring Hassenstadt. The Latverian Army attempts to defend thier city. Mole Man summons Giganto to fight off the F4. 

Most of the Latverian army is defeated by the moloids. The civilian men of Latveria realize they are the last hope, and pick up whatever weapons they have. They take to the streets to begin battle. Borris leads the charge. A moloid attacks Borris and is about to kill him before Doom arrives crashing on the streets and sending moloids flying back. Doom picks up Borris who realizes who Doom is with an instant. Doom teleports to all the Moloids and begins to fight them. There are thousands of moloids around Doom. Doom is able to fight them all off using energy blasts, magic, and his various missiles, grenades, and other weaponry, but they come at him one after another. Borris tells the men that Doom is the one who they all saw in their dreams. The one who will save latveria. All the men get riled up and they all attack the moloids. Doom summons his robots to come to aid. 

Eventually the F4 are able to subdue Giganto. Ben chases Mole man down, and knocks him out with one punch. They pick up the staff and Reed tells them his device may end up destroying them all if it doesn't work properly. Sue gets mad at Reed, but holds his hand and tells him to turn it on and get rid of the Staff. Reed turns it on and they throw the staff in. His device then explodes, and they are sent flying. All the moloids on he surface begin fleeing back to the underground, as all the Latverians take a knee and bow to Doom. 

The Latverian general thanks the F4, and tells them the Latverian people have given all the credit to Dr. Doom, and do not even know of the F4's existence. They are given a plane to leave back home. Doom tells Reed he is going to stay. They shake hands and and Reed Leaves. The end shows Doom walking into the castle of the king, as all guards just take a knee, bow, and let him go through every door as if it was his castle. Doom eventually reaches the king's castle, and asks why the king could not have killed his father and persecuted his mother in person instead of sending guards to do it. The king is in so much fear he can't even say anything. Doom grabs the king by the throat and chokes him to death. Doom then walks out of the Balcony as thousands of Latverians stand outside cheering and screaming ""ALL HAIL DOOM"".

I've been looking around at gyms in the area and they're all so expensive. I was going to go for the cheaper option like LA Fitness or Planet Fitness but they seem to not like the weight banging. It seems like a place like Titans fits my criteria more, but that $65 a month fee is a steep charge. 

I am a serious lifter and would like a place where I can possibly bang around some weights. Primarily deadlift my 2-3 rep max and not have to set it down like it's a newborn toddler. My new job is a low paying internship since I'm still finishing up school at Kent State. I was hoping to find a place that also had a location towards Kent, but at this point I'd rather have a more quality gym in Cleveland than anything. 

I'm a committed lifter and love my powerlifts. I'm hoping to find a gym I can enjoy longterm.

Sex: F 
Height: 5'8 
Weight: 140 (athletic, really fit)
Race: Hispanic/White
Duration of complaint: 1 year (happy anniversary to me) 
Relevant medical issues: Asthma, eczema
Current meds: Mirena IUD 

tl;dr: Patient with no history of mental illness or anxiety disorder has first (and only) panic attack in December, 2015. Immediately stops taking oral birth control, but still has severe anxiety and some depression for 5 months after panic attack. Finally decides to take depression meds (citalopram) for 2 months. Has been off meds for 5 months and is doing fine for the most part. Right now patient has random, though manageable, anxiety accompanied by acid reflux and a sporadic rash. Stool has had white/yellow fibrous-looking, shredd-y strings (don't look like parasites) for about 3 weeks. Alcohol exacerbates anxiety. Patient believes she could have anxiety disorder, OR, could have a microbiological digestive problem that is causing other symptoms. Patient would like to know how likely it is that a digestive issue could be causing these things, and if she should be on antidepressants even though she has been able to handle things for a while now.

Backstory: About a year ago (December 2015) I had an acute panic attack around 3 in the morning while house sitting for a family member. It was the day finals had ended. The week leading up to the attack I had not slept very much, had consumed way more caffeine than I am used to, and had spent ample time in front of a computer screen. I had never had a panic attack or anything close before, so I thought I was having a goddamn heart attack. Really sudden chest and back pain, blurry vision, felt like I was dying. (I later learned that these were all symptoms of a panic attack, go figure). Panic attack lasted about 30 minutes. The next day I went to the school docs to get an EKG, just to make sure I wasn't having heart issues. Nothing was wrong. Still pretty freaked out. Whatever. 

About a three weeks later with no incident, so I had chalked up the panic attack to basically me messing up my nervous system the week prior. However, sometimes I would get this tight pain in my chest and it made me go back to thinking I had a heart problem (though if I understand correctly, heart issues generally manifest in referred pain?). I was pretty much on edge all the time because of this chest pain; it would be fair to call me paranoid. I went to the doctor about a month into it (late January, early February) and said ""hey, look, I have constant chest pain, this has never happened to me before."" I probably looked and sounded pretty shitty, because I didn't realize at the time that I had bad anxiety, and the doc asked if I was under a lot of stress and made me take one of those mental health tests. I realized then that I was indeed having daily thoughts about horrible things happening, not sleeping well, feeling pretty awful all around, the works. I asked to be taken off oral birth control (which I had been on for about 3 months) because I thought maybe that was messing with my brain. Stopped taking them. 

I walk out of that appointment like well, I have anxiety. It's probably just the elevated estrogen. But what if it isn't? I have never EVER EVER been inappropriately anxious about anything. I felt like a core facet of my identity was that I was an even-keeled person, who did well under pressure. Why be anxious now, very suddenly, after this massive panic attack? Something was wrong.

Eventually, the chest pain turned into full acid reflux at all hours. Surprise, the chest pain was always acid reflux, but no doctor ever had said that. I decided to go to a GI doctor mid-March. She also chalked up my acid reflux to anxiety also, but I promised her that I have never had these problems before and something was amiss. She said I can't even check on you because you've had this acid problem for 3 months and your throat is torched. She gave me antacids for a month, expecting that to fix the problem. But it didn't (surprise again). Got an endoscopy. No abnormal growth or anything, but my stomach juices were granular? Still never got a good explanation of what that meant. 

In the meantime, my anxiety became pretty consistent, and developed into full-blown depression. I was spending a lot of time with my boyfriend, for fear of being alone and something happening (heart attack, aneurysm, terrorist attack, you name it) because I was an anxious paranoid mess. My hip and hands hurt constantly at this point, so I was pretty sure I had cancer. I wasn't working out because I wasn't eating so I lost about 10 pounds. Always exhausted. Friends didn't understand what was happening, boyfriend was super supportive but I could tell I was really taking a toll on him by being so mopey and paranoid. The thing was, I thought it was just a phase, that it would pass. It was all so new and random. One morning after sleeping at bf's apartment, he leaves to go to class, I also have class, but I do not get up. I cannot get up. I stayed there paralyzed in bed for a full 7 hours, and the only thing that eventually got me up was the thought of my boyfriend coming back and seeing that I hadn't left. That was the day I decided I should probably get some help for the mental side. 

Except medical care is expensive and that added to my anxiety. I had already gone to the school docs like 3 times, and seeing the GI doc cost a lot (2-3k because of the multiple visits and endoscopy). I'm on my parents' insurance but it must not be very good. I got a rash on my arms. It started at my wrists and then moved up my arms, and is currently on my arms, chest, and my shoulder blades. It is randomly distributed dime sized patches of little red bumps that itch and are dry. It is also weird because the rash comes and goes really randomly (I thought). Eventually I went to a dermatologist and got a pretty strong topical for it. It gets rid of the rash temporarily, but then it comes back. 

Cue end of Spring semester. It's almost summer, and I am about to go away to a summer internship across the country, where I will be living in a rural area with little access to healthcare. The thing was, when I was busy, I could easily ignore the anxiety. It was only as soon as I was not thinking about anything or had some off time that it came crashing down hard. So I felt that as long as I stayed hella busy all the time, I would be alright. This worked for the whole semester (in terms of being productive, at least having the semblance of a functioning person). I went to one group therapy session before the summer and decided it was dumb because they were teaching us about how to be okay under stress and pressure but I wasn't feeling that at all. I knew how to be fine under stress and pressure. I was just anxious all the time, for no reason.I was offered antidepressants and turned them down because I didn't believe that they were going to fix the actual problem. 

Cue two weeks into summer; I am getting ready to leave for the internship. The week before, my best friend and I decide to go to San Diego for a short vacation before we were working. 7 days of absolute hell. I was anxious literally every minute of every day. With nothing to mentally distract me, I was on edge the whole trip. It felt like I was drowning. Rash was real bad. Acid was real bad. I was a mess, and I was worried because I was about to traverse across the country. But I don't have time to see a doctor before I leave (since school docs were out for summer, and it always takes a month to get in with my GI or a mental health professional). Get out to the internship. Really really anxious in a bad way, but excited also. Really do need help though. Can't live like this anymore. Blah blah. I convinced the people running the program to let me take a car two hours into the closest city, where I see a HELLA expensive mental health clinician. They prescribe me the same meds (citalopram) that were offered to me months earlier (fuck me, right). I take them, feel better. Great. They didn't always work, but they worked enough. Eventually ran out of meds and didn't go back to refill them, because I was feeling really good and dealing with the days that I did have anxiety pretty well. 

Fast forward to today. It's been about 5 months since I've been on meds, and I did fine this semester. I had about 10 days total in those 5 months that were really bad, but the rest I could handle or I had no anxiety at all. The acid and rash are still there, and they only flare up in conjunction with my anxiety (makes sense). I'm still trying to decide which appears first. Because sometimes it seems like the rash and the acid reflux appear before the anxiety sets in. So here's where I am at: Either I have a mental health thing and have anxiety and I should be on meds OR maybe I have a digestive tract issue that is causing the anxiety, the reflux, and the rash. My stool has rweird fiberous strings in it. They're not red, but maybe theyre clear or yellow. They don't look like parasites, but maybe they're a fungus? I believe this is possible because estrogen destroys your GI tract. Additionally, I notice that my anxiety is much worse the few days after I drink alcohol (which also messes with your GI tract). Either way, my next step is to get a comprehensive stool analysis. I'm still not completely convinced I have an anxiety disorder. I mean, technically I do, but I don't think cause can be simply chalked up to a brain problem. "

So everything starts off with the end credits for spiderman homecoming. You see a crowd cheering and screaming with someone speaking. The speaker says things like Today dawns a new beginning. We shall lead the world in our conquest...stuff like that. Eventually the dude ends saying ""All shall feel the might that is Doom"", and cuts to showing Doom putting 1 fist to the air while everyone cheers....

Movie starts here It maybe called Fantastic Four, but they should push for Dr. Doom to be the main focal point of the movie. simple plot points starts off with flashback of Doom's childhood of him holding valeria's hands at his mother's funeral. Borris rides on horseback coming and telling Doom and his father the King's men are coming. Doom and his father begin fleeing from Latverian army. His Father gives him a green blanket, and he flees while his dad runs back to fight of the guards

flash forward to the future (around the beginning of Iron Man 1). This is shown on a television stating Tony Stark had been kidnapped. Reed says if only Stark would use his genius to progress science rather than create war weapons, which leads to a debate between Doom and Reed. Doom and Reed work for Franklin Storm on a secret mission to study cosmic rays that appear near earth. Franklin Storm knows something is not right with shield and is able to keep the secret mission from shield.

Doom is fascinated by magic and attempts to recreate the Tesseract he has read about in mythological stories. He creates something like it, but Reed tells him his equations are off. Doom doesn't take Reed serious. He turns on his device, and a portal opens showing Asgard. Doom attempts to walk through it but his device explodes causing him to be flung towards the wall. He runs out in shame.

On his way home Reed is stopped by 4 guys telling him give them his wallet. Reed tries to run, but they tackle him down and beat him up. Ben Grim Yells for them to stop. They tell Ben Grim they aren't on Yancy Street, and for the old man to get lost. Ben takes them all out. Ben helps up Reed and tells him he was never much of a fighter. Ben has been there protecting Reed from the tough streets they grew up in since they were children.

Reed lives with Ben Grimm. Ben is depressed as his life is going no where. Reed asks Ben if he would like to go to space. Ben doesn't think Franklin Storm will let Ben go along, but Reed says he will tell Franklin Storm that Ben is a pilot. Ben says, but he is a forklift driver. Reed feels he owes Ben big time for being there for him since they were kids, and Reed tells Ben to just play along. Reed talks to Franklin Storm but he says no. Doom backs Reed and pushes for Storm to allow Ben to go with them. Franklin finally caves in and lets Ben go. Doom tells Reed, Reed owes him a favor.

They are introduced to Johnny and Sue storm, and Sue is excited to meet Doom, as she has read his work on wormholes. Reed introduces himself to Sue and tells her about his work with anti-matter, but she doesn't know who he is , and thinks he is Doom's intern

Johnny sneaks into he ship and hides in a crate as he also wants to go to space. The crew eventually come in later. Ben puts a picture of Captain America up on the walls, to which Doom mocks him for believing in the lies of the tale of Captain America. Ben moves towards Doom, but is stopped by Reed. They fly up to space and pass by the moon. Ben tells Doom he saw a video on the internet about super-powered humans living on the blue area of the moon. Doom mocks Ben again.

They eventually reach the cosmic radiation. Reed is shocked at how much energy it is giving off. Johnny jumps out of the crate, and Sue berates him. Franklin Storm tells them to continue the mission even though Johnny is there. Doom tells Reed he is going to now use the favor Reed owes him. Doom pulls out his Tesseract replica, and tells Reed to fly the ship as close as he can to the Cosmic Field. Franklin Storm tells them not to do it. Doom turns on his device anyways. The blue light of the replica begins to flicker violently before turning green(space stone turning into time stone). The cosmic field engulfs the ship, and communication is lost. Franklin Storm, thinking both of his kids died, separates himself from the world, and moves to the forests.

The ship reappears in the future. Around the time of the most recent movie released by marvel studios (Infinity War Part 1 or captain marvel maybe). Johnny is on fire, Ben has turned to rock, Reed's body is stretching all around, Sue disappears and reappears, and Doom feels as though his face is being burnt. They crash land on an abandoned town in Latveria. Doom runs out hiding his face with his father's blanket. Doom runs into one of the houses and finds bandages and wraps it around his head completely covering it. He finds rope to tie his father's blanket around his shoulders.

The crew crash on Latveria. They all get out of the ship and are unsure where they are. They are shocked at how Ben looks. Only Doom knows where they are, but he ran off. Moloids being to come out of the ground. Ben knows they are not friendly, and rushes them. Ben fights them and is able to take out a lot of Moloids, but they keep coming. Reed grabs Sue and Johnny and pulls them all on top of a truck. Johnny says he would rather fight, and focuses on releasing his power. He flames on and goes to help Ben. Sue tells Reed to fight, but Reed says he isn't much of a fighter. A moloid comes towards them and Reed is able to stretch a gigantic fist and knock the Moloid out. Reed goes and helps Ben and Johnny, and Sue protects them with shields. Doom, eventually comes out and creates a ball of energy which sends energy all around hitting all the moloids. They all retreat.

Johnny flies around before landing. He picks up an old newspaper showing Captain America and Tony Stark after they have defeated the Chitauri. The headline reads Tony Stark and the Avengers save New York from aliens. Ben says the world has gotten really weird since they have been gone. Reed sees the title of the newspaper as the Hassenstadt Tribune. Reed asks if this was the Capital of Doom's home country Latveria, and Doom says it is. Johnny says he's never heard of Latveria, and Doom replies that Latverians are doing their jobs then.

The crew begin to walk together in hopes of find someone to help them out. Johnny starts rambling on about what to name the group. He names a few things before saying the Fantastic 5. Ben tells him to stop as all those names are cliche nonsesne. The Latverian army helicoptors arrive where they are. Soldiers come out and point all their guns at them. Doom teleports away and leaves the group. Johnny jokes that the Fantastic 5 just became the Fantstic 4.

The army take the Fantastic 4 with them. Doom goes back to his old home. His house is in ruins with trash everywhere. Doom goes into the shed outside. Doom tries his best to focus all his mind on the door. Doom puts his hands out and spins them in a circular motion towards the door. A secret door of magic opens up leading to Doom's mother's old hideout. Doom goes in to find his father's old technology, and his mother's magic items. He finds a wooden mask that belonged to his mother. Doom puts it on. Doom finds his mother's diary and reads it.

Doom uses his mother's writing to create a seal of a red hexagram shape of light on the ground. Doom steps on top of the hexagram and is transported the realm of Mephisto. Doom finds Mephisto, and tells Mephisto to free his mother's soul. Mephisto tells Doom he should be thankful for Mephisto's service, as it is the reason Doom turned out the way he was. Doom tells Mephisto that Mephisto lied to his mother on the deal.

Mephisto laughs, and says there is always a catch to his deals. Doom sends hundreds of beams of energy towards Mephisto, but he deflects all of them. Mephisto strikes Doom down with one strike. Mephisto tells Doom he pities Doom, and tells him Doom he will give Doom freedom once a year to come to Mephisto's realm and fight him. If doom wins, then Mephisto will free Doom's mother's soul. Doom gets sent flying out of the realm, and lands on the ground outside the shed. Doom goes back into the shed, and creates his armor and turns his mother's wooden mask into a metal mask. Doom's quest for ultimate power had now been realized.

So everything starts off with the end credits for spiderman homecoming. You see a crowd cheering and screaming with someone speaking. The speaker says things like Today dawns a new beginning. We shall lead the world in our conquest...stuff like that. Eventually the dude ends saying ""All shall feel the might that is Doom"", and cuts to showing Doom putting 1 fist to the air while everyone cheers....

Movie starts here It maybe called Fantastic Four, but they should push for Dr. Doom to be the main focal point of the movie. simple plot points starts off with flashback of Doom's childhood of him holding valeria's hands at his mother's funeral. Borris rides on horseback coming and telling Doom and his father the King's men are coming. Doom and his father begin fleeing from Latverian army. His Father gives him a green blanket, and he flees while his dad runs back to fight of the guards

flash forward to the future (around the beginning of Iron Man 1). This is shown on a television stating Tony Stark had been kidnapped. Reed says if only Stark would use his genius to progress science rather than create war weapons, which leads to a debate between Doom and Reed. Doom and Reed work for Franklin Storm on a secret mission to study cosmic rays that appear near earth. Franklin Storm knows something is not right with shield and is able to keep the secret mission from shield.

Doom is fascinated by magic and attempts to recreate the Tesseract he has read about in mythological stories. He creates something like it, but Reed tells him his equations are off. Doom doesn't take Reed serious. He turns on his device, and a portal opens showing Asgard. Doom attempts to walk through it but his device explodes causing him to be flung towards the wall. He runs out in shame.

On his way home Reed is stopped by 4 guys telling him give them his wallet. Reed tries to run, but they tackle him down and beat him up. Ben Grim Yells for them to stop. They tell Ben Grim they aren't on Yancy Street, and for the old man to get lost. Ben takes them all out. Ben helps up Reed and tells him he was never much of a fighter. Ben has been there protecting Reed from the tough streets they grew up in since they were children.

Reed lives with Ben Grimm. Ben is depressed as his life is going no where. Reed asks Ben if he would like to go to space. Ben doesn't think Franklin Storm will let Ben go along, but Reed says he will tell Franklin Storm that Ben is a pilot. Ben says that wont work because Ben is a forklift driver. Reed feels he owes Ben big time for being there for him since they were kids, and Reed tells Ben to just play along. Reed talks to Franklin Storm but he says no. Doom backs Reed and pushes for Storm to allow Ben to go with them. Franklin finally caves in and lets Ben go. Doom tells Reed, Reed owes him a favor.

They are introduced to Johnny and Sue storm, and Sue is excited to meet Doom, as she has read his work on wormholes. Reed introduces himself to Sue and tells her about his work with anti-matter, but she doesn't know who he is , and thinks he is Doom's intern

Johnny sneaks into he ship and hides in a crate as he also wants to go to space. The crew eventually come in later. Ben puts a picture of Captain America up on the walls, to which Doom mocks him for believing in the lies of the tale of Captain America. Ben moves towards Doom, but is stopped by Reed. They fly up to space and pass by the moon. Ben tells Doom he saw a video on the internet about super-powered humans living on the blue area of the moon. Doom mocks Ben again.

They eventually reach the cosmic radiation. Reed is shocked at how much energy it is giving off. Johnny jumps out of the crate, and Sue berates him. Franklin Storm tells them to continue the mission even though Johnny is there. Doom tells Reed he is going to now use the favor Reed owes him. Doom pulls out his Tesseract replica, and tells Reed to fly the ship as close as he can to the Cosmic Field. Franklin Storm tells them not to do it. Doom turns on his device anyways. The blue light of the replica begins to flicker violently before turning green(space stone turning into time stone). The cosmic field engulfs the ship, and communication is lost. Franklin Storm, thinking both of his kids died, separates himself from the world, and moves to the forests.

The ship reappears in the future. Around the time of the most recent movie released by marvel studios (Infinity War Part 1 or captain marvel maybe). Johnny is on fire, Ben has turned to rock, Reed's body is stretching all around, Sue disappears and reappears, and Doom feels as though his face is being burnt. They crash land on an abandoned town in Latveria. Doom runs out hiding his face with his father's blanket. Doom runs into one of the houses and finds bandages and wraps it around his head completely covering it. He finds rope to tie his father's blanket around his shoulders.

The crew crash on Latveria. They all get out of the ship and are unsure where they are. They are shocked at how Ben looks. Only Doom knows where they are, but he ran off. Moloids being to come out of the ground. Ben knows they are not friendly, and rushes them. Ben fights them and is able to take out a lot of Moloids, but they keep coming. Reed grabs Sue and Johnny and pulls them all on top of a truck. Johnny says he would rather fight, and focuses on releasing his power. He flames on and goes to help Ben. Sue tells Reed to fight, but Reed says he isn't much of a fighter. A moloid comes towards them and Reed is able to stretch a gigantic fist and knock the Moloid out. Reed goes and helps Ben and Johnny, and Sue protects them with shields. Doom, eventually comes out and creates a ball of energy which sends energy all around hitting all the moloids. They all retreat.
Johnny flies around before landing. He picks up an old newspaper showing Captain America and Tony Stark after they have defeated the Chitauri. The headline reads Tony Stark and the Avengers save New York from aliens. Ben says the world has gotten really weird since they have been gone. Reed sees the title of the newspaper as the Hassenstadt Tribune. Reed asks if this was the Capital of Doom's home country Latveria, and Doom says it is. Johnny says he's never heard of Latveria, and Doom replies that Latverians are doing their jobs then.

The crew begin to walk together in hopes of find someone to help them out. Johnny starts rambling on about what to name the group. He names a few things before saying the Fantastic 5. Ben tells him to stop as all those names are cliche nonsesne. The Latverian army helicoptors arrive where they are. Soldiers come out and point all their guns at them. Doom teleports away and leaves the group. Johnny jokes that the Fantastic 5 just became the Fantstic 4.

The army take the Fantastic 4 with them. Doom goes back to his old home. His house is in ruins with trash everywhere. Doom goes into the shed outside. Doom tries his best to focus all his mind on the door. Doom puts his hands out and spins them in a circular motion towards the door. A secret door of magic opens up leading to Doom's mother's old hideout. Doom goes in to find his father's old technology, and his mother's magic items. He finds a wooden mask that belonged to his mother. Doom puts it on. Doom finds his mother's diary and reads it.

Doom uses his mother's writing to create a seal of a red hexagram shape of light on the ground. Doom steps on top of the hexagram and is transported the realm of Mephisto. Doom finds Mephisto, and tells Mephisto to free his mother's soul. Mephisto tells Doom he should be thankful for Mephisto's service, as it is the reason Doom turned out the way he was. Doom tells Mephisto that Mephisto lied to his mother on the deal. Doom's mother was given absolute control of her full magical powers, but also gave her a cancer that spread throughout her body eventually killing her. Mephisto laughs, and says there is always a catch to his deals. Doom sends hundreds of beams of energy towards Mephisto, but he deflects all of them. Mephisto strikes Doom down with one strike. Mephisto tells Doom he pities Doom, and tells him Doom he will give Doom freedom once a year to come to Mephisto's realm and fight him. If doom wins, then Mephisto will free Doom's mother's soul. Doom gets sent flying out of the realm, and lands on the ground outside the shed. Doom goes back into the shed, and creates his armor and turns his mother's wooden mask into a metal mask. Doom's quest for ultimate power had now been realized.

Cut back to the F4. The Latverian Army General interrogate them asking if they are Avengers. One of the soldiers says they apparently call themselves the Fantastic Four, and Ben tells them they never agreed to that. The General tells them to imprison them, as they are Americans, and no outsiders are welcome in Latveria. Reed goes on to say he knows what might be causing the moloids to spring up. The general listens. Reed pulls out a pocket size device, and turns it on. The device turns into Herbie. Reed tells Herbie to check for any strange frequencies that maybe causing interference. Herbie scans and says there are really low frequency sound waves coming from underneath the city. Reed then goes on to tell them of Harvey Elder otherwise known as the Mole Man for his peculiar appearance. Reed tells them he can help them with the Moloid Infestation if they help the F4 go home. They army agree, but tell the F4 they can't tell anyone of Latveria. They all agree.

Valeria eventually finds Doom at Doom's old residence. She checks up on the house every once in a while to make sure the shed doesn't get destroyed. She finds a badly injured Doom working on doombots outside the shed. Doom is happy to see her. She tells Doom about the Moloids. Doom tells her he will save Latveria, and she doesn't believe him, as he is severely injured. Doom goes through his mother's spells trying to find a spell which would heal his wounds. It takes him a few days but eventually he finds one, and heals himself. He puts his armor on with Valeria's help, and turns his Doombots and other robots on. Valeria tells Doom Hassenstadt is the only remaining city standing, and everyone in Latveria is there.

Eventually Reed is able to create a device using his and Doom's work on Anti-Matter and Wormholes. The device is able to send anything within it's path to the negative zone. The F4 go down underground to find the Mole Man. Eventually they find the Mole Man. The Mole Man is using his staff to send low frequency sound waves out and causing the mole people to attack Latveria. The Mole Man turns it on to max power, Moloids begin to spring Hassenstadt. The Latverian Army attempts to defend thier city. Mole Man summons Giganto to fight off the F4.

Most of the Latverian army is defeated by the moloids. The civilian men of Latveria realize they are the last hope, and pick up whatever weapons they have. They take to the streets to begin battle. Borris leads the charge. A moloid attacks Borris and is about to kill him before Doom arrives crashing on the streets and sending moloids flying back. Doom picks up Borris who realizes who Doom is with an instant. Doom teleports to all the Moloids and begins to fight them. There are thousands of moloids around Doom. Doom is able to fight them all off using energy blasts, magic, and his various missiles, grenades, and other weaponry, but they come at him one after another. Borris tells the men that Doom is the one who they all saw in their dreams. The one who will save latveria. All the men get riled up and they all attack the moloids. Doom summons his robots to come to aid.

Eventually the F4 are able to subdue Giganto. Ben chases Mole man down, and knocks him out with one punch. They pick up the staff and Reed tells them his device may end up destroying them all if it doesn't work properly. Sue gets mad at Reed, but holds his hand and tells him to turn it on and get rid of the Staff. Reed turns it on and they throw the staff in. His device then explodes, and they are sent flying. All the moloids on he surface begin fleeing back to the underground, as all the Latverians take a knee and bow to Doom.

The Latverian general thanks the F4, and tells them the Latverian people have given all the credit to Dr. Doom, and do not even know of the F4's existence. They are given a plane to leave back home. Doom tells Reed he is going to stay. They shake hands and and Reed Leaves. The end shows Doom walking into the castle of the king, as all guards just take a knee, bow, and let him go through every door as if it was his castle. Doom eventually reaches the king's castle, and asks why the king could not have killed his father and persecuted his mother in person instead of sending guards to do it. The king is in so much fear he can't even say anything. Doom grabs the king by the throat and chokes him to death. Doom then walks out of the Balcony as thousands of Latverians stand outside cheering and screaming ""ALL HAIL DOOM"".

Ending Credit Scene Silver Surfer flys through space and eventually reaches the Earth's Moon. Sufer talks to Uatu the Watcher and tells him Galactus is coming. Uatu tells him the humans are not ready, and they aren't even able to leave the planet yet. Surfer tells him he feels the pain of Uatu as his planet was once threatened with Galactus's hunger. Surfer tells him he will leave a source of his Power Cosmic energy near the Earth, and hopes the humans can use it properly. Surfer blasts a field of Power Cosmic Energy in space. The watcher thanks Surfer for this, even though surfer is betraying Galactus. Surfer then flies off."

5i6t6m,3,2016-12-13,"To Dear, our 8 year anniversary",frizzlefranz,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/5i6t6m/to_dear_our_8_year_anniversary/,"I can't get over how time passes after you've been gone. It's stopped for you, but it hasn't stopped anywhere else. As if things just keep going without you. That seems like that's obviously what would happen, and that's how I thought it would have happened, but it's weird to experience. Even though it's game over for you, life keeps going and I'm here stuck watching a game I no longer have an investment in. 

Shit, maybe I should just leave too, I sometimes think to myself, but I also realize that would be weak -- a cop out. I still love you so much, and I still have so much respect for you, even more now that I am constantly reminding myself of your memory. But I do know that at this point, even at my weakest, I'm stronger than that. 

I spent so much time as your shadow -- watching you play the game and fucking crushing it. Don't get me wrong, I didn't mind it. It was awesome to see you succeed, to get a full ride to UW Madison Law School, to get an internship at the Thai embassy, to take that and transform it into a program that taught the department how to speak English, even though you knew nothing about their language. There's no way, at my strongest, that I could have done that. 

Now that you're gone, I realize that it's time for me to start taking control of my own game. I don't even feel like I know the fucking rules -- it's like someone handed me Risk for the first time but forgot to include the instructions. I hope I catch on eventually. 

But for you, I'm going to (try my best to) fucking win it. I have to do the things I've always talked about doing, that I've always dreamed of doing, because now I'm living for both of us. There's no way a spirit as powerful as yours can just fade away -- I don't want it to fade away. I have to take at least one ounce of your motivation, your strength, your encouragement to live out what you always said I could do. And when I do (hopefully) succeed, which I hope I do, you're goddamn right I'm going to think of you and dedicate every single effort to you because for so long you were the only one to truly, honestly believe in me. 

If you could just tell me how to grow my own backbone without you, that would be great. If you could come back for just one moment from the grave and give me a crash course, that would be just the best. But I know that wouldn't be right. I have to take it from here -- to take the wheel and go, which you know is terrifying for me on so many levels because you know how poor of a driver and navigator I am. Maybe I'll just wander for a while, but I'll find my way eventually. Not just for me, again, but for both of us. And I have a feeling this will piss you off watching me wandering and ambling and weebling around where I should be going, but I swear I'll get there eventually. For you, dear, I'm going to at least try to live up to at least 1/10 of your potential.

In other news, there's a man in front of me on this flight who just spent the last five minutes explaining to his young kid that Diet Coke is ok to drink on the flight because it has no calories and no sugar (oof). The kid said, ""Yeah, but we need calories."" The dad didn't say anything. The kid paused for a second and said ""But water doesn't have calories,"" and the dad said ""You're right, buddy. Water doesn't have calories."" One of the dad's other kids said ""Daddy can we have a snack?"" and the dad said ""I think we've had enough calories for the day today."" This could be totally possible. They could have been cramming their faces with Auntie Anns pretzels before the flight, but something about this rubbed me the wrong way, completely. Why not ""Yes, buddy. We should have water -- that's much healthier for you than Diet Coke"" or ""Let's have an apple once we get off this short, 1hr flight."" I don't know. Maybe I'm just in a funk right now, maybe I'm just incredibly down and pessimistic now, maybe the dad was just tired and was just spouting nonsense, but in my humble opinion, you would have been a WAY better dad than this dumbass.

5i7628,5,2016-12-13,He Wrote Me A Letter,mentalsquints,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/5i7628/he_wrote_me_a_letter/,"Deep breath... here goes. We've been together three years. He's 26, I'm 27 (f); we met our last year of college through a mutual friend and were immediately inseparable. He gets me like no other, I get him, we share the same interests... We speak each other's language. In so many ways this felt meant to be.

About a year into the relationship I lost my financial aid, which was what was getting me through school and paying my rent (yes, I had a job at the time, but it wasn't covering it). His grandma's house has been vacant for years, so we officially move in there together (we'd been basically already living together at my apt). It's a huge adjustment -- not only am I his first major love, the weight and the responsibility of moving in together stress him and send him into a panicked state. Around the holidays of that year, he freaked out, and first broke up with me, then reclarified that this is a break. I was more than happy to give him the space he needed and work things out on my own, and we did reunite by Christmas. 

The next two years were... Amazing. As he's put it recently, the best years of our lives. I was able to finish school thanks to assistance from my department chair, and we graduates together. We adopted two dogs, went on road trips, camped, went to Operas... It's amazing. I'm tender, I'm patient, I'm considerate of his feelings and have NO expectations that we get married any time soon. 

This year has been different. He began the process of getting his teaching credential; between exams, studying, and preparing applications, he got busy. I was still determined to find a career in theater, so I applied for and got an internship and a backstage job. I got busy too. It was a tough summer, as I hardly saw him and he was hard at work with classes. The internship was not what I'd hoped it would be, but the backstage job lead to a part time front of house gig. It seemed like things were progressing along -- but the truth was, I was feeling stuck. He was making actual moves, and I'd been feeling aimless and stuck career wise since earlier in the year, afraid that I was puttering around aimlessly and not actually making progress. 

This fear was then compounded by my jealousy of one of his classmates, a cute, tall, conventionally extroverted girl, who clearly had a crush on him. My insecurities reared their ugly head and I became convinced that she was actively trying to steal him out from under me. She did do some really shady things, but I definitely obsessed over it more than I needed to. This, my feelings of inadequacy, and my fear of failure all started to get to me, and I became more stagnant than ever. I'd been struggling with severe facial and body eczema too, that made me feel like nobody would ever want to hire me due to my appearance. Let's face it -- I was depressed.

I couldn't move, I couldn't see past the next couple of weeks. I would work my little part time jobs, but structure my schedule around being home with my guy as much as possible, thinking that he needed me. I wasn't able to understand what I was going through though, only knowing that I wasn't feeling good. I'll admit it, the last couple of months I've become dependent on him. 

Last Thursday I got a text from some close friends. ""Call us when you get this. It's important. We love you."". My heart sank. I knew what it was immediately, and raced home immediately to find a typed letter taped to the heater. It was all, I loved you, I thought we were meant to be, but I have to end things because it's not working and it's the morally correct thing to do, you've made me a better person and I've changed and that was the poison pill in the relationship, and I only want the best for you. 

He didn't come home that night. He'd texted all my friends that we were through before I even knew. Worse still, that morning I'd woken up with the realization that something wasn't right and I was going to tell him I needed to seek help. I did finally get to see him the next day, where he informed me through tears that he no longer loved me -- or rather, I was no longer the person he fell in love with. 

I feel so blindsided. I stuck by him when he was going through a full breakdown, giving him his space but still being there for him, and he can't even extend me the same courtesy. Worse still, he reached the decision that our relationship was unsalvageable without even trying to fix if, or giving me a chance to regain my independence. He's always been a stubborn guy, and once he makes a decision there's no undoing it. I'm hurt beyond belief, my head is spinning, and I keep processing everything we've been through the last 3 years, keeping this wound fresh. 

I know I needed to take charge of my own life and be strong. But he's always telling me that I'm the strongest person he knows, so why wouldn't he give me that chance? I also know a part of it is that as his first major love, he felt trapped by the responsibilities of a serious relationship. He wants to spread his wings and see the world, teach in Japan for a year, travel, move to the coast and teach in a beach side high school. When he'd bring these things up I'd be supportive, encouraging, but then would get stressed because I didn't feel like there was room for me in these plans, or if there was it wasn't considerate to my career (such as it was) to uproot me. But I was always the one to meet him halfway, and I figured heck, I could do theater anywhere... Just so long as I'm included in your plan for the future I'm ok.

But now it feels like I was deluding myself all along. I wish we'd never moved in together. I wish we didn't get along so well. I wish I wasn't losing my best friend. I wish he had had the courage to face me and tell me in person how he was feeling. I wish he would change his mind. My world and my future as I'd envisioned it is gone and while I'll always have the fire to keep going, I'm always going to look back and this and feel that there was a way to have fixed this. 

Now we're strangers in the house we share. I'm facing losing either one or both of my dogs. I love him desperately still, but don't want to dump all my pain at his feet. So the job search for something non-theater begins, so I can earn enough money to move out ASAP. I'm struggling badly, but am trying to keep moving. The worst part is that I feel I could have done all this, gotten the motivation to find 9-5 work and see a therapist, without us breaking up. Now I'm left with the loss of my best friend and a huge void in my heart and my day-to-day life. I want to live in hope that we'll reunite (though I'd still move out) but with each passing, agonising day the reality of this loss sets in more and more.

 Reddit, if you made it this far, I commend you, and thank you for listening to the venting of this broken heart."

5i7ina,66,2016-12-13,Unsolicited advice from an Interviewer,cut_to_cure,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/5i7ina/unsolicited_advice_from_an_interviewer/,"I'm a second year gen surg resident at an academic institution and at our program the residents participate in the interview process and I figured I'd offer a little advice to those on the interview trail from someone who's already done it and been on the other side.
    
**1.** **Read up on the program before you get there.** During the preinterview dinner, we (residents) want to have a few drinks, have some fun, and get to know our potential future colleagues. But it gets a little tedious when you ask us if/how many elective months we have, what services we rotate through, and what fellowships we offer. All that information is found on the websites.
    
**2.** Going along with point 1, **the pre-interview dinner/ get-together is as important as interview day.** Treat the pre-interview dinner as a way to get to know the residents and to get the feeling of the general character of the program-- the intangible things that can't be found on the program's website. Interview day is all astro turf; every program is the best, none of them have any problems, and they all want you..you know, generic bullshit. The dinner is important because firstly you'll see if/how many residents show up, which will tell you how cohesive the group is and how well people get along with each other. Secondly, residents tend to be a little more free-speaking and less politically correct during the dinner (especially after a few drinks). Finally, it's an easy way to see how over-worked the residents are and truly how happy they are in their program.
    
**3.** **BE YOURSELF!** It's the most cliche advice but i'll explain: there are lots of posts and forum threads that will try and groom you into the person you ""should"" be like an ultra extrovert with politically correct jokes and wit and all the rest of it. But you've gotten to the interview because you've met the program's academic expectations; now, you have to see if you ""fit"" into the program. So if you're an introvert who tries to act outgoing and social, not only will it be painfully obvious, awkward, and cringey, but you'll be doing a disservice to yourself because it's like you're trying to fit in with a group of people who will end up not being like you. The point is not to be off-putting or weird but if you're the introvert, it's ok to not be the center of attention when you're at an interview (or preinterview dinner). You'll quickly realize that certain programs, regions, institutions, etc have their own feel and aura and your job is not only to get into the ""best"" program, but the one where you'll be happiest because you're working with people you can get along with. That goes the same for when you're actually interviewing and answering questions. If you're putting forward generic answers that all of us have heard over the years, then you won't stand out in the slightest. We want to get to know the ""real you"" because we're looking to make a 3-7 year commitment to work with someone.
    
**4.** **Thank you letters.** My advice is email (yes email is ok) the staff, residents, program director, program coordinator, and program chair the day after you interview. It shows you're interested and it's just common courtesy. I would also advise to send handwritten letters closer to match date to your top 2 or 3 programs. It shows you're still interested and will help the program leaders remember you when they're making tweaks to their lists. 

**5.** **Have good questions to ask during interviews.** Just like how you'll soon become burned out from the same old questions on the interview trail, we get burned out from the same old questions from the interviewees. Are there any big changes to the program coming? What is this program missing or what do you wish this program had? Are the staff approachable? Why did you choose to work for this program? Do residents have trouble getting their numbers/ do you get to start doing cases/procedures during intern year. All these questions and the rest of the ones you'll find on many threads and forums are mind-numbingly generic. It also goes back to whether the interviewee read up on the program before they got there because generally all of those questions can be answered on the website. The questions you need to focus on are, again, seeing if you'd be a good fit for that program. Ask if/how many residents have their own families [e.g if you have a SO and child(ren)]; what sorts of activities residents do on their free time; what resources there are for (fill in your area of interest). 
    
    
The biggest thing I can stress is just be yourself and don't overthink the process. If you're at the dinner/interview, you deserve to be there; now just figure out if you click with the program and the people in it. "
5i7w4r,3,2016-12-13,30 [M4F] Work Wife,bluishribbon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5i7w4r/30_m4f_work_wife/,"You and I have known each other for years.  Hung out with groups of friends, shared music, exchanged travel stories, commiserated when our supervisors gave us shitty assignment, and went out for beers when one of us got a promotion.  

We met when we were interns, and you used to joke that I was your Work Husband and you were my Work Wift.  It was never spoken, but I could just tell that you were really into me.  Unfortunately this was back when I was dating someone else, and I was too fucking righteous to yield to my desires.  I've always regretted it.

There were always whispers about your wild nights and secretive hookups, and I always imagined that you were super kinky in the bedroom.  I would jack off at night thinking about the things I would do to you if I ever had the chance.

Over time we grew distant.  You got engaged mere weeks before I had a nasty breakup.  Then before I knew it you were married.  Your husband is super possessive, and I basically never hang out with you outside of work anymore.

Yet when I come to your cubicle, you laugh and flirt with me, always compliment me when I look good, and always seem to have that playful sparkle in your eye.  You drive me crazy with your business attire that seems to perfectly hug every curve on your body in a way that screams ""I'm in charge.""  I love the way your feet angle ever slightly inward when you're standing. The way you always twirl your hair when you're talking to me leaves me distracted for the rest of the afternoon.

Tonight though, things are going to change.  Our annual departmental conference in New Orleans has gotten a little too drunken, and the two of us have decided to play hooky from tomorrow morning's huge seminar.  We're the only ones of our coworkers still on Bourbon St, and the pair of hand grenades we've recently downed encourage us to continue throwing caution to the wind. However, when we realize that your credit card has been left at some random bar and is gone forever we decide to call it a night.  Your hotel is well over a mile away and mine is less than 3 blocks.  I kid that you should stay at mine because the shower's jet faucet feels heavenly, and you fall silent staring at me.  At first I'm concerned that I've finally pushed the boundary too far.  Until a sly lopsided smile forms across your face.  You grab my hand and we start walking in the direction of my hotel.

Maybe it's in my head, but it feel like you're half a step in front of me urging me to walk back faster...

5i7ztk,0,2016-12-13,Fantastic four MCU idea,abc2k,FanFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/5i7ztk/fantastic_four_mcu_idea/,"Feedback would be greatly appreciated It's long so thanks for reading.

So everything starts off with the end credits for spiderman homecoming. You see a crowd cheering and screaming with someone speaking. The speaker says things like Today dawns a new beginning. We shall lead the world in our conquest...stuff like that. Eventually the dude ends saying ""All shall feel the might that is Doom"", and cuts to showing Doom putting 1 fist to the air while everyone cheers....

Movie starts here It maybe called Fantastic Four, but they should push for Dr. Doom to be the main focal point of the movie. simple plot points starts off with flashback of Doom's childhood of him holding valeria's hands at his mother's funeral. Borris rides on horseback coming and telling Doom and his father the King's men are coming. Doom and his father begin fleeing from Latverian army. His Father gives him a green blanket, and he flees while his dad runs back to fight of the guards

flash forward to the future (around the beginning of Iron Man 1). This is shown on a television stating Tony Stark had been kidnapped. Reed says if only Stark would use his genius to progress science rather than create war weapons, which leads to a debate between Doom and Reed. Doom and Reed work for Franklin Storm on a secret mission to study cosmic rays that appear near earth. Franklin Storm knows something is not right with shield and is able to keep the secret mission from shield.

Doom is fascinated by magic and attempts to recreate the Tesseract he has read about in mythological stories. He creates something like it, but Reed tells him his equations are off. Doom doesn't take Reed serious. He turns on his device, and a portal opens showing Asgard. Doom attempts to walk through it but his device explodes causing him to be flung towards the wall. He runs out in shame.

On his way home Reed is stopped by 4 guys telling him give them his wallet. Reed tries to run, but they tackle him down and beat him up. Ben Grim Yells for them to stop. They tell Ben Grim they aren't on Yancy Street, and for the old man to get lost. Ben takes them all out. Ben helps up Reed and tells him he was never much of a fighter. Ben has been there protecting Reed from the tough streets they grew up in since they were children.

Reed lives with Ben Grimm. Ben is depressed as his life is going no where. Reed asks Ben if he would like to go to space. Ben doesn't think Franklin Storm will let Ben go along, but Reed says he will tell Franklin Storm that Ben is a pilot. Ben says that wont work because Ben is a forklift driver. Reed feels he owes Ben big time for being there for him since they were kids, and Reed tells Ben to just play along. Reed talks to Franklin Storm but he says no. Doom backs Reed and pushes for Storm to allow Ben to go with them. Franklin finally caves in and lets Ben go. Doom tells Reed, Reed owes him a favor.

They are introduced to Johnny and Sue storm, and Sue is excited to meet Doom, as she has read his work on wormholes. Reed introduces himself to Sue and tells her about his work with anti-matter, but she doesn't know who he is , and thinks he is Doom's intern

Johnny sneaks into he ship and hides in a crate as he also wants to go to space. The crew eventually come in later. Ben puts a picture of Captain America up on the walls, to which Doom mocks him for believing in the lies of the tale of Captain America. Ben moves towards Doom, but is stopped by Reed. They fly up to space and pass by the moon. Ben tells Doom he saw a video on the internet about super-powered humans living on the blue area of the moon. Doom mocks Ben again.

They eventually reach the cosmic radiation. Reed is shocked at how much energy it is giving off. Johnny jumps out of the crate, and Sue berates him. Franklin Storm tells them to continue the mission even though Johnny is there. Doom tells Reed he is going to now use the favor Reed owes him. Doom pulls out his Tesseract replica, and tells Reed to fly the ship as close as he can to the Cosmic Field. Franklin Storm tells them not to do it. Doom turns on his device anyways. The blue light of the replica begins to flicker violently before turning green(space stone turning into time stone). The cosmic field engulfs the ship, and communication is lost. Franklin Storm, thinking both of his kids died, separates himself from the world, and moves to the forests.

The ship reappears in the future. Around the time of the most recent movie released by marvel studios (Infinity War Part 1 or captain marvel maybe). Johnny is on fire, Ben has turned to rock, Reed's body is stretching all around, Sue disappears and reappears, and Doom feels as though his face is being burnt. They crash land on an abandoned town in Latveria. Doom runs out hiding his face with his father's blanket. Doom runs into one of the houses and finds bandages and wraps it around his head completely covering it. He finds rope to tie his father's blanket around his shoulders.

The crew crash on Latveria. They all get out of the ship and are unsure where they are. They are shocked at how Ben looks. Only Doom knows where they are, but he ran off. Moloids being to come out of the ground. Ben knows they are not friendly, and rushes them. Ben fights them and is able to take out a lot of Moloids, but they keep coming. Reed grabs Sue and Johnny and pulls them all on top of a truck. Johnny says he would rather fight, and focuses on releasing his power. He flames on and goes to help Ben. Sue tells Reed to fight, but Reed says he isn't much of a fighter. A moloid comes towards them and Reed is able to stretch a gigantic fist and knock the Moloid out. Reed goes and helps Ben and Johnny, and Sue protects them with shields. Doom, eventually comes out and creates a ball of energy which sends energy all around hitting all the moloids. They all retreat.
Johnny flies around before landing. He picks up an old newspaper showing Captain America and Tony Stark after they have defeated the Chitauri. The headline reads Tony Stark and the Avengers save New York from aliens. Ben says the world has gotten really weird since they have been gone. Reed sees the title of the newspaper as the Hassenstadt Tribune. Reed asks if this was the Capital of Doom's home country Latveria, and Doom says it is. Johnny says he's never heard of Latveria, and Doom replies that Latverians are doing their jobs then.

The crew begin to walk together in hopes of find someone to help them out. Johnny starts rambling on about what to name the group. He names a few things before saying the Fantastic 5. Ben tells him to stop as all those names are cliche nonsesne. The Latverian army helicoptors arrive where they are. Soldiers come out and point all their guns at them. Doom teleports away and leaves the group. Johnny jokes that the Fantastic 5 just became the Fantstic 4.

The army take the Fantastic 4 with them. Doom goes back to his old home. His house is in ruins with trash everywhere. Doom goes into the shed outside. Doom tries his best to focus all his mind on the door. Doom puts his hands out and spins them in a circular motion towards the door. A secret door of magic opens up leading to Doom's mother's old hideout. Doom goes in to find his father's old technology, and his mother's magic items. He finds a wooden mask that belonged to his mother. Doom puts it on. Doom finds his mother's diary and reads it.

Doom uses his mother's writing to create a seal of a red hexagram shape of light on the ground. Doom steps on top of the hexagram and is transported the realm of Mephisto. Doom finds Mephisto, and tells Mephisto to free his mother's soul. Mephisto tells Doom he should be thankful for Mephisto's service, as it is the reason 

Doom turned out the way he was. Doom tells Mephisto that Mephisto lied to his mother on the deal. Doom's mother was given absolute control of her full magical powers, but also gave her a cancer that spread throughout her body eventually killing her. Mephisto laughs, and says there is always a catch to his deals. Doom sends hundreds of beams of energy towards Mephisto, but he deflects all of them. Mephisto strikes Doom down with one strike. Mephisto tells Doom he pities Doom, and tells him Doom he will give Doom freedom once a year to come to Mephisto's realm and fight him. If doom wins, then Mephisto will free Doom's mother's soul. Doom gets sent flying out of the realm, and lands on the ground outside the shed. Doom goes back into the shed, and creates his armor and turns his mother's wooden mask into a metal mask. Doom's quest for ultimate power had now been realized.

Cut back to the F4. The Latverian Army General interrogate them asking if they are Avengers. One of the soldiers says they apparently call themselves the Fantastic Four, and Ben tells them they never agreed to that. The General tells them to imprison them, as they are Americans, and no outsiders are welcome in Latveria. Reed goes on to say he knows what might be causing the moloids to spring up. The general listens. Reed pulls out a pocket size device, and turns it on. The device turns into Herbie. Reed tells Herbie to check for any strange frequencies that maybe causing interference. Herbie scans and says there are really low frequency sound waves coming from underneath the city. Reed then goes on to tell them of Harvey Elder otherwise known as the Mole Man for his peculiar appearance. Reed tells them he can help them with the Moloid Infestation if they help the F4 go home. They army agree, but tell the F4 they can't tell anyone of Latveria. They all agree.

Valeria eventually finds Doom at Doom's old residence. She checks up on the house every once in a while to make sure the shed doesn't get destroyed. She finds a badly injured Doom working on doombots outside the shed. Doom is happy to see her. She tells Doom about the Moloids. Doom tells her he will save Latveria, and she doesn't believe him, as he is severely injured. Doom goes through his mother's spells trying to find a spell which would heal his wounds. It takes him a few days but eventually he finds one, and heals himself. He puts his armor on with Valeria's help, and turns his Doombots and other robots on. Valeria tells Doom Hassenstadt is the only remaining city standing, and everyone in Latveria is there.

Eventually Reed is able to create a device using his and Doom's work on Anti-Matter and Wormholes. The device is able to send anything within it's path to the negative zone. The F4 go down underground to find the Mole Man. Eventually they find the Mole Man. The Mole Man is using his staff to send low frequency sound waves out and causing the mole people to attack Latveria. The Mole Man turns it on to max power, Moloids begin to spring Hassenstadt. The Latverian Army attempts to defend thier city. Mole Man summons Giganto to fight off the F4.
Most of the Latverian army is defeated by the moloids. The civilian men of Latveria realize they are the last hope, and pick up whatever weapons they have. They take to the streets to begin battle. Borris leads the charge. A moloid attacks Borris and is about to kill him before Doom arrives crashing on the streets and sending moloids flying back. Doom picks up Borris who realizes who Doom is with an instant. Doom teleports to all the Moloids and begins to fight them. There are thousands of moloids around Doom. Doom is able to fight them all off using energy blasts, magic, and his various missiles, grenades, and other weaponry, but they come at him one after another. Borris tells the men that Doom is the one who they all saw in their dreams. The one who will save latveria. All the men get riled up and they all attack the moloids. Doom summons his robots to come to aid.

Eventually the F4 are able to subdue Giganto. Ben chases Mole man down, and knocks him out with one punch. They pick up the staff and Reed tells them his device may end up destroying them all if it doesn't work properly. Sue gets mad at Reed, but holds his hand and tells him to turn it on and get rid of the Staff. Reed turns it on and they throw the staff in. His device then explodes, and they are sent flying. All the moloids on he surface begin fleeing back to the underground, as all the Latverians take a knee and bow to Doom.

The Latverian general thanks the F4, and tells them the Latverian people have given all the credit to Dr. Doom, and do not even know of the F4's existence. They are given a plane to leave back home. Doom tells Reed he is going to stay. They shake hands and and Reed Leaves. The end shows Doom walking into the castle of the king, as all guards just take a knee, bow, and let him go through every door as if it was his castle. Doom eventually reaches the king's castle, and asks why the king could not have killed his father and persecuted his mother in person instead of sending guards to do it. The king is in so much fear he can't even say anything. Doom grabs the king by the throat and chokes him to death. Doom then walks out of the Balcony as thousands of Latverians stand outside cheering and screaming ""ALL HAIL DOOM"".

Ending Credit Scene Silver Surfer flys through space and eventually reaches the Earth's Moon. Sufer talks to Uatu the Watcher and tells him Galactus is coming. Uatu tells him the humans are not ready, and they aren't even able to leave the planet yet. Surfer tells him he feels the pain of Uatu as his planet was once threatened with Galactus's hunger. Surfer tells him he will leave a source of his Power Cosmic energy near the Earth, and hopes the humans can use it properly. Surfer blasts a field of Power Cosmic Energy in space. The watcher thanks Surfer for this, even though surfer is betraying Galactus. Surfer then flies off."
5i8ct4,1,2016-12-13,Question about Suitability Review,SuitabilityThrowaway,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/5i8ct4/question_about_suitability_review/,"Hi everyone,

I searched through old posts on this sub for info on the Suitability Review. I'm seeing a lot of horror stories about people putting in a year or more of work, passing security and medical reviews, and being denied at the suitability review. I'm trying to assess if I should 1) apply for the Foreign Service now, 2) let some time pass, or 3) skip it altogether because I have no chance. (Hoping it's not 3. but feel free to lay it on thick if it is.)

I have only one black mark on my file, and I plan to report it on my SF-86. The following happened almost 5 years ago - by the time I apply, it will have been a solid 5 years. I held a security clearance for an internship in college so I've been through the process for clearance, but the Foreign Service obviously has a higher bar for suitability.

I was out with some friends in college when I was 22. We had all had a few drinks and we were heading from one bar to another. I was lagging behind the group with another guy from our group - we were definitely not sober at this point but I felt I had control over my actions. By the time we got to the bar, our friends were inside, but the doorman refused to let us in. I don't remember why - could have been because the bar was full, could have been because he thought we were too drunk. My friend started arguing with the doorman, things started to escalate, and I stepped in to try to defuse the situation. I think at some point I placed a hand on each of their shoulders, and that's when a cop drove by.

Cops flip on their lights, stop, start talking to everyone, etc. Obviously there was some tension in the air. My driver's license was expired, so the only ID I had in the world was my passport. I handed that to one of the cops and he went off to do whatever it is police do with your ID when they take it. Then another officer came over and told us to leave immediately and go home. I should have listened, but the other officer still had my passport and I was worried I would never get it back if I left. Officer 2 was having none of it and told me he would arrest me if I didn't leave. I, being a stubborn 22 year old college kid, told him I wasn't going to leave without my passport and if he had to arrest me, go ahead. Biiiiiiig mistake.

Officer 2 grabbed my wrist, spun me around, and slammed me face-first on the sidewalk. On my way down I reflexively reached out to grab whatever was closest to me to stop my fall, which happened to be the roof of Officer 2's cruiser. I most certainly had a concussion, and combined with the alcohol, things get pretty hazy from there but I do not imagine that I had nice things to say to anyone about what was happening.

Cops took me to the station, charged me with Assault (because I touched the doorman while trying to defuse the argument), Disorderly Conduct (because I was involved in an argument in a public street), and Resisting Arrest (because I reached out against the police car to try to stop my fall). From the police report it's pretty clear that my actions and my friend's actions got jumbled and I got slapped with all the bad stuff because he walked away when he was told to and I didn't. 

I got a lawyer to represent me in court who got the ADA to recommend dismissal of all charges and expungement of the record if I 1) received an opinion from a psychiatrist that I did not have a substance abuse or dependency problem (a technicality required by judicial guidelines in the state for young first-time offenders), 2) wrote a letter of apology to the victim of the ""assault"" (the doorman), and 3) completed 20 hours of community service. I did all those things, the charges were dropped, the record was expunged, and I closed the book on this sordid chapter of stubbornness and immaturity, feeling like a real idiot about myself.

So fast forward almost-5 years, and I have absolutely no other blemishes on my record. Perfect credit and financial history, great resume with lots of progressively responsible and interesting experience, amazing references including current senior FSOs, past security clearance adjudication (although that was granted pre-Incident), etc... I mean, it's not like I demolished $100k+ of private property with a baseball bat...

So I guess my question is, how bad is it? Will the Suitability Review Panel just see my SF-86 with 3 dropped charges and a single court-ordered psychiatric evaluation from 5 years ago and think ""Well, we can't have that"" and reject me? I feel like a Class-A idiot here because *none of this would have been a problem if I had just left my passport and gone home and dealt with it later* but I didn't and here we are.

Give it to me straight, doc :/"
5i8eh5,46,2016-12-13,TIFU by eating Banana Bread,realreplicant,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/5i8eh5/tifu_by_eating_banana_bread/,"I'm on my peds clerkship right now and you think happy funny feely warm people right? Well anyway today I was on clinic duty and I performed a well child check on a cute newborn little girl today. I went back to the office to staff the patient and there was a tray of banana bread that was announced earlier to be up for grabs. I walk up to the tray of banana bread and proceed to take a piece and put it in my mouth. 

One of the staff physicians that I barely have worked with walks up behind me, startling me and says ""Are you ready to present?"" 

I say, garbled ""Oh I'm sorry have banana bread in my mouth, one second""

She retorts very harshly, ""Well do what you have to do I guess""

I gulp the food quickly and say, "" I apologize, I didn't know you were behind me waiting. I am so sorry""

She says, ""You know the patients come first, I don't have all this time to wait while you stuff you face!""

Anyway this was in a room full of residents and interns, this was more than a yelling it was a public shaming.

After that I just shrug and finish the presentation, what else could I do? Anyway throughout the day she smiled at me some but never addressed the awkward encounter. I'm actually pretty appalled that she kept yelling at me, even after I directly apologized for not seeing her in the room and eating the bread. Furthermore, I'm tired  of this third year BS. Since med-students aren't technically employees, we exist in this weird gray zone where we can be bitched at and shat on with no repercussions. The worst part is, you have to grin and bear it, apologize, smile, wave and dance little monkey dance for them and dance until you have no pride, or sense of self, or ability to forgive yourself just a blisters all over your feet and welts all over your hands and knees from sucking dick.

5i8l46,3,2016-12-13,20 [M4F] Something that lasts. [long-term domination],imthatguyukno1,BDSMpersonals,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/5i8l46/20_m4f_something_that_lasts_longterm_domination/,"Hello Potential Mistress,

I would like to start this whole application with the disclaimer that I hope this lasts a long time. I had one Mistress for about 2 years and a significant amount of trust had been built between us to the point where I had no issue sending anything controversial. I was freely able to give up my manhood for the woman of my cock's dreams and would feel no remorse about a thing. Now that she has gone into retirement, I hope to rebuild a similar relation to a new Mistress. Please also note that this is for an ONLINE Mistress but I would be open for real sessions should both of us be comfortable with such and there be a convenience for it. I am also very respecting boundaries should there be a boyfriend or husband on the other end that you would prefer not be involved.

I have been searching for far too long to find anything of legitimate value to the point where my messages have become lazy and lack the proper thought that should be put into a message going to a potential Mistress. My hope is to have a running online relationship that would consist of casual conversation throughout the week or in the evenings with plenty of ""sessions"" mixed into talk whenever we both have free time. I understand schedules can be quite tight as I am currently working through a full college schedule at a good school, a difficult major, two minor degrees, maintaining a good GPA, and balance my sport/social life on top of it all. Do not let me be thought of as a giant time commitment, but a mutual dispersion of high sex drives. Also be assured that I will make every session count and love would love sending the occasional photo to tease you at work whenever you might ask or I just have been feeling frisky that day. Who wouldn't with the constant reminder that that night might give the opportunity to show off my glistening stiff rod to an equally kinky woman. I also will work a very good internship between semesters that I loved to take ""extended bathroom breaks"" on. ;)

A few of my kinks:

-Joi (audio gets me off really badly)

-Forced anal (I have toys)

-Cbt

-Bondage

-Control/Power plays

-Verbal Degration &lt;---

-Honesty

-Trying new things!!

For a general sense of what I look like, it should be clear that I am very fit, good looking, well endowed (7""), and come with plenty of toys to let you explore my body with to your heart's content. I also would have no problem sculpting my body for your pleasure! I will GLADLY get a haircut, work out one area of my body more, wear different clothes, trim my pubic hair, etc. in order to make you happy. I really want to be genuine about this whole experience.

It should be stated, that this whole experience isn't something that would start TONIGHT. I have no interest in forcing this type of thing on anyone who isn't ready for it, and wouldn't go balls deep (pardon the pun) into a hardcore domination system with somebody I just met. I have had many people try to make me believe they're ""The perfect Mistress"" and ""You need to submit now to show your loyalty"", and I'm sorry, but that's just bullshit, and I KNOW you're never going to send me anything but a text message and you're actually a man pretending to be a woman to get some exclusive nudes of some guy on the internet. If you're going to message me like that, at least be fucking honest with me and tell me you're not a woman to start (phew, sorry for rant).

What I would hope from in you:

-Have a Mic and a good voice (this is really big for me, anything else is optional) (/r/gonewildaudio is how I spend many nights)

-Dominant personality

-Have be open to using kik/snapchat/skype, etc to communicate

-Be a fun and open individual at heart, but a kinky mess everywhere else

-Be cute looking (especially if you decide to send pictures/skype back)

-Located in Boston/Providence area (again, entirely optional)

-Similar timezone (US EAST)

I hope that somebody reads this, or even relates with what I have here. I have so many hopes to where this might go that I really would enjoy talking over with you. Perhaps you're even near Boston, or Providence and we could transition this to a real life experience should we progress that well. I am really an open guy and would love to hear more feedback from you in our initial conversation to decide if this will work out between us.

TL;DR I am looking for a Mistress that I'd feel genuinely excited to hold in a butt plug in for all day.

Thanks for your time.

5i8n3p,8,2016-12-13,How can I network in Korea as a college student?,conrad141,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/5i8n3p/how_can_i_network_in_korea_as_a_college_student/,"Hi guys. I'm a junior spending a year at PNU this year studying computer engineering. I also lived here previously for a year in high school so I have a relatively decent command of the language as well. Anyways, I was hoping while I was here I could maybe do some networking or apply for some internships maybe, but it seems pretty much all internships in my field are only looking for seniors who are about to graduate. After this year I will still have 1.5-2 years probably before I finish my degree in the US, so this isn't exactly an option. Is there any good way I could potentially get my foot in the door with some of these companies while I'm here or at least make a few connections that might help in a year or two when I will actually be eligible for these internships or possibly a job? I know it can be tough to get a job outside of teaching here, so I want to do everything I can while I'm still physically here in the country. I'm working on getting my TOPIK up again after I got a little worse at Korean when I was starting college in the states, because I know that will be important. I suppose I should probably work on writing a Korean resume but I'm not really sure where to start with that. What else can I do?"
5i9nap,4,2016-12-14,Looking for advice!,Wienegy,Austria,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/5i9nap/looking_for_advice/,"Hello everyone! I just found this subreddit last night and started to look around for advice regarding German and jobs here in Vienna. I thought of posting maybe it is easier. I have some questions and I hope there are people here who know how to get those things done:

1- I have been living in Vienna for almost a year and a half. had the b1 certificate last year and since then haven't studied it but rather practicing. I am free now to study it again to get back in my job track I used to have back home. My question is what is the best place to study the language and practice it for work and life and not only the exam?

2- I have been working on water management issues and environmental research as a research assistant. I am finishing up my masters although it took me awhile due to illness. I have come to this city and had to pick any job to afford living, but now I am tired of it and decided to get back on the track. I am applying everywhere and though of looking for internship, but still don't know the chances. I would appreciate it if anyone has an advice of what's easy to get and the options I could rely on.

Thanks in advance to everyone!"

----------------------------------

Now before anyone starts crying bloody murder over Nigeria and Egypt, let me try to explain the drastic price increases.

Strong downward macroeconomic pressure on Nigeria's currency, the Naira, meant that the Nigerian Central Bank was unable to protect its currency's pegged value to the Dollar. On June 20 this year, the Central Bank abandoned the pegged value, allowing the Naira to float and plummet ~40%.

Similarly, the Egyptian government devalued the Egyptian Pound on November 3, abandoning its previous peg of 8.8 XUSD.

Hence the new prices are in line with forex trends, albeit late. Remember the Ukrainian loophole? Arbitrage opportunities often arise when merchants fail to adjust overseas prices accordingly in a timely fashion. ~~Maybe KLab hired a new intern to read the newspapers?~~

All the other price changes listed here are also in line with current forex trends. Of course KLab never seems to want to lower the prices in countries where love gems are overpriced, e.g. Australia."
5iaokq,11,2016-12-14,Deciding between hacking and game dev as a career - need help,The_Grey_Wolf,HowToHack,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/5iaokq/deciding_between_hacking_and_game_dev_as_a_career/,"Hello guys,

I'm studying IT and around this time next year I'll have to make a decision where to take my internship. I have 2 paths that appeal to me the most - game dev and hacking.

I liked games since I was a kid. When I grew older, I wanted to make them. But, since I actually made a few prototypes and applied for one job at a company which gave me 2 weeks to make a small game, I know what it means to have ""crunch time"". I also heard that sometimes you have about a month or two of ""crunch time"", where you work 12 hrs a day, 7 days a week - which is not appealing to me. I don't mind working over the weekends when I want it, but I don't want to be forced to work over the weekends and when I'm older and when I have a family I want my weekends to be free.

Alongside game dev, I've always been interested in hacking. I've read ""Ghost in the Wires"" about 6 years ago. The main reason why is saftey - if I can hack, I can best protect myself and others because I know how bad guys think. Saftey is really important for me, as I also train Wing Chun, just in case someone tries to hurt me or someone I care about. Secondly, the world becomes my playground. Thirdly, I really like the idea that the knowledge should be free and that code should be open, so I really really like that mindset.

As for what I'm currently doing, I'm learning C++, I read the book ""Code"" and I'm investing time in learning computer-based skills day in, day out. I know to read assembly, but I don't know a lot about newtorking or operating systems yet.

I have 3 questions:

1) What's the crossover between hacking and game dev? What are the areas where they intersect (I'll learn these first - I'm already learning C++)?

2) What do you like most about your job as a hacker? What jobs are avaliable there (I have a vauge idea - pentesters, malware analysts,...)? Do you have a 40-hour work-week? 

3) Can you start your own information security consulting company? It would be great for me if I could start my own company, so that's why I ask.

4) How does this job (whatever it is - pentesting, malware anlysis,...) help the world? A really big factor for me is knowing that I'm helping someone. In game dev, well, I can motivate/help someone through the ideas in my game, but I'd like to know - how is Info Sec helping the world?

If you have anything to add, please do.

Thanks in advance!"

I can login from my computer and browse for shows, but when I press play the player will crash after loading for a bit and a ""Sorry, we ran into a problem.

I have tried restarting the player, the webpage, signing out and logging in again, restarting my computer, my wi-fi network... pretty much everything.

A little background info. I'm 25, bring home a bit over $3000 a month after taxes, benefits, retirement contributions, etc. I've worked there about 2 years as an intern and 3 years as an intern.

I have no student loans, car payments, or other debt besides a small personal loan from my credit union that I used to build credit in order to buy a house. The personal loan is pretty much paid off, freeing up $200 a month. 

I just moved from a rental house ($900/month) to a home I've purchased ($100,000 with $700 a month payments) which frees up another $200 a month.

I'd like to use that $400 a month (at least) to put towards paying off my house as quickly as possible, but I'm unsure of the best way to do this. The obvious option is to cut an extra check each month towards the principal, but would I get the same net result if I put that money in a savings account every month and used it to pay off the mortgage in a lump sum down the road? This would have the added bonus of being a substantial ""apocalyptic emergency"" account if I really needed it. Are there other smarter ways of using this money that I haven't considered?

**Background** by /u/cammusbread

*MY WOMAN* is the third full-length album by Asheville-via-St Louis indie rock artist Angel Olsen. It was recorded in Los Angeles and released on September 2nd, 2016. Olsen started her career as a member of Bonnie “Prince” Billy’s band The Babblers. After releasing a couple of EPs in 2010 (*Strange Cacti* and *Lady in the Waterpark*), she released her first full length in 2012, *Half Way Home* – an album that reviewer Lindsay Zoladz called “a surreal and lyrical collection of folk songs that sounded a bit like Vashti Bunyan playing a midnight game of Ouija.” That’s fair: the album is desolate yet strongly enticing and comforting at the same time. Olsen followed this up two years later with *Burn Your Fire For No Witness*, which saw her come a lot more into her own with regards to her songwriting ability. Much of the sparse folk was replaced with poppier, psychier and more powerful tracks – but still, the slower moments on the album demonstrated a lingering part of Olsen that still appreciated the reflectiveness and melancholy of her beginnings. At this point, you would have been hard pressed to find a piece on Olsen’s music that didn’t contain the term “lo-fi”.

Which is why, when Olsen announced her new album in June, the first single “Intern” was wonderfully out-of-place. A breathy, reverb-coated synthpop intro track accompanied by a video of Angel in a silver tinsel wig and headset microphone is just about the opposite of what anyone expected. If that wasn’t confusing enough; her next single, the impeccable “Shut Up Kiss Me”, wouldn’t have sounded out of place (at least musically) on *Burn Your Fire* (and yet she kept the wig for the video, and added a sequin dress and roller skates). The final single, “Sister”, is an anthemic centerpiece and cathartic journey. Quite the odd bunch of tracks, really, and it left many guessing as to the direction the overall album was going to take. If one thing was certain, it was that the contemplative isolate we saw before had had a change of heart, at some point.

**Album Review** by /u/cammusbread 

No one likes to be typecast, not even if said type produces fantastic results for them. For some, trying to escape the narrative others are writing for them proves too difficult, but for me the truly exceptional move past it and produce something even better. That is what I believe Angel Olsen has achieved with her recent LP, *MY WOMAN*, and it is a benchmark for other artists looking to change, to experiment, to deviate from their norm. Her previous albums, the charming and tight *Half Way Home* (2012) and the stunningly sombre *Burn Your Fire For No Witness* (2014), displayed an emotional girl with a voice that kicked ass and broke hearts. Lyrics like “I need you to be the one to call” (from “The Waiting”) summarized the sort of role Olsen seemed to play – proud and strong but with a classic vulnerability. And yet, something I find interesting is the last line of “Windows” off *Burn Your Fire*: “Won’t you open a window sometimes?/What’s so wrong with the light?”

Maybe not light per se, but a thematic upturn was most definitely embraced with *MY WOMAN*. The very first track, “Intern”, might be the first of her songs to noticeably feature a synth. It was released as a single, and it certainly got me excited at the prospect of a full synthpop album. I mean, there was little chance of that actually happening, but there’s no way it wouldn’t be at least interesting – since when would you expect this Cohenette to croon over warm electrotones? But it just works. I love the way she layers her vocals in this song, they’re sung so breathily and tenderly and they still maintain the vibrato that makes her voice so powerful. The synths and the vocals intertwine as the track floats on: “Pick up the phone ‘cause I swear it’s the last time”, Olsen promises. It’s highly likely she was referring to the use of a synthesizer in one of her songs.

Then, suddenly, the song is over and you almost feel like you’ve been taken to a *Burn Your Fire* bonus cut, in “Never Be Mine”. Listening closely, the track is kind of reminiscent of something off of a Spector Girl Group best of compilation. The chord progression is literally just a one-four-five, and the drums kicking in takes you right back to the sockhop. It’s a nice little pastiche, but again, fans of Olsen might be taken aback. Why is this instrumental so overtly cheery? Where’s the picking? I couldn’t even picture listening to this while driving past a farm at night. It’s totally atypical for her, and it absolutely fits the ideals the album is trying to get across to the listener: Angel is strong, moreso than she’d have you believe, and moreso than the Shangri-Las- or Ronnettes-type artists she’s emulating portrayed womankind as.

Next, Olsen kicks you right in the seat of your pants with one of the best songs of the year, decade, century, whatever. “Shut Up Kiss Me” should be sealed in a time capsule and held on Svalbard for safekeeping. For anyone looking to understand how Olsen has managed to captivate so many with her voice, this is the best place to start. Over a similar instrumental to the previous track, but with more of the gusto and guitar power from *BYF*, Olsen croons, cries, screams and demands you to shut up and listen (or kiss her or whatever). It’s female vulnerability juxtaposed with girl power (“Still out there hoping to be found” versus “Shut up! Kiss me! Hold me tight!”), coming to a swell after the last chorus with her *screaming* her heart out in her simultaneously frenzied and commanding tone. And above all that it’s catchy as hell. I truly and honestly get chills every time I hear it – and I’ve heard it about 100 times by now.

Surely by comparison anything else you’d hear on the album is going to suffer in comparison, at least with the way I’ve hyped up the track. In my opinion that’s a fair assessment of the next two tracks, “Give It Up” and “Not Gonna Kill You”. They continue the healthy blend of Olsen’s comfortable indie rockisms and a girl group-like structure, and also mark the end of the first half of the album. There’s nothing really wrong with them, I actually like them a lot. In particular, the progressive percussion and gospel-referencing lyrics of the latter track are great (“Oh let the light shine in!”). But in my mind I think they’re the low point of the album (Again, not that low! Still great! Just not quite as great as what we saw before).

“Heart Shaped Face” kicks off the second half by slowing this thing right down – indeed, the second half of the album is 12 minutes longer than the first. Here, Olsen takes pause and begins to reflect on past relationships, on love faded over time, and on her own insecurities. Lyrically, the track is most similar to the themes and messages from her previous works: “Was it me you were thinking of...Or was it another/With a heart shaped face”, she asks the subject. “And the truth never lives/In the story of words we say” – wow. She beautifully points out how easy it is to romanticize our past relationships, how hard it is to leave when we think we can return to what we had before. The lyrics are really heartbreaking and worth a look over for this one, it’s really some of her best work. All the while, the well-crafted and shimmering guitars punctuate each of her remarks, in a style that Courtney Barnett fans will certainly enjoy.

This brings us to the nearly 8 minutes long “Sister”, which is true to its name as a beautiful and strong monument to the power of sorority. After the end of her relationships, Olsen recognizes the significance of that love not being placed elsewhere, until she realizes: “Turned around and then it’s there/All the love I thought was gone”. In times like these, a sister is a valuable companion. The song serves as a centrepiece of sorts, chugging along until about the 3 minute mark when what I think of as the ‘extended bridge’ comes in, with those nice leading fifth and seventh chords: “I want to know you/I want to show you.../Live it through your eyes/Piece us together”, she tells her sister. It’s a different sort of love to the romantic counterpart, but she shares the belief that sisterly love makes the two a part of each other, and it’s so especially important in times like these. From then on, the song shifts into this “wondrous journey” that just gets more and more exciting and rises to a fever pitch. “All my life I thought I’d change” she repeats over and over. When the climax finally arrives, with Olsen airily warbling in the background behind the frantic guitar, it’s as if Olsen finally realizes the self-assurance she’s being yearning for with the help of her sister. It’s a beautiful moment.

The following track, “Those Were The Days” is very, *very* aptly named. Like, to the point that it’s a bit of a cliché. Olsen reminisces about her relationship, but it’s not a “why won’t he call me” song, it’s not a “I miss you please come back to me” plea – it’s a confident sort of reflection, the one where she is genuinely okay with the end of what the two of them had. “Will you ever know the same love that I’ve known?” Not exactly a question an insecure woman would ask her ex. It’s a necessary break between the two longest songs on the album, and musically she keeps everything nice and tight over lovely major sevenths and what I believe is a bell that sounds dope as hell.

“Woman” is Olsen coming full circle. She’s finally realized the power of sisterhood, the power of womanhood, and more importantly the value of self – in other words, she’s let go. You hear it all the time, and after such a meaningful relationship as Olsen has seemed to have had (Remember “Shut Up Kiss Me”? God that track is so fucking sick), it’s difficult to do. Here she does it, and she procures nothing but absolute power in the track. We can hear what is probably a synth, but sounds more like a string section being played through a gramophone (in a totally pretty way), delicately ebb and flow. The bassline is simple here, the main focus is the lightly sung yet poignant and deliberate voice. We don’t even hear a guitar for nearly three minutes, but when it comes in it starts the best minute of music you may hear all year. Olsen grows more bold: “Tell me what I couldn’t do/Tell me that love isn’t true” as the instrumental grows (lots of crescendos on this LP. My opinion? Shows growth :\^)) until she quite literally “dares you to understand/What makes me a woman”. This is a genuine contender for one of the best sung lines in the history of music – the way the track just explodes the second she finishes the word “underSTAAAAAAAAAND”, the way her voice just takes your breath away... it’s unreal. I had the pleasure of seeing Angel live in Toronto this past September, and I waited all night for her to play this – she waited until the encore, and when she reached this part of the song I well and truly cried. It was absolutely transcendent, as it was written to be.

“Pops” is an afterthought – the piano-and-vocals track (super rare for Angel, and makes the track super sincere) is coated in reverb. It’s a tear-jerker, and the only moment that makes you question the message of the album. We just heard Olsen daring her lover to understand her womanhood, and now we get stuff like “Baby don’t leave, please believe me/Couldn’t love ‘em if I tried to/No one understands me like you”. What’s going on? Well, in my view, the last lines of the song make it seem as if it’s not really Olsen as the speaker. “I’ll be the thing that lives in the dream when it’s gone”, she says. To me, it seems as if the speaker is the *idea* of longing, of wanting to return to what you had. Or, it could be that on some level, Olsen really is still broken up over the relationship, despite her assertions to the contrary. Whatever the case, it certainly makes “Pops” interesting in the context of the album.

In continuing with the theme of *MY WOMAN* marking a stylistic shift for Olsen, she described it in an interview with BBC 4 program *Woman’s Hour* as the first album of hers that was “truly autobiographical”. I think that was clear, with the purity and power of the emotions and thoughts conveyed by the music. There’s no way that something this gut wrenching, this defiant, this soul-baringly raw, was conceived off of anything other than the tumultuous experiences in a woman’s life. The way that the first half was structured as more stereotypically feminine and vulnerable, and then completely transitioned to a braver, more confident, and stronger representation of womanhood, is almost like an allegory for Olsen’s career thus far. For Olsen, *MY WOMAN* is another notch in the proverbial “stunning albums” belt, but it’s one that took a lot of soul-searching to make.

**Favorite Lyrics** by /u/cammusbread 

&gt;Everyone I know has got their own ideal

&gt;I just wanna be alive, make something real

&gt;Doesn’t matter who you are or what you do

&gt;Something in the work will make a fool of you

* Intern

&gt;I could make it all disappear

&gt;You could feed me all of your fears

&gt;We could end all this pain right here

&gt;We could rewind all of those tears

* Shut Up Kiss Me

&gt;I've seen you changing

&gt;I've seen you aging

&gt;And I learned how to turn my head

&gt;And I learned how to walk away

&gt;And the truth never really lives

&gt;In the story of words we say

* Heart Shaped Face

&gt;And I could still breathe for you

&gt;Open up and scream for you

&gt;Tell me what I wouldn’t do

&gt;Tell me that love isn’t true

&gt; I dare you to understand, what makes me a woman

* Woman

**Talking Points** by /u/cammusbread 

* What do you think the meaning of “Pops” is given the context of the album?

* Do you find Olsen’s more explicitly romantic lyricism more or less relatable? Do you think it’s better or worse than the lyrics on her previous efforts? 

* What are some of your favourite examples of artists making significant thematic shifts to their songs?

* Do you think this is a feminist record? Does the personal nature of the album prevent it from being more universally applicable?

* Do you relate to this record? Has similar heartbreak happened in your life? Have you posted about it in the general discussion like everyone else in the world?

My ex and I were together for about a year, however over the summer we had taken internships in different parts of the country. Everything seemed fine for the first three weeks, but around the fourth week of us being long distance. Her demeanor and attitude changed significantly. I tried to be supportive, and had set up a trip to visit her over the long 4th of july weekend anyway. When I got there she seemed distant, and at one point, told me that quote 'Don't you think having an affair would be fun?' 

I should have ended it there, but I just spent 7 hours and $600 to fly myself out to see her, so I brushed it off. Her fuse was shorter than usual, and at one point, she screamed at me for resting my hand on the shifter of the car while I was driving. The night before I my flight back, she left early (I had a hotel room for the night) claiming she had a ton of stuff to get done for work. A few hours later, she texts me claiming about how much she misses me, so on and so forth.

The rest of the summer goes by, and her behavior becomes more and more strange. At one point, we got into an argument, and I asked her if she wanted to break up. She yelled at me, claiming that I wasn't allowed to break up with her halfway across the country, and that we'd work it out.

Fast forward to the start of the school year. She comes over to visit my apartment, and drops the bomb on me that 'I wasn't entirely faithful' she refused to describe what hat happened, only explaining that ""I thought our relationship was falling apart."" 

But, like a complete and utter idiot, I tried to forgive her. She seemed apologetic, and said she felt guilty for what she had done. We ended up breaking up a few weeks later, because I realized I hated her for what she did, and that without trust, there was no point to the relationship.

However, two months out of it, I still can't seem to let go of what happened. I've managed to avoid even seeing her once (nor do I ever want to) since the breakup, let alone communicating with her, but I'm worried that I have trust issues that I may carry into my next relationship. 

The pain doesn't seem to have gotten any better, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice, or similar stories to share. I want to move on from what happened so badly, but I just don't know what to do.

**TL:DR: Ex played me like a fiddle, and then cheated on me while managing to make it somehow my fault. I'm still torn up about it 2 months after the breakup, and am looking for ways to help myself move on.**

How do I endure having to continuously decline invitations to parties, etc.?",throwaway209234823,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5icfpe/i_18f_am_starting_to_make_a_lot_of_connections_in/,"Instead of going to college this year, I started to intern and work for a very well-known photographer. He works with models. For the record -- I don't take pictures. I make short visual clips (think like, behind-the-scenes, or a moving picture), etc. 

He really loves my work and is starting to spread my name around. My mother also works in a high-end business environment and has also been telling her clients who I work for. Tomorrow, I'm doing a shoot with an interior designer. 

I have two ongoing problems. 

**The first one:** I don't like to socialize. I'm not a hermit. I have friends. I have a boyfriend. But I also suffer from depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Most days, I just want to stay home and read or play World of Warcraft or work on editing videos, etc. A lot of people have been inviting me to parties and events, and I don't want to go. We're in NYC, so there's something going on all of the time. 

I want to make friends, and there are moments where I wouldn't mind going out, but for the most part, I don't want to. Even the designer that I'm working with tomorrow informed me that there would be two interns around my age working with us. That's the complete opposite of what I want. I work better with adults. I don't mean this in a pretentious I'm-Better-Than-Everyone-My-Age type of way. That's just how my anxiety is. I even graduated high school early just so that I could get away from everyone. 

I'm not a misanthropist. I'm not a nihilist. I don't hate everyone. I don't think that I'm better than anyone. It's nothing like that. I'm just quiet, and shy, and private, and want to stick with my group of friends and boyfriend. The whole reason that I like doing these video shoots so much is that no one has to pay attention to me. I am invisible.

So, I guess my question is, how do I continuously decline these invites? Or do I just suck it up and go because this is the kind of industry that I'm getting myself into?

**The other problem** is that, I have no interest in letting anyone view my social media accounts. I know a lot of people who work for Teen Vogue and MTV who have no problem with their social media accounts being publicized. But I feel too.. seen? I'm planning on keeping mine private and then creating a few for work-related purposes. However, I feel like those would be too business-y and wouldn't let people see the ""true"" me, if that makes sense? I don't know what to do. 

This post is confusing. I don't even think that anyone is going to make it this far, but if you have, thank you.

*Edit:* It's not that I don't ""fit in"" or that I'm anxious about not being liked. I'm a very nonchalant, laid-back person and a lot of these people are hyper and excited and talk really loud. It just overwhelms me and drains my energy and it's the same reason that I wanted to get far away from high school, but I like doing and editing shoots. The photographer that I work with also loves me and wants me to learn from him, so I'm not going to stop doing this.

***EDIT***: I am also referring to coworkers incessantly asking me if I want to go to a museum with them or to a house party or to get coffee. Sometimes I go, sometimes I just want to go home and rest, and I just wanted advice on how to get that point across, since all I've been doing is coming up with excuses for why I can't go.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Am a very private/shy person, the work that I'm getting into is the complete opposite of that. Help."
5id504,1,2016-12-14,Huma After Clintonworld's Stunning Defeat - by William D. Cohan (Vanity Fair),ShaunaDorothy,Drudge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drudge/comments/5id504/huma_after_clintonworlds_stunning_defeat_by/,"Huma vs. the “Night Stalkers” After a stunning election loss, the knives appear to be out in Clintonworld

.......................

Maybe I’m just pissed off, but I really don’t give a shit about what happens to Huma to be honest with you,” one close adviser to Hillary Clinton told me recently. He was irked, in particular, at Abedin’s seemingly superfluous breach of decorum during a post-election event. On the day after Hillary Clinton’s stunning loss to Donald Trump, this person said, Abedin appeared within the rope line while Clinton greeted her morose and woebegone supporters. “You’re staff, O.K.?” this adviser continued. “Staff is staff. You’re not a principal.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign notes that Abedin was seated alongside the rest of the campaign’s senior leadership team that morning. Abedin declined an interview request.)

In the bizarre month since Clinton’s loss, few people besides the candidate herself have seen their fortunes overturned as significantly as has Abedin, 40, the glamorous and charismatic former vice-chair of the campaign. For two decades, Abedin has been a fixture inside Clinton’s inner circle; she began her career as a college-aged White House intern and rose to become Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. As a former adviser to Bill Clinton once put it to me, over time Abedin morphed into “a mini Hillary” herself. She wasn’t merely an aide, but rather an amalgamation of adviser, best friend, confidante, and perhaps even surrogate daughter. Abedin “inspires loyalty, and she’s loyal back,” one Clinton aide told Amy Chozick in her widely read dissection of Clintonworld for The New York Times Magazine, in 2014.

In fact, according to Chozick, Clinton appeared to countermand those who suggested that Abedin should be relegated on behalf of the sexting antics of her spouse, the randy former congressman Anthony Weiner. Clinton, Chozick reported at the time, appeared more concerned with quarantining the so-called “night stalkers”—sycophants and hangers-on from her many decades in public life—who might try to re-exert their influence. Abedin, meanwhile, was widely expected to get a big job inside a Clinton White House.

But amid Clinton’s stunning post-election hangover, some inside the inner circle wonder if Abedin became overwhelmed by the attention, and shut too many people out. “She was enjoying the red carpet and enjoying the photo spreads much too much in my opinion,” one Clinton insider told me. “She enjoyed being a celebrity too much.” The close Clinton adviser elaborated that Abedin and the other tight-knit circle of people may have suffocated Clinton, preventing the campaign from taking in outside counsel. “The real anger is toward Hillary’s inner circle,” the Clinton insider told me. “They reinforced all the bad habits.” For instance, the suggestion had been made that Clinton should show her gregarious side, by, for instance, appearing more often on The View. (She appeared once, but Bernie Sanders, her rival for the nomination, appeared a handful of times.)

According to this person, however, the inner circle nixed that idea. It seemed, this person elaborated, that even minor suggestions about changing the narrative fell on deaf ears. “Right away,” this person continued, “it was either regarded as an intrusion or a naïve suggestion or maybe someone has an agenda. And so people just stopped bothering. Where in most presidential campaigns the circle grows broader and broader, hers grew smaller and smaller.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign refutes this characterization, noting that the campaign may have had up to three times as many people on their plane during the election’s final weeks.)

In the month since the election, Abedin, once ubiquitous, has essentially vanished from public view. She was absent from the recent, and public, campaign exhumation that occurred at Harvard’s Kennedy School, during which her former colleagues tussled with Trump supporters such as Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski. Recently, the Daily Mail captured Abedin shopping at the Lululemon store on lower Fifth Avenue with her four-year-old son, Jordan, in tow. The story followed a report in the New York Post noting that Weiner, in the wake of his most recent sexting scandal, had cut short his rehab stay after about 30 days, supposedly because he ran out of money. (His family had wanted him to stay for 90 days, at a cost of around $1,000 per day, Richard Johnson reported in Page Six, and his parents reportedly took out a mortgage on their home to help him pay for the cost of the treatment.)

Compounding Weiner’s financial woes, in early December, the New York City Campaign Finance Board fined him more than $65,000 for a variety of infractions related to his mayoral campaign. Weiner apparently spent $600 of his campaign funds on televisions, another $1,539 on his personal dry-cleaning and cell-phone service, and more than $115,000 for a group of expenditures after the campaign was over. Weiner was also ordered to repay some $195,000 in matching campaign funds. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, is reportedly investigating Weiner’s latest round of sexting, along with the F.B.I. and the New York City police.

Aside from Weiner’s public mishegas, Abedin has her own problems—namely coming to grips with the blame directed at her for the new stash of Clinton e-mails that ended up on his personal computer and that became the focus of F.B.I. director James Comey’s now infamous late-October letter to Congress. In the wake of her loss, Clinton told donors that Comey’s letter had cost her the election. Fairly or not, many people blame Comey’s letter with abruptly changing the narrative about Clinton at the penultimate moment of the campaign (despite his subsequent November 6 letter saying nothing new of substance was found on the computer).

But perhaps Abedin’s biggest challenge is that she may soon have a new boss for virtually the first time in her life. The Clinton insider reiterated that Huma, who has spent 21 years at Clinton’s side, might need to prepare for the reality, moving forward, that her “juice” was “tied to Clinton’s ascendancy.” Nevertheless, this person continued, “she’s someone that will be sought after either personally or through business from many rich, very rich connected people.” He concluded: “She’ll do very well for herself.”

On December 15, Clinton is having a big party in Manhattan at the Plaza Hotel, once owned by Trump, for her campaign donors, as a sort of thank-you and keep-in-touch farewell. It is expected to cost more than $100,000 and be paid for with excess campaign funds. Clintonworld insiders will be interested to see if Abedin shows up or whether she chooses to skip the celebration to stay at home to nurse her wounds.

5id8y6,86,2016-12-14,"My Story (Super long post, sorry)",OrganistApostate,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5id8y6/my_story_super_long_post_sorry/,"Tl;dr – Growing up I built what I thought was a bullet proof testimony and became an uber TBM. Thanks to moving out of Utah, teaching with the missionaries, reading books from Deseret Book, and studying Isaiah, I deconstructed my testimony and escaped the cult. I still love pipe organs though.

**I needed to write this out at some point, and I figure I might as well share with all of you fellow heathens. Here is my story:**

I’m a sixth generation Mormon, born and raised in the heart of Morridor. However, despite the deep Mormon heritage, neither of my parents is from an ideal Mormon background. I’ll leave out details, but it is safe to say that the LDS church saved both of my parents.

Growing up I had a nearly perfect Mormon childhood. My family still had their fair share of rough patches though, including a younger sibling who was born with a terminal illness and lived only a few months. This was a difficult time for my parents and they leaned heavily on their religious beliefs. Following the death of my baby brother, my mother had an interaction with him in the temple. Because the experience was sacred to her I am not familiar with the full details, but as a young child there was no room for doubt in my mind that TSCC was true.

When I was in middle school I nevertheless began to question things privately. I couldn’t satisfactorily understand the reasons behind polygamy or the priesthood ban, and I wondered where I would be religiously had I been born into a different faith (e.g. Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism). I questioned why I could not understand what the Holy Ghost felt like. But I would now classify my doubts back then as a recognized lack of knowledge rather than a lack of belief.

Growing up I loved reading Chris Heimerdinger’s Tennis Shoes books. I got caught up in learning about Book of Mormon geography (strictly from one-sided apologetic sources, of course) and totally bought into the whole chiasmus thing. Akin to Hugh B. Brown’s “Profile of a Prophet” talk, I had a strong intellectual testimony of the Book of Mormon.

I was very much a cookie-cutter TBM teenager, complete with earning my Eagle Scout and Duty to God, but when I was getting closer to leaving on a mission I was still concerned about my inability to feel the spirit. During my freshmen year, one of my institute teachers changed that. He would say, “If you ever wonder about whether or not you are feeling the spirit, think of someone who you’re not a very big fan of. If you have a hard time feeling unkind thoughts about them, then you are feeling the spirit.” For some reason this clicked with me and allowed me to fully consider myself a TBM. I could finally sincerely say “I know the church is true.”

I served a mission in Hiroshima, Japan and my first year over there was absolute hell. But I fell in love with the food, culture and people. I had several experiences that were very faith-promoting and several experiences that added weight to my yet-to-be-acknowledged shelf. I also experienced sleep paralysis for the first time, which I interpreted as having been attacked by an evil spirit.

It was also during my mission that I finally felt I had received a witness of the Book of Mormon. At a zone conference we had discussed the importance of regularly applying the Moroni 10 promise. And so, on the bus ride home, I prayed for a witness of the Book of Mormon. As usual, I felt nothing. But the following morning I was studying 2 Nephi 2 and read verse 11: “For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so… all things must needs be a compound in one.” I remembered a previous conference where a member of the area presidency (now an apostle) had suggested that the genius of the phrase “compound in one” itself was a testimony to the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. I thought “I already know this is true.” As I focused on these thoughts and my emotions, I felt what I interpreted to be a spiritual witness that the book was indeed true.

Fast forward to after the mission and I moved up to Utah State to study physics. I continued to be uber TBM and served as the ward organist for a majority of my time up there. This is maybe unimportant, but I got to play the Logan Tabernacle organ (3rd largest in the state?) for a stake conference during my senior year and it was fantastic. Love that pipe organ! Also during my senior year I stumbled across the Race and the Priesthood essay on lds.org. I was ecstatic that the church was addressing complicated issues, but I also found the essay disconcerting when I read through it. Additionally, same-sex marriage was an especially hot-button issue at the time and, although I stood with the rank and file of the church, I knew that the only reason behind my opinion the direction of church leadership.

After graduation I moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico for an internship. (It was ironic after having lived in Hiroshima.) There were no YSA wards close by, so I attended a family ward and taught primary for a year. As I was still single, church was my social life and provided a support structure that I depended on.

Then I moved to the upper Midwest for graduate school. At first I was still a gung-ho TBM. Although I’ve always been uncomfortable with missionary work, people knew I was Mormon and I would invite curious friends to church or provide copies of the Book of Mormon. I was doing everything that I was supposed to be doing. However, being exposed to a non-Mormon culture and developing a social network outside of TSCC allowed me to widen my perspective of the world.

A large contributor to my shifting world view was a shift in political ideology. I don’t want to focus on politics, but I was raised in a political bubble where many democrats were the equivalent of Gadianton robbers and global warming was a hoax. Being in a climate science department, I eventually gave up on some of my mental gymnastics and admitted to myself that my parents were flat out wrong in some of their political views. (Again, I understand that this sub is not a place to discuss politics, but anyone who believes that climate change is a hoax is simply and apolitically wrong.) This was a big deal for me because my parents’ political views went hand-in-hand with their religious views and it was difficult to separate the two in my mind. Thus, my shifting political views naturally lead me to question every part of the ideology I had been raised in.

So, I started feeling uncomfortable with my religious beliefs. I felt restricted in my political views. I disliked that the church encouraged a societal and cultural homogeneity. I felt that many members used their religious beliefs to justify an unwillingness to compromise with or even respect differing perspectives. Being back in a YSA ward made me realize how much the church infantilizes its single members. I looked at many of my nonmember friends and realized that they were living happier and more fulfilled lives than so many active Mormons. I realized that I didn’t want to share the gospel with some people because they were better off without it.

During this first year in the Midwest, I had been sitting in on lessons with one of the missionaries’ investigators. This investigator’s questions reminded me of myself and brought back many of the doubts I had all the way back in middle school. I realized that I still did not have answers to those doubts. I had a strange feeling that my membership in the church was somehow connected to the decision of this investigator. When he declined the invitation to get baptized, I knew that I would never have been a member had I not been born into the church.

In February 2015 I stopped paying tithing. At this point I had several philosophical issues with the church and decided that I needed to figure out what I actually believed before I could start paying tithing again. (Of course I did place tithing funds aside so that I could make the back payment once I figured stuff out.) I considered the nature of truth and made the connection that scientific truth does not require constant repetition to maintain a conviction of its truthfulness. Why should metaphysical truth be different than physical truth?

In March I stopped wearing garments, except for Sundays and visits to Utah. My reasoning was that stressing constant habits (e.g. daily prayer, daily scripture study, wearing garments, etc.) fit much too well with how I imagined brainwashing would work. I didn’t think I was brainwashed, but I needed distance from the church in order to reevaluate my beliefs. Removing the garments was one method of gaining that distance. (Attending ward activities without wearing garments was nerve racking for the first few months, but the increased comfort and lack of irritated leg hair was a huge bonus.)

About this time I picked up on a few more details about polygamy and seer stone stuff, so I decided that I needed to take a deeper look into church history. In June 2015 I ordered Rough Stone Rolling off of Amazon. As it was a non-hagiographic biography sold by Deseret Book, it was the perfect choice. (I wasn’t brave enough to make the leap to No Man Knows My History.) I finished the book within a month and came away with two main takeaways: 1) Joseph Smith was good at making stuff up (e.g. Zelph) and 2) early church members were crazy (e.g. speaking in tongues).

By this point I was dreading church for a variety of reasons. Most of my good friends in the ward were either graduating and moving, or getting married; I absolutely hated my calling as “building coordinator” (i.e. toilet-cleaning volunteer seeker); and the bishopric got switched up and started heading in the “everyone-needs-to-date-and-get-married” direction. Church was not fulfilling and my nonmember friends were better influences in my life than a majority of the members in my ward.

Around July 2015 I was put in the Sunday school and released (hallelujah!) from my toilet-cleaning calling. I distinctly remember teaching a Sunday school lesson that month and I finished the lesson with a sincere testimony. I still believed. But I knew that the Book of Mormon was the only thing keeping me in the church. I knew that I needed to re-inspect my faith in the Book of Mormon.

I had two reasons why I believed in the Book of Mormon, the first of which was that I had found answers to personal questions within its pages. Unfortunately, I read The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins a couple of years earlier and was struck by one of the character’s insistence that he could find answers to his problems by reading Robinson Crusoe. One evening as I was starting to reevaluate my faith in the Book of Mormon, I felt drawn to a copy of Dune sitting on my shelf. I ended up reading an excerpt in Dune that was directly relatable to the questions that were on my mind. And so I accepted the notion that books contain ideas and ideas answer questions. The Book of Mormon perhaps wasn’t as special as I had believed.

The second reason why I believed in the Book of Mormon was due to intellectual reasons including chiasmus, the complex literary components, and the plethora of evidences flaunted by apologists. RSR introduced me to some of the theories surrounding the authorship of the Book of Mormon, and I began to delve into some Wikipedia articles (gasp!) dealing with the Book of Mormon. (I still wasn’t brave enough to search out any anti-Mormon websites.) I found copies of A View of the Hebrews and The Late War and soon began to realize that none of the ideas in the Book of Mormon were unique. I discovered that all of the evidence in favor of the Book of Mormon seemed ridiculous when you had both sides. I came up with the preposterous hypothesis that chiasmus was a side-effect of mimicking scripture. To test this hypothesis I looked up the Monty Python scene with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Sure enough, the fictional scripture quoted in that scene is riddled with chiasmus.

Around this time I also began listening to Mormon Stories, starting with the [Sandra Tanner interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W64Ntsea6uw). By listening to Sandra Tanner, reading about Fawn Brodie, and learning about other “anti-Mormon” figureheads, it seemed like they were sincere, down-to-earth people. I found that I could relate to their stories much more than with the typical general authority.

In a last ditch effort to save my testimony, I began an in depth study of the book of Isaiah. I figured that if any book of scripture had the power to convince me that the church was true, Isaiah was it. But the more I studied Isaiah and compared the KJV, NASB, JST, and BoM versions, the more convinced I became that the Book of Mormon was a conglomeration of plagiarizations. In August 2015 I again taught a lesson in Sunday school. At the end of my lesson I awkwardly stumbled over my words as I tried to share a sincere testimony. I no longer believed any of what I was supposed to believe.

Although I didn’t have a testimony at this point, I was still uncertain in my unbelief. But I had not yet stumbled across Jeremy Runnell’s [CES letter](http://cesletter.org/). (I want to say that I first heard about the CES letter from the [Zelph on the Shelf Mormon Stories episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn5Hcs1PunE).) Once I found it there wasn’t much new material for me, with the exception of the Book of Abraham. I was dumbfounded that I had never before questioned the Book of Abraham when it was so obviously a fabrication. (My focus had entirely been on the Book of Mormon.) Despite having seen the majority of the information previously, the CES letter allowed me to see everything laid out. Instead of simply not believing, I knew that TSCC was not what it claimed to be.

Over the next few months I became very sporadic in my church attendance. As everyone on here can relate, I started reading any church-related information that I could get my hands on. I finished my study of Isaiah and gained nothing more than a respect for ancient Hebrew literature. That fall I experienced another episode of sleep paralysis and, since I didn’t panic, I actually had fun with not being able to move for a minute or two. Then I read up on what sleep paralysis actually is. As I submitted every reason to believe to critical analysis, every reason to believe in TSCC evaporated into thin air. I felt like I was watching my foundation of rock wash away like sand and there was nothing I could do to stop it. The single reason to believe that I could not discount was my mother’s experience in the temple; but I had to admit that those types of supernatural experiences are not unique to the Mormondom.

In April 2016 I started going back to church since part of me still wanted to make it work. The church had provided so much to my family but I was still weighing the cost. Leaving behind my tribe of six generations was painful. I felt hurt and betrayed and conflicted and, for a few personal reasons, I continued to attend. I started playing the organ for my ward since I didn’t mind trading a couple hours on Sundays for access to the organ during the week. But church was never the same and the internal conflict made me feel like I was losing my mind. (Luckily, I found this amazing sub about that time.)

In May I publicly came out with my unbelief. It rocked my family’s world. But it allowed me to start living my life without hiding. And I continued playing the organ as a nonbeliever.

In September I notified the bishopric that I would not be playing the organ after General Conference. I decided to watch October’s conference, hoping that something would be different, but knowing that I was done. I made it until Ballard’s Sunday morning talk. “Where will you go?” was my answer. It wasn’t the answer that I wanted but it was the answer that I knew I was getting. After listening to Ballard for a couple of minutes I cussed him out, turned off conference, and went straight to [quitmormon.com](https://quitmormon.com/#/). My resignation was processed in less than a week.

I am a male in my early 20s moving to the city for the first time ideally at the beginning of February. I lived in the city last summer for an internship and would prefer to again be close to my work (no further north than 110th street ish while working out of midtown.)

I am a quiet person but quickly contrast that with enjoying to go out around the city a lot and having a good time. I prefer to keep it quiet on week nights and enjoy the weekends inside or out alone or with friends. Will be working normal hours (9-6/7).

Working as a consultant from a technology background, can BS about anything science, technology, sci-fi, or popular TV and movie related. Would like to think that I am easy to get along with based on lack of confrontation with previous roommates.

Message me with details as to the type of person/apartment you're looking for to see if we would be a good fit!

EDIT: Would not mind going as low as $1200 per month each based on your needs and what we could find!"

Also, what are the best dorms overall for freshman men? Are you allowed to choose your roommates? 

For any of you who are engineering students, what is it like to study engineering there? What is freshman year like? How hands-on are the classes and are there any internship opportunities available? What would be your recommendations or tips for an engineering student?

I currently have two offers I'm struggling to navigate through. 
The first is at M&amp;T Bank as a web developer, I was an intern there in the summer and the team has really grown on me. We've even discussed me joining the team's personal business as a developer regardless of where I go. The work is fun, I enjoy it, but it's very niche and won't be very applicable if I ever change jobs. A lot of the work is done in Coldfusion though a switch to Node.js is planned for the future. Base salary is 85k, I'm still interning their now so they would bump me to full time now and I'd end up making   8k once you take out taxes before starting full time. Their 401k plan is match 6% for 6% and then an extra 2% at the end of the year. Paid time off is 4 weeks and they are pretty flexible about working from home. Raises are pretty normal at the end of the year, but are based on performance. I would live in Baltimore, MD. 

The second job is at Capital One in a technology rotational program, each rotation is one year and you work on a different project and team each year. The base salary is 94k, starting bonus of 10k tax free, relocation assistance at 1.5k tax free and a performance based bonus that would probably end up being in the range of 3-5k. If you contribute 6% to your 401k they match at 7.5%. The job would be located out of McLean, VA but I would probably live in Arlington, VA. Paid time off is 3 weeks, they are also flexible on working from home. Same as the previous, raises are normal but based on performance. Most of the work would be done in Java and it would be a brand new system, walking in blind. 

I have 9k in student debt currently, but no other debt, I do not even own a credit card yet, plan on getting one just to start building solid credit. I don't currently own a vehicle, though I plan on purchasing a used one for cash my first year working. I don't mind having a roommate wherever I live, in fact I'd prefer it my first year or two. I have no dependents, I'm in a serious relationship, but we have no plan of getting married for at least 2-3 years. 

Obviously I know I have to make the choice, but I'd appreciate any advice people could send my way. It's a tough choice to make."

Me and my ex broke up after 6 months a few months back. We'd known each other 4 years so the break up was difficult. Long story short, she didn't feel she was in the right place for a relationship and was about to start uni. I understood but despite this we continued to talk and message back and forth etc. 

However,  I felt I was just being strung along, she'd suddenly want to meet up and want to get back together and then when we'd see each other she'd feel different.

Seeing her on my social feeds just kills me, she'd send me a pic of her wearing some of clothes of mine she still has and then won't reply for weeks. I've just landed an internship in a new country and I want to move on with my life.

I feel she's dragging me down, so today I got fed up of being strung along and removed/unfollowed her from everything that I was on my phone.

But.. I'm feeling guilty, maybe I was too harsh? Has anyone done something similar, in terms of cutting off their ex? Was I right to do this?

Thank you"

I'm still looking for one, and I have a problem. I really want to smoke again. In a few days it will be winter break and I will have all the time in the world. I was at around 2 or 3 bowls per day when I quit. I haven't had any problems or negative effects except whenever I'm doing something I enjoy, I think to myself, ""Yeah this is cool, but man, it would be even better if I were high.""

Watching a movie? Going out? Having a quiet dinner? Hanging out with a few friends? Sculpting (a hobby)? The worst one is playing video games. Man I love to get high and play some video games.

This isn't the first time I've quit. I didn't smoke for the entire year of 2013, and I had similar problems/thoughts. The only reason I didn't start up again was, during that time, there was a possibility I would be randomly drug tested. (For context, I was managing a restaurant, and they kept telling me that they would 'get around to drug testing me some day.')

In the past two months I've tried drinking, which gives a nice high, but the next day is hell and it's something like 1000 calories to get where I want to be drunk-wise, and I'm also trying to lose some weight. So drinking more than once a month or so is not a good solution. I've also tried smoking cigarettes, and let me tell you, cigarettes are a *terrible* substitute for toking (don't worry, no more cigarettes for me, they don't even work, why do people smoke these things?).

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading that vent. Here's my question-- how do you deal with the temptations? I've tried occupying my time with things, activities, and loved ones. It always comes back to the thought, ""Sure, ____ is nice, but it would be even better if I could get high.""

5ifvmi,0,2016-12-15,Huma After Clintonworld's Stunning Defeat - by William D. Cohan (Vanity Fair),ShaunaDorothy,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/5ifvmi/huma_after_clintonworlds_stunning_defeat_by/,"Huma vs. the “Night Stalkers” After a stunning election loss, the knives appear to be out in Clintonworld

.......................

""Maybe I’m just pissed off, but I really don’t give a shit about what happens to Huma to be honest with you,” one close adviser to Hillary Clinton told me recently. He was irked, in particular, at Abedin’s seemingly superfluous breach of decorum during a post-election event. On the day after Hillary Clinton’s stunning loss to Donald Trump, this person said, Abedin appeared within the rope line while Clinton greeted her morose and woebegone supporters. “You’re staff, O.K.?” this adviser continued. “Staff is staff. You’re not a principal.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign notes that Abedin was seated alongside the rest of the campaign’s senior leadership team that morning. Abedin declined an interview request.)

In the bizarre month since Clinton’s loss, few people besides the candidate herself have seen their fortunes overturned as significantly as has Abedin, 40, the glamorous and charismatic former vice-chair of the campaign. For two decades, Abedin has been a fixture inside Clinton’s inner circle; she began her career as a college-aged White House intern and rose to become Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. As a former adviser to Bill Clinton once put it to me, over time Abedin morphed into “a mini Hillary” herself. She wasn’t merely an aide, but rather an amalgamation of adviser, best friend, confidante, and perhaps even surrogate daughter. Abedin “inspires loyalty, and she’s loyal back,” one Clinton aide told Amy Chozick in her widely read dissection of Clintonworld for The New York Times Magazine, in 2014.

In fact, according to Chozick, Clinton appeared to countermand those who suggested that Abedin should be relegated on behalf of the sexting antics of her spouse, the randy former congressman Anthony Weiner. Clinton, Chozick reported at the time, appeared more concerned with quarantining the so-called “night stalkers”—sycophants and hangers-on from her many decades in public life—who might try to re-exert their influence. Abedin, meanwhile, was widely expected to get a big job inside a Clinton White House.

But amid Clinton’s stunning post-election hangover, some inside the inner circle wonder if Abedin became overwhelmed by the attention, and shut too many people out. “She was enjoying the red carpet and enjoying the photo spreads much too much in my opinion,” one Clinton insider told me. “She enjoyed being a celebrity too much.” The close Clinton adviser elaborated that Abedin and the other tight-knit circle of people may have suffocated Clinton, preventing the campaign from taking in outside counsel. “The real anger is toward Hillary’s inner circle,” the Clinton insider told me. “They reinforced all the bad habits.” For instance, the suggestion had been made that Clinton should show her gregarious side, by, for instance, appearing more often on The View. (She appeared once, but Bernie Sanders, her rival for the nomination, appeared a handful of times.)

According to this person, however, the inner circle nixed that idea. It seemed, this person elaborated, that even minor suggestions about changing the narrative fell on deaf ears. “Right away,” this person continued, “it was either regarded as an intrusion or a naïve suggestion or maybe someone has an agenda. And so people just stopped bothering. Where in most presidential campaigns the circle grows broader and broader, hers grew smaller and smaller.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign refutes this characterization, noting that the campaign may have had up to three times as many people on their plane during the election’s final weeks.)

In the month since the election, Abedin, once ubiquitous, has essentially vanished from public view. She was absent from the recent, and public, campaign exhumation that occurred at Harvard’s Kennedy School, during which her former colleagues tussled with Trump supporters such as Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski. Recently, the Daily Mail captured Abedin shopping at the Lululemon store on lower Fifth Avenue with her four-year-old son, Jordan, in tow. The story followed a report in the New York Post noting that Weiner, in the wake of his most recent sexting scandal, had cut short his rehab stay after about 30 days, supposedly because he ran out of money. (His family had wanted him to stay for 90 days, at a cost of around $1,000 per day, Richard Johnson reported in Page Six, and his parents reportedly took out a mortgage on their home to help him pay for the cost of the treatment.)

Compounding Weiner’s financial woes, in early December, the New York City Campaign Finance Board fined him more than $65,000 for a variety of infractions related to his mayoral campaign. Weiner apparently spent $600 of his campaign funds on televisions, another $1,539 on his personal dry-cleaning and cell-phone service, and more than $115,000 for a group of expenditures after the campaign was over. Weiner was also ordered to repay some $195,000 in matching campaign funds. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, is reportedly investigating Weiner’s latest round of sexting, along with the F.B.I. and the New York City police.

Aside from Weiner’s public mishegas, Abedin has her own problems—namely coming to grips with the blame directed at her for the new stash of Clinton e-mails that ended up on his personal computer and that became the focus of F.B.I. director James Comey’s now infamous late-October letter to Congress. In the wake of her loss, Clinton told donors that Comey’s letter had cost her the election. Fairly or not, many people blame Comey’s letter with abruptly changing the narrative about Clinton at the penultimate moment of the campaign (despite his subsequent November 6 letter saying nothing new of substance was found on the computer).

But perhaps Abedin’s biggest challenge is that she may soon have a new boss for virtually the first time in her life. The Clinton insider reiterated that Huma, who has spent 21 years at Clinton’s side, might need to prepare for the reality, moving forward, that her “juice” was “tied to Clinton’s ascendancy.” Nevertheless, this person continued, “she’s someone that will be sought after either personally or through business from many rich, very rich connected people.” He concluded: “She’ll do very well for herself.”

On December 15, Clinton is having a big party in Manhattan at the Plaza Hotel, once owned by Trump, for her campaign donors, as a sort of thank-you and keep-in-touch farewell. It is expected to cost more than $100,000 and be paid for with excess campaign funds. Clintonworld insiders will be interested to see if Abedin shows up or whether she chooses to skip the celebration to stay at home to nurse her wounds.

Looks like the long trip to the swiss alps was really worth it: 4 bedrooms, a cozy fireplace, an indoor jacuzzi and a very private covered deck with a hot tub. But the best part is: I'm here with three beautiful women.   
  
  

No, Im not a rich celebrity. I wish I was. In fact, the trip was the first prize in a popular TV quiz-show: 2 weeks in a romantic cabin in Switzerland for the winner and three companions – all expenses paid.  
  
  

But I'm not even the winner of that show. I am one of the lucky companions who were asked to join. In fact, the lucky winner is you.  
We've been close friends since high-school and although you're very pretty, our relationship has always been platonic. Since we're going to different colleges, we don't see each other so often. Needless to say, I didn't think twice when you asked me to go with you.  
The two other companions are Alexa and Jenna, your two best friends. You've met in college. Alexa is 19 years old. Slim and curvy, big boobs, blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful. Jenna, 22, is a petite girl with dark hair and brown eyes, small b-cups and a firm ass. You've told me that Jenna just started an internship as a chemist at a big pharmaceutical company. „She's really really smart, but also a little crazy“, you said. You had no idea how right you were about that...
  
  
  
  

Fast forward to today: Here I am, taking my sunbath by the pool and enjoying a Tequila sunrise. What I don't know yet, is that Jenna spiked my drink with a expiremental drug that she must have snitched from the lab where she works. The drug with the product name „HGQ-12“ will boost male libido, cause long lasting erections, increase sperm volume and even allow men to have multiple orgasms. Suspected side effects are premature and sometimes spontaneous ejaculation. Obviously Jenna didn't want to wait for the approval for tests on humans, so she figured she might just do her own little experiment...

Hey, thanks for reading! In this RP I'd love to play your male friend Jake, who's (at first) really embarrassed and confused by the fact, that he has a boner almost all the time or that even a casual touch can be enough to make him cum. Once you notice what's going on, the three of you start teasing me on purpose – just to mock me a little bit.  
I'd love to imagine that eventually, the girls realize that they might have gone a little bit to far. To make amends for making fun of me and help me to release some sexual energy, they finally allow me to fuck them whenever I want. Hey, that's just fair!  
I'm looking for a RP-partner who'd like to play with me on a midterm basis (about a week?)  
I'd love to include a reasonable amount of buildup for this RP. This specific prompt would more or less focus on sexual tension in the finca building up. Eventually, of course, it would break down into a full-blown house of sex between the four of them, but that's later on!  
Hope to hear from you :)  
Jake.

I meet this hb 8 at a bar on Friday, and I approach. After hitting it off, we start dancing but her orbiter brother types are around. She says she ""hopes they don't intimidate me"" and they don't. I hold frame and am friendly to them. However, everytime they come around, her dancing gets way less dirty because she doesn't wanna be judged. So eventually I suggest a setting change and we go get her coat, but she's  hungry and so am I. We grab cheap pizza and her other orbiter confronts me but I handle him with class. She laughs and apologizes for him, and then her and I walk to her apartment after she throws up some slight resistance/shit tests, I just play it off as though I'm just walking her back. 

After getting to her apartment, I realize I left my condom in the car and my friends were still by the bar. It was 2:30 am at this point. She grabs me water, runs to the bathroom, sits on my lap afterwards and we start kissing. Eventually I pick her up and move to the couch, and she slings out a comment about how hot that was and how I'm strong and blah blah. Eventually I tell her I don't have a condom and so things wane a bit. My friends call me looking for a ride, and as soon as my attention shifts away from her, she starts taking her leggings off and is just in her thong and she starts kissing my neck and showering me with attention.

I pretty much just end up giving her an ass massage that night, and try to spank her awake(she became sleepy drunk) because I had to get my friends, and as I'm leaving she tries to tease me and get me to stay and abandon them. I obviously wouldn't do that, so I get her number and leave.

Skip to last night, I'm gaming her and eventually get her to meet up at the bar with me. I had just drove back to my home after finals which is an hour away from where I go to school at. Eventually she agrees but won't walk in the cold unless I have two shots waiting for her. I playfully fight with her on it but I end up caving and telling her ""if you don't hurry your ass up, your shots will get warm"". (Probably a beta move...)

Anyways she gets there and I'm confident af, and I feel like I smiled a bit too much. She shit tests me a couple times but I literally just agree and amplify it all and brush it off. She eventually says ""I feel like nothing I say will ever insult you or get to you"" and I say ""you're probably right"".(strong fucking frame) Eventually we start talking about how she was riding me the other night and blah blah, I tell her how it wasn't the right night that night to fuck, I had too much responsibility. She brings up how she only remembers parts of it or some shit, but by the time I left her apartment that night before, she was naked and wanting me like mad. I respond by saying ""tonight is different, but we won't do anything unless we both want to"" and I smirk.

Anyways, she ended up asking me about work, and my major and my internship and future job, and I stupidly disseminate this information, she offers to pay for her part of the meal and drinks but I stupidly pay the whole thing. I read a topic earlier about putting yourself into provider status and I realized I really fucked up here... I start talking about places to explore in our town and she's raring to go on a drive with me to see a place I mentioned. (I should've just said we should chill at her place... but noooo.) 

I open the door for her to my car, and then I get in (being too damn gentlemanly) and eventually she asks me about my type of girl. I flip it and ask her what her type is, she describes me to a T. I end up telling her what my type is, and it just happens to be a thick white girl with a small waist and a fat ass. (Her. I should've lied). Eventually I bring up going back to her place after we've driven around and she says ""so you're inviting yourself to my place?"" And I said ""you said this last time lol.. don't be presumptuous"" 

I eventually tell her idc what we do but there's things I prefer. I end up getting her back to her place at 2:30 am and she doesn't want to invite me in. I walk her to her door and make out with her and grab her, and then she smiles and just says ""goodnight"". 

I've been laying in bed unable to sleep because I'm pissed at myself and I see everything I've done wrong now that I'm not in the situation. 

My question is, do I still try to fuck and slightly alter my sexual frame to knock her off balance? Or do I soft next and just take the L, I've been thinking about smashing since the night I wasn't able to. 

Edit: I'm low key in a fit of rage at myself for this."

My state (LA) pays for the tuition at in-state schools through 4th year for students who have demonstrated academic merit, and I received this state-provided aid. My parents have been covering the difference between what the state pays and my actual cost of attendance. However, I am currently in my 4th year, and at the end of the current academic year this aid will end. My scholarship cannot be returned to me even though my grades have improved over the last couple of terms. Additionally, my scholarship would have ended at the end of this academic year anyway.

I'm on a 6-year plan because I faced some trouble making academic progress my first year and a half due to my emotional and psychological instabilities, but I'm making steady progress now and have been for a while now. I'm in my 4th year and I'm taking all junior level courses.

I have two years of college left after this one, and I will be paying for my education 100% full price. There will no longer be any state aid, and like I said, I lost my scholarship earlier this year with no chance of getting it back.

As of now, the full cost of attendance at my university is $20,406/year. That includes tuition, fees, room-and-board, books, supplies, and ""other expenses."" My parents have outright refused to continue to pay for my education, and my dad has explicitly said, ""I will not cosign with you for any loan."" My credit is average (FICO ~650), and I have pretty much 0 savings. I currently work at an on-campus job making $7.50/hour, 15 hours/week (we're not allowed to work above 15). I've always been a medically inclined person, so I sent my application to the state Board of Pharmacy to get my Pharmacy Technician Candidate Registration. It would allow me to work as a Pharmacy Technician at any pharmacy in the state until I qualify to pass the PTCB exam and get my full certification. The reason I applied for this is that the local Walgreens is hiring a Pharmacy Technician and typically pays them about $12-15/hour.

How can I take care of all of my expenses? I can probably live with a friend for somewhere around $400/month and split utilities and Internet for somewhere around $50/month and $35/month, respectively. But then I also have to somehow budget food, gas, and (most importantly) paying for my education.

Oh yeah, I also have 0 student debt, but I do have a few (5) credit cards (totaling around ~$17k) that I'm hoping to put a big dent in this summer by working full time.


How can I handle all of this?


EDIT: Currently, federal loans would let me borrow up to $7,500/year with an aggregate limit of $31,000.

EDIT (for clarity's sake and this is probably pretty important): My 6th and final year I will not be full-time. I have made sufficient academic progress such that my 6th year I will only enroll for 4-5 hours/quarter (8-12 is full time, beyond 12 you need special approval). As a part time student, my tuition and fees will drop tremendously (from ~$2,950/quarter to ~$1,500/quarter).

EDIT: I'm studying electrical engineering so with some luck I can probably make around $10k with a summer internship.

**EDIT:** I've read over all of your comments. I racked up the debt by buying stupid crap I didn't need but wanted. I recognize that my poor decision making coupled with my impulsiveness and lack of self control got me where I am. But I am ready to change. I am planning to tackle all of my credit card debt first and then worry about school. With the mountain of debt that I am facing, I will not quality for any private student loans. Therefore, I have to clear myself before I even think of hitting that ""Apply Now!"" button. Have I made some stupid, idiotic decisions? Yes. Have I been a completely irresponsible adult? Yes. But I'm not doing that anymore. I literally **cannot** afford to do it. My parents will allow me to move back home and live with them and have all my living expenses covered by them. They just don't want to pay for my living expenses elsewhere. So I can live with them and work full time. If I live with them and work full time, I can settle ALL of my debts easily under a year. I'm deep, **deep** in the hole, but I don't have to be forever. I will not be forever. I'm changing myself, and I am taking responsibility and getting my life under control. To all of you, thank you for your comments. You have all been very helpful. I'll be back to /r/personalfinance a little while from now to tell you all about my success in recuperating from this devastating blow I've dealt myself. I am an idiot. But I will not always be an idiot. I'm changing myself starting today."

I graduated a few **months** (!!) ago and i'm absolutely terrified to start to work. So far, i haven't send one single application and i lie about it to evryone :/

Everytime i read a job, i feel so unqualified and incompetent. There s always something (especially the splints oh dear lord) that makes say no no no no, too hard for you.

I did good during my internship but the whole work word frightens me i think. And i think it makes me sooo down.

I love this job, i'd love to get independence (for the patients and for myself!) but somehow something in my chest pops up and i'm so anxious.

Any advice or tips from would be greatly appreciated

5ijr27,0,2016-12-15,Sanity check on new college grad budget and apartment search,repairmanjack3,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ijr27/sanity_check_on_new_college_grad_budget_and/,"I'll be graduating this coming May but am beginning my housing search now. In order to get an idea of what kind of apartment I can afford, I put together an estimated budget. I'll be moving to Madison, Wisconsin, so cost of living is relatively low.




Category | Estimate | Notes  
---|--- | ---
Pre tax yearly salary | $95,000
Estimated tax rate | 35.00% | I'm pretty sure the effective rate will be lower, I'm estimating high
Post tax year salary estimate	|$61,750
401K Deductions	| $9,000 | 50% employer matching up to $9000
IRA contribution	| $5,500
Additional savings | $15,000 | I'm thinking a mix of low cost index funds and bonds
Health insurance (bi-weekly) | $36.80 | From employer
Dental insurance (bi-weekly)	| $3.14 | From employer
Montly take home (after savings and health insurance) | $2,600.96
Car insurance estimate	| $200.00 
Gas estimate | $89.60
Renters insurance estimate | $15
Grocery estimate (monthly) |	$168 | Slightly higher than my current college groceries
Internet estimate	| $50 | Might be included in rent, depending on location
Utilities estimate	| $200 | Took current utilities (5 bedroom apt) and added 50%
Gym estimate | $50 | Will likely be subsidized by work, but included it anyways
Hobbies/Entertainment | $200
Cell phone bill | $48.50
**Maximum rent estimate** | **$1,500** | This gets a nice 2 bedroom in Madison, and I'm thinking of living with a roommate for a year or two.
Monthly take home AFTER rent, groceries, utilities | $79.86 | Left over will likely go to savings

Are there any things that jump out as missing or that I should be planning for? I managed to avoid student loans through a combination of scholarships, good paying summer internships, and going to a state school so that makes life a lot easier. 

Thanks!"

I plan to get involved very soon and am in the process of applying for an internship with the party so that I can learn how things work in our government. In order for Dems and, thus our revolution, to have any kind of success in Indiana, we need to reach out to the rural areas of the state. These are what make up the majority of our vote and affect our statewide politics more than the urban areas like Indy or Bloomington. As long as we ignore those areas, we will continue to live in our liberal cities, but have their conservative views imposed on us at the state and national level by their representatives. We need to reach out to these people, expose them to different cultures, religions, thoughts, and sexualities, and show them that the world outside of their farming town is not the evil place that it is often depicted to be. We need to do this while they are young, so that we can shape them. Let's promote and help start diversity groups at middle and high schools, and set up programs for elementary and younger preaching the merits of diversity and open-mindedness. We need to counter what they are getting at home and from too many of those around them. I don't want this state to be the closed-minded wasteland of the midwest that it is and has become. Let's fight for our state and then we can fight for our country."
5ikg1c,5,2016-12-15,[Non-romantic] Should I [21F] try to rekindle relationships with my two high school best friends [21F] and [20F]?,cinnamonbunn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ikg1c/nonromantic_should_i_21f_try_to_rekindle/,"(Kinda long, there's a TL;DR at the end. Paragraphs 2-4 are the only important ones, the rest is me venting)

I went to school with both these girls from kindergarten through graduation. I've known the 20-year-old since fourth grade, and the 21-year-old since seventh. The three of us were all really good friends  throughout middle school and high school.

After we graduated high school in 2014, I noticed the two of them would post stuff on social media of them hanging out together and I never got invited. I didn't get offended because the two of them didn't go to college and stayed in our hometown. I moved to a college about half an hour away and had a really tough major that had night classes and required me to study a lot. However we all still maintained contact (text/snapchat/Facebook), but for the three of us to hang out I always initated it. 

The last time I hung out with them was 4th of July weekend of 2015 when I came back home to visit (I have been away for the summers of 2015 and 2016 for an out-of-state internship). After I got back home in August, they said they really wanted to see my new apartment, but between their work and my school schedule they never came over that fall semester. 

December 2015 I messaged them asking them to hang out while I was home for break. 20F didn't have a phone at the time, so I asked 21F to ask her the next time they talk/see each other. She said sure, and then I asked what her work schedule was (she sleeps in the day due to midnight shift) trying to figure out a day to do something. I never got a response. 

After that I was very heartbroken/depressed for awhile, like how most are with a bad breakup. I'm feeling that way again now because it's been exactly a year since it happened. I didn't understand what I did to make them not want to hang out with me, and I understand with what little information I've presented here neither can you. All I know is there was never any bad blood between us, our friendship didn't end in any fights, and I never got a vibe that they were unhappy with me. I'm not the type of person to cause problems, I've always been very quiet, had few enemies, and have had a good reputation behind me. 

I didn't have a lot of friends in HS due to social anxiety. I was friendly with everyone in my school and they were back, but we were just school acquaintances that dropped after graduation. But college really helped open me up. I have friends that I have made over the last three years of college. These people are wonderful and I've had a great time with them. Yet I still mourn the loss of my childhood friends. All of my college friends, while we are all very close and consider ourselves best friends, still have deep connections with at least one or two people from school. My boyfriend is in his late 20s and is still best friends with all of his high school buddies. But I haven't talked/hung out with anyone from my high school in over a year, while I see my fellow alumni posting pictures on social media with each other indicating that their high school relationships didn't fall through like mine did. I feel like a social failure with no connection to my small home town besides my family who still lives there (2000 people, 64 kids in my hs class). All of the people in my life right now besides my family have known me for three years or less because I met them in college.

 I miss my friends. I see them post on Facebook or Snapchat of things that I want to comment on or like. When I see a band coming into town for a concert, my first instinct still is to ask them if they want to go. I said happy birthday on Facebook to both of them recently and they both liked it and replied thanks! so I know they don't hate me or something. 

 If you've made it this far, thanks for reading my novel. Should I try to reconnect with my old friends, and if so how? What should I say and how should I do it? Or should I quit being emotional and just try to get over it and move on with my life?

**TL;DR: High school friends ghosted me about a year ago, but there isn't any bad blood between us so I'm wondering if I should try to reconnect to them.**"

5ilmhh,5,2016-12-15,"23y/o, college grad, stable job, good credit, debt free - Should I buy a house?",BoyyFefe,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ilmhh/23yo_college_grad_stable_job_good_credit_debt/,"Hey, y'all! Long time lurker!

So, as the title says, I am 23 years old with a psychology degree (business psych emphasis) working in HR for a financial company in Dallas, TX. I interned with this company while in college and am coming up on my year mark next month (not including internship time). I make 50k a year with a possible 10% bonus.
Assuming that in a year or so I'll have 20k saved for a down payment (with an emergency fund), would it be a good idea to invest in a house?

Rent in Dallas for a nice apartment is about $1100+. Using the affordability calculator on Zillow, I would be paying around the same for a mortgage on a 15-year fix. I would look for homes in the suburbs outside of Dallas. Such as, Arlington, Grand Prairie, Mansfield. I've seen some nice homes, in good areas for about $180k.

My main thing is why pay that much in rent for an apartment that isn't ever going to be an asset, when I can invest in a home while I'm young and own the house by the time I'm 40 maybe even sooner if my side business generates good revenue? Anyhow, what do you guys think?

Thanks in advance!"
5imb9f,7,2016-12-15,Contest Entry for /u/TheShadowQuill's contest (Just A Normal Day At Scruffy's Hangout...),Cheyenam,fivenightsatfreddys,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/5imb9f/contest_entry_for_utheshadowquills_contest_just_a/,"""**H-H-Hello, Kids! Welcome-e-e to Scruffy's Hangout!**"" The child slowly walked over to the large blue chihuahua that was twirling and whirling around, his arms opening and closing on the accordion, while his fingers gently pressed on each key and created a wonderful, slightly exotic sounding tune. Her eyes were glittering, the girl beaming with delight as the other animatronics started dancing and playing along with him. One in a dress was playing the piano, one in a tuxedo and skirt was singing, and the one wearing a chefs hat and apron was playing an electric guitar. All of these instruments together, all created an odd, yet unique symphony of music. It was, for some reason, soothing. Even to the adults. ""I however, didn't really like the place though. Trust me, the technician of these little creeps, when I say that you DON'T want to know what goes on in this place at night. 


You want to know the reason why these guys look so realistic...? I'll keep this short and sweet. The company went to various places in the world and captured live animals. What they did afterwards..... are you ready for this...? They skinned them alive and gutted them. All they left behind were their brains, hearts, and nerves. Not to mention that they made titanium replicas of their skeletons, stuffed them inside, gave one of them a needle gun, pumped them full of steroids and nuclear radiation, and dyed their fur and skin different colors. The rest of the guts were put into small packages to use as food to feed the customers. So basically, these animals are technically alive and in agonizing pain. ""Good thing the government doesn't know about this though. Or else we'd be shut down. Make sure they'll never know, or you go down with the company."" Those are the wise words from my boss named Jenkins. Such an odd first name. Believe it or not, his full name is Jenkins Dewberry. But I know something you don't about him... something so dark, that I'd rather not explain it here in front of children.....""


The former technician continued his conversation with the new intern, making him extremely uncomfortable ""o-okay then... thanks for that introduction..."" he had walked towards his office when he heard the loud screaming of a child. He swiftly turned his head to look at Scruffy convulsing while his accordion is wrapped tightly around the little girl's neck, who was frantically trying to free herself from the constricting plastic. When the intern stepped in to try and tried to release her from his grasp, the big blue dog stared directly into his eyes, tightening his grip on the child's neck while maintaining eye contact ""**You are too close to the st-st-stage, sport! Please-e-e back up a bit!**"" he then quietly whispered to the intern, in an uncharacteristic tone ""**Please.... it's not our fault... please let her go...**"" Riley, the one who was playing the piano, her chest had opened and revealed the needle gun and was pointing it at the intern's head. ""**Let her die.... or you're gonna go with her...**""


The building had went into a lockdown state, not letting anyone in, or out. The retired technician had done a barrel roll under a desk below just before Riley had shot needles out of her chest rapid-fire, shooting and killing 2-4 people. She motioned Ebony and Dartanian off the stage to find and ""take care of"" the rest of them. Suddenly the sounds of electricity, roaring, bones snapping, flesh ripping and loud, agonizing screams filled the room. The retired technician was terrified for his life, covering his ears and trying to ignore the disaster around him. The child was a deep blue color and limp, but Scruffy wouldn't and couldn't let go. It was as if he were being controlled. Suddenly the technician was hit in the head with a large pipe, immediately being knocked out cold.


He then woke up later on, his throat, eyes, and lips were hurting a lot. His vision cleared up a lot and he saw Riley experimenting on him, mid operation. She tilted her head at him in disinterest... in lifelessness... [she slowly held up a mirror to his face.] (http://m.imgur.com/a/YCxJV) ""**Do you like it....? I made you like us...... fake... plastered on smiles....... were unable to close our eyes at night... we cannot act out of character... we cannot speak...**"" that was the last thing he heard before Riley had finished him off with a round of rapidly fired needles to his head.

5imw1a,5,2016-12-16,"An internship abroad, and I need help",boterhammetje,hsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/5imw1a/an_internship_abroad_and_i_need_help/,"Writing down what's on my mind helps and maybe you guys can give me advice.

I am now on an internship in China as a graphic design student.
And life in China is hard. There are a billion things that are not right, to name a few: gap between right and poor in huge, a lot of homeless people, kids grown up by their grandparents because their parents work their asses of for a better future for their children, dogs get awefully tortured and then being slaughtered, accidents in traffic with children. 

But that's not it.

I began my internship to get rid of this sensitiveness towards everything and to get to know my roots. (I was born in china) 
In the first week I had an extreme difficulty to get enough sleep and i slept that week only 3 hours a night. To much things going on in my mind. This dissapeared but my stomach problems didn't go away. After two weeks was that problem also gone and I began to get used to the food and situation. But then there was the heat. The intense heat where I sweat quite quickly, i don't know if that's thing for hsp's but even in the metro with a lot of people in it I start to sweat as hell, without any movement whatsoever. 

After one month I could't recognize myself anymore due the consumption of too much alcohol, sleep deprivation and sad thoughts.

Even though I tried so hard to keep in touch with my family often to not get too isolated from them too much, it happened. I feel like i’ve also been slipping away from the other in the house where I live here and never been me again since then. 

I don’t know how to get myself back again. Can you guys help me?

5in04c,7,2016-12-16,Possible SA grad student - need your advice,SC_Gunners,studentaffairs,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/5in04c/possible_sa_grad_student_need_your_advice/,"Hi all,

I am an international undergraduate student in the US, and am applying for the Master's program in Student Affairs in Higher Education (or similar programs depending on the schools). Even though I'm coming in the SA program with a BBA in Actuarial Science (don't ask how or why, am sponsored for my undergraduate so kinda stuck in this major), I've worked in my university's Admissions Office since sophomore year (loved it, was why I started looking into SA) and also currently working as a part-program assistant for a volunteer group in the International Student Services office. Have also intern in education-related places (volunteered for Teach for Malaysia one summer, intern at [MACEE](http://macee.org.my) for their Fulbright/EducationUSA departments) and did a bunch of education/youth development volunteer programs like [Projek Inspirasi](http://inspirasi.avh.me) in Malaysia.

Universities I applied for (&amp; some decisions that I've received): 

* University of Rochester (admitted, 30% tuition scholarship)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (recommended for admission, need official transcript to finalize offer)
* Colorado State University (not invited to interview)
* Michigan State University (no results yet) 
* Anglia Ruskin University (in England, UK) (conditional offer, need minimum GPA of 3.0 by graduation next year, highly achievable).

What I'm contemplating right now is if I want to stay and pursue my Master's in the UK or in the US (if the US, I still have to decide which school, but that's a different story). Some thoughts that I consider while thinking this all out:

**1) Funding, obviously.**

While Rochester offers a 30% tuition scholarship, that will still cost me about $35,000 or so in tuition fees. For Madison, tuition cost should be roughly around the $40,000-mark or so, give an take a few thousand. Anglia Ruskin would cost me around GBP12,000, so that's around $15,000. 

I have been on a convertible loan from my country's government for my undergraduate (will probably need to pay back around 10-15% of my total costs including living expenses and all after I graduate). But for my masters, I will mostly be on personal funding (my parents agreed to help me pay for grad school) since there are not many options back home for funding for Education-related program.

**2) Time commitment**

Rochester is a two-year program. Madison is roughly 1.5 to 2 years, depending on how many credits I take per semester (30 credits for their program). Anglia Ruskin is a year-long program. While I don't mind studying for another two years, doing it in a year seems interesting but daunting at the same time.

**3) Education system**

Malaysia follows the British education system (exam-based all throughout high school), and I did A-Levels partly after high school before realizing that I hated how super exam-based it is and switched to a program and applied to the US schools for my undergrad. Super loving the US system and its flexibility, and how it offers me options I didn't know exist for me (seriously, taking a Videogames &amp; Learning course for a Comm B requirement is awesome). But have been told that the UK Master's programs are not the same as the UK Bachelors' programs. Am planning to read up more on how the program is structured and taught, as well as talking to my friends who did Master's in the UK for their experience.

**4) Environment**

I've grown to love the US, and would love to stay and do my Master's here. Been to Rochester, loved the campus and my possible department. People are friendly, diversity is great (as a Muslim, this is highly needed). Even saw a prayer mat in the student lounge while touring and I was so excited. Madison, on the other hand, is my alma mater, and I have friends and people that I know and love. Anglia Ruskin is located in Cambridge, England, and while I've never been to Cambridge specifically, I've lived in London for 1.5 years back when I was younger, and have visited two years ago. Still have friends who are pursuing their undergraduate in England at various places, and some who will still be there if I do my Master's there next September.

The thing is, my parents are worried about me wanting to stay in the US, what with the election results and all that (as a female Muslim who wears the hijab). Personally, I've never experienced anything bad, other than that one time where a white guy suddenly yelled ""F* you"" in my face as I was walking back home (granted, it was 2am in the morning, and he was probably drunk). But my parents, not knowing how things would be next year (or the next two years), are super worried, which was why I actually applied to Anglia Ruskin.

**5) Visa requirements for dependents/spouse**

A little related to the funding issue, since I'm mostly going to be on personal funding. I am now on an F-1 student visa in the US, but would like to be on a J-1 visa for my Master's (mainly because if my spouse were to come and be with me, he can be on a J-2 visa and work part-time instead of staying at home and being idle for two years). But J-1 visa are typically for students sponsored by the university, by government or have substantial funding from anything other than personal (I am asking Rochester about their policy, since I have a 30% tuition scholarship and the form that I was given gave me an option to select J-1 instead of an F-1).

The UK, however, should be easier. As I will be on a Tier 4 student visa, my spouse should be able to come and stay with me (as I am doing a year-long Master's program) and he should be able to work (if I'm not mistaken, if you know more, please let me know!) 

**6) The program itself**

Rochester is one of my top choices because their program is a combination of Educational Administration w/ specialization in Student Affairs and Academic/Career Advising. As I would possibly like to be an education consultant in the future, this would work best with my interests. Madison's Student Affairs program is in their Ed Leadership &amp; Policy Analysis (ELPA) program, which is more policy-based from what I've been told (though I plan to meet with my assigned advisor next semester to learn more and talk about options). Anglia Ruskin's program has a focus on international/national student affairs, which is interesting for an international student like me. It'd be interesting to see things from different countries' perspectives, and would be beneficial considering it can help me adapt to different situations, especially if I go back home and work with students who are interested to apply to schools outside of my home country. Anglia Ruskin also has a possible internship opportunity to work in the US (summer internship?) if I want to apply for it, which would also be fun.


--------

So that's just some of the thoughts I have at the moment. I would be meeting my family next week for a winter trip, and should be discussing all of the options with my parents (after all, they are paying for my education).

At this point, I'm just going through all the pros and cons in my head (and talking it out with my friends to help me think clearly), but I would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, and ideas from anyone who has any experiences in any of these programs, or know more about the UK vs US thing.

Early thanks. :)"

5inyzv,3,2016-12-16,"I've distanced myself from my NFather, but I feel more conflicted and horrible than ever",AstraRow,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5inyzv/ive_distanced_myself_from_my_nfather_but_i_feel/,"I just want to mention that this is my first time ever posting anything on Reddit. I read about some of the stories here and felt the need to share my own story because I really fear I'm only doing worse and worse and I'd just like to hear some thoughts of people who have experience with Nparents.

Alright, so, this is going to be pretty long. I think I need to explain matters to make clear in what situation I currently find myself, but here goes.

I've been raised by a NFather and a chronically ill mother (multiple sclirosis) who was always too weak or exhausted to stand up for either me or my brother, and going along with my father's ways always proved to be the easiest way of avoiding trouble for her.

I didn't pick up on my father's abusive behavior and manners until I was 19 and got a boyfriend who also had been my best friend for six years at the time. My father didn't like it whatsoever, mainly because I was now developing myself as an adult and figuring out what I wanted in life. And it was very much the opposite of what he desired from me.

In the beginning, I did as my parents wished of me and studied in the Social Care. Which was super fun, don't get me wrong, but the internship showed what it truly was, and that made me reconsider my education at the end of the year. I decided to sign myself up for an art education because I've been creative and illustrating and making stories and videos for as long as I can remember, and my dream was to just continue in it and hopefully find some work in it. However, I knew my father would never approve of this, so I did something I could hardly believe at the time: I switched education on my own with the help of someone at my current school at the time. 

However, they had to be notified of this some way or another, so we agreed to bring my father in for a talk and inform him of the steps we had taken and what it meant. 

And oh man. He arrived there, arms crossed, looking grouchy and threatening, saying absolutely nothing except yes and no when he was required to say something. Absolutely no interest from his side, and when we returned to the car he exploded rage.

How could I do this? Why did I do this? He said that I had pretty much sentenced myself a life of being jobless (even though I work in the hospital every weekend since my 18th to pay for my education. 7 years now) and that I'd end up in the gutter. Which is what he says so often that currently I feel like it doesn't even bother me, though at the same time it does? It's very confusing.

In an attempt to explain, I realized that I wasn't going to get through to him. My father decided, as punishment for this big step I had taken for my own future (and was really proud of), that my financial support from him and mom was taken away. Because, ""If you know everything so well you can start paying for everything from now as well.""

I was terrified. Sure, I had a weekend job in the hospital which pays really well for only 20 hours in a month- but no support whatsoever? My education fee every month was above the 200 euros, not to mention the materials I need to purchase for it and the insurances I need to pay every month, etc. For a long while I considered back off from my decision, but in the end I didn't. I didn't wanted to give him the satisfaction of winning and taking away something I truly desired. So I went on and did that education.

I could manage. Just barely, but at least I could take of myself. Which was one less way of how he could manipulate me. Little did I know that the following years would be absolutely horrible...

[TW: violence/abuse] At any little disagreement he would hurt me. If I didn't agree with him, he'd grab me by the arm and drag me upstairs, or kick or hit me, rush into my face and stare at me with psycho eyes to intimidate me into silence or agreement. He did everything he could to assure that he was the boss in the house, and if I had problems with that I deserved to get punished and hurt. Or as he always called it: disciplined.

It was terrible. Especially because I've always been sickly ever since I was 13, so I sometimes stay home more often than healthy people do, which he thinks is nonsense and just an excuse to stay home because I'm lazy. I remember one time that I had a pretty bad fever and could hardly get off the couch without dropping to the floor. He came back from work and was frustrated to see I was still on the couch after four whole days. I don't exactly remember what was said between us, but what I do know is that he got so angry that he grabbed me by the ankle, dragged me upstairs- which hurt really badly, and he was very rough- and once we were upstairs, he lifted me up and threw me down onto the floor, yelling: ""GET IN YOUR ROOM. NOW"" but I hardly knew what was going on, and I was in such pain that I couldn't immediately go, so he proceeded to move me into the room by literally kicking me into it and slamming the door shut behind me. I remember feeling so helpless that I silently cried on the floor where he left me for the remainder of the day.

It was always over such matters. He once shoved me against the wall, making sure to push my head against the stone when I had used hot water instead of cold, and thus wasted money on purpose. He's obsessed with money. So obsessed that I could hardly buy anything without him throwing an angry fit over it. I like playing games and reading books, so from time to time I purchase a new game- which he considered an addiction even though I played 2-3 hours at most a day, and tried to get me to stop gaming by taking away my consoles and even my laptop which I needed for school work. Eventually he returned it, but that was weeks later when he realized he couldn't actually do this for some reason?

He never showed any interest in what my interests, passions and dreams are either. He believes in hard work and earning as much money as possible. Whereas I am more of a person that does what they do because they love it, huddled up in their room working on a illustration for hours and writing really long stories because one of my dreams is to publish a book some day. All these things have impacted my life so well, and now that I think back to it, it might have been the reason why I always continued instead of falling into hopelessness. Creating was my passion, and I often twisted real life experiences into them, letting them inspire me and make something worthwhile out of it.

Then, about almost 3 years ago, I got health problems.

At the time I was over at my boyfriend's place during summer break. And at some point I lost consciousness and fell off the bike. The following days I literally had no energy to move out of the bed, even when I had to go to the bathroom. I didn't eat or drink and hardly even talked. Something was really wrong.

I want to mention that I have been suffering of insane stomach and bowel complaints and pains since I was 13. Which my father always brushed off as whining and excuses to stay at home, so I ended up trying to live with them as I continued daily life, not actually realizing that being in pain for almost 24-hours was not NORMAL. It didn't help that my doctors could never find out what was wrong with me either.

After a lot and long examination- the results came back. And there was a LOT wrong with me. Apparently when I was 13, a bacterial overgrowth began developing inside my stomach and bowels, which always caused pain and nausea. The really bad thing about it though, was that it was allowed to grow for over nine years and destroying a lot of my stomach from the inside. Making it impossible for vitamins and other nutrition your body needs to function and live to begin with. For a long time my body got none of them, and slowly began to use the 'emergency' supply my body had, until there was nothing left and I just couldn't move anymore. And the doctor said that if I didn't work hard to change any of it, I would not live to witness the coming of 2015 and slip away during sleep at some point.

Despite everything, I was overjoyed. There was something wrong with me! Not me just whining, or imagining it, there really was something wrong with me after all! I had to take on 3 strict diets: Histamine-diet, Lactosefree-diet and fructose-free diet. Which was almost impossible, and I lived on only about 7 products for over than 7 months. That, and a gigantic medication plan (seriously I think I swallowed more meds than food at that point) I eventually began to feel better.

But my father refused to pay for the medication. He thought the entire thing was rubbish. The doctor wasn't to be trusted. If it were up to him, I would not have recovered and I would have died. It is only thanks to the kindness and sincerity of my boyfriend and his entire family that I managed to get through this, because they paid for EVERYTHING. And it's not just a few hundreds of euros. No, it goes up in the thousand. 

And my dad got upset that I allowed them to pay it for me. Saying that they were trying to snatch me into a relationship where I owed them. Needless to say, I began to see my father as a monster. Thanks to being around my boyfriend's family; who are extremely kind and caring, always asking me how I am, which is... very foreign to me. And even expressing interests in my passions! They like my drawings! They want to read what I write! They care! It really opened my eyes, and I realized that my family was a very toxic one. My father would have rather let me die than accepting I was sick and needed a lot of medication. Money... was more important to him. And to the current day, that proves itself once again.

A year ago my mother's sickness grew worse. She can hardly work, she has trouble speaking. Her illness, which its advancing was halted due to the medication- was now catching up quickly. 

My father doesn't like sick people, so a few months ago he expressed that he wanted to divorce. In the meanwhile, he had already been fooling around with an acquaintance of my mother- whom was truthful enough to come to us and tell us about it and that's how we discovered.

He dropped her like a stone when she needed him the most. Friends of hers had a small apartment and she was allowed to stay there for free for the time being, thank goodness. Otherwise it would've been even worse. So what did I do? I continued to live with him...

I don't even remember how I was convinced that this was the better option. At first he was really kind, really supportive, and we helped to work on the house to make it ready for selling together. And it was just really nice. So nice that I admit with shame that I truly believed that he could be the kind of father again he had been when I was a child. 

Of course, I was just outright stupid. Because his behavior returned as soon as he got back to work and couldn't keep an eye on me the entire time. Around those months, I was searching for an internship. I was a tad later than the other students because I had difficulty finding an animation internship, so I was at home often. He didn't like me doing 'nothing' as he said, even though I was taking care of the household, working on my portfolio, contacting companies, etc. So he told me to look for work. I told him that I didn't think that was a good idea, because I don't need a job I need an internship. Besides, I already have a job? I worked in the hospital in that time during the week sometimes, as extra shifts. But he seemed to completely ignore that, saying stuff like: ""Hmph, that job you have had in the hospital for 7 years? As if you can call that a real job.""

One morning I awoke, and he immediately phoned me. Telling me that at the end of the day I would have not ONE job, but TWO- otherwise he would make sure I had no access to the internet, my laptop and my other equipment I need to produce creative works with.

And something snapped in me. I yelled at him through the phone, telling him to cut this nonsense out, that he was pressuring me and that it's impossible to find two jobs in just a few hours time. And that I was not happy like this and that he needed to get off my back. A moment of silence followed, and: ""You heard what I said."" And I hung up on him.

A moment later he called back. Stupidly enough, I answered. ""You're not going to do that again, or else I'm not done with you."" And he proceeded to yell at me, call me names. He called me a fishy bitch, horse-face and downright useless and lazy, and said I had to get lost (which he often says when we disagree) and I said OK and hung up on him.

I was in a panic. For I knew that there was the possibility he could come home from work to teach me a lesson. (he did a few times before) so I acted in a impulse. I fetched my bag, put my laptop, chargers, book, drawing stuff and my 3DS in them and still in my pajamas, I got my bike and went straight to where my mother currently lived. My suspicions were correct however, because he arrived just mere 5 minutes later. Unfortunately for him, my brother just heard from my mom that he had cheated on her, and instead of confronting me, he and my brother almost literally fought in the backyard. 

And... I've never returned home since. I'm currently in this place for 3 months now, and despite feeling more at ease mentally, I also feel very unstable and uncomfortable. Like something is wrong or off.

I've been experiencing bodily complaints, anxiety attacks where my chest tightens and I have difficulty breading. Panic attacks where I see not other way out than to hurt myself by hitting my head, pulling my hair, hitting my arms and legs and screeching. 

And that's become a daily thing at this point... I really don't know what I can do to help it. I just had a moment where I hurt myself again, and afterwards I feel so ashamed of myself because I know I shouldn't to it. I mean, the fingers on my right hand are currently so bloated, purple and painful that I just absolutely loathe myself. 

I'm in the best position since years without him, yet as an individual, I feel so unstable mentally. The smallest thing is able to throw me into an anxiety fit, and even during work I often tend to hyperventilate. On certain days I hardly eat anything, and that can last for days too. 

I'm away from this abusing man, shouldn't I feel better? I'm so confused and I feel so helpless to my own mind that I truly don't know anymore.

My apologies for the lengthy story, but I just wanted to vent it a bit before getting to the real point, I think?

Hi everyone, 

Currently i am in an internship at a relatively big museum in the Netherlands. It is a museum about planes. We've got a big collection of planes including a real boeing 747. Anyway, currently i do an essay on the museumcard. That is a concept we've got in the Netherlands where poeple can buy a card and with that card you could visit over 400 museums in the Netherlands. We try to attracht more 'museum lovers'. So I that is why I want to know some things from the regular museum visitors.

- Who is your company? do you take your kids if you have any?
- Is it important that there is some kind of interactivity?
- What price are you willing to pay for a visit?

As i know, this subreddit is not really my target group, but still very interested in some oppinions of 'museum lovers' outside of the Netherlands. 

I hope this all make sense, and as i said: still learning English, i do my best, don't judge the grammer :) 

Looking really forward to some respons. "

American, well educated, same interests as me.. he would be tall and hairy with a thick cock and thick balls..

We would be madly in love, I would try to get/stay fit again, we would marry and my family would love him..

He would buy this great house in Palm Desert for us (one of those where you can see the hills in the mountains from your perfectly green lawn) and we would start looking for a surrogate - which we would find - to have our beautiful kids (of course with his sperms, so they would have the same advantages and fat cock he has.. )

I wouldn't have to work and stay home to raise our - or his kids - and giving singing lessons or something else.. 

Alltogether a great fantasie..

Than my fantasies became strange - I would be thinking of how at sometime he would stop having sex with me - although still loving me - and start fucking around with hot young guys when he was away on business - and be more and more impertinent and starting having them over at our house - ""interns"" - as he would explain to our kids .. little would they know that not the intern, but their papa was sleeping in the guest room, while there daddy was fucking the young guys in their parents bedroom.. 

A thing that turned me on - but on the other hand leaving me devastated; alone in the desert, totally dependend on the man I once loved, unable to leave, for our kids love both daddy and papa so much.. talking to my sister still back in Austria on the phone, missing my beautiful mountains but trapped with a man who once loved me - well still being honoured in some way that he thinks I'd be worthy raising his kids... 



And I was wondering.. has anyone of you being fucked by an actual father?"

As we are approaching X-Mas and New Year’s Eve, this will be the second and last part of our winter update for this year. You will be able to face a new winter encounter and can finally start collecting those snowflake tokens!


Also included in this release is a set of minor rebalancing changes.  These changes are just the beginning of our plans to make some of the outdated parts of the game a bit more relevant and challenging again.  Details below.

http://imgur.com/a/YQ1gc

**New:**

* The“Ice Tomb,” a new encounter dungeon &amp; its key item were added. You will find the classic winter reskins there, as well as some new drops (including, the Winter Edition of the three Tomb of the Ancients UT rings). 
**Ice Tomb can be entered via Craig the Intern**

* Dragon Tamer - a warrior ST set which you will be able to find it in the Lair of Draconis or in the rotation of ST mystery boxes - (note that this set currently does not support dyes or cloths and will be soulbound to safeguard against duping attempts). As with the other ST sets, there is also

* **Sword: ‘Indomptable’**
 * 566 - 650 Damages
 * Range: 3.5
 * Rof: 25%
 * Range: 3.5
 * Pierce
 * On Equip: -10 def
 * Fame Bonus: 4%

*  **Helm “Helm of Draconic Dominance”**
 * Activate on Self: +250 HP for 10 sec
 * Paralyze enemies for 2 sec, range: 2.5

 * Cost: 90 MP
 * Cooldown: 10 seconds
 * Fame Bonus: 4%

* Sir Bagston is dressing up exclusively for the winter season and you will have a chance to get your hands on three separate pet stones - each will give you a distinctive Bagston holiday look
* Common humanoid pet - Muddy Tidechaser (available as pet stone or via hatching humanoid eggs)



**Updated:**

* Mystic ST set is now only dropping from the Lich encounter (no longer from LoD)
* Snowflake Tokens - these collectable tokens reserved to unlock the Freezing Quiver will now have chance to drop with the best chances to find them in the Ice Tomb. Other than that, they drop pretty much anywhere where candy canes also drop. You will be able to collect these until the 2nd of February 2017, before they will vanish - so be sure to collect all 50!
* Updated the Shatters to work with event chests - we will definitely give this a try soon :)
* Updated the Ice Cave to work with event chests - also fixed stacked shots from Esben


**Balancing Updates**

* Necromancer -&gt; max attack increased to 75 (from 60)
* Cube Gods and Skull Shrines -&gt; increased HP (+5000), added new defense mechanics (i.e. stun immune at low hp)
* Pentaract Eyes -&gt; increased HP (+150), dmg (+30), shot frequency halved
* Pentaract Towers -&gt; increased HP (+3000), bomb dmg (+30) &amp; slow, new defense mechanics


**New Payments System**

We are now introducing a new payment system from a vendor named Xsolla.  The new system works similarly to the old one, but with additional payment methods and differences in the way it handles currency conversion .  This system will replace Kabam’s payments system on our website only.  
**NOTE:** The new system is not compatible with NoScript.  You must turn off NoScript in order to see the paywall.


**Announcement: Kabam.com account migration option will be removed by Dec 21st**

* The option to migrate any old kabam.com accounts will be removed by Dec. 21st

I've always been a huge musician/music guy and one of my ideal careers would be working on the business side of the industry.  I recently went to a talk by an alum of my school who works at Pandora, and I found it very captivating.  I went online looking at student summer internships they offer, and many are actually software/app/web development jobs for Computer Science majors.

I came into college just taking Econ classes, assuming I was going to be an Econ major because it would be practical.  I do find it interesting, don't get me wrong, and I'm still likely going to be an Econ major.  I also recently found I like philosophy a lot, too, and I now want to be an Econ-Philosophy double major.  

I am still pissed at myself for never taking a CS class coming into college.  I don't know why it didn't interest me that much, and now it's just too late.  I could always do some summer or post grad studies in it but I'd fall behind in getting a job.  A CS-philosophy double major also just sounds really cool.  There's a chance I wouldn't like CS after a while, I've always found myself to be more of a creative-minded person so perhaps there's some other jobs in these companies I could pursue that don't involve coding as much.  Still, having computer skills makes you so much more marketable in today's job market, I feel like I'm at a disadvantage."

It's a love hate relationship because i know escorts are the only way i can get laid but they can mark up so much by placing a price on a certain act that i want performed.  I also know they dont give af about me. Not to mention i have to sift through the 1000s of escorts that have ""ONLY WHITE GENTLEMEN"".

After getting payment for my internship im debating if I should see another escort. I don't want to but its the only way i can satisfy my urge to be a hERo."

I know i should strive to get good grades, so i can get a good internship (maybe even paid), so i can get a good job, so i can be financially stable, and then i can pay for an apartment for my boyfriend and I and he can go to school without constantly worrying about making enough money to eat. And then we'll be financially stable and we'll both have degrees and maybe we'll be able to emigrate to canada out of the trump presidency. But... if Trump stays president, he's in the pocket of oil companies. We needed to act on climate change yesterday, and that's not gonna happened. It's over. And if he gets impeached and pence gets put in his place, I'm personally in danger as an LGBT american (although, maybe that would make moving to canada easier...) But if i move to Canada, or run away to some other country, that doesn't change what's happening. The mass extinction is still happening. We're still going extinct. And a part of me doesn't give a shit about my own life, because really.... it seems like if i'm gonna die (and everyone dies eventually), any way i could die now isn't as bad as dying in a food riot on a barren earth 20 years from now. I just.... maybe it's the winter. But every winter i think about climate induced mass extinction. And how the weather shifts are fucking with tree blooming schedules. the weird 60 degree days in the middle of february cause trees to bloom prematurely, and then the blooms are killed when the frost comes back in. And one year, all that instability is gonna lead to an april with half barren trees, where the flowers don't bloom in the park, the frogs don't sing in the ephemeral pools. One day, i'm gonna look outside in mid march, and the tree in my front yard will be dead. And when that spring comes.... I'm not sure i wanna stick around for the spring after that. 

But i'm getting ahead of myself. That's not for years. I should try and fight. I should finish my environmental science degree. It's my fault for giving up so easily. For watching TV in bed instead of.... i dunno. Protesting in the streets does jack shit and we all know it. I guess i could go chain myself to an oil pipeline project or something. Worst case scenario, i get run over by a bulldozer, and that's a nicer way to die. At least then i'm dying standing by what i believe in. That's better than dying quietly, too polite to ever make a scene.

But i can't do that. it would kill my parents for me to die. My boyfriend would be devastated. So would my sister. At least some of my friend would probably be tipped over the edge to suicide themselves. Some days, i think i'd be doing them a favor if that happened. It can't be worse than living to see the year 2030. 

And I hate myself for being that lazy. Fine, not lazy. weak. If i could just get off my ass and deal with my shit, I wouldn't be such a burden on my parents. And my boyfriend *needs* me to be someone more dependable. He deserves someone more dependable. I need to find the strength to fight without throwing myself into nothingness recklessly. ""head full of fantasies of dying as a martyr? Dying is easy young man, living is harder"" Be an environmental lawyer. Or something. I think deep down, i just don't believe in my ability to make a difference in the world. I can't even handle 1 fucking easy essay. I'm not capable of getting myself on T- my boyfriend had to do that for me. I'm not gonna ever be good enough with money to pay for top surgery. And even if i DO get a stable enough job, it'll be under a trump presidency, and really, what does a fucking flat chest matter? it's not gonna stop the slow destruction of life on earth."
5iqhmz,2,2016-12-16,Huma After Clintonworld's Stunning Defeat - by William D. Cohan (Vanity Fair),ShaunaDorothy,IslamUnveiled,https://www.reddit.com/r/IslamUnveiled/comments/5iqhmz/huma_after_clintonworlds_stunning_defeat_by/,"Huma vs. the “Night Stalkers” After a stunning election loss, the knives appear to be out in Clintonworld

.......................

""Maybe I’m just pissed off, but I really don’t give a shit about what happens to Huma to be honest with you,” one close adviser to Hillary Clinton told me recently. He was irked, in particular, at Abedin’s seemingly superfluous breach of decorum during a post-election event. On the day after Hillary Clinton’s stunning loss to Donald Trump, this person said, Abedin appeared within the rope line while Clinton greeted her morose and woebegone supporters. “You’re staff, O.K.?” this adviser continued. “Staff is staff. You’re not a principal.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign notes that Abedin was seated alongside the rest of the campaign’s senior leadership team that morning. Abedin declined an interview request.)

In the bizarre month since Clinton’s loss, few people besides the candidate herself have seen their fortunes overturned as significantly as has Abedin, 40, the glamorous and charismatic former vice-chair of the campaign. For two decades, Abedin has been a fixture inside Clinton’s inner circle; she began her career as a college-aged White House intern and rose to become Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. As a former adviser to Bill Clinton once put it to me, over time Abedin morphed into “a mini Hillary” herself. She wasn’t merely an aide, but rather an amalgamation of adviser, best friend, confidante, and perhaps even surrogate daughter. Abedin “inspires loyalty, and she’s loyal back,” one Clinton aide told Amy Chozick in her widely read dissection of Clintonworld for The New York Times Magazine, in 2014.

In fact, according to Chozick, Clinton appeared to countermand those who suggested that Abedin should be relegated on behalf of the sexting antics of her spouse, the randy former congressman Anthony Weiner. Clinton, Chozick reported at the time, appeared more concerned with quarantining the so-called “night stalkers”—sycophants and hangers-on from her many decades in public life—who might try to re-exert their influence. Abedin, meanwhile, was widely expected to get a big job inside a Clinton White House.

But amid Clinton’s stunning post-election hangover, some inside the inner circle wonder if Abedin became overwhelmed by the attention, and shut too many people out. “She was enjoying the red carpet and enjoying the photo spreads much too much in my opinion,” one Clinton insider told me. “She enjoyed being a celebrity too much.” The close Clinton adviser elaborated that Abedin and the other tight-knit circle of people may have suffocated Clinton, preventing the campaign from taking in outside counsel. “The real anger is toward Hillary’s inner circle,” the Clinton insider told me. “They reinforced all the bad habits.” For instance, the suggestion had been made that Clinton should show her gregarious side, by, for instance, appearing more often on The View. (She appeared once, but Bernie Sanders, her rival for the nomination, appeared a handful of times.)

According to this person, however, the inner circle nixed that idea. It seemed, this person elaborated, that even minor suggestions about changing the narrative fell on deaf ears. “Right away,” this person continued, “it was either regarded as an intrusion or a naïve suggestion or maybe someone has an agenda. And so people just stopped bothering. Where in most presidential campaigns the circle grows broader and broader, hers grew smaller and smaller.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign refutes this characterization, noting that the campaign may have had up to three times as many people on their plane during the election’s final weeks.)

In the month since the election, Abedin, once ubiquitous, has essentially vanished from public view. She was absent from the recent, and public, campaign exhumation that occurred at Harvard’s Kennedy School, during which her former colleagues tussled with Trump supporters such as Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski. Recently, the Daily Mail captured Abedin shopping at the Lululemon store on lower Fifth Avenue with her four-year-old son, Jordan, in tow. The story followed a report in the New York Post noting that Weiner, in the wake of his most recent sexting scandal, had cut short his rehab stay after about 30 days, supposedly because he ran out of money. (His family had wanted him to stay for 90 days, at a cost of around $1,000 per day, Richard Johnson reported in Page Six, and his parents reportedly took out a mortgage on their home to help him pay for the cost of the treatment.)

Compounding Weiner’s financial woes, in early December, the New York City Campaign Finance Board fined him more than $65,000 for a variety of infractions related to his mayoral campaign. Weiner apparently spent $600 of his campaign funds on televisions, another $1,539 on his personal dry-cleaning and cell-phone service, and more than $115,000 for a group of expenditures after the campaign was over. Weiner was also ordered to repay some $195,000 in matching campaign funds. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, is reportedly investigating Weiner’s latest round of sexting, along with the F.B.I. and the New York City police.

Aside from Weiner’s public mishegas, Abedin has her own problems—namely coming to grips with the blame directed at her for the new stash of Clinton e-mails that ended up on his personal computer and that became the focus of F.B.I. director James Comey’s now infamous late-October letter to Congress. In the wake of her loss, Clinton told donors that Comey’s letter had cost her the election. Fairly or not, many people blame Comey’s letter with abruptly changing the narrative about Clinton at the penultimate moment of the campaign (despite his subsequent November 6 letter saying nothing new of substance was found on the computer).

But perhaps Abedin’s biggest challenge is that she may soon have a new boss for virtually the first time in her life. The Clinton insider reiterated that Huma, who has spent 21 years at Clinton’s side, might need to prepare for the reality, moving forward, that her “juice” was “tied to Clinton’s ascendancy.” Nevertheless, this person continued, “she’s someone that will be sought after either personally or through business from many rich, very rich connected people.” He concluded: “She’ll do very well for herself.”

On December 15, Clinton is having a big party in Manhattan at the Plaza Hotel, once owned by Trump, for her campaign donors, as a sort of thank-you and keep-in-touch farewell. It is expected to cost more than $100,000 and be paid for with excess campaign funds. Clintonworld insiders will be interested to see if Abedin shows up or whether she chooses to skip the celebration to stay at home to nurse her wounds.

5ir8lf,1,2016-12-16,How haters drag me down,Wollbro,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5ir8lf/how_haters_drag_me_down/,"I just had to write myself off, I wanted to share with you guys how much hate can destroy a person.

It's all started 2012 when I started working at my first real development job, I had worked before that but that was the first company that was focused on development. 
I started there and was happy because everyone was so nice and I was so proud of my work and loved what I was doing, until about 3 months in, when many people started too look down at me because they thought that my work wasn't good as there's often I was compared with them that I didn't have an engineer degree and my code was not how they would write it and so on.
Even though no customers was ever complaining and no work that I did was sent back or had negative feedback, but the other employees didn't care.

This continue during my time there, the employees even talked crap about me to my employer so he started to talk down on me because he believed in them. I will not say everyone at the company was this mean to me but they where some people.

After 2 years I was so depressed so I had lost all interest in what I was doing and had no self esteem left so when I was laid off I felt some relief that I wouldn't have to be going back there any more.
After I was laid off I didn't want to work in software development anymore because of all hate I had gotten the past 2 years, but 2 weeks after my layoff an old work place where I had my first internship on called me and offered a job and I was excited because I had worked there before and know the people who worked there.. I tough..

I started working on the new company but this company had grown from 5 people to 18 people and only 2 of those I had worked with was still working there, but everyone was really nice too me except for 2 people who started exactly as the people at the other company, they started to compare me with them because I had no engineering degree and my code was not looking like how they code and this continued on for another 2 years.
After 2 years at that company I hit the rock bottom, I got to see a doctor and got antidepressants and was on sick leave for about 4 months before I decided to quit.

During my time on antidepressants I was numb I had no feelings, imagine that your 3-4 month baby boy looks at you and smiles and you feels nothing, no joy, nothing. I decided to stop taking the medicine after 2 months and that was hell, I will never take antidepressants again.

It was April 2016 I quit my work and it took me until November last month before I could find anything fun anymore, during this time I couldn't look at a pice of code even though programming was the one thing I had always loved doing but because there was so many people that told me that I couldn't code I believed them and I felt that coding might not be right for me.

Today I still feel like I shouldn't work as an developer that it's not right for me but I know I still want to work with computers, I'm not as depressed anymore but can still have some down time where I lay down and thinks about what everyone has said to me during the last 4-5 years.

I'm on my way back but there will take time and strength to get back but I now have a son that gives me a lot of strength and willingness to move forward in life.

This is what hate can do with a persons life!"

I still managed to be top of my class, to have an internship and to write for a website and to have a boyfriend while taking care of my mom, but in order to do all that I had to give up of something - and it was myself. I didn’t know how to deal with all that, because it was so overwhelming, so I guess I stopped myself from feeling anything at all, because if I did, it would be too much. At first it was mostly around my mother, and I was still happy doing other stuff, but as she started to get a bit better, I started to get worse. Earlier this year, I felt really numb, but for a while I didn’t notice anything. I kept convincing myself I was just tired from school or something like that, and that it wasn’t a big deal, I just needed to rest. But vacations came and I didn’t rest. I felt worse than ever, and at the same time I felt nothing. I knew what was going on because I spent an entire year watching my mother go through it.
If I could look under my numbness, I think I would find a very sad, scared kid who had to grow ten years older in just one. I would find frustration, sadness, anger, disappointment and fear. But instead, I don’t feel any of that. I am afraid to feel that, even though I hate the alternative in which I live in. I sometimes do try to feel it, but I locked it so well from myself that it’s hard to even find it."

I'm in university and have a 3.2, so I guess I'm doing well, but I having to show for it. I dont have any relationships with my professors and I never talk to any of my classmates. The only reason I know someone is because they are a mutual friend. And as for friends I guess they're more acquaintances. When I come home I literally do nothing. No one ever asks to hang out or do anything, I hate breaks. But if a random person were look at me on a sheet, none of what I'm saying would make any sense. I'm in a fraternity and I like to think I'm decently attractive, but for some reason talking to random people is impossible for me and fitting in with the rest of the guys is really difficult for me because as a ""frat bro"" i'm supposed to be getting laid 24/7 and having girls flocking towards me and being very successful in general; which is not true in my case. Because of my inability to cultivate any bond with a female i've just become the guy who is always drunk or under the influence of something. Basically whenever someone wants to get fucked up they hit me up. Granted I always have a good time getting messed up with my bros, but I feel like if I keep this up I'm gonna have a serious problem soon, and there's no sign of me slowing down. I also have no clue what I even want to do with my life. Somehow I've managed to never do anything exciting valuable with my life and I getting to the point where I've kinda missed out on all of my chances to do the things that everyone should have done by now. Compared to the rest of my family I'm a huge fuck up. My step brother is a lawyer, my brother is a software engineer and my sister goes to harvard, full ride. I go to this shitty overpriced D3 school in the middle of the ghetto that has literally nothing to offer me and its too late to transfer now.

At this point I just don't know what changes I could even make to my life that would have a significant impact on my life. I feel as if I'm never going to get into a relationship and even if I did I would be extremely inexperienced because everyone else has had plethora of experience so why waste time with me? As a math major finding an internship is literally impossible if you don't know anyone in the field, which I don't, and since I have so little work experience theres no reason to hire me. Basically I have no marketability in any field, no hobbies, no experience. I've reached a level of apathy where im just coasting through life and im fine, maybe happy?, in the moment, but I know once I graduate im going to be a huge miserable mess and probably live with my parents. I do drugs and it helps for a time, but once they wear off its back to normal, so I try to find more drugs. Its bad. I think part of the problem is that I never tell anyone my problems for fear of being judged. This is the first time ive done anything like this. When i went to the doctor recently I lied because I didnt want to tell them how much i smoke and that I drink 4 days a week. 

If you wanna give any advice, shoot. idk how much it will help tho

5is24h,9,2016-12-16,My ex just got engaged,Joltygon,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5is24h/my_ex_just_got_engaged/,"Man, this is kind of the place I've been looking for, for a while. Somewhere to write it all down and delete it in an hour.

I dated this incredible girl through the end of high school, and for the first year and a half or so of college. She was perfect for me, fit me in all the ways I wanted and needed. I was not perfect for her; our biggest difference being religion. I wasn't outwardly spiritual enough to be a religious leader for her, which is completely valid because I haven't ever been super religious. All fair and good, the relationship wasn't going to work out because of it.

She broke up with me, moved into the summer on an evangelical mission trip, kept in touch, but just kind of kept stringing me along. Come Christmas 3 years ago now, it comes to a confrontation of me saying that if she couldn't be a friend to me, I couldn't be a friend to her. She accepted that, left, and I haven't had a single interaction with her since.

I was kind of sad - always kind of have been - but I recognized that I would not have been a good fit for her; that I wasn't a good fit. But damnit if I haven't gone a day without thinking about her, and missing her. I've tried damn near everything. I got out and got into some new activities. I picked up swing dancing. I started coaching multiple soccer teams. I picked up a lot of pet programming projects and put a couple apps out on GooglePlay. I got back into the dating scene, thinking that I just needed to get out and see what else is out there.

I've not sat back and been secluded, I really have tried. School got tough though, along came a deep depression, my work quality started to slip. I went from a 4.0 student in the honors program of a challenging university engineering program, on track to graduate with honors and a 3 year internship and any future job I could ever want, to failing multiple classes, not showing up for my internship or coaching, got fired from both, and didn't graduate on time. That really sucked, I tried to commit suicide.

Didn't work, clearly, and on comes the shuttling of friends and family freaking out. I finally came clean to my parents that I wasn't graduating on time, dropping the charade that everything was going blissfully. Got dragged to the doctors, got put on medication, and worked with my professors to bring me back to graduating. I ended up graduating over the summer, moved back in with my parents, and started the job search.

I couldn't have gotten luckier with how it all turned out. I got a job with one of my dream companies that just happened to go on a big hiring spree right when I was looking for a job, and I've  now been working for several months. I couldn't enjoy it more; I find this job so much more fulfilling and rewarding than I found my internship. I work with great people that are fun to be around, and I feel enjoy me. I still get some depressing pangs, but for the most part things have really turned around for me.

But still, through every single bit of it, every single day, a though goes back to her. I lost all the texts we had years ago. I've been disconnected from her in every bit of social media. I removed all possible reminders, heeding advice found right here. I still thought of her every day. Still do.

Then I see a facebook post, top of my timeline (due to an enormous amount of likes), that she is now engaged. Engaged to a guy that she started dating 8 months ago. And my heart just got ripped out, man. Honestly, he's probably great for her. I don't know a damned thing about them, but they will probably have a long and happy marriage. That was always her biggest dream; she wanted to get married and never get divorced. Things will turn out well for them.

I'm not sure I could feel worse about it. I don't know what to do, I feel like I've slid all the way back down. I guess I always had the hope that someday things would come back around, but I won't ever admit to that. It's taking all I have not to reach out to her, which I know would be a huge mistake. I can't just let it sit though, I just need to get it off my chest. If I don't, I'm going to be causing a lot more trouble than I have any right to."

Everyone has been lovely to me and i'm enjoying my time.

I would occasionally catch my colleague (who we shall refer to as 'M') looking at me from across the lunch room but I didn't think much of it until now. We didn't really talk at that point. 

During a team building activity a week ago, I finally got to know him one on one and I would say we were comfortable and friends by the end of it. He added me on facebook the next day which I thought was nice (he wanted to be friends!) and as an intern, i'm really trying to get to know everyone in the company. I accept, and I realise that he hasnt added any of the other interns.

We start chatting, and he asks me out that day. I decline and ask my friend what his opinions were of this situation and my friend told me that he suspected my colleague liked me and was asking me ""out"". I subtly dropped a hint that I had a bf and he's left me at seenzone since. The company is on break right now and I haven't seen or heard from him since that point. However, I know I have to see him every day after the holiday break since we are in the same team and i'm scared things will be awkward.


How should I act when I see him? Business as usual or should I try to avoid him?

5isqur,4,2016-12-16,Gallbladder and Heart Patient: Ease My Mind?,Driswae,medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/5isqur/gallbladder_and_heart_patient_ease_my_mind/,"Obligatory note I'm on mobile so my formatting will be what it is, sorry if it hurts!

So this post isn't about me, but about my dear old dad. Today he said words that I hoped I would never hear said a second time: ""If I go into that hospital, I'm never coming back."" The last person to say these words to me actually did die in hospital due to complications with heart surgery. He just never woke back up. Anyway.

A little background: my dad just turned 64 on Dec. 11 (happy birthday daddy!), he's a white male, probably around 260 pounds if not a little less. He carries all his weight between his chest, hips and arms. He's the oldest of six brothers, all of which have their own medical problems, two of which have had gallbladder removal surgery. My one uncle actually had his out the same day this all started. 

Now my dad had a viral, congestive heart failure about six or seven years ago. He would have died had he waited to go to the hospital any longer than he did. I've been taking care of all his medical followup since then, doctors appointments, medications, being genuinely informed about these things. I have mentally prepared myself for the day the heart attack comes: same questions the 911 operator would ask, my plan to get him from bed to stretcher, etc. I'm not a nurse, but a lot of people tell me I should be.

November 30th: I'm just laying down to read some Reddit and have a nap until my husband gets home when I hear this ear piercing wail come from below me. My dad is screaming in pain, calling my name. It takes me about ten seconds to get from bed to his side. He's writhing and crying and grabbing his sheets and he's white and yellow and grey all at once. I can handle pale, I have a hard time with grey, and I know what yellow means. I start panicking. I'm thinking heart attack so I start firing off questions. Finally I conclude and he denies he needs to go to the hospital. He tries to go to the washroom, I call 911. 

Paramedics arrive and assure me it's not his heart. My uncle from down the street comes and tried to talk me out of my hysteria while I'm trying to answer the paramedics (my dad likes to fib. When asked if he had high cholesterol he said no, he takes mess for it). Naturally I let him take the led on the questions but they want to know medications and history and if he can walk and etc. We gather the 11 scripts he's on and the paramedics get him to walk himself down the stairs, to the stretcher and into the ambulance. 

We got into emergency at 11:30 pm. He was admitted at 3:15 am, and finally got into a bed at 4:30 pm the next day. In emergency he saw three doctors and four interns. The result was pancreatitis cause by a gallstone blocking passage to the pancreas. They can remove the stone but they usually don't do the procedure until fridays. This is Wednesday/Thursday. He's in and out of sleep on the emergency bed, doctors are back and forth with catheters, IVs, medications, ultrasounds, X-rays and the lot. They all agree he should have his gallbladder removed to prevent further issues. His only worry: every surgeon he saw about his heart said they would never put him out because he wouldn't wake up. He wants to wake up. They assure him he's going to see a cardiologist before any decisions are made.

So they rush the procedure to get the gallstone to 11:30 am (whilst he's still in emergency, still admitted with no bed), and they successfully manage to get it out, hopefully solving the pancreas problem. Now they can pump him full of fluids to flush the infection. 

The next evening I get a phone call: we flooded his chest with all the fluid we were giving him, he's been moved to another unit and we're trying to flush him without having to pump it out. He can't breathe currently. I freak out, I can't breathe and I'm standing in the grocery store. She assures me he will be fine and to come visit the next day.

Three days go by of back and forth are they or aren't they taking his gallbladder. Finally, Sunday at 630 am I get a text from him: surgery is at 830 am, cardiologist just left says it will be fine. Okay here we go. My mom goes up to the hospital (I ended up stressing myself sick so I stayed home) and waits till after 8 pm to find out my dad's surgery had complications: he had massive scarring on the gallbladder from previous, possibly silent attacks. They had to go in the cut him across the belly way, remove the scar tissue, take the gallbladder and... they nicked something (he wasn't clear on what, my mom thinks he said liver but isn't sure). They had to reconstruct what they cut so he was in surgery all day long. He was going to recovery and that should be that.

Naturally he has drainage bags and for a while we were back to the catheter, but he wasn't having frequent enough bowel movements (due to the morphine they say), so he was on a gentle laxative, plus his regular mess for high blood pressure, cholesterol, gout and all that other great stuff. Poor guys stomach looks like doctor Frankenstein operates on him. 

They sent him home. They sent him home with no warning last Friday. I literally got a text: ""come get me, they are kicking me out."" I was floored. I get that it's not cheap or nice to stay in a hospital forever but at least there they can monitor the situation especially with his heart and other issues. When I went to get him he was swollen like a balloon in his fingers, face, stomach and feet. He couldn't get socks on, could hardly get a jacket on and it's like -11 Celsius on a good day right now (I'm in Ontario, Canada). 

We arrange for a nurse to come to the house to deal with the dressings since they wanted him to go to a clinic everyday that was over a kilometre away, and we don't have a running vehicle. Plus the poor guy can barely stand up straight never mind anything else. The nurse comes daily, has me draining his fluid bags and things are looking like maybe he's gonna be okay.

Yeah right. Didn't I speak too soon? He's had half his staples out since last Tuesday. And he's been in agonizing pain since last Tuesday. They didn't tell us what he could eat, didn't send the pain medication home (and the pharmacy didn't want to issue it because the hospital was supposed too). So I've been asking every day what he wants. No not having anything as he's supposed to eat with his meds. He's been drinking ensure, eating jello and if I'm lucky a sandwich and some soup for supper. 

Wednesday he had some tomato soup (mostly watered down, very light in the milk). He seemed okay and went to sleep with his pain medication. Thursday morning he woke up with over 320 mL of drainage in his bile bag and he was in pain. But there was no nurse that day and he said he would be fine. He had half a can of the chicken noodle soup with the big noodles and vegetables and chicken as well as a ham and cheese sandwich. It's what he felt like. I was in no position to argue, I was happy to see him eating. Still no bowel movements though. 

Today I was up with him at 6 am. His bike bag was so full he said he was having trouble hauling it around. And he was in pain. I told him to tell the nurse how he was feeling if he didn't trust my judgement that he had to go to the hospital. Now it wasn't that he didn't trust me, he just didn't want to go.

Nurse flat out told him: you probably have an infection. You should go to the hospital. If you have pain or the drainage is insanely high, hospital ASAP! (Drainage on the bile today was 350 mL). She left before noon and I called the ambulance (my mom is useless she refused to speak to the dispatcher but tapped the paramedics ears off when he was trying to get my dad to answer questions. She also kept snapping at my dad how she'd have to pay an ambulance fee. One day I might post her greatest hits for some mental health advice: pretty sure she has early Alzheimer's). He kept saying he wasn't coming out if he went back to the hospital. The paramedics told him he was going, either to be forced to have a bowel movement or to deal with an infection. Either way there was nothing we could do at home for him. 

He's been at the hospital since noon-ish. It's now 1120 pm. He's been admitted, still not in a bed, still no bowel movement. He's had blood work and an X-ray to show he does have an infection. 

So ease my mind friends of Reddit. Is he going a little pain crazy or is he having one of those ""I know I'm leaving this world"" moments? Are infections common after this type of surgery? Can they lead to sepsis? The more informed I am the more at ease I'll be.

Thanks for listening to my dad's plight!

Update: Just found out they are keeping my dad. They say his white blood cells are super high and his kidneys are off the charts."

5itf7p,6,2016-12-17,I became the crazy ex girlfriend :(,mgdelin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5itf7p/i_became_the_crazy_ex_girlfriend/,"How I became the psycho Ex-Girlfriend…

It started with a swipe. A right swipe to be precise. I suppose that’s how most relationships start these days, a click, a swipe, there’s no more courting no subtle psychophysical mannerisms that are meant to convey interest. Unfortunate really, but then I also succumbed to the convenient, game like apps meant to find my next source of sexual satisfaction for the next few months. Little did I know that I would fall for this guy without even realizing it.

Alright let’s start off by saying that I don’t blame A (we’ll call the dude in question A for anonymities sake) for anything except not being honest with me, and even this is a stretch. That said I will jump right in. 

February: We began talking on this app called bumble, most of you know it I am sure. For those who have been living under a rock or simply have the good sense to avoid these “dating” apps, bumble is an app where the woman has to start the conversation with people she has matched with (not sure how it works with men looking for men or women looking for women on the app). After the conversation is started the person has a limited amount of time to respond before the math expires. I started my conversation with A using my usual one liner 
“Do you ave 11 protons? because you’re looking sodium fine” 
The texting blossomed from there, for the most part he started the conversations after that, we discussed the usual hobbies, etc. and more importantly we discussed what we were looking for. At the time I was looking for something in between casual sex and long term, a sweet spot that was more than FWB but less than a full on relationship, and to be completely fair that is what A gave me. Most of you may think, wow that sounds great! all the fun none of the drama, who is she to complain? And you’d be right, I look back and realize this was my fault, A was giving me what I asked, and I am the one who changed my mind. But there in lies the problem with dating on these apps or even just dating in your 20’s. Our wants change as our feelings develop! 

Fast forward to about a month later, A asks me to be exclusive, I agreed, thinking that exclusive meant don’t fuck anyone else. Which is sort of does, and more, the more part is what I didn't get, I kept talking to people on bumble, never really pursuing anyone or going out on a date, just chatting, keeping my options open. A little bit of background information for you; A is unique in that I hadn't dated anyone like him before, he his about 5”10 dark hair, larger “boxer type” frame and not really in shape, but not grotesquely obese. Everyone before him had been muscular, extremely athletic and very tall. So I didn’t really think things would last long, I had a tendency to lose interest quickly, I require a lot of sex in a relationship and a lot of guys have a hard time keeping up, and I hadn’t been serious with anyone since my first boyfriend J who I met at 18 and dated for 2 years and had all my firsts with. (He was older and also traveled a lot so I rarely saw him) So when I say I have little experience with relationships I am not exaggerating, I have a lot of trust issues and and baggage from events of my past and I am emotionally detached from people in general due to this. 

When I felt weird still talking to people on bumble I figured it’s because I was just off my game, but later realized this was guilt. The feelings were slowing starting to creep in. A noticed I had changed my picture on bumble while he was off on a trip with his friends, and confronted me about it, I explained my ignorance, and said I would delete the app, and so I did. Mistake #1. So we continued dating and having incredible sex, we would spend the night at each others places often and it was just very relaxed. 

May: By this time I am realizing I really care about him, I don’t find other men as interesting anymore, and I am trying to be more open with him, at least in my own weird way. But A seems disinterested, I notice he spends a lot of time on his phone now, and I worry it’s because I am boring him. A has also quit his job at this point, something I thought was good, since he seemed to hate it. He talks about his future a lot and finding what he wants to do, talks about grad school, etc. A lot of his plans involve going to California, and he talks about it like it’s nothing. Ouch. Suffice to say I am blind, I have completely ignored all the warning signs, the disinterest, the little comments about my weight, talking about the future as if I am not part of it (well duh girl, you aren’t). Mistake #2! 

I have also been getting irritated by the fact that I am still just “the girl he dates”, because dumb me, I forgot that I just wanted something in the middle! To make things worse he wants me to meet his parents, okay, so I am the girl he dates, he wants to take things slow, but wants me to meet his parents? I think it is fair that I was confused, but I am the one who let him do this, so only I am to blame. 

I will never bad mouth A’s parents, they were fucking awesome people, his mother is honestly one of the kindest, loving people I have had the pleasure to meet. His dad was very kind as well, though I did sense some tension over the quitting his job issue. His nana, uncle and aunt were also hilarious, amazing people that I truly regret not being able to know better. If it had been a socially acceptable thing to do I would have stayed in contact with them. So we leave and go back to his place, he says his mom liked me, which I am thrilled about it. 

That night after we got back, I also told him about me moving to Tennessee, I know what you’re thinking! Wtf, where did that come from, you’re kind of the asshole in this situation. That is true only to a point, yes it was a shitty thing to drop on someone, but my mom’s health is very hot and cold right now and TN holds better options for my education and internships. Had he not talked about moving to California so often and tip toed around the fact it wouldn't work out with us if he did, I will 100% say that despite my mom’s health, as much as I love her, I would have stayed. I can now be honest with myself and say that yes, I loved him at this point, before this even, and I would have stayed if he had asked me to, if he has said “don’t leave” I would have ignored all the red flags and stayed with him, knowing deep inside, it was never going to last, he was ready to leave me any minute. 

June: A invites me to meet his friends at a birthday pool party they hold for him. So I go to meet his friends, and they are mostly jewish, nothing wrong with that, I have jewish friends and they are all awesome. Problem is, all these people know each other REALLY well, they all have a lot in common, and I am sitting there equipped only with knowledge pertinent to my degree in molecular bio and biotech and very little real world experience, I am 22 and still in college, what do you expect? I rarely see him during the party, which is fine, he wants to reconnect with his friends right? So I am sitting at this pool party not knowing what to say or how not be awkward or a burden on these people, who to be fair really tried to keep me involved in the conversation. At one point in the evening he and I are talking and I make a joke about him having other side chicks, (it really was a joke!!!! I am not a passive aggressive person!) and he pushes me away from him and scolds me, in front of others, for insulting his character. Embarrassed I was almost a mute for the rest of the night, when we got back to his place he didn't want to have sex. So we laid down and watched t.v. in the dark. I started thinking through the day and all the times he had introduced me as “this is ___ , the girl I am dating”. Most of his friends had no idea he was dating anyone (RED FLAG!) and my paranoid, and newly vulnerable self figured the reason he had been upstairs for 1/2 hr was because he was fucking one of the attractive girls at the party who were foreign. I told myself I was stupid to think he would do something like that. Suddenly I realized I had tears running down my face and it pissed me off. I hadn’t cried over something that wasn’t a movie/sad youtube video/ book for three years and this motherfucker is the reason I’m silently sobbing like some pathetic toddler. I hid my face in his chest and pretended to sleep all night, I didn't want him to ask questions, how could I answer? 

This is the night I realized the true extent of my feelings for him, and the vulnerability he had brought out of me, and it scared me. 

Moving on to the end of June, I didn’t see him often anymore, I had bought him a watch online for his birthday, a gorgeous wooden one that was personalized with a message engraved on the back. The watch took a while to make so it didn't make it until after the move. I was moving to my dad’s house since my lease was up, and I didn’t want to shell out for an additional 6 months since I was moving at the end of the year. He helped me move there and spent the night. We talked, and he said he would be willing to try long distance, I was thrilled. My heart felt like it had just received a direct dose of adrenaline, a day later I texted him telling him I loved him for the first time. I figured I would tell him before the watch came. He called me a day later at his fourth of july party with his friends and said he loved me, and then IN THE SAME CALL broke up with me. I had never felt so instantly empty and grief stricken. I could barely talk to him, I was in tears sitting on the driveway in the dark listening to him break up with me, tell me long distance won’t work for him because he needed someone to “hug him at the end of a hard day”. The next week was filled with me felling empty, alone, and worst of all even more broken than normal. I got a call form him later that month when the watch came, he loved it, I didn’t know what to say to him, he had just torn out my heart, threw it on the ground, and acted like it had never happened. I told him I was glad he liked it and he replied with “that’s all?” What did he want me to say? He knew how I felt, and he decided that wasn’t good enough a week ago. 

During the summer I went to TN for a month to visit my mom and watch the pets while they were on a trip. He and I texted a little here and there, he would say he missed me and tell me how hard it was for him. (Hard for him? seriously dude?) My parents and friends told me I was better without him, that he had ditched me once I became inconvenient. I became angry, and we  fought, and stopped talking. When I got back, I chatted him up October, I really needed sex and I wanted to get over him, I figured fucking him would desensitize me. Mistake #? I lost count. 

All my old feelings for him crept back up, I ended up telling him I couldn’t do it anymore, I asked him if I could pick up my stuff sometime. After he asked to reschedule, I told him to just leave it all in front of his house and I would pick it up while he was out. He forgot to put it out, and when I called him to figure out where it was he asked if we could do it another day, I told him no. At this point I wanted all of this to be over. I had fucked my ex J (first boyfriend) and honestly just felt like shit. He said to come to barnes and noble where he was to pick it up, I did, and I left him with one last heartfelt note wishing him well in life, and trying to pathetically explain my feelings. Mistake. 

Press on to December, I leave in a week. Right after Christmas in fact. I am exited, and hoping this will serve as a clean slate where I can forget about him and all the pain I let him cause. And I get a call from J’s finance (I know, I am an asshole, but that’s an even longer story) she is crying and trying to tell me in her garbled english/japanese that J may have given her an std an that he had died in a car crash and the funeral had passed. She gave me long enough on the phone to get the location of where he was buried and then hung up. 

Any progress at trying to pull myself together was dashed, in fact I am still trying to figure out where to start again. And stupid, stupid me, I had been fucking J before hooking up with A after A and I broke up. So now, if having to deal with the sudden death of my first love and close friend was not enough, I have to tell A he needs to checked for STDs too. I call him that night but chicken out. I text him two days later and tell him to get checked and why, but he replies asking me what he needs to be checked for, how long have I known, and when I refuse to call back and ask J’s fiance what she was checked for he goes on at me telling me he is disappointed in me, I am immature, and have put his new partner at risk. Triple ouch. No care at all that J is dead, I find out that within a month of us not seeing each other anymore you have moved on, and you think I am immature because I don’t want to call back the fiance of the man I fucked, who has just died. Right. So long long story short I let my emotions overwhelm me and I made some seriously cruel comments and a fool of myself. 

Well, if you made it this far, congrats, I am impressed, and you probably are wondering what the fucking point of this is? Well I guess there are a lot of points, 
1st, create the expectation that your feelings may change as a relationship evolves
2nd, don’t allow yourself to be vulnerable to someone who doesn’t treat you right
3rd, we all go crazy sometimes, and while I always preach that you should be classy when breaking up, if you do go a bit crazy, forgive yourself and learn from it. 
4th, if he’s actually into you, he will actually try
5th, good guys/girls don't make you feel like shit
6th, dating in your 20’s is hard as fuck
7th, talk! if you are unsure about where a relationship is, talk about it, if you are upset or worried about something tell them, if you love them tell them, if you want more tell them, just talk.
8th, they may be wasting your time, but you’re the one letting them
9th, people lie 
10th, this one is a rule: if you’re texting an ex, wait a day before you send it and see if you still feel the same. Most of the time you are just letting your emotions/wants get the best of you.

~Good luck my dears, and tell me your crazy ex moments!!!~"
5itkw2,87,2016-12-17,"[Spoilers] Rory is a typical Millennial, and her Revival storyline reflects that:",waytoomanychoices,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5itkw2/spoilers_rory_is_a_typical_millennial_and_her/,"- She was told she was special throughout her childhood, that she was going make an impact, and if she received perfect grades and followed the checklist, everything Good would happen. This is *not her fault*, but it explains her perspective in the Revival. It's a common Millennial trait.


- So Rory worked hard in her education, achieving a Yale degree filled with extracurriculars, unpaid internships, networking events, etc. Understandably, she feels like she's entitled to a higher-ranked job as a result. 

- And, if you look at the success of Rory's peers (Paris, Doyle, Logan), this stress and feeling that she *should* get a great job right out of the gate is compounded. All her rich friends jumped into high ranking jobs, and she didn't. All her hometown friends made a family and social connections, and she didn't. I'd be a little frazzled, too.  

- She's also learning that a Bachelor's degree for Millennials is basically the equivalent of a high school education for other generations. It gets you the minimum, despite the older generations who say it gets you everything. A Master's degree is another year (or two) of work and money, for a low level job. In weighing her options, I agree that a Master's degree to teach high school English is not a good choice.


- As technology grows and the Millennials demand more instant gratification, Rory is realizing that journalism is slowly fading into nothing. All that's left are the Buzzfeed-like writing jobs that are just forgetful entertainment (""10 ways to blah blah blah!""). (For the record, a RL blogger wrote a post about being a journalist in the Obama campaign -- it was a lot of work for no pay, and only one of her articles was published near the back of the paper. Everyone sees Rory's Season 7 ending as her success, but the Revival shows that her career failed right out of the gate, despite one article).


- Because of all of this, Rory doesn't have a job that pays enough to live her life. The job offers she receives will never match the cost of her education, for years and years and years; the first generation for this to be true. And that's a shitty realization. (Although admittedly, I feel like ASP smudged Rory's history and pretended like her trust fund never happened, in order to make her storyline relatable to Millens right now).


I agree that Rory did *a lot* wrong in the Revival, but I also don't see her spoiled, either. Unpopular opinion, but I found her somewhat sympathetic: her situation was a weird mix of general fuck ups, trying to 'shoot for the stars' but failing, and a sociological look at how Millennials are falling apart. Their situation isn't necessary their fault, but rather due to how their personalities were groomed by the Boomers, and just shit luck at reaching adulthood during housing crises, job shortages, globalization, and a rapid societal shift. Sociologists are currently waiting to see *how* the 'middle class, school-based' Millennials deal with their situation, because it's their choices as 30yos that will decide how spoiled and immature they truly are, or if all that education and 'change the world' mentality will achieve something.

When you listen to experts, the answer to Millennials problems always boils down to: 

1. leave your single apartment and move closer to home (aka, you can't afford what you parents could afford, so give that up and live communally)
2. figure out your life priorities
3. reconnect with your peers and family instead of long distance interactions: put down the cell phone and delete social media (fighting the Millennials' high rates of anxiety/suicides/isolation)
4. take the ridiculously low-paying job for now
5. and have a side interest that can give you extra profit (to pay your rent). 

Which is basically the end of Rory's storyline: she leaves her apartment and moves home, she gets pregnant, which helps her decide that journalism (and Logan) aren't for her, throws away all her phones but the basic one, she reconnects with her town and all her old friends, she takes the *lowest* ranking job as a small town local newspaper, and she writes her book on the side. She's giving up the dreams her parents had for her and is embracing mental wellness.  

Rory is the Millennial success story."
5itr9p,11,2016-12-17,Realizing that I'm not a fan of having female friends - gay in a new city. Figuring this out.,Aaoto,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5itr9p/realizing_that_im_not_a_fan_of_having_female/,"21, recently graduated - moved to the west coast from NYC alone. I landed a great job post-graduation, and I’m settling into this living alone lifestyle. I’m content.

&amp;nbsp;


There’s been this tendency as I’m sure many of you can relate, to me attracting primarily female friends. I have no problem with it, the girls are great. Not as intense, usually better convo. It could be a comfort level on my end subconsciously; I’m sure it is. Either way, I interned with these two girls and kind of rode it out with them this summer. We partied, smoked, drank, and landed our jobs together post internship. We were that killer trio.

&amp;nbsp;


Things then started getting weird, as usual. I started feeling prop-ish and gimmick-ish or somehow for their convenience? It’s hard to explain, but I felt expendable. The trio slowly broke up. One girl who went to school here became busy with work and was no longer able to hang out with me and the other girl. Fine, I understand - the issue was, she wouldn’t reach out when she was free to hang out either…so we grew apart. This other girl now has a love interest who she now hangs out with *all the time*. She’s introduced him to all of our mutual friends, so it’ll turn into them going to these house parties that I’ve apparently not been invited to for whatever reason, and me sulking in my apartment on Friday and Saturday nights trying to figure out what I’m doing. I don't hang out with them because he seems to act up around her friends and the night usually ends with them arguing and everyone's night getting cut short. That's why I stopped hanging out with them, my sanity. I told her this. There's that and I think he gets a little threatened when I'm around...idk why. I'm pretty gay lol. She’ll ignore me for days until it’s of her convenience again to complain about work after this trend…and I’m kind of over it.

&amp;nbsp;

This happens often, me+girl become close, girl gets a boyfriend, I’m kicked out of the picture. I probably shouldn’t feel some way, but it bothers me how dependent I was on them. Conversations are one-sided; usually, them talking about their relationships ––– god forbid I try to get a word in about anything….it turns to an underlying quick disinterest and a pacifying word of “you’ll be fine” lol. I think I'm expected to worship and kneel to their will and necessities without reciprocation. Sitting here on a Friday night questioning all of this and I'm stumped as to how I allowed myself to end up here.

&amp;nbsp;

Makes it harder being in a new city…and shy in a new city but eh. I'm not too into the gay scene either...so that makes it difficult as well to meet people.

&amp;nbsp;

I need some gay friends, huh? Or just better quality friends?
Have any of you experienced this? And how do I get out of this rut?

like this? And tips on figuring out my own space?"
5iudfp,3,2016-12-17,Procedure Experience,NoGrandPlan,Vasectomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vasectomy/comments/5iudfp/procedure_experience/,"All right - that's that done! I went in yesterday for my V, and here's how it went.

I'm 48, two kids, and we decided that we didn't want any more; wifey's 39, and for various reasons she's not currently using birth control; it would be much better for me to have a vasectomy than for her to have the female version; also that the sex would be much better without the obligatory condoms. You guys know all the reasons. 

SO! I got a half-day off from work, came home, we had one last condom test (went fairly well) then, due to child-care stuff, picked up the kids, and we all trooped off to the urologist.

When we got there, everyone in the office was very nice, helpful, we set the kids up with their electronic distractions, and I was taken to The Room. The nurse asked me a few questions - one of which,  ""Do you have peas?"" threw me for a few seconds, until she clarified that she meant frozen peas - then told me to strip from the waist down and cover myself with the paper sheet thingy, and sit up on the operating table.

After a few minutes of waiting, I heard voices outside; one of them said ""You can come in and watch this one, if you'd like."" So! My junk was going to be viewed by more than one person for the first time in my life! In walked the rather personable doctor and a young lady who I'm going to assume is an intern. They greeted me, and we're off. 

He said ""I'm just going to clean you up a bit,"" (remember, I had just had sex maybe an hour before; but I do try to be thorough in my cleaning after that happens!), and slapped what felt like a bucket full of iodine all over my scrotum. He asked if I wanted a bow on it, and I said my wife might like that as a Christmas present. Oh how we laughed...

So, down to the procedure. I was concerned that he was going to explain each step of the way, but i think he realised I didn't want that, and kept the talking to the essentials. starting on the right side, he warned me that I was about to feel the needle - and boy did I. I'd put that pain at about a three. Then then was a bit of uncomfortable pulling and tugging and then the pain jumped to about a seven. I wonder and he apologized and said, essentially, ""I'm right in the middle of this now, it's better if we just power through."" I was pretty much tensed up from that point on, occasionally sweating and feeling slightly queasy. Then came the cauterization. That was not a pleasant smell at all, as you might imagine. Things were the same for the left one, and he joked that he thought they'd filled the syringes with water rather than lidocaine.

Anyway, once he got to the end he said ""Okay, you're done. If you still feel slightly shaky"" - I did - ""you can lie there as long as you need to."" Then they both left. I took about five more minutes, then sat up and examined myself. I was a little surprised to find that he hadn't put any bandaid or anything over the incisions, and there was a sizeable drop of blood welling up on the left side. He'd left me some gauze so I put that in my shorts, got dressed, and walked out to my waiting family.

All in all, it took somewhere around 45 minutes. After I got home - the drive home was painless, despite the roads 'round here - I did a few things about the house (nothing strenuous), and sat down. There hasn't been much pain at all, nothing more than a dull ache. When I got up this morning, I felt no different than I did when I got up yesterday morning, which was nice. 

I'll keep you posted if anything changes. "
5iufsv,25,2016-12-17,Huma After Clintonworld's Stunning Defeat - by William D. Cohan (Vanity Fair),ShaunaDorothy,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5iufsv/huma_after_clintonworlds_stunning_defeat_by/,"Huma vs. the “Night Stalkers” After a stunning election loss, the knives appear to be out in Clintonworld

.......................

""Maybe I’m just pissed off, but I really don’t give a shit about what happens to Huma to be honest with you,” one close adviser to Hillary Clinton told me recently. He was irked, in particular, at Abedin’s seemingly superfluous breach of decorum during a post-election event. On the day after Hillary Clinton’s stunning loss to Donald Trump, this person said, Abedin appeared within the rope line while Clinton greeted her morose and woebegone supporters. “You’re staff, O.K.?” this adviser continued. “Staff is staff. You’re not a principal.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign notes that Abedin was seated alongside the rest of the campaign’s senior leadership team that morning. Abedin declined an interview request.)

In the bizarre month since Clinton’s loss, few people besides the candidate herself have seen their fortunes overturned as significantly as has Abedin, 40, the glamorous and charismatic former vice-chair of the campaign. For two decades, Abedin has been a fixture inside Clinton’s inner circle; she began her career as a college-aged White House intern and rose to become Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department. As a former adviser to Bill Clinton once put it to me, over time Abedin morphed into “a mini Hillary” herself. She wasn’t merely an aide, but rather an amalgamation of adviser, best friend, confidante, and perhaps even surrogate daughter. Abedin “inspires loyalty, and she’s loyal back,” one Clinton aide told Amy Chozick in her widely read dissection of Clintonworld for The New York Times Magazine, in 2014.

In fact, according to Chozick, Clinton appeared to countermand those who suggested that Abedin should be relegated on behalf of the sexting antics of her spouse, the randy former congressman Anthony Weiner. Clinton, Chozick reported at the time, appeared more concerned with quarantining the so-called “night stalkers”—sycophants and hangers-on from her many decades in public life—who might try to re-exert their influence. Abedin, meanwhile, was widely expected to get a big job inside a Clinton White House.

But amid Clinton’s stunning post-election hangover, some inside the inner circle wonder if Abedin became overwhelmed by the attention, and shut too many people out. “She was enjoying the red carpet and enjoying the photo spreads much too much in my opinion,” one Clinton insider told me. “She enjoyed being a celebrity too much.” The close Clinton adviser elaborated that Abedin and the other tight-knit circle of people may have suffocated Clinton, preventing the campaign from taking in outside counsel. “The real anger is toward Hillary’s inner circle,” the Clinton insider told me. “They reinforced all the bad habits.” For instance, the suggestion had been made that Clinton should show her gregarious side, by, for instance, appearing more often on The View. (She appeared once, but Bernie Sanders, her rival for the nomination, appeared a handful of times.)

According to this person, however, the inner circle nixed that idea. It seemed, this person elaborated, that even minor suggestions about changing the narrative fell on deaf ears. “Right away,” this person continued, “it was either regarded as an intrusion or a naïve suggestion or maybe someone has an agenda. And so people just stopped bothering. Where in most presidential campaigns the circle grows broader and broader, hers grew smaller and smaller.” (A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign refutes this characterization, noting that the campaign may have had up to three times as many people on their plane during the election’s final weeks.)

In the month since the election, Abedin, once ubiquitous, has essentially vanished from public view. She was absent from the recent, and public, campaign exhumation that occurred at Harvard’s Kennedy School, during which her former colleagues tussled with Trump supporters such as Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski. Recently, the Daily Mail captured Abedin shopping at the Lululemon store on lower Fifth Avenue with her four-year-old son, Jordan, in tow. The story followed a report in the New York Post noting that Weiner, in the wake of his most recent sexting scandal, had cut short his rehab stay after about 30 days, supposedly because he ran out of money. (His family had wanted him to stay for 90 days, at a cost of around $1,000 per day, Richard Johnson reported in Page Six, and his parents reportedly took out a mortgage on their home to help him pay for the cost of the treatment.)

Compounding Weiner’s financial woes, in early December, the New York City Campaign Finance Board fined him more than $65,000 for a variety of infractions related to his mayoral campaign. Weiner apparently spent $600 of his campaign funds on televisions, another $1,539 on his personal dry-cleaning and cell-phone service, and more than $115,000 for a group of expenditures after the campaign was over. Weiner was also ordered to repay some $195,000 in matching campaign funds. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, is reportedly investigating Weiner’s latest round of sexting, along with the F.B.I. and the New York City police.

Aside from Weiner’s public mishegas, Abedin has her own problems—namely coming to grips with the blame directed at her for the new stash of Clinton e-mails that ended up on his personal computer and that became the focus of F.B.I. director James Comey’s now infamous late-October letter to Congress. In the wake of her loss, Clinton told donors that Comey’s letter had cost her the election. Fairly or not, many people blame Comey’s letter with abruptly changing the narrative about Clinton at the penultimate moment of the campaign (despite his subsequent November 6 letter saying nothing new of substance was found on the computer).

But perhaps Abedin’s biggest challenge is that she may soon have a new boss for virtually the first time in her life. The Clinton insider reiterated that Huma, who has spent 21 years at Clinton’s side, might need to prepare for the reality, moving forward, that her “juice” was “tied to Clinton’s ascendancy.” Nevertheless, this person continued, “she’s someone that will be sought after either personally or through business from many rich, very rich connected people.” He concluded: “She’ll do very well for herself.”

On December 15, Clinton is having a big party in Manhattan at the Plaza Hotel, once owned by Trump, for her campaign donors, as a sort of thank-you and keep-in-touch farewell. It is expected to cost more than $100,000 and be paid for with excess campaign funds. Clintonworld insiders will be interested to see if Abedin shows up or whether she chooses to skip the celebration to stay at home to nurse her wounds.

I don't know what I'm doing here, so ... here we go. University was never great for me, I learned a few things about computer science and about myself, but I'm now 6 years into a three-year Bachelor's degree with two exams to go till it's done. I'm 24 and don't know what I have really done in the past six years, lying in bed and watching TV was a big part of it I guess. The problem is that I don't really know what I'm doing with my life and going to University wasn't that great of an idea to begin with I suspect. Every semester I get into this cycle of apathy interrupted by periods of fear about not being a functioning human being and I consequently fail exams because I don't prepare but worry and feel like shit. It's my main occupation. The little else I do is just there to drown out the dread. And I have done it again with the exam I have in five days. It's sort of a slow suicide. Not a ""he killed himself, sad"", but a ""he's a complete screwup, sad"" to other's. I really want to work I think, programming makes me happy, and applied for a few internships, but got nothing back. So that is stalling as well. Having no friends doesn't help. The binge-eating as a coping mechanism doesn't help either. And yes, I know I need help, I've tried medication, but it's obviously not a real solution, and I'm in a tight spot with therapy, waiting lists being a few months long and me being in a city I really want to get away from but didn't yet, because of my fucked up university-and-nothing-else-to-do-situation. And there is the problem of being with other people reminding me of how fucked-up I am. I'm just meandering about in my so-called life and I've always been a little bit like that. I think I know what I need, a stable environment and stuff assigned to me to do, but on some days it seems impossible and I wish everything would just finally crash."

I just don't know what to do anymore. After 3 years at college I began working in the field of my study, Media. But 6 months later my boss moved offices and I was left without a job. Unfortunately I was only an intern and he was 100% within his right to just let me go so I had no choice but to get whatever work I could find. 

For the last two years I have been in and out of temp jobs, I try to get a more full-time position somewhere but everytime I go for an interview I am told they don't think I would be a good fit for a general job in a store as I can e very withdrawn and timid at times. 

For the last year I have been scraping by. Somehow landing temp job after temp job to help my partner and I pay rent but now its come dry. I haven't been able to find work in the last two months and my partner is thinking about moving back in with her parents because she cant keep us both afloat. Which brings me onto the fact I have nowhere to go if she leaves. Her parents don't like me/wont let me stay with them and im 100% sure if I cant get my side of the rent by end of the month me and her are over as its what she keeps telling me day in day out. 

The other day I started having really bad thoughts and I just need to sort things out before everything falls apart but I dont know what to do. The job centre over here wont help me whilst I live with my partner because they take into consideration her parents funds which is 'great' because they would rather she moves back home and leaves me anyway. 

I have nowhere to turn, no family to ask for help. 

The net has always felt homely too me so. Family, what should I do?"

Feeling lost and not sure what I should do next.",mhlaxe,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5iwi8r/26_reached_200k_net_worth_milestone_feeling_lost/,"I am perhaps seeking more of life guidance here rather than specific financial advices. Some personal stories fragmented with maybe approval-seeking words and rants. I hope you will bear with me.

Next year I will be celebrating my 5-year job anniversary. A little ahead of it, this summer, I have reached the $200k net worth milestone that I've set 5 years ago when I graduated from college. 

A little bit of personal history. I came to the US to study Aerospace Engineering when I was 18. My parents were always supportive of me studying abroad. However, they were going through some financial hardship back then - so I needed to finance my college with scholarships, loans, and some on-campus employment. Looking back, I'm always amazed by how little I spent during my college years - $300 for rent&amp;utilities with $30 set aside for food to last me a month. I rode a bicycle through the cold, harsh mid-west winter to get to school because the idea of owning a car was too far out of my reach. 

But it was college too. Everybody was poor. And I made sure to pick up some fun alongside. We drunk $3 pitchers at college bars and made occasional road trips across the country. I did have to say no to some parties and trips though because I was literally living paycheck by paycheck. To be frank, I still regret for not accepting my mom’s offer to wire me some money – but I had very different perspective on life back then.

Anyways, believing naively that the ITAR requirements in the Aerospace industry can be overcome if you obtain good skills and knowledge - I've worked my butt off through college. In 2011, I graduated from a well-regarded engineering school with a 3.9 GPA and some internship experience. Still, I could not find any job in the industry I wanted to be in. I’ve considered several graduate programs. But I felt the urge to be more financially self-sufficient first and, honestly speaking, was feeling too exhausted to continue the study. In the end, I ended up picking an engineering job in an adjunct industry. The thought process was that I could try going back to Aerospace once I have my green card. Having a green card also means freedom to start my own business here in the States. This is also when I set the goal to reach $200k in net worth – so as to gain the freedom of choice in the future not constrained by money.

The pay was average. But the work was not too demanding which has left me with some time to work on personal projects. Through the years, I have had a few promotions and change of positions. Earlier last year, I have finally paid off my $40k student loans and now own a modest but brand new car that has also been paid off. I can now buy gifts for the people I care – like my parents and brothers. My green card will arrive, hopefully, in a few months too. 

So you see, when I reached the $200k milestone, I felt like I have accomplished much of what I wanted to achieve as a broke student living in a foreign country 5 years ago. It feels good that I can soon call the US my home. But at the same time, the time has brought me different views on things. Instead of truly enjoying the freedom and feeling better about myself, I cannot help but think of different paths I could have taken. The industry I was once so passionate about feels like it is fading away slowly in distance. The money I thought would bring me more certainty is now making me conflicted – “Should I settle down and buy a house?”, “Maybe save for my future family?”, “What about MBA?”, “No, my friends make more money. I need more money.”, etc.

I sometimes think I have narrowed down my paths too fast – even though back then it felt like it was the only path. Now that I have gone down the path, I feel like it was just an excuse for not considering other harder options. 

Does anyone feel the same way? Any personal stories that I can learn from? What should I read or ask myself so that I can find the way forward? "

Hello all.
I met ""T"" on OkCupid in 2014 after a rough breakup. I made the account because I was heartbroken and desperately looking of someone to just pass time with. We met, kinda hit it off, continued talking for a few months.



I found out during that time that T was actually still going over his ex girlfriend's house to sleepover. Apparently since she was SO sick and distraught over the breakup, the only way she could feel better is if T would visit. I called bullshit and told him I was okay as friends.



We decided to stay as friends, a couple of days later he mentioned to me he was seeing another girl. This woman was one of his interns.. (He's a scientist).



Apparently the intern agreed to him seeing his ex under the condition she came with him while visiting her. Which sounds so shady. If she's already in a dark place after the breakup, how does seeing his new girl make things any better?



We fell off texting and I did not hear from him for 2 years..


PROBLEM
A few weeks ago I get a text message from a random number asking if it was me. After a brief exchange I was surprised to find out that it was him. After 2 years you still have my number? I had gone through a few phone mishaps that I lost all of my contacts.



When he reached out he told me this had been the worst year of his life. One of his dogs was hit by a vehicle and could no longer walk again, his mother was diagnosed with cancer (only parent since father left in his young years), an he had gone into a terrible car accident.



Even though this wasn't the easiest of years for me, I consoled him and he asked me if we could continue the conversation in person. He set a date for Monday. We didn't speak until Monday morning when he cancelled. The conversation was a bit odd, when he reached out to reschedule I told him it was no problem since I do had forgotten about our plans since I was so busy. I had a 10 hour shift the day before and my mind was literally racing.



He was very upset and sarcastic and told me he was glad that ""I made him such a priority in his life"" and that he penciled me into his schedule. I was a little taken back by this. We had not spoke in 2 years, what makes you think you are suddenly a priority?



In the meantime I was a little alarmed by his condescending attitude. He had just gotten his PHD and all he spoke about was physics and his projects. He would call his interns ""useless"" and told me that were unable to learn the material he gave them quickly. He spoke so ill of his brother. Told me he cannot hold a job yet T supports his family unit.



We rescheduled and met up for some dinner. All he seems to speak about is himself. How successful he is, how shitty his home life is and then proceeded to ask me a few questions. He paid saying , ""its cool I got it, we haven't seen each other in a long time."" 



We have been chatting everyday via ""Google Hangouts"" and it's been interesting. He says he uses hangout to talk to coworkers and our conversation has picked up since downloading the app.He set up another hangout. He said he was looking to book this steakhouse near his job but it had no reservations for the specific time he wanted to go.  He asked me what I had in mind, we decided dinner and a movie is a go.I guess it's a good sign that he wants to see me on his day off.



He takes long to respond sometimes, which is alright with me because I understand that his job is VERY demanding. I just don't want this to be another repeat of the narcissistic cycle of devaluation. Where we speak so much and I'm on cloud 9 and then it just crumbles. 



Due to my lack of boundaries and trust and abandonment issues, I have had a history of narcissistic relationships. More than ever I wasn't to prevent being in that situation and stop the cycle.



The real issue is... I cannot put a finger on to if he actually likes me or is so consumed with all of these tragedies that he needs someone to latch on to. I don't know if this is a healthy development or if this is something I should walk away from.



Thanks.

  **tl;dr**: Unsure if [31/M] likes me or is using me [25/F] as emotional support. We've been out and speak everyday but I want to make sure this is a healthy development."
5ix1zu,5,2016-12-17,Fixing Phantom Menace and Anakin's Overall Arc,hanslandablofeld,RewritingThePrequels,https://www.reddit.com/r/RewritingThePrequels/comments/5ix1zu/fixing_phantom_menace_and_anakins_overall_arc/,"There's actually seeds of promise buried under all the distortion and bloat. So this fix cuts out most of the ridiculous distractions, and rewires some plot points to make more sense or be more impactful.

Qui-Gonn (QG) and Obi-Wan (OW) are escorting the queen after an assassination attempt and get grounded on Tatooine after a brief dogfight with insurgents. QG stays with the queen and OW travels to the nearest town (you don't leave the main mission with the intern and go run errands yourself). OW gets stranded in a sandstorm and gets rescued by Anakin (a throw-forward to when Luke sees OW in the snow in TESB). OW learns of A's strength (no midichlorians) and tells QG, who instructs him to free the boy so they can take him to train. Meanwhile, he speaks to Yoda about this new candidate. Yoda is surprised he cannot sense the boy despite his innate power and suspects something else is afoot.

There was a moment in the movie that I liked which can happen between A and OW (instead of QG). A asks if OW is a Jedi since he has a ""laser sword"". OW muses maybe it belonged to the Jedi he killed to get it. A says Jedi are infallible and can't be killed, and OW sadly refutes that, wishing it were true (maybe setting up for some later exposition there). This is also the first seed of doubt A has regarding the Jedi's strength. This will be a big motivating factor for A. What I disliked about the prequels was how A had a decreased agency in his own downfall. He was always *reacting* on his path to the dark side: becoming more powerful is always a secondary reason, either to protect his loved ones or avenge them. Then he goes 100% dark all too quick. Instead, he should take a more proactive role in his own turn. He resists Jedi orthodoxy as per the movies, but he also *pursues* power, he *wants* to be great, etc.

Anyhow, OW tries to free A and Watto demands a huge sum of money, knowing it is outrageous. A tells OW he has a podracer he could sell. OW asks where the boy got a pod racer. (A doesn't build it, that's gratuitous). Instead, Shmi says ""a generous man passing through"" gifted it to him. A confides he saw the man carry a ""laser sword"" too. So now OW is on alert that there is a Jedi(?) who wants something with the boy. QG, not knowing anything about the Jedi being in these parts, decides it must have been a Sith and hypothesizes that the podracing was intended as a passive form of training/prep. OW finds it hard to believe, since the last known Sith was Darth Plagueis hundreds of years ago. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, this mysterious Sith, claiming to be in bad health, stayed with the Skywalkers for a short duration and left. Shmi appreciated that he was kind to A. She reveals that A has no father. 

The mysterious man will be Palpatine himself. Darth Plagueis can create the Chosen One, after becoming obsessed with the Jedi prophecy. Plagueis manipulates the force and causes Shmi to become pregnant, endowing the boy with a bit of his own nature.

In a hurry, OW decides to risk a podrace for the pot, so they can free A. QG actually chides him for this risky gambit, but OW says he trusts the boy's abilities. In fact, this can become a pattern: OW making excuses for A, both proud of his power and too affectionate -- in the end, OW will wonder if he could have done more, if he should have enforced restraint on his padawan. His guilt of enabling A's journey to the dark side would play nicely into the original story. If the core of the original movies was the father-son relationship between Vader and Luke, it makes good sense to have the core of the prequels be the father-son relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin.

When A is freed, OW knows there isn't enough in the pot left to free Shmi. Feeling betrayed that he wasn't told this sooner, A will resent OW for this deception. On their way back to the ship, they get attacked by Darth Maul. As DM force pushes the boy clear of the fight, it becomes evident he is after the boy, not Amidala. QG joins the fight and the gang barely escapes. QG realizes that this Sith had been hiding the boy, shrouding him so that Yoda could not see. They conclude that there is an active Sith plot underway. Amidala's assassination attempts are related, but they do not know it.

A is initially feeling forlorn, having abandoned his mother. OW can't face the boy, feeling responsible. QG finds A sulking in the ship and offers him consolation. He describes how he found OW in a similar way and took him under his wing. Thus we humanize OW to A, deepening their relationship. QG says OW became one of the most promising padawans and will soon become a Jedi. He offers A some hope, direction. A already starts thinking more of when he can become a Jedi. This can even be a point of guilt later, because over the years, he will almost forget his mother. He will eventually receive news that she has died. Only then will he return to his desert home, a reminder of his small beginnings. It can be a humbling, tragic moment in his rise to power -- at a time when he is truly alone. Then when nothing is left for him on this planet except for irritating sand, it will be safe to stow Luke there for safety, since Vader would never be able to bear returning home.

Back on the ship, Padme begins looking out for A as well. Possibly the reveal that Padme is Amidala can be postponed to the second movie. That way, they can carry on their affair in secrecy. Maybe A learns this later, maybe he knows early on. But when she has to side between duty and love, she picks duty. And A is further embittered and pushed to the dark side because of this.

They get back to Coruscant, which is the Chancellor's home. He is likeable and seemingly genuine (not that obvious villain like in the movies), to the point where we have to wonder if he is even really the same Palpatine from the originals. He shelters Amidala and the Jedis, offering a political olive branch for their opposition parties, while Amidala is in danger. The Chancellor grows very fond of A too. 

We can even see Palpatine taking care of his apparently ailing father, who is very old and chair-bound. At one point, the man is passing by A, but stops to look him over. Tears enter his eyes and he reaches out to the boy. ""Look at you, my boy? You're here."" Palpatine kneels in and says, ""No father, I'm here. That's Anakin, he's our guest"". As the man is escorted away, Palpatine says his father has grown very old and does not recognize anyone or speak coherently anymore. This can partly be true, but later Palpatine can reveal the man is in fact Darth Plagueis and did recognize Anakin. But for now, Palpatine contritely says something to the tune of, ""One of life's greatest cruelties is when a parent can look on their own child and not recognize them."" Bit of foreshadowing there.

Ultimately, there is a coordinated insurgent attack on the Chancellor's planet. Unbeknownst to the federation, it was planned and executed by the Chancellor himself. Amidala being there is just the icing on the top. It will create a state of emergency and the Chancellor plans to use the bipartisan support to create an artificial war and assume control. During the attack they have to fight and flee. Coruscant is declared enemy territory.

The attack is led by Maul. The duel happens like in the movie. QG dies, OW defeats DM (who manages to escape). But when QG dies, he actually tells OW to be *careful* with A. He says the boy has a good heart, but he wonders if it is too late for him. The movie ends with OW becoming A's charge, taking him on as a padawan. OW apologizes to A for his lie and promises he will never let him down again.

5ixdv6,1,2016-12-17,I'm sick and tired of my mom's attachment to me,countrygirl2294,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ixdv6/im_sick_and_tired_of_my_moms_attachment_to_me/,"When I was 15 I realized that my mom annoyed me a lot. What I had thought was normal before actually wasn't that normal. She wanted me in her sight whenever she could/when I was home. If I was in her room watching TV and decided to go to the bathroom she'd then get offended asking ""where are you going?"" every time, without fail. When I finally left to go to boarding school for my last two years of high school I realized how annoying she was to me. I honestly didn't miss her while at school. 

So cut to me deciding to go to college 9 hours away. She wasn't happy with that. She wasn't going to tell me no, but she didn't want me going. She's also really nosy with my personal life. Last year I was going through some stuff with a guy. We were friends but I had my first time with him. He was mentally unstable. That was taking a toll on my mental health. When I came home for Thanksgiving break she asked about him and I asked her politely to not ask about him. On our way down to a family get together for Thanksgiving my dad, my sister, my mom, and I stopped at a gas station she then asked what was so complicated and why I didn't want to talk about him. I just wanted her to shut up so I admitted that he and I had sex together. Luckily my dad and my sister were coming back to the car so she shut up and didn't mention it further. Then I tried to open up to her about my relationship with him a couple months later. And then I tried to tell her that I was trying to get over him by having Tinder hookups. She didn't ask me how I was doing mentally, she didn't offer any emotional support, instead she lectured me on how having casual sex is bad. Which she called me at 8 am to tell me about. 

This past spring my dad got sick. Then he passed away a couple months after. I understand that things are rough now for her because she just lost the love of her life. But literally nothing good I say gets a good response. I'm studying abroad in France for 9 months and whenever I tell a story I get generic answers that don't really mean anything. Then she'll go on for messages at a time about how sad she is and how she doesn't know what she's going to do and how she's so lost. But she never offered me any support when I was going through my stuff last year.  
She moved my room because she thought that I would prefer to have the guest room. Even though for the past 5 years that we've lived in that house every time she's offered to switch my room I've said no. Before I left for France she said that she'd clean up my room, that I was fine with-there's cat hair galore and lots of allergens in that room that bother me-but then we talked on the phone and she said that she was moving my room. I told her no. She told me yes. She ended up switching the rooms to turn my room into a TV room. She promised me if I didn't like the new room she'd switch it back, but I already knew I didn't like it. It took me breaking down saying that I didn't want to switch rooms because Dad had set up my room for me and now that she switched everything his touch on it was gone so I might as well keep the guest room that she decided to switch it back. And yes, it's switched back now, but it still frustrates me that I need to have any sort of mental breakdown for her to take me seriously. 
That's another thing, she got into an argument with me because I needed to call our house my ""home"" for her sake. She NEEDS me to call the house a home. It's not a home anymore to me, dad's no longer there and I'm moving out anyway in August. She was texting me before I had a class and I was almost crying on the bus because she was saying that I HAD to call the house a home because it was all she had left.
Which brings me to telling her I'm moving out. She's telling me how heartbreaking it is that I'm moving out and that she doesn't understand why I would want to. But I go to school 9 hours away. Living on campus isn't cheap. Keeping a job isn't that easy when I'm switching back and forth between states for summers. I want to be able to do my internship that's required for my major over the summer. It's easier for me to live off campus in an apartment with a roommate. But I'm her 4th and final kid, you would think that because I've been living out of the house 70% of the year for the past 4 years that she would just accept me being gone. But no, it has to be a big dramatic affair.

TL;DR: My mom and I have a complicated relationship right now because I don't know if I feel fully respected."
5ixvur,3,2016-12-17,"Me [23 F] with my SO [23 M] of 3 yrs, trying to decide if we want to do long distance or not",rando5269,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ixvur/me_23_f_with_my_so_23_m_of_3_yrs_trying_to_decide/,"My SO, lets call him Pat, and I have been dating since college and have had a few issues in the past but in general have been solid. He lives in NYC with his parents and I live upstate. We both went to the same school in New York and we majored in completely opposite disciplines -  I did Geology and he did Political Science - but we always found common areas of interest like Harry Potter and Star Wars. Now we are finding that our careers are taking us to different parts of the country, and I am worried that this is just the beginning of us splitting paths due to practicality and our future careers. I will go into this more later, but first I want to hit on a few important things.

To give some context, the stem of our biggest issue is his lack of communication about how he is feeling. I know that this is a common concern for couples, but I mean that Pat would not share information that I feel should be a given due to the length of our relationship. 

The biggest example is that he did not tell me that his aunt [65] (who he was extremely close to), had lung cancer and had less than a year to survive. He found out in March of 2015 when we had been dating for a year and a half (I did not know about his aunt's health at this point) and was acting very strange throughout this time: skipping classes, getting extremely high and blackout drunk, telling me how much he hated everybody and himself. He really spiraled down into a pit of depression and I can honestly say that at many points he tried to take me down with him. He had struggled with depression before, but was seeing a therapist and had never taken his dark feelings out on me before this point in our relationship. I tried to coax out what was wrong but he always insisted that he was fine, just stressed about school. 

Fast forward 4 months (July 2015) and I had had enough. I told Pat that I loved him but could not be with someone so negative and that he was really affecting my mental wellbeing. We decided to take a break from our relationship and about a week later we met to reevaluate what we both wanted. We both broke down crying and he told me that his aunt had lung cancer and would most likely be dying and that he couldn't bring himself to tell me because he thought he would fall apart if he did. We talked for hours that night and came to the conclusion that we both wanted to be together.

Pat's aunt died in August and I attended the funeral with Pat. He seemed to be in a state of shock for a few weeks after and then acted as if nothing had happened. I sometime could not tell if he truly had accepted his aunt's death (he did have 5 months to come to terms with it) or if this was just the calm before the storm. He cried a couple times to me but would be acting as if he was fine an hour later and told me that he was just dealing with the grief, which I thought was of course a natural response.

After making it through this time of extreme emotional duress for him, I felt like we had become a great deal closer. There were a few minor incidences where he would not tell me about something that made him upset, but I just wrote that off as him still struggling to deal with his loss. 

Fast forward to now. His depression persists but he controls it (but I think moreso he hides it) and he rarely takes his anger at his situation out on me. However, he is still very dependent on his parents, weed, and alcohol and I am worried that these vices are the only thing keeping him going. He does have an internship in the city but is still at the early stages (getting coffee, writing up summaries for people, etc). He has told me that he does not think that he will ever really be happy in his job or even as a person in life but that his life has been much better because of me. 

I just got offered a temporary geology position in California that will be a 14 months in duration and due to the length of my job search (I haven't been able to find a job in my field since graduating college and instead have been waitressing for money in the meantime) I decided to take the position. This means that we will be on complete opposite sides of the country for over a year. 

This will be our first experience with long distance. I am leaving right after the new year and I am very nervous about being so far away for so long. I honestly have no intention of ever living in the city and he has told me that he is very adverse to leaving it because of how hard it would be to find a poli sci job elsewhere and because he doesn't want to live far from his parents. We have talked about us doing long distance when I leave once or twice but he is always very hesitant to talk about our future. He instead wants to take our relationship a step at a time. I would be fine with this if I wasn't devoting 14 months of my life to making our relationship work over such a long distance.

Now we get to my questions. Should Pat and I stay together and do long distance even though he has a known problem with communication and we are headed down very different life paths? I have no problem with being in a long distance relationship (I am not looking for other guys tbh) but is it worth the effort if at the end of my job I get home and we realize we both will be headed in different directions anyways? Have other people in similar predicaments made it work? What specifically made the long distance relationship seem shorter?

 I truly love him but I don't want either of us to have to give up on our career goals for the other person and then end up resenting them (I know I would feel resentful to give up on my career for him so it is unfair to make him give up his goals). I am just very lost and could use some advice. 

Thank you!

5iz01k,6,2016-12-18,Fuck it. I'm taking the red pill.,reborn2016_trp,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/5iz01k/fuck_it_im_taking_the_red_pill/,"Sorry about the throwaway. Its my first time on this subreddit.

I'm a 22 year old dude in his final year of college, and have had such pathetic luck with women that its crossed the barrier of sadness and has gotten to the point where me and my friends find it hilarious.

I come from a rather conservative background, and am attracted to women from the same background as me. Over the course of my college career I've asked out a number of girls from classes, from friend circles, from clubs and from friends of friends, but have been rejected by every.single.one. Most of the ones who rejected me said something along the lines of 'I'm not looking for anything right now', but weeks later I see or hear about them chasing some douchey frat boy.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not your stereotypical 'nice guy' who's locked up in his basement. I've tried and tried to make myself better, and have never complained about it until now. I play sports and workout often, I have a &gt;3.5 GPA, have had several high paying internships and study Engineering at a top 5 University in the US. I come from a relatively wealthy background, and am very social and amenable. But for some reason women never see me as a person they want to be with. They just see me as someone they can complain to, or someone to use for their own self interests, or someone they can manipulate to do the things THEY don't have the guts or balls to do or say.
I've tried to change myself a lot, but nothing came of it. Someone told me about this subreddit and how they found it really misogynistic and biased, and in my desperation I came here and binge-read the top 100 posts, and with each post I began to agree more and more with what people here are saying.

I realized that being nicer to women wasn't going to cut it. Women are selfish. They're not on your side, but they're not your enemy either. They're just out for themselves, and they have an advantage over men in that they have men drooling all over them so they can pick whoever they want and leave everyone else like me wondering why the hell nobody wants him. They don't care about men's feelings. They don't care whether men like them or not.
Whatever I have been doing until now has simply been WRONG. I realized that feeling down and sad about myself and my luck wasn't going to help my case in any bit. I have to change myself into the best possible version of me, and stop giving such a huge shit about women. I have to start finding happiness, fulfillment and self-esteem from WITHIN. Its pretty funny. You always hear age old quotes from philosophers like Buddha or Marcus Aurelius about how self fulfillment is from within, but you never believe them until something earth-shattering in your life happens. A fool never learns from his mistakes. A normal man learns from his own mistakes. A wise man learns from others mistakes.

For a while now I've been thinking about having a radical change in my life, and you guys did it. You guys convinced me. I'm sick of women treating me like a second-tier tissue they use and throw away. I'm taking the plunge down the rabbit hole to see where it may lead me. I'm taking the red pill."

I'm a Canadian student just finishing up my undergrad degree and was thinking of applying to EPFL. I wanted to know how I might stand and if I should bother applying at all. I don't have the best GPA (probably around a 2.8/4) but I do have a ton of internship experience, about 2 years worth, at some big companies too. I've also done a part-time research term and full time research term with 2 of my professors (no publications unfortunately). Also, 2 of my internships would also be relevant to my research interests (programming languages &amp; compilers).

So, have my marks already tanked me or do I still have a chance?

Thank you!

EDIT: Also, supervisors? How does that work? Do you need to contact prospective supervisors yourself? In particular I'd like to work with Martin Odersky at LAMP."

5j04s7,8,2016-12-18,How to get out of a car loan I can't afford anymore?,KngSht_FckMntn,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5j04s7/how_to_get_out_of_a_car_loan_i_cant_afford_anymore/,"Hello, /r/personalfinance, I need some advice. 

So I'm 19. When I was 17 my first car, a beater car that I bought with my own money, broke down. Afterwards I saved up a little bit more and my mom took me to a dealership and consigned for me to finance a 2012 Ford Escape. 

I was pretty uneasy about financing it but I worked 2 jobs in high school so I figured I'd be fine and my mom was super persistent. It was a 5 year loan for roughly $12k, payments were $206 a month after a down payment. 

Fast forward two years and I'm in University and am struggling to pay for the car. My mom does not support me at all and school &amp; internship take up most of my life so I barely scrape by. 

The past 4 months I haven't been able to make my payments in full, my mom has helped me but she doesn't do well herself so I know it's hurting her. She keeps threatening me that the car is going to get repo-ed. 

So what it comes down to is I REALLY need to get rid of this car. I don't really need it anymore, I can make do without it and it'd take some pressure off my mom. There's about 3 years of payments left, roughly $8k. The car is valued around $9k on KBB but I could probably get $10-$11k out of it private party. The only thing is the bank owns the title since it's financed. 

What are my options here? Would my best bet be trying to get a private loan to pay off the bank for the title, then sell it private party? My credit isn't too great right now but it's going up. 

I will admit that I'm not very knowledgeable about finances and my mom is *terrible* about communicating with me. I know it was a pretty terrible idea for me to ever finance the car. 

My internship ends at the end of the spring (roughly 4 more months) and then I'll be able to work a shitton and make decent money but until then I'm scraping by. 

Thanks for any help. "

&gt;&gt;Maybe the ""vegetable"" codeword would &gt;&gt;have worked better

&gt;&gt;Pizza' Party Codeword May Have &gt;&gt;Doomed CIA Spies
&gt;&gt;November 21, 2011 |

&gt;&gt;http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/&gt;&gt;2011/11/pizza-cia/

&gt;&gt;All the CIA's Lebanon spies wanted was a &gt;&gt;slice. What they got, allegedly,
&gt;&gt;was a big intelligence failure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hezbollah may have just rolled up the &gt;&gt;CIA's network of spies devoted to
&gt;&gt;cracking the secrets of the Lebanese &gt;&gt;Shiite extremist group. If so, it's
&gt;&gt;because of one of the stupidest, least &gt;&gt;secure code words in history.

&gt;&gt;According to ABC News, Hezbollah &gt;&gt;operatives figured out that CIA
&gt;&gt;informants who had infiltrated the Iranian &gt;&gt;proxy group were meeting with
&gt;&gt;their agency handlers at a Beirut Pizza &gt;&gt;Hut. How could Hezbollah deduce
&gt;&gt;that location? ""The CIA used the &gt;&gt;codeword `PIZZA' when discussing &gt;&gt;where to
&gt;&gt;meet with the agents,"" ABC reports.

&gt;&gt;The agency is reportedly fearful for the &gt;&gt;informants' lives. ""If they were
&gt;&gt;genuine spies, spying against Hezbollah, &gt;&gt;I don't think we'll ever see them
&gt;&gt;again,"" retired CIA officer Robert Baer &gt;&gt;told ABC.

&gt;&gt;An anonymous U.S. official denies to ABC &gt;&gt;that CIA's Hezbollah network
&gt;&gt;actually met in a Pizza Hut. We've &gt;&gt;reached out to the CIA and will update
&gt;&gt;if they're challenging the story further.

&gt;&gt;If ABC is correct, though, it's another &gt;&gt;spy-ring setback against Hezbollah
&gt;&gt;and its Iranian sponsors, who appear &gt;&gt;devoted to gaining a nuclear weapon.
&gt;&gt;In addition to losing the Lebanon &gt;&gt;informants, a different operation
&gt;&gt;exposed ""a secret internet &gt;&gt;communication method used by CIA-paid &gt;&gt;assets in
&gt;&gt;Iran"" to Iranian security officials. &gt;&gt;""Dozens"" of assets may have been
&gt;&gt;lost, according to ABC.

&gt;&gt;It's not like the CIA doesn't have &gt;&gt;successes against Iran and its allies.
&gt;&gt;It's spent years disrupting Iran's nuclear &gt;&gt;supply chain through sabotage.
&gt;&gt;The Stuxnet worm that messed with &gt;&gt;Iran's centrifuge control system may
&gt;&gt;have been a joint U.S.-Israeli homebrew. &gt;&gt;Iran nuclear scientists keep
&gt;&gt;dying under mysterious circumstances. &gt;&gt;Some may have been kidnapped, as
&gt;&gt;well.

&gt;&gt;But the CIA also has an unfortunate &gt;&gt;streak of self-pwnage as well. New
&gt;&gt;York Times national security reporter Jim &gt;&gt;Risen reported that in 2000, the
&gt;&gt;CIA accidently exposed its entire network &gt;&gt;of Iranian contacts thanks to a
&gt;&gt;boneheaded reply-all mishap.

&gt;&gt;The successful targeting of Osama bin &gt;&gt;Laden gave the CIA its biggest
&gt;&gt;success in decades. But that may mask &gt;&gt;some deeper problems, according to
&gt;&gt;one of ABC's anonymous sources: &gt;&gt;""Officers take short cuts and no one is
&gt;&gt;held accountable."" But now CIA &gt;&gt;sloppiness even comes with free
&gt;&gt;cheesesticks.

5j0lhl,60,2016-12-18,Just a couple rants for you CFers,Lolztobehad,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/5j0lhl/just_a_couple_rants_for_you_cfers/,"I have a lot to say, very glad I found this community because I just find that no one really dislikes kids as much as me so I don't often have people to vent to. I have 3 stories, I will try to be quick about them.

First story is about my cousin's wife.. I feel so bad for my cousin.. he just got out of college and got an internship to get into a pretty decent paying job. His wife was supposedly on birth control but lo and behold, she gets preggers anyway. Of course my Aunt is super excited and no one else cares because BABIEZ!!! ZOMG! So poor cousin has a kid at the point where he is still interning and doesn't even have the full-time position yet.. Again his wife pops out another kid, AGAIN supposedly this bitch is on BC.. AGAIN no one says anything. Think it stops there? Nope! This was all about 1.5-2 years ago, THEY HAVE ANOTHER KID ALREADY! So my cousin basically got played by some baby crazy bitch.. Luckily at this point he has the fulltime position but way to have your life ruined.. 30-something with 3 fucking kids to a woman who probably lied about even taking birth control in the first place. So wrong..

The second story actually kind of relates to the first.. Aunt loves to cook so she has a lot of dinner parties where she will cook for whoever shows up. Cousin's participation is pretty much mandatory since he has a bunch of little brats lol. But also, free food for him and his spawn so I'd go too if I was in his position. Anyway, I try to not show up a lot because I hate appointments and being dragged into schedules but mainly because they make the same dish every.single.time. It's basically their child-friendly dish. Kinda selfish to complain about that but it drives me nuts because I know they're good cooks but the kiddies come first! ugh

Last story is actually about a coworker who is maybe 30, he has a gf(or wife maybe) that he HATES, I always hear him talking shit about her at work but they have to stay together to support the kid. Since I'm a girl, he sometimes assumes I care to hear about his little brat, which I politely listen to cause he's my coworker, don't want to cause drama.. But I actually like to think about my coworker whenever I am feeling bad. Hey, at least I don't have it as bad as him! 

Thats all folks, thanks for reading"

I can't think about anything other than my career. I cant relate to people my age who want to party and do drugs all the time. (I'm 20, dont drink or smoke) 

Im an undergrad electronic and computer engineering student with a 3.5+ GPA, I want to use this to do a masters in finance or mathematics in an ivy league, then use that to get a job as an analyst at a bank. I've had an internship with a financial firm in london already. 

I have a month off from university and I can't relax. I'm restless, I'm starving for success. I spent 5 hours a day in the gym last week (not all weights, also basketball and a swim). Working out all the time only fills so much of my day. I know its unhealthy to be this obsessive. But I dont know what else to do. 

I want to become fluent in French, start piano lessons, I'm joining a boxing gym on Monday. I also need to start some side projects and start practicing interview questions to improve my programming skills so I can apply for software engineering jobs if my plan of working in finance doesn't work out. 

I cant relax, I'm tormented by the idea that I won't succeed. If I stop working I get depressed pretty fast. Being around lazy unambitious people disgusts me. I hate my parents for not setting me up properly in my career. My mother should have given me adequate nutrition and made an effort to help me to put on weight as a kid (im 6'3 155lbs). They should have realized my academic potential, how I was bored to tears in school, and then actually fucking done something about it, they should've noticed how good looking I was and got me to apply to a modelling agency or something to boost my confidence, they should have figured out how to make me a motivated, happy young man, not a clinically depressed teenager who had to figure everything out for himself. I cant help despising both of them for being useless, miserable people that have held me back no end. I should be further along in my path than I am. 

That's not even mentioning how socially stunted I am. Bullying and abuse from my dad combined with an emotionally unavailable mother (did I mention theyre both mentally ill? Mom is bipolar, dad has borderline personality disorder ) made me a quiet,  weak little pussy who got picked on and excluded from everything. Naturally I couldn't handle this and got further abuse from my dad for being a pussy. 

So all of this led to a life of alienation and misery up until now. Ive always made sure to focus on what I could control, and I couldnt control people not liking me, so fuck it. I focused on academics instead, with the belief that someday I could socialise normally. But goddamn it makes me angry knowing how my parents fucked me up mentally by being so fucking useless as people. I still hate them for giving birth to me, and then bringing me into a miserable, toxic environment full of whining, arguing and complaining. 

Anyway, I'm going off topic. What do I do from here? I still have two years left in my undergrad degree. Eventually I want to start my own business. I won't have time while trying for 3.5+ in a tough major. What else can I do? Part time job as a waiter or bartender to + social skill? Sales job? Again, wont be possible mid semester. 

Is my entire plan wrong? Will I be successful if im willing to sacrifice everything to work as hard as I can at it? "

5j2i98,1,2016-12-18,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5j2i98/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5j2vau,8,2016-12-18,"My father assaulted me and chipped my teeth by punching me in the face for no reason, should I get even? What would work best?",Anitaliandude,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5j2vau/my_father_assaulted_me_and_chipped_my_teeth_by/,"I'm 24 years old and I am finishing my master's in International business in march after winning 3 scholarhips and studying and working in 3 different countries (South Korea, Germany and Italy). 
I always honored my duties and did what I was supposed to do, I practiced lots of sports and have never ever slacked for one single month in my life. I am the first in the whole family tree who gets a degree and, judging how my other brothers are faring at school, I will also be the only one. In May I will be hired long-term by a foreign firm I did an internship at.

I was raised by two undereducated school dropouts who happened to have inherited a small fortune and a huge and isolated farm in a rural province of northern Italy.
I am writing on this subreddit not by chance, so you can easily figure out why.

My father is the definition of the violent countryside bigot and woman and children beater with, literally, a biblically high opinion of himself. The only books I have ever seen him read are the bible and another book about catholicism and the pope. The peasant is stuffed with money greedily amassed over the years and with inherited property.

""Thanks"" to all the evil he has reversed on me in manifold ways since my early childhood (beatings, sordid psychological and verbal abuse, crooked manipulation, calling me a failure and a no good since elementary school, heavy emotional blackmail and you damn name it) and to too many years of living with the sick fucker, I know for a fact that he desires above anything else to sabotage me and make me fail in life so that, in some fucked up way, he can feel better about himself and his ""success"" and the rest of the family is completely subservient to his violence and despotism.
I always managed to prove the evil bastard wrong by getting top grades, being as successful as I could, getting pretty girlfriends of several different nationalities as I worked and studied abroad (which secretly makes him incredibly jealous since he married the first one he got his hands on) but a recent injury and the effects it's having on me and my life are playing nicely and conveniently into his hands.

About 9 months ago I got a light TBI and my neck vertebrae got badly messed up after a whiplash occurred when practicing sport during the last month of my scholarship-sponsored semester abroad. Nothing broken but the condition is disrupting my life and it is giving me:
- tremendous neck stiffness 
- debilitating daily headaches and tinnitus which prevent me from being able to concentrate and study as I used to 
- impinged shoulders and contracted traps which prevent me to work out (I have lost 8 kilos of sheer muscle mass so far)
- back pains
- nasty sleep disturbances

The only one who has proven himself to be able to fix me is an American chiropractor I visited in the main town of my province. The problem is I can't pay him by myself since I had to spend everything I saved self funding most of my past medical visits and other unsuccessful treatments and in my countryside province there are no ways for me to make money with a part-time job because there aren't any available, even if I have been job hunting for 5 months already. Working with these symptoms and writing my thesis trying to manage graduating in March and getting one last exam done in January could only mean burnout or that I screw up my graduation.
The Chiro in just two times did wonders, I felt much better.

The scrap of filth I have the disgrace of calling father knows I am in bad pain but he deliberately refuses to believe me and refuses to pay the 500 Euros (about 500 dollars) needed for 12 adjustment sessions at the chiropractor, who can eventually fix me up and let me get away from my family and country to start my own life without having to endure any of the plain human misery unfolding each day in our isolated country househould. 
500 Euros for our family are nothing, also considering the use I'd make of them and the fact that I have always studied without asking nothing more than the basics I needed (clothes, food and the occasional 10/15 euros to go out every once in a while with friends)

I have already politely and earnestly asked him several times for financial help.
He answers each time with indifference, loud shouting and personal insults or like last time with ""I don't give a fuck about your health and for me it would be better if you hanged yourself in the barn"".

The other day I went up to him wanting to describe him the treatment I need to get but he immediately started yelling and refused to listen like a 5 year old. 
After a couple of minutes  of MEEKLY and PATIENTLY but firmly insisting for him to listen he started calling me a pussy and a no good. 

At that point I told him to his face ""Who do you think you're fooling, I know perfectly well how fucking rotten you are, just give me my money and let me get away""

At that point he started shoving me away and he kicked me in the stomach right before darting off to the door to savor the fact he could hit me with impunity. So I opened the door he just closed and he started to hit me with punches out of the blue. I had to defend myself so I took him down and put him in a sleeper hold (Yes, like in goddamn MMA) telling him to cool down. The narcissistic injury of being called out so blatantly was too big and the demon had just manifested himself.
A soon as I thought he calmed down I let him loose but he jumped on me as I still was on the ground and started to punch me in the face really hard, one on the teeth and one on the jaw.
The first chipped a bit of one of my lower incisives and made my nose bleed and the second compounded the injury to my already messed up cervical spine. 
I got up and tried to hit him but I was so baffled and disgusted by everything that happened and so phisically debilitated by my year-long injury that I couldn't even react effectively.
All this happened in front of my six year old brother.

The reason he assaulted me is because he knew that I am injured and untrained at the moment. He wouldn't have dared to do that 1 year ago when I was weighing 90 kilos and muscular.
He then sneered at me and went quickly away for a walk as if nothing happened, smug in the beastly satisfaction that he overwhelmed me physically.

Very much unfazed by the anger I put my good clothes on and went straight to the police station and explained everything to the local captain (Maresciallo here in Italy) who understood quickly and set a meeting for both of us about two hours later.

I went back home and he had already manipulated my whole family against me and was shouting madly telling me I deserved it etc. etc. 
Two hours later I rode my bike to the police station and he came by car bringing his spouse with him.
As we live in a very catholic country, the father is almost a fucking sacred figure who can suppposedly do no wrong as long as he puts food on the table and the Maresciallo couldn't tell him much more than ""this is not how a family should work and you should have at least listened to him and have a reasonable discussion"". My wretched mafia father then openly admitted in front of the authority (after being asked the question by me) one should not punch anyone just because one disagrees with someone (wow, such a discovery) to which I promptly replied ""you had a different opinion back at home"". He then agreed in front of the Maresciallo to pay the 500 Euros for my treatement.

He got basically humiliated but as we walked out he tried to get a last fucked up petty ""victory"" by trying as he was leaving to find the complicity in the eyes of the Maresciallo, who until then kept a textbook and professional poker face. 
The Maresciallo, being a man of honor and having understood who he was dealing with also before, responded to his slimy attempt with a brief but definite glance of utter but composed and unflinching disdain which made my father widen his eyes in fear and get a huge instant injury to his ego. 
Today, for the whole day, he looked as if he had seen a ghost and when one of my friends came to visit me he immediately hid in the bathroom until when we got away.

If on one hand I know I won the moral battle and I took great pleasure in knowing he knew  he was defeated in that thanks to the semi-official endorsement by the Maresciallo and to the last revelatory (for him) episode upon leaving the police station, on the other I know that deep down he hasn't learnt any lesson whatsoever. 

In less than a couple of days he'll be back playing the same old fucked up game he's always played with renewed smugness due to the fact that there were no factual public consequences for him and that he managed to lay his hands on me unpunished. Besides, in his mind he only got a closed doors reprimand and a glance, his inflated ego will swiftly erase and forget both.

Personally, I just wanna strike him with a baseball bat in the head when no one else is home and he is watching television or something but I know that that is not who I am and the life I'd do afterwards is not what I want.
The Maresciallo told me I can press charges but if I do that I gotta say goodbye to my graduation as I won't be able to prepare for it and I will lose my job abroad too due to the lenghtiness of the legal process I'll have to take care of with an attorney.
I also know this mustn't go unpunished.

Any thoughts on this are welcome.

5j3bpe,47,2016-12-18,Office Gangbang [MMMf] [Str8] [fSub] (long),Sw1ngst8,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/5j3bpe/office_gangbang_mmmf_str8_fsub_long/,"I wrote this story for my wife after she confessed to me that she sometimes fantasizes about being taken by multiple men, especially at work, and that on occasions when she's the only girl in a meeting, her imagination can go a little wild. I write stories for her from time to time to get her excited, and she liked this one so much we thought I'd share it here. Hope you all enjoy it as much as she did.
 
 


 
On a week long visit to the Seattle office, miles and miles from the cock you normally rely on for satisfaction, you are frustrated as you've probably ever been. As each night comes, you find yourself furiously rubbing out another sub par orgasm, even browsing all kinds of porn to see what could do the trick. You need a fuck. Bad. This is as obvious as the days go by as you maintain extended eye contact, brush against, and openly flirt with any acceptable looking male in your day-to-day activities in the office.

 
It's meeting time, and you're staying after hours with three team leaders discussing a few plans moving forward. After regular office hours finish, and the Thai food order comes and goes, you once again feel the nagging itch that's been plaguing you all week; you need to cum. There's been a running joke the past few days around the office that you've been a thirsty little nympho; making excessive physical contact with men and making more dirty jokes than would typically be expected from you. You've playfully sat in a nervous  interns lap, and worn your shirt lower than it probably needed to all week.

 
Your shirt crosses the boundary even now not between business casual and comfortable attire, but between cock hungry whore and desperate slut at the club. You've caught all three team leaders staring at your chest multiple times, and you've bent down without shame on a few occasions just so they could get a better look. You love turning men on, and you love making them climax. It makes you feel sexy, and powerful, and a stirred mix of other emotions that can make you shake when you think too long and hard about it.

 
""Long and hard"" you think to yourself as dinner is being packed away, ""I wonder who's got the biggest cock in here?"". You absorb yourself in this question as you look over each man in the room. They're casually finishing up their food while talking and joking about the events of the week. ""Him? No, I can barely see a bulge. But it's up to the pants and what his boxers are like too..."" you go on, ""well HE is physically the biggest guy here, but that's not always going to mean a big cock"". 

 
""Big cock"" that word excites you every time you hear it. Though it's true that size means less if they don't know what to do with it, but it's the culture around it and -sometimes- the rarity of it that excites you most. You realize that by now you've been fantasizing about your coworkers cocks for the last five minutes at least and you can feel yourself getting red and a little hot and bothered because of it. ""It seems so stupid. I just want to get fucked. There's three perfectly good cocks right here, and they're not fucking me. What a waste."" Your internal dialogue has regressed to this level in only a few short days -sexual frustration can easily do this if left unchecked- and your thoughts have evolved from memories of home, or a funny joke you read on facebook, to how you could convince the man in the office chair across from you to spank you in his lap for messing up his printout, and how far his eyes would roll back in his head if you stuffed his entire cock in your mouth.

 
It's time to get serious now as you pull out your laptop to plug in to the projector. Your new one doesn't have the right port, so one of the guys needed to grab you an adaptor. He comes around behind you and fits it in to the side of your PC. He's incredibly close to you and his warmth is easily felt, as well as his breath on your neck. You lean back in to him and thank him for helping you. Your panties are soaking wet by now, and the simple act of squeezing your legs together is getting you bothered.

 
The laptop fires on and you begin shuffling around for papers. You're so absorbed in trying to forget your screaming internal dialogue and focusing on what's in your bag to notice that the last porn you were watching last night is now broadcasting on the projector. It was the cheesey one where the girl couldn't pay the mechanics for her car repair, so the natural conclusion was to have a bukkake. The room is silent as you finally look up to see the girl in the video receiving the money shot.

 
You panic and slam the laptop down while blurring out ""oh shit!"". Your heart immediately begins to race in your embarrassment. It's like time is standing still as you try to process what to do next. ""Oh, cmon."" One of them says, ""it was just getting good!"" The other two chuckle as you can feel yourself begin to blush uncontrollably. You try to laugh along nervously as you hide your face and try to unplug the laptop unsuccessfully. One of them comes around the desk to help you settle down saying, ""hey, hey... it's alright. It's okay, calm down."" He places his hands on your shoulder and rubs in as comforting a way as he can. ""It's alright, we're not judging you here, it's funny. You can laugh along with us. Plus it was a pretty good video too!""

 
Another few chuckles come from the other side of the table as you grimace and put your hands over your face while they all try to make you feel a little better about this embarrassing revelation. They're attempts to comfort you blend together as you can hear your heart beat in your ears and your eyes are hiding behind your hands. You lower your hands when you notice the voices were closer as the team leaders all surrounded you. You turn around and lean back against the table with all three men in front of you. The first one is on your right and still rubbing your shoulder, telling you that this all isn't a very big deal.

You look down to notice that the bulge you were hunting for earlier is now easily noticeable through his pants, and a sizeable signal of affection is poking through. You lean in to him and thank them all for helping you feel a little better. Half hugging number one, you call for a group hug, and they oblige. This was the straw that broke the camels back.

Their bodies all pressed against you, laughing, smiling, happy. At least one of them very much aroused. You didn't think- you just acted. Your right hand reaches down and caresses number ones erect cock through his pants, as you run your cheek along number three's face to your left and kiss his neck. There's a pause from everyone involved for a minute until number two directly in front of you plants his lips on yours. He's stubbly, and you can feel the rough beginnings of a beard on your chin as you tighten your grip on cock number one, and hands with owners you couldn't begin to guess are running along your body caressing your ass, your tits, and upper thighs. You make a surprised sounding moan as it begins.

  
Number two moves to kissing your neck, as you lean to the right to find number ones lips next. Number three is pressed tightly against your left side, he's rock hard and felt easily against your thigh. He's rubbing your pussy from outside your pants as three separate hands are now fighting over claim to your ass cheeks. Your head raises up and you breath deeply as one and three now each have a side of your neck to kiss. Number two is now unbuttoning your shirt, kissing your breasts, and moving to your pants. You don't remember when you started but you're stroking one and three trough their pants . One is certainly thicker, as you could tell visually already, but three has much more length with a little less girth.

 
Number twos hand is now fingering your pussy as your pants are lowered to your hips. He's kissing you again. Number one and three each grab a breast and begin working on your nipples with their mouths pushing aside your bra . Your hands on either head. You let out an excited moan as your Pussy begins to receive some much needed attention. You sit back on the table as your pants are stripped off eagerly by all three as if fighting for the right to be the first to touch your pussy. All three men's hands reach down trying to get at you. Number two gets down on his knees and is declared the winner as he begins to eat your Pussy vigorously.

Number one begins to unbuckle his belt saying, ""well if it's going this way, I'd better commit to it"" in a chuckle. Number three agrees and begins to do the same. You giggle in embarrassment for a moment as number two sends shivers up and Down your spine with his seemingly magic tongue. Running your hands through his hair, you find two and three on either side of him with their pants around their ankles and cocks poking through their boxers sucking on your tits, and running their hands along your neck and lips.
 
 
A finger enters your mouth as you suck eagerly, making eye contact with two and three. You assist them in removing the rest of your clothing as you're now totally naked with a man eating your pussy and another two groping and licking you like savage beasts. You appreciate for a moment your total vulnerability, and the fact that three men filled with lust and cum are having their way with your naked body. This thought alone sends you in to an orgasm that clamps your thighs around two who's been working diligently. You cry out for a moment and lie back on the table with a sigh of both incredible relief and sheer embarrassment. You can't believe this is happening, and you certainly can't let it stop now. 
 
 
You roll over on to your stomach from your back to slide off the table when a pair of hands blocks your hips and you hear, ""whoa whoa; look at that"". You bite your lip and look back to see all three men grinning with approval at your voluptuous ass bent over in front of them. A hard spank comes, and then another. You let out a yelp with each one, lifting your left leg up on to the table to give them a better view. ""Who goes first?"" Number three pipes up. They look to you eagerly for some sort of direction. 

 
""You"" you excitedly say, pointing at number one who's cock was the first you managed to spot earlier. He nods in agreement as his boxers hit the floor and he positions himself behind your freshly spanked ass. You raise your hips in anticipation as his cock rubs your outer lips for a moment or two before plunging slowly and deeply into your soaked pussy. He moves in and out with great care as your tight, lonely pussy expands to accommodate this thick new surprise. Your mouth opens wide in ecstasy as barely a sound comes out. Your eyes close as you take in his glorious cock. Everything inside of you is screaming ""finally"", but on the outside you only manage primitive moans and grunts.
 
 
""That's good"" you hear number three say as a hand caresses your breast from the left, and moves up to your lips. You open your eyes to see number three stroking his cock by the side of the table. You angle yourself towards the corner and open your mouth eagerly to take his awaiting cock. It's long, and you gag when it goes too deep, and back off a little. He parts your hair and tells you just to work the tip. Your lips and tongue smother the head of his cock with number one picking up the pace, fucking you harder. 

 
You moan louder onto cock number three as you spot number two finally unbuckling and joining the party. His hand caresses your back and your ass as a cock on either edge of the table are gently roasting you like a stuck pig. Number one picks up the pace and begins getting louder, while you do the same. He receives a few words of positive reinforcement from number two and three as you're too cock drunk to keep sucking. The sound of his body slapping against your ass and thighs would now easily alert the entire office had anyone else been there. The two of you moan loudly as he pulls out, and you slide off the table and to your knees upon his instruction. You take him in to your mouth as he blasts cum down your throat.
 
  
""Oooooh shiiiit"" he exclaims as you happily drink his cum, grabbing his cock, licking some more, and sucking him dry. He pulls back eventually saying ""fuck. I'm done. Holy shit."" He's not two paces back and two and three are now standing in front of you, dicks in your face. You smile as number two says the first thing he's said since this started; ""you're a dirty little cum drinker, aren't you?"" You nod with an ""mhmm"" as he stuffs his cock in your face. Number three is pressing his member eagerly against your cheek and stroking, waiting his turn as you hold the base of either cock with each hand. You open wide and invite both cocks into your mouth at once, licking either head vigorously. ""What a good fucking slut she is!"" Number three says with amazement as he gets more into it. ""You like the taste of that cock?"" He asks. ""Yes. I love your cock"" you reply, barely taking it out of your mouth.
 
 
You stroke a cock in either hand and look up at your lovers waiting for their next instruction. ""Over there"" says number two as he points to the couch and heads over. He takes a seat and motions for you to follow. You crawl across the floor with number three smacking your ass with each foot of floor you cover. Your pussy is on fire again and needs to be put out, and your got two perfectly good cocks left. ""Open that pretty mouth of yours"" number two says as you've crawled up to his waiting cock. You oblige, as he guides your head down on to his cock once more. ""Good girl""
 
 
Number three is spreading your ass cheeks and rubbing your tight little asshole while saying in amazement, ""what a fuckin ass!"" Cock in mouth, you reach back and spread your ass cheeks and wiggle it back and forth to give him the hint. He kneels down and slips his cock into your pussy that's been dripping on the floor since you crawled over. You moan all over number twos cock. Number three is fucking you with the momentum to allow you to suck number two on all fours with practically no effort as your body shifts back and forth between two rock hard, moaning men.
 
 
Their calling you their private little slut, and exclaiming that the HR lady can get all the cock whenever she wants, she just needs to call a meeting. All this dirty talk causes you to cum once more as you quiver on the floor with a cock in either end. Number three pulls out and tells number two that he's got to give you a try. You happily agree as you crawl up on to number two and straddle his cock on the couch. You sit back on it and begin to ride him as he sucks your tits and moans. Both of their hands are playing with your ass as you feel number three begin to finger your asshole. 
 
 
""Ever gotten a DP, slut?"" Number three says. You reply ""uh... I don't know..."" you feel his hand around your neck from behind as he says ""well you're gonna get it now."" Number two repositions slightly and bends you forward as number three slowly inserts his cock into your ass. You feel the stretch as both cocks fight for room inside of you as both men moan with pleasure. Footsteps from around the corner reveal number one has stroked himself hard once more and is positioning himself to stand on the couch over number two to fill your wide open mouth.
 
 
""Are you our little slut?"" He asks, holding back his cock from your mouth. ""Yeah"" you struggle to reply as two cocks ravage you. ""Say it"" he commands. ""I'm your little slut"". Various versions of ""yes"" and ""fuck yeah"" come from either men now fucking each hole with disregard. They fill your holes and fuck you for a while before, ""Time to cum?"" Number three says. ""Yeah, time to cum"" the other two announce. You get on your knees in anticipation only to be forced down on all fours with your face to the floor. Number threes long cock finds its way inside your pussy as he fucks it vigorously, thighs and balls heavy with cum slap against you *pop pop pop* until he fills your pussy to the brim with cum. You're surprised but incredibly turned on by the feeling of taking his huge load inside of you - you love a good cream pie and don't get it nearly as much as you'd like at home. He quickly hops off as number one teases your asshole with his thick cock and says, "" I really didn't want to miss being able to do this"". He makes you reach back and spread your ass as his cock squeezes inside. You moan with every thrust as he eventually cums deep into your asshole, pulling out slowly and not forgetting to miss a single drop as you giggle and moan while he compliments you on being such a dirty girl.
 

Number two positions himself behind you and turns you over to sit facing him with your arms back and your legs out like you're lounging on a beach chair. He instructs you to open your mouth and asks you how bad you want to drink his cum ""so bad"" you reply. ""You want to taste my cum?"" He asks, ""yes"". He dumps a massive load onto your face and in your mouth as he grabs your head and fucks your mouth once more until he falls back onto the floor in amazement.
 
 
You sit there filled with cum as each of your lovers burning with lust fondle and caress you one last time before grabbing you something to clean up with, and making plans to do this all over again in your hotel room before you leave- they've just got to make up an excuse to their wives as to why they'll be out so late one more time this week. You agree, and add that you'll probably live stream it so Your husband can enjoy too.

Western Kentucky University – The Spirit Makes the Master

In May of this year, Western Kentucky University became the 2nd public university in the country to establish a varsity eSports program. WKU offers players with the desire and the drive to reach the professional level with the structure, coaching, facilities, equipment, and support they need to reach their goals. Not only does WKU eSports prepare our players for transition to the next level of competition, players are also provided with an excellent education which will serve them for life. Read more about playing for WKU eSports, and find the link to our player recruitment form below!

At WKU, we do not just want to be the best school for players to prepare for a career as a professional eSports athlete. Our goal is to be the best school at preparing students for many careers in the eSports industry, such as: broadcasters (shoutcasters, analysts, and color commentators), journalists and/or bloggers, coaches, sports psychologists, social media managers, and more!

Nowadays, it is not enough to graduate with a degree; employers are also looking for experience. While earning a degree in your field of choice, students will have the opportunity to get hands on experience in the niche industry of eSports. By joining the eSports program in one of the non-player roles, students will get the chance to work on projects for the program that they will be able to collect into a portfolio of experience. The portfolios, the resumes of experience working at the collegiate level, and the recommendations from eSports program faculty, give our graduates a huge leg up on their competition.

By joining the eSports program as a broadcasting student, you will have the chance to be one of the faces and voices of WKU eSports on game-days on our partnered Twitch TV channel, and on the planned weekly SportsCenter-like eSports show which students will host. The School of Journalism and Broadcasting has excellent facilities for students to create content. Those enrolled in coaching or sports psychology will have the opportunity to join the eSports program as student assistant coaches. Social media marketing students assist in the management of the social media outlets we use, and the journalism students create written content for the website and social media teams.

PLAYERS - Whether your next goal is to join a Challenger team or to be recruited by a professional eSports team, WKU is committed to preparing our players for the next level of competition. We provide our players with facilities for practice and competition, a coaching staff, brand new Alienware PCs and accessories from top brands (headsets, mice, keyboards, webcams, chairs, etc). Players will receive team apparel including professional quality competition jerseys. In addition to coaching, equipment and facilities, WKU will also work to support all of our players who wish to reach the professional level by helping our players create and market their personal brand. We take extra steps to ensure our players have a smooth transition to the next level of competition.

We are recruiting for the start of the 2017 school year (Fall Semester). The selection process does not rely on rank alone; however, rank is a major indicator that we take into consideration. Since we are recruiting players that are serious about a professional career, we expect applicants to be ranked Diamond/Platinum/Challenger --unless there are mitigating circumstances. We are prepared to work with international students who may have some language barriers.

In fact, our top team is quite diverse. The roster includes players from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), China, Chile, Germany, and the US. We even have the rare female student in our starting lineup. WKU is a welcoming environment and is committed to promoting acceptance, providing support, and encouraging diversity in both the student and faculty bodies. The University’s dedication and persistence in this effort is an institutional priority.

Player Recruitment Form: https://wku.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0OqUiJkK11c26mV Lastly, WKU has many scholarships available for students, including those in the eSports program. Be sure to check out our academic programs and our BEAUTIFUL campus!

1.OS List. Smaller clients don’t seem to use the firms’ portal system, so this is usually done on Word/Excel. The client would then send the support to one of the staff on the team, however not everyone on the team gets updated at the same time unless that staff immediately sends the support to everyone by email. 

The client would often be reminded to be sent things they already provided, or would forget to send items, making it difficult for us to know what to remind them about. Ideally, google drive would solve these communication issues, but clients aren’t allowed to edit a firms’ drive document. 

2.Documentation. I’ve been told I need to improve my explanations and documentation.  Any suggestions, or templates that make for very clear explanations? This is of course depending on the line item, but any general tips?

3.Any advice in general on really excelling at the staff level?

Happy holidays!

I stepped on a scale for the first time in a year and found that I weigh 225 on the dot. Last October I was 208. I told myself if I ever hit 220 I would change my eating habits. It turns out aging, eating poorly, and not exercising are a bad combo. I started Saturday. 
My prior eating habits were lots of soda (2-3 bottles a day), pizza a couple times a week (two slices of sausage and a fountain drink with ranch on two weekdays and a large that I'd eat on the weekend in two sittings by myself), and generally lots of carbs. 
I haven't had soda or caffeine in two days and I'm feeling pretty good this far. I've been exercising a bit more. I walked for 30 min each of the past two days and have been doing jumping jacks and push-ups. I feel weak, I can only do about 15 with good form. The myfitnesspal app has been really helpful to help me stay on track so far. I'd like to get to a healthy weight (180s) by the summer. 
Three questions.
1. Does this sound reasonable (~40 lbs difference)? 
2. Does anyone have tips on meal planning for a busy schedule? 

I work full time (overnights), I have an internship, and I'm in grad school so any tips for foods that keep me full would be appreciated. A lot of my poor habits happen when I'm hungry and don't have food on me so I just grab some fast food or a sugary snack. 

Thank you everyone for your feedback. This post is half for feedback and half to commit myself to the change. I'm all in.

Edit: Tldr: I figured out that I've gained a bunch of weight, what's safe and reasonable to expect to lose? What techniques have worked for others? "
5j4e1w,3,2016-12-18,"Made it to the 7th clean day, with a bombshell ending. Going to continue the pornfree streak because of it",Brydude92,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/5j4e1w/made_it_to_the_7th_clean_day_with_a_bombshell/,"I set my goal in my post last week about going the week without the unhealthy aide we're here to overcome. Made it! I am happy with myself, I have a date coming up this Tuesday, looking forward to going on a date without the crazy influence of porn in my mind. 

I'm going to continue the pornfree streak. I have a cleaner general sex drive, and have been less irritable overall.

The bombshell mentioned in my title happened just about an hour before the 24th hour of my 7th day. I was dating this girl over the summer, we were VERY serious, but she was only around the area for an internship which would end at the end of the summer. We agreed a long distance relationship wouldn't work, so we accepted that we wouldn't put ourselves through that and left off on the best terms. That was the hardest way for a relationship to end, because nothing was wrong, we were happy, but she had to go back home. We said we would get together if she comes back to the city again. We kept in touch for the following weeks of her being gone. As of today, she has become ""Facebook official"" with a new guy who is a ""long distance"" from where she goes to school. As far as I know she met him this month. I'm completely broken, I wish I could say I don't know why I'm so shaken by this because we are not together and accepted that we would both move on. But I God damn love her. I think about her every day.

I'm glad to say I am not craving porn to relieve me of this God awful feeling. I'm going to keep going with this pornfree promise, even though the first week of me trying to better myself as a person happened to be the same week I find out someone I love has moved on. I've left Facebook temporarily and unfollowed her on all other platforms until I can breath without thinking about her and him. 

Til next time."
5j5l5k,35,2016-12-19,[Graduate] First time recruiting experiences from a first-time job seeker,Zewp,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/5j5l5k/graduate_first_time_recruiting_experiences_from_a/,"I recently graduated with a CompSci degree and thought I would share my experiences with recruiters. I wanted to get the ball rolling early so I started applying to positions while I was still busy with finals. The tl;dr version being 9/10 of the recruiters sucked. I'm South African so take that into account too when I talk about salaries and the like.

The very first interview I got was for the position of a junior DBA at a massive African retail chain. I didn't really want the position because I don't want to do DBA long-term, but I thought it would be good to get my foot in the door at a company like that and then I could work my way towards a software dev position. Right off the bat the recruiter was 5 minutes late (I was 10min early). She was nice enough, but this was your typical ""mommy-does-recruiting"" momtrepreneur and it was apparent right off the bat. We did the whole ""tell me about yourself"" dance and got through the basics. She then moved the conversation on with ""so tell me, what does a DBA do"". I thought it was probably a way of testing whether I was taking a chance so I gave my answer. She then responded with ""oh okay, thanks. I don't have the job spec with me so I wasn't sure"" and then quickly Googled the answer to make sure I was right. The interview just went downhill from there. I obviously couldn't ask her anything about the position or what I would be working on because she hadn't prepared and couldn't even bother to bring the job spec along. I never heard back from the company and looking back, I probably dodged a bullet if that's the caliber of recruiters a mutinational corp works with.

The second interview I went to was a direct interview at a recruitment agency I was referred to by a friend. This guy was just so full of himself. He started off by telling me how he wrote his agency's CRM system so I can trust him, he knows software development (it later turned out he cobbled the CRM together using bits and bobs of code pulled from Google). We started off with a little 'get to know you session' and I started with telling him how I dropped out of university while doing a social sciences degree due to laziness that led to incredibly poor academic performance and how I essentially took that low point and turned my life around and was now busy graduating Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science. I'm always upfront about this because I believe in being honest about it and I think it's something I can be proud of. I explained that I messed up one of my modules by accidentally handing in the wrong assignment and thus got excluded from the exam, and how I was trying to get a Dean's exam so I could still graduate this year. To be fair this does sound really bad, but this was in a semester where I took 3 additional modules (bringing the total up to 8) so that I could finish my degree 6 months earlier. At the time I had 6 assignments due in a week, was sleep-deprived and simply uploaded the wrong zip file by accident. His response was to ask whether I didn't get exam admission because I was lazy. I choked down the response I really wanted to give him and explained that no, it was an honest mistake. Moving on, we discussed a database-driven app I did in Delphi for university (yuck, I know) and he asked if I would be able to port it to another IDE and language. I said yes, I would just need some time to brush up on the syntax and the nuances of the IDE. This was a very big problem for him because it showed that I was 'inexperienced'. That's despite this being normal even for experienced developers. It's rare that you just jump into a new IDE/language without taking the time to orient yourself. We then discussed a hobby videogame project I was working on in my spare time and he told me to ditch it because it would count for nothing. (Ironically I took the source code with me to another interview a week later, this time directly with a business owner and he was impressed, stating that the quality was way above what he expected from most graduates and even some juniors.) The interview ended with the recruiter telling me that he wouldn't forget me, but placing candidates such as myself is difficult and I should consider asking my father to employ me for 6 months to write them software, that his company genuinely doesn't need. He's ""sorry, but he has to be realistic for my sake"". Fast forward a month later, and I had three job offers in the space of a week. Naturally (because I'm a smug bastard) I emailed the recruiter to inform him of this. Then suddenly it was a complete 180. He never said any of the things I quoted or I just misunderstood him, he was just trying to be helpful and he never doubted for a second that I would get offers. I'll probably hear from him again in a year or two when he thinks he can make a fat commission by placing me in a new company.

The last one was for the position of a junior developer. I applied thinking I would probably not get a response but lo and behold, I did. So I went for the interview and once we got past the formalities the interviewer went into more detail on the position. They didn't list it on the original ad, but they wanted 5-6 years of formal coding experience for a junior position, paying a junior salary. Maybe I'm wrong, but after 5-6 years should you not be considered a mid-level dev? The position was paying 13000ZAR and most people with 6 years work experience as a coder should be earning at least 25k-30k ZAR. To give you a frame of reference, I just signed for an internship that pays 11000ZAR. It's a 6-month internship and my salary will go up if I get hired full-time afterwards. Okay, so maybe not a recruiter story and more a cheapskate company, but I'm still not sure how I landed the interview considering my CV made it clear I was a graduate with almost no work experience.

And that's the worst of the experiences I've had so far. Let's just say that I am really happy I signed for something and don't have to run this gauntlet again in the near future. In the space of two months I went from being barely aware of recruiters to outright loathing them."
5j5q5v,5,2016-12-19,"Injured RPer, Fiance stayed and supported family while preg. Need advice on MAP for career and education.",Zaeyn,askMRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/askMRP/comments/5j5q5v/injured_rper_fiance_stayed_and_supported_family/,"Hey guys, like the title states I was injured about 8 months ago when some dumb cunt rear ended me going 50+ mph (I was at a dead stop). I was diagnosed with a herniated bulging disk which results in pretty bad sciatic pain. My job was high on the alpha spectrum as I had to ""perform"" every night as a Teppanyaki Chef. I tried to go back to work after a couple days at home but it was a no go. Tried again a month later and had to call it quits. This was the worst timing because my fiance was pregnant with our first child. Throughout the entire ordeal she stayed and supported us (and still is). I know, crazy right?


This has created a rift between us, and I can see that her respect for me has almost completely vanished. I used to be pretty jacked at 6' 200, but have since gained almost 30 lbs since the collision. I've been hitting the gym 6x a week to rehab myself and to get back into shape. I'm doing the best I can by keeping the house clean, taking care of the munchkin, and cooking dinner, but this position as house bitch hasn't done me any favors. We still have sex about 1-2 times a week but it's pretty much starfish sex and bj's are non-existent. Hell, we don't even sleep in the same bed anymore.


I tried to make the most out of the situation by going back to school through worker retraining. Here is where my dilemma lies. I have the option of getting an Associate degree in IT. This program has a good outlook since the technical college is well respected. I am located in the Northwest so tech jobs are everywhere. I would be able to graduate in 1.5 years and start earning a modest salary, about 40-45k starting or maybe more if I'm able to land an admin job (still less than her income). I would then attend an accredited online university for my BS in IT to further my career. This option appeals to me because I can get back to supporting my family ASAP, while also having time to pursue my hobbies. I consider this the short term choice.


Now my main choice is this one: Enroll in my technical colleges Programming and Web Development until my training benefits run out in 6 months. This would allow me to get my feet wet with programming and be able to knock out some Gen Ed classes. After this I would transfer to a normal community college with the goal of getting into the University of Washington's Computer Science major. This is probably the only way I'll be able to earn more than her and become the main breadwinner.


I don't know how I feel about not having a real income for 4 years, even though the reward will be worth it in the end. We aren't really struggling for money since my fiance makes a lot, but I have a lot of guilt since I'm supposed to be the man and own my shit. It gets hard trying to take charge and make financial decisions since I'm not contributing to anything. Her mother also owns her own business and helps support us too... Her mom has also offered to give me a job at her business that would work around my school schedule. I wouldn't be making as much, but it's still a source of income. Would taking her offer be a bad idea? I already feel like a bitch for not working for so long, but I feel like accepting someone else's help would emasculate me even further.


Everyone is telling me to go for the second route, my fiance included. She keeps telling me it would make her really happy if I were to accept her mom's offer to work there (I'm pretty sure she just wants me to bring home any sort of income). The problem is that I would see my fiance almost every day at work, and not have much time for anything else. I am afraid that this will make me too available. I mean I know she is already resentful of me as it is for not working, and I don't want to make it worse. I would try to get an internship or co-op as soon as I could to get out of this situation.


Sorry if my thoughts are all over the place, it's late and I haven't gotten much sleep with a newborn. I would appreciate your guys' advice on whether or not its a good idea to invest in the 4 years for a Computer Science degree, or go for the Associate in IT and enter the workforce ASAP.

**UPDATE** 


Reread the stickies on MRP and found my way again. I am not going to bury my ambitions, and will own my shit. My fiance has no problems supporting her alpha as long as he stays ALPHA. Being an indecisive fat fuck is NOT alpha. Newbies read the stickies. Feel free to reply if you still want to.

5j85cu,3,2016-12-19,Can someone please help me understand what I need to do about my car?,bucktoothshark,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/5j85cu/can_someone_please_help_me_understand_what_i_need/,"**This question is strictly for people who have actually gone through the process of getting an RPP for your out of state car. If this does not apply to you, save your breath.**

I'm young and stupid and I don't fully understand what I need to do after reading [the DMV's website](https://dmv.dc.gov) in regards to my car and parking. I'm hoping someone here can help explain this to me in simpler terms than the website does and sort of lay it out step by step. 

So, I had a 6 month internship and got reciprocity for my car. Turns out internship is turning into a full time job so now I need to update my parking permit. I've read pretty much everything on the DMV page about parking and stuff but I'm still a little confused and I don't want to have to go to the DMV 5 separate times to because I was unprepared. Also, when I went in for my reciprocity I was basically verbally abused for being unprepared and don't need that kind of negativity in my life again lol.

So, my understanding is that to get a residential parking permit (RPP) I have to have a DC driver's license. I believe I can do so pretty easily since I have an out of state license so don't have to take a test or anything like that just bring in proper docs. Once I have my DC license, I can move forward with my car...

For my car, I have to have my plates registered in DC, right? I gotta bring in all the docs and get an inspection. It's a lease so that makes things extra complicated cause I gotta get the dealership to send the title to the DMV. After MORE reading, I realize I have to cancel my home state's insurance and get DC insurance. Am I on the right track?

Now all that's done and I get my plates on my car, and NOW I can get my RPP. 

Am I understanding all of this correctly? Is there an alternative where I wouldn't have to change my home state plates? Help me adult.

EDIT: Wow thanks for all the help! I'm proud of myself for piecing all that together after weaving through multiple pages on the DMV website (that shit crashes so often too so it was annoying as hell). Heading there next week! Thanks guys!"
5j88hc,1,2016-12-19,35M4F - Pick your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5j88hc/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I have a degree (graduated last year today) that I did very well in, but am having trouble finding work as my chosen field, while rigorous and interesting, requires education and experience. I know I want to go to back to school but I don't know exactly what for. I have an opportunity to take a prestigious internship in a town near mine, but it's unpaid. However, after even just a year of working there, I would be set in terms of employment opportunities/going back to school. Plus, the person I interviewed with was super-duper chill; I was completely honest with her about who I am and she appreciated it and even told me that I remind her of her husband, and gave me however much time I need to make a decision.

I've spent the last year as more-or-less a gap year, and I am glad I did. So far, prior to this year, my 20's have been turbulent and unpleasant (directly mediating my parents' divorce, rigorous coursework, loneliness, etc) and although I've been frustrated about where I am relative to where I want to be, I think I'm in a good place (good enough to spend the past year fucking around, which is not something a lot of people get to have).

Anyway, my question is: at 23, do you think it is more important to prioritize career and take advantage of the fact that I can live with my mother rent-free (I'd be helping her with her business), or, would it be more important to experience independence earlier?"

Along with the gym, this is the single thing which drastically improved my life in so many aspects. Helped me open up, gain confidence and stand out, still does. Started hitting the gym. Kept grades high, got into uni, life was good. 

First year into uni, meet my now ex. Funny, clever, good looking (8), with a geeky side and low n-count (1 boyfriend before me). We hit it off and after 2 months of seeing each other take the plunge and become official. Fairy tale for one year - you know what's coming. 

During this one year, **I get complacent, too comfortable, open up too fast**. I react like a beta pussy little bitch when Chad comes along and she starts talking / hanging out with him all day. Break frame a few times over a few weeks, do not show abundance mentality, and surprise surprise she dumps me over Christmas break 2015. ""Is unsure she wants to be with me and needs time to figure herself out (lol)"". I take it like a champ at first, then fuck up big time by going to her a month later and tearfully beg her to take me back - which she obviously doesn't. **Don't do this.**

Cue 2 month depression.  Don’t go to class, smoke lots of weed, let myself go to shit. Meanwhile I’ve plated an HB9 who I don’t give a fuck about as I’m still pining for my ex. Was actually this girl’s first funnily enough, just goes to show when you DGAF magic happens. Break it off when she pushes for a relationship for the nth time. 

After my ‘I feel so sorry for myself period’ I pick myself up. Hit the gym, plate another girl for 2 months. Summer hits, summer flings happen, and I discover TheRedPill proper. FUCK YEAH. – this is what I need. So many things I’ve experienced and observed all written down, with a strong like-minded community.

----

**Where I am**: 

*  I have made progress, but I am still not over my ex. I’ve fucked 9-10 girls in the 11 months since, most being gorgeous, most many times, and I still can’t do it. I  still regularly fucking dream about her ffs, doesn’t help that I bump into her every few weeks or so at uni. Why is this oneitis so strong? I’ve removed her from FB and other social media, haven’t properly talked in months, deleted pictures and all that. **Any advice from people who have had gone through something similar?**



* I am hitting the gym more than ever. 10%bf, 5ft8, 145lbs. Benching around 205 lbs 1RM. I’m in good shape at the moment, look ripped, but still too small. 


*  Plating 2 girls at uni and one at home (I live overseas from where I study). Many girls have passively / actively expressed their interest, so if those spin out of control I’m ready to replace them. As I mentioned though, still not over the ex, ughh. This helps in plating / NGAF about the others, but **it’s obviously not where I want to be.** I want to be free from her. 

* I read TRP every day, and am engraining its precepts in my daily life. This place is amazing, thank you for your daily contributions. 

* I am not dedicating enough time to my two big passions in life. This weighs heavily on me and sometimes makes me a little depressed that I’m not progressing. 

* I feel overwhelming lethargy quite often. It seems to take superhuman effort to do anything productive, leading me to leave assignments till much too late.  Thankfully I am still coping, but I know this will not last and I need to make a change and get disciplined. 

* I have internship possibilities lined up for next summer. Still only possibilities, nothing concrete yet. 

* I do not meditate. 

* I do not wake up early enough.

* I watch porn much too often (1x a day on average, more if I’m having a lazy day). 

* Did I mention that I think about my ex too much? Jesus fucking Christ..

----

**Where I will be**

I have set myself goals to complete by next summer. 

* **I will get the fuck over this girl**. 
* I will put on 15lbs of lean mass.
* I will throw myself more fully into my passions than I ever have.
* I will secure an internship at a prestigious firm.
* I will start meditating.
* I will cut down drastically on smoking weed and porn. **YOU HEAR ME YOU WEAK LITTLE BITCH? YOU WILL DO IT.**
* I will stop waking up at 12am and wasting half of my day.
* I will keep girls on rotation and never make the same mistakes I made in my previous relationship. 
* I will maintain academic excellence.
* **I will be strong. I will be consistent.
I will persist and endure the hardship, for this is my life and I can achieve what I set out to achieve.**

5j9fkx,4,2016-12-19,My husband [26M] is squandering career opportunities and it's worrying me [26F],newsahmworries,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5j9fkx/my_husband_26m_is_squandering_career/,"My husband just recently took his first real job, and I'm currently on maternity leave from the job that I've had for five years now. I got it right out of college (which I graduated early from thanks to being dual-enrolled back in high school) thanks to hard work and a lot of networking. People skills and the ability to handle office politics matter *a lot* in our line of work. It's not just about being a good worker. I've seen plenty of good workers get passed up for amazing opportunities because they didn't really become part of the team. 

So, knowing this and knowing how our company works, I'm really worried about how my husband is performing. He shows up at 9 am and tells me ""Well, my boss isn't even coming in today, so what does it matter if I'm there at 8 or 9?"". He has a bad attitude about the position he currently has. He's the new guy, he has no real job experience because he refused to work at all while in college, turned his nose up at internships too, and he feels like his current position is entirely beneath him because he's not doing what he wants to be doing ultimately, right now. I've had the ""it doesn't work like that, you have to put time and effort in"" talk with him, but he doesn't seem to care about what I have to say on the matter.

One of the biggest problems is that he's refusing to get to know anyone at all. Peer reviews are a big, big deal in our office. If your peers don't know you or like you, or feel like you fit with the office culture, you're not going to get promoted. 

I'm not sure how to handle this, because he doesn't seem to care about working toward our goals. I've done most of the heavy lifting so far, and I've been hoping that he'd start doing some of that when he graduated and we started our family, but so far that isn't happening. Is it fair to assume that it never will? 

I am clearly more career oriented than he is, and that's okay. I plan to return to work here soon, but he really doesn't want me to. He says he wants to be the breadwinner and he wants to support our family, but with his attitude right now I don't think he's capable of doing so. He's very adamant about our daughter having a parent who's at home with her until she's in school. Honestly, I think that parent should be him, once my leave is up.  

How can I get him to realize that his fantasy of me being a stay at home mom while he brings home the bacon isn't realistic? He isn't hearing me when I tell him how concerned I am and what my worries are and he's brushing it off as silly post-baby hormones. 

 ---   
  **tl;dr**: Husband wants traditional home structure but lacks the ability to provide for the family. How do I avoid drama when I go back to work?"

5j9ph4,3,2016-12-19,My friend [19/F] keeps on making me feel bad about myself [19/F] by telling me I'm missing out on the 'college experience',pomelo04,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5j9ph4/my_friend_19f_keeps_on_making_me_feel_bad_about/,"We've been friends since freshman year of high school. Now we are both in our second year of college but she's out of state so I only see her during the holidays. 

Whenever we hangout, she always tells me about what she's up to in college and everything which I like because I prefer listening rather than speaking. However recently, she's asked me a lot of questions about parties and how many guys I hook up with, all that stuff. 

I'm not a huge party person and I still live at home and commute to school so it's a bit harder for me to go out that often. She's huge on parties and stuff. Anyways I tell her the truth, I don't party at all basically and there aren't any particular guys in my life. I'm not interested in one night stands and I mostly just hang out with my friends, go out to eat or watch movies, just chill out with them.

She thinks this is weird and that I'm missing out. ""College is the best 4 years of your life. You're young and should live your life a little more"" I don't know why this bothers me but I feel like she looks down on me because I don't go out or have sex with anyone. I'm pretty content with my life. Sure, it's probably super boring to most people but I don't mind. I get along great with my family (especially my brother), I have a dog that's always so happy to see me when I come home, I have great friends and I'm doing really well in school and have an internship lined up for the summer.

I know this is a stupid question but how can I let this stop bothering me? I think it bothers me because she is right to a certain extent but I don't have money to move out from my parents' house, so I try to make the best of it. I don't want to feel inferior anymore.

I know this isn't the first or last cost of living post you'll see here, but after doing a **bunch of searching** I thought it would be a good idea to post because my situation isn't typical, being an intern.

I've taken a summer internship at a firm in downtown Seattle. The terms of the gig are amazing, but the relevant ones are: 

* good salary 

* Completely covered housing located in South Lake Union, Capitol Hill, or Downtown (TBD)

* I can turn down the housing for an additional stipend (amount TBD, but probably at least 1.5k/mo) and find my own place.

* $500/month public transport covered, gym membership partially

* Duration: 12-14 weeks.

About me:

* Never been to Seattle, I don't have a great read on what cost of living is like. 

* From the much cheaper Midwest

* I've never been paid anything close to this amount in my life, but I've also never had to live on my own in a new city. So I'm pretty inexperienced at 'adulting'.

So because rent and public transportation are covered, what should I expect to be spending per week on groceries, leisure, dining out, bars, etc? I don't come from means per se so I'd want to lean towards saving more. I'm super anal about personal finances and want to make sure I have everything on lock. Thanks so much, and I am super stoked to be in Seattle!"

I'm a Junior at UNCC and I am approaching an optional internship opportunity for my major.  The problem is, I was panicking about minor criminal offenses (like two Class C non-violent or drug related misdemeanors) and I may have lied on my application about my background. They aren't very serious and are actually very common convictions but I didn't have a very good explanation during the application process for what I did. 

I realize this might be a question that people are scared to answer but will the results of a background check for an internship compromise my position in the university? 

Furthermore, if I was accepted into graduate school, would this history be brought into question? Like if I were to TA, did research, a fellowship, etc.  

Thanks for any answers anyone is able to give me.  I realize I made a mistake.  I also know that it might be better to cut my losses and just not apply for any of these positions.

Any information you guys can give me would be appreciated and yes, I expect bashing/flaming.

Figured I would have better luck here than in /askreddit.

So I am going back to my parents' house for Christmas. My grandparents are also going to be there. They are pretty old and pretty immobile, so when they visit, we often resort to watching movies in the evenings just to have something to entertain them.

The problem is that they are also rather prudish. So, any movies that we watch have to be free of language stronger than ""damn"" and not contain nudity or sex. Even the TV cut of *Forrest Gump* is too risque for them. There are also no children in the house (apart from a 17-year-old) so kiddie movies are out. 


Movies we have watched in the past and enjoyed include ""Life of Pi"", ""The Intern"", and ""The Good Lie"". We watched ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" with my other side of the extended family for Thanksgiving but it was pretty dull. 

Any good suggestions for movies that will be okay to watch with my grandparents? Preferably ones that have come out in the past five years? A bit of language is okay but definitely no ""f-bombs"". 

It would be nice to be able to just suggest a movie to watch without having to scroll through Fios On-Demand for a half hour."

I currently have my passport with an [SB-1 visa](http://www.ustraveldocs.com/no/no-iv-sbivisas.asp) in it, I will be moving from Europe to the USA in the near future.

I was born in Europe and left to live in the USA with my parents when I was 2 years old. My parents moved due to a transfer. My parents and I were granted the Legal Permanent Resident status (LPR, or Green Card holder). We lived there for 10 years, then my parents moved back to Europe. I was 12 when we moved back. 

Today I am well-over 20 years old. However my green card is beyond expired: I stayed more than 10 years in Europe. I've also attended a European university and obtained a Master's Degree (STEM field). However I kept the desire to return to the USA; I haven't worked in Europe outside of the internships for my studies and some odd jobs. 

So, before even finishing my Master's, I applied for an SB-1 visa. This is a visa which allows for an LPR to return to the USA if they were unable to before, due to **circumstances beyond their control**. This is very important and it is what immigration officers are looking for when they interview you, more on that later. 

To apply for an SB-1, you must first fill out a [DS-117 form](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/217444.pdf). You then go to an interview with this form filled out. I also brought many different documents to support my statements (parents' tax returns, report cards from American schools, my old green card, old passports, plane tickets, etc.). The immigration officer didn't look at any of the documents, though I don't doubt that bringing them was necessary anyway, just having a stack of paper to support your claims is reassuring. My answers were coherent as well (very easy when you're telling the truth).

The immigration officer asked what my story was. Why did I immigrate to the USA? Why did I come back to Europe? She asked about my studies and asked if I thought I would find work in the USA. The important aspect of my story was that I moved back to Europe as a 12 year old child and that it was my parent's decision to come back: not mine. This is the ""circumstance beyond my control"". I had been wary of her asking why I didn't move to the USA at the age of 18, but she had no qualms with it. I remained in Europe to study for practical reasons (it's cheaper here, much easier for my parents and myself) for more than a few years. However, I never sought out work in Europe, I went to this interview just after finishing my studies, which is a strong indicator that I was serious about moving back to the USA. I believe that finding work in Europe would have undermined my application very seriously.

I never asked for US citizenship as a child, even though I could have, since a child doesn't really understand the implications of citizenship. This is something the consular officer was also very understanding about.

After this first interview, she approved my application, as I was able to successfully prove that:
* I had legal LPR status when I left the USA and never formally abandoned that status,
* I kept the desire to return to the USA as soon as practically possible (not looking for work in Europe, but instead going straight to the embassy),
* My stay outside of the USA, as an LPR, was protracted for reasons beyond my control (young age, cost and practicality of studies),

When this was approved (she told me on the spot that it was), she told me that the embassy would contact me again soon for further instructions. After the first, most important interview, I had to bring different documentation to the embassy at a later date (photos, birth certificates, current passport, old green card, etc.) and also go through a second interview. The second interview was comically short (""what is the basis of your immigration?"" being the only question asked). The second visit to the embassy was pratically nothing more than me bringing papers to the embassy. I also had to go through a medical exam and bring the results in a closed envelope to the embassy (though the doctor mailed it directly to them). The embassy then mailed me my passport with my SB-1 visa in it. I have a closed envelope to give to the immigration officer when I land in the USA and some other papers. 

The entire process took roughly 5 months from start to finish. My LPR status has been renewed and I will be leaving for the USA soon. It is my intent to ask for citizenship when I am eligible for it. As I said before, this post is there to give a reference point to other young, non-native-born, LPRs who lived in the USA before and would like to return. Though it is a stretch, it's absolutely a possibility. Make sure to think about this aspect as early as possible. 

Other valid reasons for getting stuck outside of the USA (which I've read) include medical problems and companies transferring you abroad. "
5jdz8h,4,2016-12-20,"Suspended from school, now do what?",throwaway100134,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jdz8h/suspended_from_school_now_do_what/,"I received my grades recently and think I am very likely to be suspended from college, and I need advice on what to do next.

According to [this](http://www.collegeconfidential.com/dean/using-time-wisely-during-one-year-college-suspension/), I should ""get an internship or job that is related to your major or prospective career."" However, due to my low GPA, I don't have a lot of confidence when applying for jobs or internships. Am I just being scared? Should I just apply to as many anyway? And if so, would I even have a chance of getting the job or internship?

In the case that I can't get a job or internship related to my major, I have certain skills from before college such that I can almost certainly land any job having to do with that particular field, but most of the jobs I find are part time, though paying around $40/hr. Is working one or two of those sustainable?

I'm not sure if I can or want to tell the parents, especially since I thought I was going to be okay this quarter, but it seems that I was wrong and might not have a choice. What should I do about the parents situation?


In an ideal world, I'd like to be able to just work a job or internship relating to my field under the guise that I'm taking a year off to work at that job or internship, but I don't know if I have the resume to apply for it.

I need help and advice.

Sincerely,

A Confused and Lost Student

EDIT: Also, what should I do about housing? or should I worry about that after I have applied for things?"

5jf4us,1,2016-12-20,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5jf4us/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls
The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

Anyways, I guess I don't know how to say this, but I will be absent from the community for the first weekend of Electric Forest. I have been accepted into an internship that I could not refuse that will require all of my time from mid June until the day after weekend 1 of the festival is over with. You can still find me in the Good Life on weekend 2, but this means that for the first weekend, I can not run the Reddit meet up, I can not plan any Camp Reddit events, and worst of all, I will not be dancing with my friends throughout the weekend.

""What internship could be so important?"" is something I am sure many of you are going to ask. Well, there is only one reason I would miss attending this festival, and that would be working it, side by side with the Madison House team, with the friends who I have made through my adventures running this place for you all. Please understand, this is one of the most difficult choices I have had to make. I miss will you all dearly.

If I'm lucky, I'll be zipping by on a golf cart, and we can high five.

I'm currently a senior graduating with a BA in Sociology in May 2017. It took me a while to get to this realization but I'm interested in a career in public health. I am going to attend graduate school sometime in the future, but I want to first decide what I want to do for a living. 

I've had social stats, medical sociology, various other sociology courses and many different psychology courses (my minor) and am going to graduate with hopefully a little higher than a 3.2. Epidemiology seems very fascinating, and with that being said, I was hoping I could bounce some questions off of you guys.

1. What books should I start with that will give me a some knowledge more specific to public health other than sociology? I.e. Epidemiology, public health theories, etc.

2. Where should I look for internships? 

3. What other kind of job titles are there out there in public health?

4. Anything else you may have to offer please, I am all ears!

Thanks guys. "

What happened?

September 2013, I get into engineer school after3 years of doing NOTHING but studying, taking showers, taking shits and eating. No sports, no friends, no hobbies, NOTHING for 3 years. I get into the party lifestyle really hard, I become a popular guy but I live a very unhealthy lifestyle : 3 to 4 hours of sleep a day, shitty unhealthy diet, no sports. 

I finally meet a girl and enter what would become an abusive relationship. She cheated on me, hit me physically, manipulated me, gaslighted me, made my life a living hell and tortured me emotionally, psychologically and mentally. I wouldn’t go out anymore and I would dedicate all my time to being with her.

February 2014, I break up with her. I was having troubles in college because I wasn’t studying. The girl encouraged me to cut ties with my family and I did it. I did it too with my friends. I was alone and when we broke up, my world finally collapsed. Alone, problems at school, shitty health, and now this break up. I was lost, confused, I needed to understand what was happening. 

I couldn’t leave my room. I had panick attacks and paranoiac attacks. I spent a whole week without eating because I couldn’t go out of the house. My father dragged me to see a doctor, I was diagnosed with a major depression but I didn’t get any treatment. I had major pressure from college, I was on the verge of getting expelled. My friends betrayed me, bad mouthed me and I became really alone. 

august 2014, I was working for my finals in September. I passed them and spent the months of October and November taking care of myself : shrink, tai chi chuan, acupuncture….i didn’t work for college at all. Then in December I realized I had to work for the next finals in January and gave up everything to study hard. I was miserable. Couldn’t get up in the morning, everybody was mean to me in college, I was living alone, without talking to anyone (I once spent 9 days without even speaking a word), eating junk food to numb me, using porn and video games all the time. I became the shadow of who I once was. 

After I passed the exam, I left for an internship in Canada. Instead of going out, meeting people, discovering new things, I spent my nights in my closed bedroom surfing the internet, jerking off, playing video games and eating like shit. I tried to commit suicide in January 2015. 

Then last year of engineering, failed my last year internship because I couldn’t function normally. 

I don’t know what happened but I’m mentally broken and I need to get back on track. 

I have a horrific self talk ""you are a loser, you never did anything right you will never amount of anything you are a failure a worthless human being, you are just a scum""...I am affraid of everything, full of fear, full of hate. 

I was once a joyful and loved guy. 

Any suggestion? 

I know, go see a shrink. I come to you for additional advices. I try to get help from as much places I can.

5jgfp2,13,2016-12-20,Should I go back to school or take the job?,falalaaa,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/5jgfp2/should_i_go_back_to_school_or_take_the_job/,"So, here’s some background:

I’m 30 and still living with my parents (I know…). I just finished a bachelors and want to make a career change to get into computer science.

And here’s the issue:

I got accepted into an MS program (with an internship option), but the problem is that I hate the area and the school is very expensive. It would tack on another 40k to my already high student loan bill. The cost of living in the area is also high -$1200 in rent with no utilities for a 1 bedroom.

The upside is that I do have a roommate I could live with and doing an in person master's gives me a chance to socialize (something I don’t do much of because I live with my parents). The internship option also gives me experience in the field, which could potentially lead to a job after school. The downside… it’s not a tech area and I might not be able to find an internship. I’ve been having a lot of trouble even finding jobs in the tech field around the school.

However, I was also offered a job in a semi related field near where I live now. Initially, I was looking for a job that I could take for now and then pursue a master’s online. The problem with this is that they’re paying me 20k less than the market rate, they created the position for me, I won’t learn anything new, and the next youngest person is 20 years older than me. I’ll have very little social interaction and I’ll be close to home… which is something that I absolutely do not want to do. I do NOT want to live around where I grew up. The upside is that I won’t be hemorrhaging money anymore.

I don’t know what to do. I do have some savings so I could apply to an online masters and keep searching for a job in the nearby city, but it’s a gamble on if I’ll find something even remotely near my field of study… and I really need to get the hell out of my parents house, which I can’t do unless I get a job. 

What should I do? School? Take the job? I'm all ears for a third option if anyone has one. "

I was originally pretty okay with being alone for the first few days with her, but I've been getting steadily more anxious about it as it gets closer. Baby's dad is an intern and won't be able to really swing time off after she comes, so aside from when she's actually born, he won't be able to be home with us during the day.

We used to be the closest of close cousins. Nearly inseparable. We lived a street away from each other and went to the same private school. Attended the same dance academy, summer camps, etc, but we drifted apart when she started high school (I'm 6 years younger). We haven't really gotten close to that since. Then she moved for uni and then I moved for uni and she got married and yada yada things haven't been quite the same since we've gotten older. She doesn't have kids (I think she's childfree, but not in an asshole kind of way) but is totally on board with paying to fly out here to just be a person in my house to help me and cuddle my baby when I need 5 minutes. Wow. I know some people don't want people there that early but I think it'll really help my anxiety.

I'm just surprised. She apparently talked to my mom about it at the family Christmas party and when she found out no one from my family was going to make the trip to Canada to be here with me for the birth she immediately offered. I didn't realize she cared that much. My mom thought she was joking, but my cousin texted me today and told me to think about it and that we'll talk about it while I'm back east for Christmas. Since I know that I'll be induced, I'll have some pretty solid travel dates for her. It'll be nice to see her. Hopefully this is the start of us rebuilding the relationship we had when we were kids.

I just wanted to share because the genuineness of her offer made me cry at Subway while I was trying to gorge myself on a sandwich. The guys at my Subway prob think I'm nuts. "

Me: Yeah but I don't want to do a crash diet before the wedding, I want to lose weight slowly so I'm just going to stop eating cake and candy!
..... This guy is also very overweight, why is he judging my desire to get in better shape!! Like, can't people just say Congrats!!!!

Example 3:
**Yesterday**
*Me talking to an intern about work*
Guy2: Well now that she's engaged you can't talk to her anymore and you can't come here.
Me: oh yeah? Should I tell you the same thing next time you ask for my help?
Guy2: oh you're hurting my feelings.
Me: Well then you shouldn't have said anything.
Intern: You had it coming.
**Today**
Me to Guy2: Are people being hard on you today?
Guy2: Why don't you go back to looking at stuff for your wedding.
.... Like wtf!!! He started it and now he's all pissy about it!!!

What's wrong with these 2 guys.... Everybody else said ""congrats"" and then moved on.... but these guys are giving me attitude and they're making me miserable!!!!  Please help"

I completely get that it's stressful to self-manage videos and such, but i sure do hope they won't change from cosy two/three man let's plays to something like the abomination that many youtubers have.

I don't know about you guys, but part of the reason i watch this channel is because it's just a couple of guys talking about video games or making stupid jokes.

I would really be sad if it changed into another cookie cutter studio-edited youtube channel.

What do you guys think? I realize we don't even know what it is, but i think the format is perfect now. If Matt finds it stressful, maybe hiring a couple people to help out would work, but it would suck if it turns from a 4 person let's play channel into SBFP productions with them in a studio playing.

TL;DR I hope they won't change the format like other youtubers to be ""professional"", i quite like the cosy homey feel of this channel, it's why i watch it."
5jhpp6,8,2016-12-20,"It's my fault, but I now owe the Department of Human Services ~$4000 for 4 months of Medicaid. [X-Post]",peteman720,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jhpp6/its_my_fault_but_i_now_owe_the_department_of/,"I am a university student in Fargo, North Dakota. My parents moved across the country, and they informed me that I could no longer be under their health insurance plan as of 2016. I applied for insurance through healthcare.gov, and was lucky enough to qualify for Medicaid Expansion coverage. 

Fast forward to October 2016, when I realized that I neglected to inform the Department of the income from my summer internship. I proceeded to report this extra income, and received a letter a couple weeks later stating that I was no longer eligible for Medicaid Expansion, and that I had already received several months of coverage which I would have to pay for. I was instructed to wait for more information regarding the amount that I owed. 

Today, approximately two months later, I received another letter which says that I owe the North Dakota Department of Human Services $3952.80. The letter specifies that ""If the changes [in my income] would have been reported timely the Department would not have paid premiums on your behalf; therefore, you are responsible to repay the premium amounts to the Department.""

As a student who is many thousands of dollars in debt, there is no way that I will be able to pay this off within the 30 days that they specify. Additionally, I do not believe that $4000 is a fair trade for 4 months of health coverage, of which I did not use a cent. The letter which I received states that I have the right to appeal this decision; however, I am not sure it would be effective. I am the one who made the mistake, and their logic appears to be sound.

Are there any other moves that I can make at this point? Happy holidays, and thanks for reading!

**TLDR**: I forgot to notify the Department of Human Services of some income from a summer internship. Therefore, I lost my eligibility for Medicaid Expansion and received a $3952.80 bill for the 4 months of coverage that I received while ineligible.

EDIT: If this isn't the proper subreddit for this question, don't hesitate to let me know."

The biggest mark against me is that I have a low GPA (about a 2.6-2.7 on a 4.0 scale), and that I will have graduated in 6 years time instead of the 'desired' 4 years. I've had to overcome a lot of adversity, which I think is a big reason for my low GPA. Both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer mid-way through my college term. My sister became a little sick. I had to take on many more extra responsibilities that attributed to my prolonged stay in University and my lower GPA. 

I did manage to score 2 competitive internships with reputable companies and managed to create a strong network with the higher administrators at my University. 

I am clean. Never done drugs, and I don't have any tickets or arrests. I don't think my PT scores will be a problem, nor do I think my exam scores should be a problem either (I have done fairly well on exams like SATs, ACTs, state standardized tests and will definitely study for the military exam). 

I do not know of any higher ranking military officers that would be able to give me a letter of recommendation. I could POSSIBLY get a letter of recommendation from a US Congressman (representative from my city) that could help?

5jjzj0,59,2016-12-21,No Christmas For Me (Vent),mineareworse,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5jjzj0/no_christmas_for_me_vent/,"This is my first ever post on this thread, so I'm not sure how to approach this - it's all new to me, but I'm so happy that I have found this thread for support; back to the situation at hand.

I'm 20, so I should be moving out in a few years but I only realised in the past year that this was too long, so I'm working on moving out from my NParents. 20 and living at home sounds pathetic, and it probably is but I am working on it.

A few relatives come around to my house, armed with Christmas presents and as per usual, I was a bit busy. I manage to say goodbye to them and they had given me a card which included a $20 and $10. I open the card and place the money back inside and leave it to one side.

I start to watch TV for a little bit and then next thing you know, NMom proudly gives me the $10 from my card saying ""look what they've given you, isn't it great"". It was great, except for the fact that I asked for my $20 back as well. She then said that I 'didn't deserve it' and it was my fault. Because I didn't give them a ride back to their next stop (only a few miles away admittedly), I didn't deserve their money. Goddamn it was a present, and I had my presents taken from me by my own mom.

*The reason I didn't/couldn't give them a ride was because of the fact my insurance policy has a strenuous mileage policy that I must keep to. Because I work mainly night shifts and go to College, so this all adds up over the course of a year - I have a tracker on the car so the insurers can check anytime they want. This car is something I have paid for completely. NParents haven't put anything towards it.

So long story short, she refuses to hand me my $20 back under any circumstances, in fact, she was laughing at me and my apparent ""naivety"". I'm a bit short on money (broke college student and all) and understandably, I'm frustrated. I find where she hid the $20 and take it back. NMom finds out and vows to make me regret this and how I won't have a Christmas at all. No presents, no family to look to and no invitations to family gatherings - I've been pushed aside. Merry fucking Christmas.
- Firstly, for Christmas last year, I had gotten a diary - a then 19 year old, getting a diary to ""organise my life"". And that was it - I'm not ungrateful, so I gladly accepted their presents and went about buying myself the stuff I want. If you want something badly, buy it yourself is the rule I adopt. For the past year, I have bought everything I needed and wanted - and whilst it's not a lot, I'm hugely proud of being self sufficient.
- Secondly, I'm working all throughout the festive season - night shifts as security for clubs/concert venues - not because I have nothing better to do, but because I want to get away from my family as much as possible - believe it or not, I'd rather be assaulted than spend time in my own house with NMom (in fact, I have been assaulted, I couldn't give a fuck in comparison to my situation at home).
- And lastly, the family that I thought I had have all left me under the words from my NParents - I have been shunned out of my society (I'm foreign, but accustomed to Western Culture whereas my NParents aren't so much). Also because I'm not that religious (everyone else is), I've been targeted by them for it - been given countless lectures on why I'm going to hell if I don't change my ""sinful ways"". The number of times I've been called selfish is almost hilarious - funny how nobody else, not even the drunk dickheads that I deal with on a weekly basis, have ever said that to me but my NParents. I try to be as considerate as possible and as polite as possible to everyone I meet but I've only ever been dismissed as selfish and branded effectively an asshole by my own parents.

Also side note - she has requested my high school transcript so that she can collect a ""cash award"" on my behalf from my local community group (that I'm not even part of), I politely said no - and wouldn't you know that I'm a selfish bastard that isn't grateful for anything he gets; instead, I'm working that day (and night) and earning a living.

This toxic environment is completely destroying me from the inside and only one of my ""relatives"" (best friends' mother, who is almost like my own mother and can trust wholeheartedly, in fact, she's better) understands this. Everyone else that knows my NParents won't ever even suspect anything like this from them - all good behaviour on the outside, but I'm the problem child. In fact, I opened up to two of the people I thought I could trust went and told NMom what I said, and wouldn't you know it came back to me. How dare I make such accusations; it had gotten to a point where I had semi-confronted her about getting diagnosed for NPD - but it turns out that I'm the crazy one according to her.

The first time I ever went to my best friends house (a year ago - my parents wouldn't let me out of my own house to see my best friend of 7 years), I almost cried at how much support his mother offered him - in fact, I did (in private) when I realised that this is what you would call normal parenting. The other day, I picked him up from the train station and his other hugged him more times in one day than I have ever been hugged this year by my NParents, dare I say in the past five years? I wish I had an upbringing in his position and had met his parents a lot earlier because only then would I have realised what support actually feels like. 

All I wanted was someone who doesn't open my fucking letters, invade my private life and say that everything I do was wrong, date the people I want to (the last time I told my NParents I had a white girlfriend, they fucking flipped and locked me out of the house for a night (I didn't have my car at this time) - I don't have a girlfriend now, but holy fuck that was an experience straight out of hell), someone who doesn't read my emails and peruse through them for what I'm doing, someone who's actually proud of me for who I am - I managed to get an internship in one of my cities premier banks (after calling 30 different firms in my general area, only one replied), I was so happy and over the moon - especially since people like me don't get this opportunity very often, yet nobody gave a half a shit. I only want someone that wouldn't even dare use physical punishment for something minor - I have been slapped numerous times, but the last time I was hit by my NDad, I fucking punched him back after 10 years of on and off aggression from him (I shouldn't have, but I lost it. Whilst I'm not advocating for physical aggression and such, judge me all you want, he hasn't laid a finger on me since though so I'd say it's worked out pretty well). All I want is for someone that didn't threaten me to move to a boarding school when I was a child to my home country that I have never lived in (looking back at it, I should've just fucking moved), I wish I'd have spoken to child protection services back then - in fact, I was taunted by my NMom to do it if I dared, I wish I had the courage to do so. All I want is for my parents to care and tell me that they love me. That is literally all I want and no amount of money could ever take away that desire. But it's not happening now, and it won't happen anytime in the future, so I'll go out and do it all myself.

I'm so sick of this bullshit because if I don't get a hold of it now, I know that I'll fall into a spiral of depression that will be really hard to get out of and not only will this affect my grades at College, but it'll also affect my future completely. I've been thinking about running away and/or moving to a new place but after doing all the finances and the maths, it just isn't financially possible - I'm saving up currently for a bit longer and hopefully by the end of next year, no matter how much it costs, I'm moving out and cutting everything from them.

It's so hard keeping up a brave face and a ""tough exterior"", especially at work and college, but I am resigned to little else. I go to college full time and work my ass off on top of that, but my grades are starting to suffer because when I'm at home, I'm getting shouted at and when I'm not at home, I'm working.

Ladies and Gentlemen of Reddit, to have narcissistic, obsessively religious parents who like to keep up appearances amongst their own clique and culture is possibly the worst thing to have in ones life and I sincerely wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy, and I never thought I'd ever utter that phrase. I'm so sorry at the length of this post but I really needed to get this off my chest because I don't know who else to tell that'd listen/accommodate some time for me. I swear to fuck I will never be a parent like this (if I ever became one) and will only treat my child with love and respect for who they are, and support what they do. Thanks to my NParents, I know exactly how not to parent a child.

If ever there was a positive side to this story and my life in general, I have realised that I'm an incredibly strong person (emotionally), and can exercise a high amount of emotional intelligence when helping others. I've talked a few people out of suicide and self harm, and counselled people through hard times - I understand how mature of a person I am and how much I can cope with shit like this, but now it needs to change.

I hope anyone that's facing a similar situation with their own NParents manage to have a happy festive season and thank you for reading.

Fellow children of narcissists, you are a strong person and you are stronger than you will ever be told by your NMom or NDad and you need to believe that because it's true. No matter how much you're going to get beaten down or dismissed as a nobody - you are worth something to someone, I know I am - even if that is by only one or two people, it is truly quality over quantity."

Yet I was still scheduled to work all of this week and next because our Lead tech was on vacation (and even though i never explicitly agreed to cover my PIC knows i have off from school at the time). So with all this stress over my dad I still agreed I could come in and didn't need the week off. I eventually caught a cold, yesterday i was coughing and sneezing all over the place but I'm thinking eh its just a cold i'll be ok. I woke up this morning with the deep coughing progressing to SOB and tissues piled high all over my bed. I decided to call work to tell my PIC i probably wouldn't be coming in today (I'm only on for 4 hours).

So I call. A women picks up and informs me my PIC isn't here today. I tell her I'm the intern and it seems that i have bronchitis and I wouldn't be able to come in.

5jkqk3,133,2016-12-21,[Warning: Tons of Spoilers] Looking for Hidden Clues in The OA; Chapter 1: Homecoming,ApplePieTerrorist,TheOA,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOA/comments/5jkqk3/warning_tons_of_spoilers_looking_for_hidden_clues/,"First off, I did not expect to love this show so much. One of the more satisfying experiences on Netflix -- there's no doubt that there are some truly emotive and deep moments [even if other plot points are a bit of a cop out].

Secondly, as many of you know, the creators of the show have heavily suggested that they embedded clues throughout the show, even going as far as to say:

&gt;""The whole thing’s a riddle. There are a lot of clues. Very few people have really picked up on all the clues. Our sound engineer picked up on a major one that kind of blew my mind. I was like, “That is designed for only the closest, creepiest viewer to find.”
&gt;

Though the creators apparently spent 3 years developing the story, I am skeptical as to how deep the show is [and I'm pretty sure the hunt for clues and deeper meaning covers for some of the writing], I've decided to look through each episode thoroughly and share with y'all my thoughts and observations.


We'll start with Chapter 1.


**Part 1: The Jump**

[So we open in on this clip of some downtown metropolitan area with a lot of construction.](http://i.imgur.com/EtvNyry.png) Based on my experience with WorldStar HipHop, I can tell this was likely show on a phone, and since it's in the back seat of the car, it's likely a kid or teenager recording this.

The clip continues, then goes black, then faces towards the front of the car.

The shift isn't particularly jarring -- the sound is that of someone fumbling with a camera and nothing creepy pops out. 

Then there's a *second* black-out! You might miss it because of how quick this 2nd of three scenes is, [but you can see that the person with the camera is under a tunnel](http://i.imgur.com/BpQbpvl.png). 


[Right after these two relatively calm scenes on this bridge, we find ourselves in a really chaotic situation].(http://i.imgur.com/Yv5adsi.png) This is definitely one of my favorite scenes in the entire show. A bunch of cars are honking, this kid is calling for his mom -- everything is crazy. 

And then, as you can see by the red in the image above, there's this small speck on the screen. It's Prairie, booking it down this bridge. She bumps into a car, looks into the camera, and then [leaps across the lane to the barrier](http://i.imgur.com/uQi4YMw.png). 

So in the last two seconds, some random Olympic sprinter has ruined your nice montage of clips, and then there's this pause. OA looks back, directly into the camera, with this look of confusion [(excuse the poor crop)](http://i.imgur.com/NZ1nKm0.png). 

What the hell is going on here?


I'm on my 2nd time watching through the show, but I'm still not exactly sure what's going on. 

One theory is that the OA is trying to reach her friends in a near-death experience, which is interesting, but fails to explain some big things going on here.

First off all, why is Prairie looking into the camera? Why would she sprint across this bridge, but wait a second to jump? This is where the thinking gets really involved.

I think the show is as much about the viewer as what's going on.

Beyond the showrunners setting up this duality of worlds -- Prairie's dubious story and the OA's time in captivity, there's a lot of involvement on behalf of the viewer. 

There is a ton of encouragement to rewatch and analyze things, and the showrunners are well-aware that the content is hosted on Netflix rather than a traditional TV channel -- the viewer is expected to go back and rewatch crucial scenes. 

I think Prairie is literally looking back at the viewer, kinda a play on the multiple realities of the show.

The second major thing of this scene is that the kid says ""She's going to the other side""...right before the OA is about the jump. One of the show's tricks is that there's a lot of exposition in full-screen videos and tapes that the characters see throughout the show, and I personally think that the kid is actually watching this video well after the fact -- especially since the voices of the kid and the mother sound a lot like those of Buck and BBA respectively.

Nonetheless, this kid is obviously important enough to have the last word in the intro, so let's break down the final words. ""She let go"" -- maybe this kid is stunned that someone would so willingly embrace death? 

Lastly, there's this clear symbolism when Prairie looks back -- she looks just like the Statue of Liberty. Her dress and hair match very well, and I think it's intentional given Prairie's obsession with meeting her father there. I have no clue what the implication there is.


**Part 2: The Hospital**

So now we jump from this thrilling jump scene to a more relaxed hospital scene, though there's a lot to be seen here on a 2nd viewing. 

[First of all, the nurse treating Prairie is in red scrubs](http://i.imgur.com/ADv87Aw.png). We'll get to it later, but there's a ton of color theory in this show, with emphasis on the colors Red, Blue and Purple [the combination of red and blue!]. I can't really tell what these colors mean -- at times the good guys wear red, other times blue -- but I can say they're very significant. 

Also, we see the first of the numbers. While colors are discussed a lot on this sub, I think the numbers are also huge. [In this scene, we see the room code, 405A](http://i.imgur.com/zkVcV9p.png). Any casual viewer can deduce there are a lot of biblical references. In this case, I think it relates to Matthew 4:05 which talks about the devil/badness taking Jesus or Yaweh to the highest point of the holy city. Maybe the ""Angel Hunter"" has driven the OA to this point?

I think 99% of the references in this episode are about the Book of Matthew for a few simple reasons -- The Book of Matthew is the 1st in the New Testament and basically introduces Jesus as this messianic figure, which the show is doing with Prairie.

Also, the show's creators have said in interviews that the show is mostly through Steven's viewpoint, and Steven is a great stand-in for Matthew as an Apostle -- both start off as a outcasts and gain respect for the Messiah by receiving forgiveness and getting a chance at repentance. 

Lastly, most of the numbers seem to work best with quotes from the Book of Matthew. 


[Anyway, we come upon this shot of Prairie in fear,](http://i.imgur.com/uTzqIDg.png) and we see a familiar sight! I think those are the rings that we see at the end of each episode and there's definitely going to be a lot more on these rings in future episodes -- both in relation to that whole Saturn thing and to the end credits. 

Another interesting point about the rings -- they're likely portals to other dimensions. Homer sees a ring of light at the end of a tunnel, and HAP suggests that the NDE subjects are likely visiting the rings of Saturn [or at least interacting with the particles of the rings through tesseracts in space-time]. In the final scene of the show where the OA says ""Homer"", we see this ring of light [really a square] behind her. Also, we know that there's a lot in this show about forked paths, and the many worlds/parallel universe theory. Interestingly, the O and A finally come together in the end credits, and the poster for the show, to reflect this idea -- the O is a ring/dimension and the A is a pair of lines forking away from each other.

Maybe, when Prairie wakes up in the hospital [in Saint Louis not NYC or her hometown in Michigan btw] it's like she's jumped to another dimension, and perhaps the 5 Michigan people experiencing the history of the 5 subjects suggests that the Michigan people are vessels for the subjects. Also, maybe when you jump dimensions there's a forked path created, and we the viewer see this through those shimmers on screen, like during the shooting or right before Prairie jumps. This is like 99% what I believe, that the entire show is this hella cool epic narrative where people are jumping through time and space and trying to fight bad guys through dimensions while still featuring a lot of really human and powerful/appealing moments, almost like a real-life Star Wars or something.

I definitely feel that's where the showrunners want to go with expanding the show, but they've also said that the 1st season can stand alone [and there has not been a 2nd season order yet], and so the rings may just be a dope hospital gown or even just a general suggestion that we're witnessing a new setting in the show.

**Part 3: The House**
Next we come across this cold open to the home of Abel and Nancy. There's nothing much to report here, except that the numbers on the microwave are blurred away. This happens frequently in the episodes as numbers on classrooms, lockers and devices get blurred out, implying that the numbers that can be seen, usually very sharply, are important to consider.

Also, the family is dressed in muted beige and grey tones, which a lot of the non-essential characters are dressed in throughout the show.

**Part 4: Back to the Hospital**
Nothing much to see here, just some nice cinematography, a heartwarming scene [blind people feel faces to identify people] and the OA has a patient bracelet with Jane Doe on it.

Also, when the OA feels her mother's face, she kinda does the 5th movement on her, [and then Abel does the 5th movement face drag too](http://i.imgur.com/Uv0kdzU.png). I'm not saying that this means that the OA made up her story, but if anything, it shows that some movements are universal and have meaning. Open palms provide people relief and healing of sorts, and the actor for Abel is very deliberate with his hand movements -- in later episodes he points to various numbers and colors and the actor sometimes looks directly at his fingers when doing so.


**Part 5: The House**
The drive in is pretty uneventful, but when in the house, some interesting things happen. First off, there's this whole 7 years, 3 months, 11 days thing. 

Obviously those are significant numbers -- 3 and 11 appear everywhere in this show, but the Book of Matthew has a few different options here.

One is Matthew 7:3, which says ""Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"" That's ok, I guess because the FBI agents aren't thinking about the bigger picture, but not the best. 

Mathew 3:11 is also there, and it says ""11 “I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."" Good references to starting over and repentance, but I think the last one is the best one.

The OA stumbles on pronouncing ""3 months"", like really stumbles, but the ""7 years"" and ""11 days"" come out very clearly, so I checked Matthew 7:11 which is part of this paragraph on how ""For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened."" This fits pretty well into how the OA was constantly working during her time away to find out the truth.

Also, the whole thing about the woman with the dusty car? I think that's a reference to that recurring goddess figure, but then the OA says there are a lot of people with her, so IDK. However, the OA definitely implies this because she couldn't have made a phone call from there.


Anyway, Prairie is up in her room and tries to get on the internet but can't -- then the program says ""Prairie Failed to Authenticate"". Not password failed...interesting. Maybe a comment on the unreliable narrator, but also perhaps on the name Prairie, maybe reminding the viewer not to call her that. 

Prairie looks for the password and [we get 3 new numbers](http://i.imgur.com/Nycpsn6.png) -- 2.99 oranges, 5 for $5 avocados and some other 2 for $4 coupon. Matthew 2:9 and 2:4 are about the joy of the Magi at Christ's birth, but 5:5 is a weird one -- it's the famous ""blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth"" line. Also, Matthew 24 is about what the return of Jesus Christ would look like ["" what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”] and Matthew 13:55 is about the child of the carpenter [basically Jesus] and Matthew 9:29 is about Jesus touching/loving the blind.


The OA then goes for a walk, the number of the lot is blurred out and [the moon is this brilliant blue](http://i.imgur.com/xAkYe14.png). 

Then we cut to Steve's room. Interestingly there's a ton of blue in this room, and his laptop's keys are programed to glow blue -- but when he helps the OA in episode 8, he and the others are dressed in all red.

Anyway, skip ahead to the dog-bite scene and we see this:
http://i.imgur.com/bH1aGUJ.png

Kinda looks like one of the movements, just not scarred in. 



**Part 6: High School**

The scene opens, and French has a shirt that says 21, and Matthew 21 is about two apostles of Jesus working together to get Jesus a mule to ride on. French and Steven then bump into each other.

Then Steven goes to that chorus room, 273, which corresponds to Matthew 27:3, a line about Judas' betrayal of Jesus. 

Also, there's this line from the song in chorus, Pearl Jam's ""Better Man"" -- ""She dreams in color, she dreams in red"". Dreams, color [especially dreaming in red and blue] will all be important later on.


**Part 7: Prairie's Room**
Steve punches the kid, then we cut to the creepy ass dollhouse scene like fuck that was weird I'm positive something was moving inside but I'm not going to freak out over that and the fact that she just randomly zooms in on that stuff. I will say it probably is very significant in so far as Prairie's room has a lot of clues in later episodes.

Anyway, Steve breaks in, and I love this scene. Brit Marling talks a lot about the process of developing the Steve character and this, as well as the punch scene, are great glimpses at his personality. I truly believe that Steven went to the car just because he thought that kid was talented and happened to be in the same room as Steve's crush, not that the kid was his crush's crush [especially with the implication that the singer is gay]. Just the same, Steve really is excited and caring for Prairie when he climbs up to the 2nd story of the house, but he is kinda hesitant to do anything until Prairie welcomes him and then he gets very excited and happy. He's proud and vain, but it's all fleshed out in a really appealing and human way -- you know a person just like Steve. 

The show gets a lot of comparison to Stranger Things, and I think that's so unfair because for all the people complaining about The OA's writing, Stranger Things has so many more cop-outs, and relies on tropes from film, TV and the 70s to bolster the immersion in the story. For the writers on The OA, they have to weave this surreal plot into a very familiar setting, and with Steve they do a really good job in the 1st episode. 

Anyway, Steve proposes the whole ""Strangers on a Train"" thing which is pretty interesting because in the Hitchcock film, the two strangers don't actually make an agreement -- one person misconstrues what the other says about a relationship and kills someone, then the killer spends the rest of the movie trying to get the other person to live up to their ""agreement"". The movie is about an falling out of partners and features a lot of doppelgangers and classic Hitchcock twists -- maybe a comment on the OA and HAP, or even that there's doubt to the whole story.


So Steve puts on his youtube video and [the Wi-Fi status is the same there](http://i.imgur.com/eQKZBdN.png) as later when Prairie watches the Homer video.  I think it's more a directing issue than Prairie is making up the video in her head, but I also think it's very plausible that Homer is just someone she knew about before the mine.

**Part 8: The Consignment Store**
Next off, we have this lovely shot off Steve and Prairie biking off to this store, an instant callback to E.T's bicycling scenes. 

[Anyway, we find ourselves in this consignment store, and this scene is really interesting as well](http://i.imgur.com/2BTiw6D.png). There's another set of numbers, 6 and 10, and because I figure that women's clothing would usually have an 8 in between, I googled ""bible 6:10"" and found an Ephesians quote about the ""armor of god"" which we need to ""...take your [sic.] stand against the devil’s schemes"". By this point I'm 100% convinced that some poor production intern had to do all this work on bible quotes, but it's pretty damn cool. Brit herself has said that no one has found all of the clues yet, so I'll go all in right now and say that all of the clues I've listed are probably intentional.

Also interesting -- the OA wears a Large. Marling is 5'7"" and seems thin so that's surprising. 

So the two talk for a little bit, and then Prairie says that Steve's issues with his crush are because he hasn't worked on his invisible self, to which Steve rebukes her and says ""I was just starting to think you were ok"". [We get this great shot from the OA's response](http://i.imgur.com/n9Wgm4Z.png). Given that the OA then says it's impressive that Steve works so hard on his visible self and it doesn't really seem that she's particularly against having a visible self, I think it's a yin-yang moment here -- Steve starts with a fucked up personality, but is externally successful, but the OA hasn't even touched someone she loves in 7+ years. That conversation is carried on to the dressing room where the OA is a bit shocked to hear the word ""fucking"" -- a great detail from the show's creator that fleshes out the character. While there's likely not to be a definitive conclusion on the OA's story for a while, the show is really strong in the characters and relationships. I've seen a lot of negative reviews get upset about the great performances and how they're lost in the plot, but Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij have repeatedly said that they don't really care about the conclusions -- the show is about the people and relationships and these incredibly powerful moments [and also a very intriguing story]. 

So Prairie changes clothes, there's this great dialogue, and then at the end Steve says she needs a ""grown up haircut"", and it reminded me of the weirdest thing about the show. So I know who Brit Marling is and I even have seen her speak at the 2013 Georgetown Convocation [Marling was the valedictorian of the '05 class]. I didn't recognize her till about 10 minutes into the show! On the show, Marling looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/sUyatr1.png), but in real life, she looks like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/34/d8/8734d87ad27284efae0ce8eab57d14ed.jpg). 

**Part 9: The School**
Later, [when dressed as Steve's ""stepmother"", Marling's jawline looks very different and I think that there's some sort of prosthetic skin and fat through the neck](http://i.imgur.com/3KZSxno.png). Marling legitimately looks older as the stepmother, even compared to the OA character, and it's glaringly obvious. That's a bit of a continuity issue since the next shot, with BBA, shows Marling with [an obviously slimmer neckline as Prairie](http://i.imgur.com/eg0N9Ro.png). That means the neck thing was intentional, and later on in the show, BBA even pushes back her neck jowls while looking into the mirror, but I think it was likely a product of the filmmakers just wanting Marling to look older in the stepmother shot and then Marling removing the makeup and prosthetics to have a better scene during the BBA/OA dialogue. 

This is a good scene too, even though y'all might be a little turned away by the laugh from the OA at the Principal's remarks [which isn't the most innovative writing to suggest that the OA is a kid at heart]. First of all, the camera man is walking down this hall and on the left of the screen there are these numbers on a classroom and they come into focus for like a millisecond and then the camera violently shifts right to the two characters on screen. After spending five minutes trying to pause at the right time and read the thing, I finally got it:
http://i.imgur.com/u6OdZbj.png

I think it says 210, which could be a reference to Luke 2:10, ""But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people"", since the OA is about to make BBA happy after feeling sad about Theo. There's also Revelations 2:10 which similarly says ""Don't be afraid of what you are about to suffer... Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.""


[Anyway, the OA walks into the classroom](http://i.imgur.com/nWhKjBi.png) and immediately there's a ton of purple, the combination of red and blue. As of right now, I have no clue what the symbolism is, but there definitely is some relevancy to it. Also, there's a sign about what to do in a lockdown procedure, and a follow up shot actually shows the text and images crisply, which almost looks like instructions to do a movement -- people holding hands, the roof of a house and two hands.

[The next part shows this awesome blackboard scene](http://i.imgur.com/ffezx1R.png). This was a really complex scene, so let's go from the flag clock-wise. First I drew an arrow, to show the progression from blue to purple to red to yellow. I think that could reflect the hierarchy of characters. During the shooting, there's an angel out of sticky notes in purple, and the OA wears a purple sweatshirt, so maybe angels wear purple [also explains why Leo's specimens, aka that dude that HAP meets at a hospital, have purple goo when incinerated]. Interestingly there's a yellow in there, and while no character is abundantly yellow, there are moments when people get lit up in yellow -- Abel is shown under very yellow lighting at times and Scott has some dark yellow hair when he is resurrected [And just before I forget, HAP says it took them 11 hours to raise Scott like Lazarus -- John 11 is a chapter on the Raising of Lazarus]. 

Then there's the math problem on the right side of the board. This is mathematically correct and it gives us X values of 1 and -4. Since there are a bunch of absolute value signs on the left, I googled ""Bible 1 4"" and found a line in Ephesians about how the creation of god was to be holy and blameless in His eyes. 

The math problem on the left side of the board is mathematically incorrect however. The problem is asking if the negative of the absolute value of 7x-1 is equal to 10x^2-12x-16. They aren't equal -- the 0 of 7x-1 is x = 1/7 and the 0s of the other side of the equation are 2 and 4/5. 

But if you're looking for clues, there's a lot to be found. Ephesians 2:08 [2 and 4/5] is all about how life is the gift of god and not to boast but that we are children of god in service to Him, basically saying you need more than yourself to be saved and don't be arrogant. John 1:7 says that the blood of Jesus purifies us of all sin. 

So all three of those quotes combine to talk about the innocence of mankind and the need to work hard -- pretty much a direct reference to Steven's situation, and interestingly the argument that OA makes. Maybe it's like what the FBI guy said about OA's psychic power, it's about picking up on hidden clues. Did OA make her argument by looking at the numbers and just knowing the bible? 

Also, I like this subtle play by the show -- everyone has a bit of Jesus in them. Each episode shows how every character is in the form of god, whether it be obvious ones like Scott coming back to life or the OA, or subtle ones like this for Steve and BBA's rescue of Steve being a little like Jesus' exploits. It's great modern commentary on the increasingly secular society as well as the godliness in a diverse group of people, from Buck's transgender process to French's struggles with family and drugs.

5jkunb,69,2016-12-21,A little story about Eric Smith; may help those of you interested in a Sports Journalism career,Tall_Rassman,torontoraptors,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoraptors/comments/5jkunb/a_little_story_about_eric_smith_may_help_those_of/,"A bit of an off topic post but I wanted to share a quick story about my favorite Raptors writer/reporter Eric Smith. This is going back about 7 years ago, I wrote to Eric Smith asking for some career advice. That year I had recently got accepted to a post graduate Sports Journalism program at Centennial. At the time, it was the only program in the whole country catered to Sports Journalism. I had so many questions and ended up emailing/contacting 8-10 sports personalities in Toronto looking for answers about what was life like Sports Journalism. I ended up getting only one response back; Eric Smith. His response was incredibly detailed and honest which I very much appreciated. After hearing him on the post-game yesterday on the Fan590 (usually watch on TV and don’t listen as much at night anymore), I remembered the email. Thought I would share it with the Raptors sub as I think this guy deserves so much credit for the job he does. One of the more humble guys in the industry I have chatted with and I got the chance to meet quite a few over the years. It is great that there are genuine awesome people in this industry that take the time to support those that want to pursue the same career they did. Also thought it could serve as some career advice for those that may want to get into the industry at some point. See the email below.   
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  



  
  
*Thanks for the email.*
 
*I would never say never ... or crush anybody's dreams.  If you want it ... go for it.  If you want it ... work for it ... and don't give up on that dream.*
 
*However, I will tell you, you're fighting a tough battle if you're looking to be where I'm at right now.  And trust me when I tell you ... I'm saying that free of ego or arrogance.  I'm simply saying ... I'm surprised sometimes where I am at.  I'll be the first to admit - as I have in emails like this in the past - and in interview I've conducted with various newspapers or magazines:  I am one of the (few) lucky ones.  I was in the right place at the right time.* 

*I started at the FAN as an intern right out of college.  And I was finishing college at the exact same time as the Raptors were first hitting the floor in Toronto at the Skydome.  On top of that ... within months of my internship beginning ... Elliotte Friedman - who was the FAN's Raptor reporter at the time - left the radio station for his first TV job with Headline Sports (now known as ... The Score).  So a door opened up in basketball ...* 
 
*Though I had little professional/radio experience ... I had covered basketball for a couple of my three years in college ... and I'd be around the game as a fan/player/viewer/reporter since my early high school years.*
 
*So I was given a chance by the FAN ... to help cover the Raptors' beat ... at 22 years old.*  
 
*Within a couple of years ... I took over the beat - full time - on my own ... and that coincided with the FAN acquiring the Raptors radio rights (which were previously owned by CFRB).  As the full-time reporter ... management figured it made sense to have me host the pre and post game show too ... so I began working with Chuck Swirsky and Jack Armstrong from their first ever broadcast in Toronto.*
 
*Years later ... when Chuck and Jack moved to TV ... and the FAN was searching for a new broadcast team ... they tried Jonesy with Paul Romanuk ... and after a year of that duo ... my bosses figured ... ""Eric has been covering this team for nearly 10 years and while he may have have played or coached in the NBA ... how many other folks have been closer to this team in the last decade?  And in hosting the pre and post game show - interviewing players, breaking-down plays, and answering/detailing callers' questions .... .... is he not essentially an ""analyst"" anyway ...?""*
 
*It was a gamble on their part ... but ... here I am now ... in my fifth year as the color analyst (and still reporter (and still pre and post host)) ... and the rest as they say ... is history.*
 
And now I've recently added ""Co-host of the Game Plan"" to my duties too!*
 
*But when all is said and done ... this all started with simply being 'lucky' enough to be in the right place at the right time ... and simply being given a 'chance'.*
 
*Elliotte and I have become good friends over the years and I joke with him all of the time -- though I'm quite serious -- that I owe a lot to him.  I owe my career to him at this point.  If he hadn't left for the Score ... who knows where I'd be.*
 
*My point to you Jonathan ... is ... work hard.  Go for it.  There's no stopping you from being a TV, radio, newspaper, or magazine reporter.  You could be a writer.  You could be a broadcaster.  Or maybe you're behind the scenes ... as a producer, director, editor, who knows!*
 
*Or perhaps a door like mine could open for you one day.  Just trust me when I tell you - I am the FIRST to recognize that this kind of opportunity that I have been given ... is extremely, extremely rare!*
 
*I would have been happy to be he FAN's basketball reporter.  I would have been happy trying to work my way into TV one day (maybe).  But I'm lucky - and thankful - to have been afforded this opportunity and I relish and cherish it every day.*
 
*I certainly don't want to steer your life in a different direction - that is for YOU  to decide.  So if it's your passion ... go for it.  What would be better than doing something you love ... and finding a way to get paid for it?*
 
*Good luck.*

*Keep listening*

*Eric Smith*

5jkwb9,4,2016-12-21,Conflicted about switching to an online college in order to pursue teaching opportunities in another Country,srhreddit,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/5jkwb9/conflicted_about_switching_to_an_online_college/,"TL:DR version: U.S. College student got offered VERY good teaching opportunities in Russia. Should I transfer to online college to pursue job opportunities?

Hello /r/college. Before I explain my issue, I should give a little background info about me.

Went to the military after high school and after my contract ended, I decided to pursue an education. I am in my 3rd/4th year of college. I have done in total 5 semesters of university. All of my tuition is now covered by federal financial aid and student loans. I have a family member that helps me with living expenses so I don't have to work as much. I've already gotten most of my general education requirements out of the way, so now I just need to focus on my Major classes. My main goal is to specialize in Applied Linguistics. However, My college doesn't offer linguistics as a major, so I figured the best thing to do is learn another language. I actually wanted to learn Russian, but the college doesn't offer that as a major either, so I ended up choosing German instead. I've been learning both Russian and German for the past six months now. This past summer I was able to get certified to teach English as a foreign language (T.E.S.O.L certification to be more specific) and was able to do an internship in Novosibirsk, Russia teaching English to children and teenagers. I am now in Germany doing an exchange program in order to improve my German.

Here is my issue now. Because of the internship I did Russia, my boss there recommended me to some other language schools and they have presented to me some very good job offers as an English teacher where I can live comfortably and still have time to pursue an education. Some of these offers are better than those I can get back home in the U.S. One company offers free accommodation, a decent salary, company health insurance, etc. These are jobs that I can also make into a career as an English teacher now if I decide to change majors, which I wouldn't mind doing. I figured if I transferred to a college where I can get an English Bachelors degree online (This would allow me to keep all my federal financial aid) and go ahead and go to Russia to start building up a career there. I know that most of my credits I already obtained would transfer. I could finish my bachelor's in German by the end of Spring 2018, but it's honestly not a major I want to pursue and I would rather have a degree in either English or Russian. (I regret now not starting with English in the first place). I could find any type of work back in the U.S. while finishing my degree, but it would only be low level work like pizza delivery or student/work. Any English teaching jobs that I could get now based on my credentials would only be unpaid internships. (I'm done with unpaid internships. I've done two already) My argument is, why should I go back to U.S. and finish my degree and know that I will have a difficult time finding work after graduating when I could to another country where I will always:

- have good job offers
- be able to learn another language that I enjoy learning and want to learn
- be able to develop my career now while studying and get paid to do it (this would mean that the family member who is supporting me could stop paying for my living expenses and use that money for other things.)

And also to be honest, I love Russia and I honestly wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life there (which sounds a bit nuts, I know)

I know that there is this certain stigma though where online degrees do not carry as much weight as an in person degree and does not look as good on a CV. However, I think that this stigma only applies if a person is pursuing their entire degree online. I think in my situation wouldn't matter as much because I've already done about two years of college, so any company would see that I had the dedication to stay in class and study the material. That is the main issue I'm having. Should I just finish my last year or so online and be done with it while working in Russia? Or should I go back to the U.S. and change majors to English? Or perhaps maybe there is another option I haven't though of? Any suggestions would be helpful because I'm kind of stuck at this point. Thanks in advance to those that can help."

Just discovered this sub, glad to be here! :)

So, I'm 23 and have been studying/working to get into speech-language pathology since 2012 when I declared my undergrad major in linguistics and developmental psych. This is relevant, I promise.

The whole time I felt a bit apprehensive about the whole thing, like I was just going along with it because it was the only linguistics field I could find that had job security and seemingly great pay. However, before this, when I was *applying* to college, I considered a compsci degree. Everyone I know that works in compsci convinced me out of it due to the 'keep up with skills' and blah blah blah. I also am not good at math. I'm not saying that 'cause I'm a girl, I'm saying it because it's true right now. My brain and numbers do not get along very well and it takes a lot of extra effort to do math in my head. I have to write it all down or else things get mixed up or forgotten.

This is my second year applying to SLP, and I've told myself for ages taht I will only apply twice, then move on. But a few months ago I had the sudden realization about my apprehensions for this field, and that they've been there all along and I just thought they'd go away.

I've done some very minimal programming (a few days of Python, read some stuff on C++ since I can't install the program I need for it on my work computer) since then and *I love it*! I want to use it all the time. It's great.

Additionally, my alma mater does this thing for returning alumni where they take the most relevant 90 credits of your previous degree and apply it to the new one, so you only have to do the major requirements. This would mean I could finish a second bachelor's in 1.5-2 years depending on how many math prereqs I need to take and timing and etc. I'm genuinely concerned about this *only* because of the calculus classes I will have to take as prereqs for some compsci classes. I barely passed calc in high school with a terrible teacher. I don't know if I can handle college calc 6 years later.

I feel like I've made up my mind, but I'm so afraid of the backlash from my family for wanting to back out so late in the process (I literally submitted all my applications this past weekend) that I'm considering either withdrawing all my apps and pretending liek I didn't, or refusing any acceptances (if any) and pretending like I didn't get in.

My mom used to work in some kind of computer engineering but got bullied out of her internship and never went back to the field. I know that if I go into compsci she's going to relay all those stories to me again because that's how it was for her in the 80s, and obviously nothing's changed since then. /s

**I guess what I'm *really* asking here is if anyone else switched gears like this and how you felt about the decision?**"

Confidence has always been something that I've struggled with and it is something that I've grown over the years. last year I finally graduated from university, it was a long and arduous process but I finally passed and decided to carry on my studies into my masters although with a different topic. 
 
I found the jump to an MA, especially since I opted to finish it in a shorter time frame and in a completely different subject to be rather jarring and combined with my fatigue from university wasn't happy and began to question its worth so I actually quit and planned to begin the whole process of looking for work after Christmas which is funny because it has come full circle now. 
 
Well my grandmother died around new  years eve, well more that she became very ill and went into hospital and for a month required the full attention of me and my family. After her death there was of course alot of grief and adaption to her absence and dealing with the funeral arrangements. It basically jettisoned any idea I had of looking for work for most of the year for me since I took alot of that time off to recover and help my family.
 
I was still determined though and wrote out my CV and began looking for work. The whole process of job searching was so complex and arbitrary I really found it quite difficult at the start and had to stop several times due to getting so overly stressed about it I fell sick. 
 
I've gotten better at it now and have a greater understanding of where to search and what to search for but all of the jobs i've applied for I have either heard nothing back or gotten a negative. 
 
I have no real working experience, university was quite hard for me and combined with my own lack of confidence and shyness I never got an internship during the summer. During the school year as well I just had so much work with all the books i had to read, I studied English Literature, that I did not feel that I could effectively balance any work I would do and my studies and felt it was better to devout my full attention towards the latter. 
 
The whole experience of job hunting has been horrible. Many of the roles that I apply for, even ones that are low end ones generally all require experience, i've even seen internships require experience. So of course the only real way for one to gain experience is via unpaid internships which is something I did not want to do but I am beginning to realise now that I will have to.
 
The whole thing has left me feeling quite anxious about my prospects and myself, I feel like I am not quailfied for anything or ready to do anything. I feel like most of what I got taught before at school and university was largely nonsense. I'm 23 now and feel like every passing day that I'm not working is some terrible sin against my name and that one day i'm going to wake up at 32 still not working and still just a failure. To make matters worse its something that is quite hard to talk  about with others I've tried approaching it with my family and they try to be understanding but I just get so tongue tied about it. I very much feel alone and knocked off course.
 
Its the wrong mindset to have I know and not one conductive towards actually getting a job since confidence is key. Problem is its a feeling I've had for a while now and never been able to shake off.
 
My plan is to begin my search again after Christmas with a more structured approach. To instead set time for myself where I set aside certain hours of the day to search and then afterwards to stop and not think about it all and relax to not get overly stressed again. I also want to do something like say apply to ten jobs or more in one week or some other goal to actually give myself a sense of progression. 
 
I'm hopeful that the new year will be better for me and that 2017 will in general go better."

Tomorrow I have my very first real job interview, since the company I'm working for now basically hired me without an interview because I did my internship there.

I'm excited, I'm nervous, I'm hoping I won't disappoint them...

So do any of you fellow Redditors have some tips for me?

(I'm a 23 year old female, applying for a Front-end Development job)

**UPDATE**: So I had my interview today, unfortunately they already told me they aren't going to hire me. They really liked my personality and said it matched the rest of the company but because they didn't have time to invest in helping me learn AngularJS they couldn't hire me right now. They did encourage me to try again some other time when I'm a little bit more experienced.

So I'm now trying to brush up on my Angular skills and I hope the next compnay that will come along will hire me! :)"
5jm4y7,23,2016-12-21,The Faux Pas,Kyengen,TalesFromLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromLife/comments/5jm4y7/the_faux_pas/,"Here's a little ditty in case you didn't believe I was an asshole.

This particular story starts with my friend Harvey. That's not his name, but I'm gonna go with it. I met Harv in middle school, he was not quite right so they put him in the ""adaptive"" P.E. class with me. I was there cause I'd punched a sewing machine hard enough to create shrapnel and was deemed emotional unstable. That's not relevant to the story, I just like to relieve the final moments of that machine sometimes.

Anyway, Harv wasn't quite right due to his home life. He was being mildly abused by his mother, who had some pretty severe mental issues and had decided she didn't need meds anymore after Harv's father lost to cancer. There was no official action on the abuse thing, but when he entered the school he was quiet and didn't respond like the admins wanted him to, so they assumed there was something wrong with him and stuck him in remedial classes.

Harv, myself and another guy I'll call Craig would become the only members of the chess club, solely as an excuse to hang out in the library at lunch and not be bothered by other people. That should tell you a lot about how these years were going to play out. We helped him with his mom when we could. I was a really good liar at this point so I was always ready with an excuse as to why the kid couldn't go home yet, and I had already been picking fights for a years, so I showed him how to block and dodge a bit. 

Middle school and high school happened, Harv turned out to be one of those guys that can build a high end computer out of gum and tape, we got more friends, things was as acceptable as can be expect from a group of ethnically diverse nerds with social stigmas. Also Harv shot up to 6'5"" one summer, and Craig was 6'3"", so I was suddenly the short one at 6'1"" which really pissed me off. 

Enter Sabrina. That's not her name, but that's what I'm gonna go with. Sabrina was...I have trouble describing Sabrina. She was, at the time, probably the loudest and most annoying individual I'd ever met. Extrovert doesn't cover it. ""Pathological need to be at the center of everyone's universe"" might be more fitting. She had to know all the gossip, share all the stories. She was nice at her core, but I really wanted to hit her with a cinder block to stop her from talking on more than one occasion.

She and Harv got into it pretty heavy pretty fast. There is something in the socially reticent that often makes the more outgoing appealing (having married one myself). By the end of high school, he was living with her in her parents place. They were also nice people, if a bit strange and they loved him, and understood that he needed to get out of his mother's place as her mental stability continued to decline.

Shortly after high school, November I think because they needed to wait for her to turn 18, they announced they were getting married. This displeased me, as they were 18 and hadn't really gotten 'out there' yet. I spoke to them about it privately, if they're happy I'm happy for them, but they are young and have very limited experiences to draw upon, and they were probably going to regret this. They didn't talk to me for a while after that, but still got married. We made up, I was a groomsman, whatever, fast forward four years.

They were still living in her parents house, who were more than happy to continue hosting the couple. Sabrina sold make up in a store at the mall, Harv had been working in an electronics store but quit when they stopped giving commission. He was learning computer animation now on his own. They were throwing a valentines day party. Not an uncommon occurrence, they there parties for everything.

The group arrives, mostly the same people from high school, we've all kept in touch, some have gone, a few others have come in, it's all fine. There's copious food as Sabrina I suspect was training to be a babushka, and oh, what's this? An announcement? They're pregnant! Congrats all around.

Except from me of course. I'm thinking. Neither of them went to college, which is fine but one must accept that it can be limiting. She was promoted to assistant manager at her makeup store, he was still unemployed but had an unpaid internship pending that could become something. They lived in her parents house, which was out of rooms between the four of them. I had a rough idea of how much a child can cost, on paper anyway and that was miles away from what they presently capable of. Emotional stresses were a factor as well, what with Harv's background.  This was ill advised.

As I sat brooding and thinking, worried about my friends and angry at them for not giving this proper thought, Sabrina came over.

&gt; Sabrina: Something wrong Ky? You're glaring more than usual.

&gt; Me: Nothing of consequence.

&gt; Sabrina: Reeeeaally?

&gt; Me: Really.

&gt; Sabrina: Come on, you can tell me.

&gt; Me: (sigh) I have some concerns about...this.

&gt; Sabrina: Oh? Like what?

&gt; Me: Not now.

&gt; Sabrina: Why not?

&gt; Me: Because not now.

She'd been growing irritated and that seemed to be the last of it. She marched to the front of the room and yelled.

&gt; Sabrina: Excuse me everyone! Ky has something he want's to say!

All eyes on me now.

&gt; Me: No.

&gt; Sabrina: Come on, you said you had concerns. What's the problem? We can talk like adults.

I dislike being put on the spot, and I was irked to begin with. Bad bedfellows this.

&gt; Me: Very well. I think this is stupid. Neither of you have any real prospects, you have nothing to your name. You're not at a point in life on any level where you can handle a burden like this. You aren't mature enough for the strain, stable enough for the burden, or strong enough for the work load. Are you going to hoist the problems onto your parents? You haven't even the room here. You haven't created a child, you've created a problem you can't solve and frankly I'm worried about you both failing to the point where you destroy no less than than three lives. Those are my concerns.

The room was dead silent. Disbelief was rapidly turning to hate. Sabrina started crying and ran out of the house. Harv and most of the women present followed, but not before giving me a look that suggested a quick death would be too good.

&gt; Craig: Ky~

&gt; Me: Relax, I'm leaving.

None of my friends would talk to me for about three months after that. Craig, who remains as the nicest guy I've ever met, wanted to set things right, so he set it up that we'd all sit down and talk. They understood that I was worried about them and appreciated that aspect of the sentiment, though my delivery method was essentially inexcusable. And Sabrina also apologized for throwing the spotlight on me like that, it's a long documented fact that that isn't going to end well for anyone. I apologized for my handling of the situation, and hoped I was wrong. They tried to assuage my concerns but it didn't take.

A year after their son was born they separated. At this point I'd taken over my family's house which included two cars I wasn't going to use, so I gave him a room and use of one of the cars till they figured everything out. Ultimately they got a legally civil but socially messy divorce. Harv ended up getting a pretty good job as a special effects artist for a production house, and these days is one of the guys pushing the limits of immersive 3D tech. He rocked the single dad thing for a while with surprising dedication and integrity, but found a nice girl who he's currently living with and she loves the hell out of the little poozer. She's a little boring, but he could actually benefit from a little boring. And the kid, despite off to a rocky start, is actually pretty cool. I'm fixing to start training him before a whole lot more time passes."

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I just finished an audit internship and will be doing another internship in a couple of weeks, so I will return to school to complete my 5th and final year. 
Anyway, I am really concerned about the CPA Exam. Especially with the pass rates being so low on each part. The changes to the exam will only make it worse. I'm afraid its gonna take me five tries to pass one part of the exam. It doesn't help that I am a slow learner, and it has taken me a while to get for me to get the hang of my previous internship. Also, I have had to retake a couple of accounting classes, but I've done well on the retakes. Anyway, has anyone taken the CPA Exam?! If so, was it hard?! How long did it take you to pass it?"
5jmqbd,27,2016-12-21,"How does one deal with handsome boys? 21F, never been on a date, easily intimidated by attractive males.",Chrips_of_the_Birds,aspergirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/5jmqbd/how_does_one_deal_with_handsome_boys_21f_never/,"I was recently diagnosed with mild Aspergers. Due to my academic and intellectually curious nature, my teachers thought loving solitude was quite normal, as was having no friends. 

As I was very good at aplitude tests, I won a lot of scholarships. My parents shackled me to an all girls boarding school. They corrected my slight stutter, and encouraged me to flourish intellectually. But the only males I talked to were my father and a few teachers.

I have a lot of friends, due to my eccentricity and strange sense of humor. Some are boys (though the majority were girls), but they are awkward and sensitive like I. I never felt any sexual attraction towards them. 

Somehow, I created this little world of intellectual conversations and reading. It was gentle and stable, but terribly hollow. 

But this year, it's quite clear that I am 'developing like a woman'. I used to avoid handsome men. Yet this becomes complex when you find them sexually attractive. Moreover, I behave like an idiot when talking to them. This is unsustainable in employment, and has led to them exploiting my vulnerabilities. 

For example, I lost a major debating competition as my partner convinced me I had 'misinterpreted everything'. I fell into a weird state of subservience, as he was very attractive. He stared at my unnervingly for hours, with a stern, unsmiling face. Normally, I would have questioned him; I am argumentative by nature. 

It turns out he did this deliberately, taking advantage of the point based system to get a new partner. My ideas were actually correct; he clearly viewed me as a threat as we were competing for the same prestigious scholarship. 

A similar incident happened during an internship. I never knew my flaws were so obvious! 

All this has making me relapse into depression. The universe I created became unstable and cold. I'm so empty, sexually frustrated, and angry at myself. 

It's worth mentioning that God was having a funny day when he created me. Socially awkward, but very pretty and clever. I think my appearance made my eccentricity more tolerable to others. 

These days, I've become a laughing stock. I say things that make me sound desperate, though I've never acted on these urges before. I ask people out, but they decline. Whilst working in the financial district, a few men asked me out. I'm sure this was due to my appearance, and they spent the whole encounter laughing at how 'fucking weird' I was.

So, Erm, how do I deal with all this? 

Is this late puberty?

5jmu7u,1,2016-12-21,advice on making friends in your 20s,lef93,FriendshipAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/5jmu7u/advice_on_making_friends_in_your_20s/,"So I finished uni in September, I am 23 and moved back to my hometown. Sadly it is something that really only occurred to me recently, but I never made tons of friends at uni, I can count only about 5 and unfortunately many of them are not in the country or never available. Outside of that I have one really good friend who had to move to another country, we contact one another regularly, and if I end up earning money I am very tempted to go over there and see her. There isn't really a lot I can do about the past, but I have lacking confidence so I found it very hard to make friends, which I don't think helped, I was also with my very first boyfriend, and he basically wasn't good for me, so I stupidly concentrated on him.

Fast forward to finishing in September and I found out he was cheating on me, so we broke up. Feeling rather insecure I went on a dating app and quite instantly found someone else, he was lovely and has at the very least taught me that all men are different. However, he is moving to a new country very soon, and just under a month before the departure after suspecting he was acting a bit different I noticed he had removed some of the 'coupley' photos from facebook. To me that says he is preparing to break up before he leaves...so I kind of sense where this could be going.

During the time that I have dated him I have met up with friends twice, one of them is a good group of friends but we will probably only end up meeting a couple of times a year as everyone has commitments.

I am in an internship, and unfortunately it is a 40 minute commute and currently a work from home thing. It is supposed to pick up in the new year, so I may make good acquaintances from being in the office, but currently I have only seen the staff a few times so I have not made friends yet.

I guess with a bit of a long background story I am asking how to make friends in this situation. I think as a person I despise loneliness as I feel it equates to my self worth...and for me there is nothing better than relaxing from a long week and chatting with someone. I suppose that is why I automatically went on that dating site straight away, and although there is nothing wrong with that, it would be nice if I had friends who I knew would stay in my life around that...so that I wasn't solely focussing on relationships.

My plan is to start getting to the gym this week at least once and build up a routine, no classes (I have a heart condition and don't want to embarrass myself with unfitness) but I am hoping I may meet people there. Has anyone made friends from going to the gym?

I was also tempted to sign up to either yoga or pilates. I know you can get actual classes so I am hoping people talk to each other in them...but I don't know if there will be many people close to my age there.

Other than that I am at a loss with what to do. My town doesn't really have a lot to do. I just really do not like the idea of having virtually nothing to do apart from a couple times a year in my 20s so I need to try something.

Hello everyone! On June 2, I had a surgery to repair a labrum and correct FAI in my left hip. I had been having a constant, radiating pain on and off for about two years. Long story short, I am SO thrilled to have had it done because it feels better than it has ever felt.

Fast forward a month after my surgery. While rehabilitating, I started noticing a shooting pain in my *right* hip that would sometimes descend down to my knee. Knowing that it was probably FAI in the other hip (FAI is often times bilateral to my understanding), my physical therapist decided to treat both hips, a plan to rehab the surgical one and a different plan to help deal with pain in the other hip.

My left hip got better but my right worsened. The past few months it has gotten to the point where both my right hip hurt pretty bad every day. I was moving around at work and I rarely went days without pain. Then about 2 months ago, my right knee started hurting as well. There were days where my the pain in my right knee exceeded that of my right hip. 

Needless to say, my right leg was in a lot of pain. I was lifting weights about 4-5 times a week and *always* ending my sessions with careful stretching and foam rolling. 

It didn't really help.


Fast forward now. I've had an MR arthrogram and x-rays on my right hip, *ruling out* a labral tear but confirming FAI in my right hip. I decided to schedule the surgery for January 12th of 2017.

The surgery for my left hip went so well, so I'm optimistic that a surgery for my right will too. For work-related reasons, this would be the optimal time to do the surgery. I just ended an internship last week and have not started applying for jobs moving forward. 

However, there's a big part of me that is rather hesitant to go ahead. Ever since I've stopped my internship, my hip has started feeling a lot better. It seems that with extended periods of sedentary life, the pain in my hip/knee lessens (sometimes even pain-free).

The on-and-off occurrences of pain are starting to make me question myself. 

I know that none of you can tell me what to do, but if any of you can give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it. "

Now I'm confused.",babyflirt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jmy2j/i_22_f_pulled_away_from_my_friend_21_m_of_15/,"First account--lurked for a long time, but never had a need to post before. I could use some help though--I thought I made the right call ending a friendship over unrequited feelings, but now I've had several trusted friends question my choice and my perception of things, and I'm just lost.

""Matt"" [21M] and I [22F] became friends at the start of our Junior year of college (we are half way through senior year right now). He had just transferred in, and I was volunteering with orientation for transferred. Turned out that he was also in one of my classes, and we got talking and hit if off great, and were soon good friends. We have the same major (though different sub-concentrations) and have had at least one class together for the last three semesters, and we always sat together in class, would grab coffee before/after, and usually met for drinks or for studying 3-4 times a week. Basically we saw each other almost every day. We would also go out to dinner fairly regularly (usually with a small group of friends, but one-on-one as well). 

This summer we both were staying in our college's city for internships, and as my apartment was closer to his job then his was he would crash on my couch a few nights a week, and eventually he just left a backpack of his stuff at my apartment. We also went on a few day trips to beaches nearby (usually with others, but once just the two of us).
  
Before anyone asks, no we never slept together. We both dated around, but weren't in relationships for more then a month or two with other people. For the longest time we were just really good platonic friends. 

However, I always was aware that Matt is attractive, and about 9 months ago I realized I was developing perhaps a bit more then a crush on him. But at the time he was in a fling with another girl, and then when that ended I had time to realize that if he had been interested in more he could have made a move a long time ago, so I put it out of my mind. 

While we always did joke about sex (lots of ""that's what she said"" type jokes) starting the end of this summer I felt like the sex-talk changed. We started talking about sexual experiences and fantasies, and even began making joke-comments directed at each other. He also got really weirdly jealous on two different occasions this fall--once at a start of the year party, when I was flirting with a cute guy and Matt suddenly was stuck to my side/interjecting himself into the conversation, and another time when I went on a few dates with a guy and Matt seemed overly interested in how the dates went, almost quizzing me. He also started complementing me a lot, and when we would go out partying would usually end up cuddling against my side. 

So, I figured he was starting to like me, right? The crush was still there, and as there seemed to be interest I straight up asked him out one evening. Said that I liked him as friend, but also as more then a friend, and if he was interested I'd be up for exploring the more-then-friend bit. He seemed a bit surprised, but turned me down (nicely).  This was in late September. Afterwards I went back to treating him like a friend, and started pulling back on some of the more sexual, flirty stuff. But if anything Matt seemed to ramp it up a bit. This was the period where the weird over-inquisitive-questioning about the guy I was briefly dating happened. 

Finally, after a lot of thinking about it and talking it over with my sister, I decided that I needed to back off on the friendship. I still liked him a LOT, and the flirting hadn't stopped (not just his fault--I would flirt back). It didn't seem healthy. But, due to how close our friendship was I thought I owed it to him to let him know why. So before we left for break I pulled him aside, and let him know that I still had feelings for him and because of that I would need to town down the friendship for a bit. 

Since then, though, I've had three different people tell me to my face that I am doing the same thing to him that ""nice guys"" do to girls all the time--become close friends just to hookup, and then get mad when sex doesn't happen. **I** don't feel like this is what happened. We were friends first, and I feel like he was flirting (though maybe I am wrong?). Who knows why he didn't want to date me, that is completely his choice and I get that... but isn't it also my choice to pull away from a close friendship that for me has crossed a line? I read on here all the time about friendships that are too intimate and bother a partner, and when I was talking to my sister she pointed out that another guy might have a problem with a male friend who I ate dinner with and who crashed in my apartment all the time and stuff. To be completely fair, I did tell her all about my feelings for Matt, so idk if she was really impartial.

I guess I was so confidant at first in my choice, but now I'm second guessing myself. Did I ""nice-guy"" him? I mean, two of my friends were arguing with me that I was over reading it and friendships like that are normal for students. It didn't feel normal though. Guys, do you have female friends you act like that with? I mean, I have talked about sex and sexual fantasies with my female friends, so maybe that is where they are coming from. But this just felt more intimate?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Was really close friends with a dude for over a year. Liked him. Thought he was flirting. Asked him out and was turned down. Stayed friends for a bit, felt the flirting continued, as did my feelings. Ended the friendship... now am being told I ""nice-guy""ed him. Did I?"

Among the people I met there was this girl who at first sight didn't stand out much. As I got to know her during the first weeks of the schoolyear I instantly felt that we had a lot in common but didn't pursue anything as I learned that she was in a relationship. At the time I was also in a relationship that had lasted 4 years, it was quite tumultuous and if I had feelings before, they were probably gone. Fast forward a few months, I am spending quite some time chatting with this girl (texting everyday and the occasional night drinking out) in addition to seeing her everyday at school. By that time, I knew that something was wrong and that I needed to end my current relationship because I was getting feelings for this girl. This is what I did about a year ago, I do not regret it because this relationship was toxic and I should have ended it long ago. 

So back in January this year, I was feeling quite lonely and so was this girl as her BF had just left for a 6 month internship in Denmark. At first I felt that I had a shot since the main guy was gone but upon seeing how devastated she was I knew she had strong feelings for him and that I shouldn't interfere, but she kept on talking even more to me and wanting to spend more time together. I was glad to do so because she was a friend and feelings aside we shared a lot of common interests so it was always a good time. Then I got doubts about her intentions when she proposed to come over to my place one night, have dinner and drinks together and sleep at my place so I decided to go ahead and see what happens. She was quite promiscuous that night and we ended up making out but nothing more as she cried afterwards thinking she was a bad person. After that night I was sure that it would never go further and that she had made up her mind, but she kept on coming back, making out with me and regretting it twice after that night. 

At that point I was beginning to have strong feelings towards her, so I wanted to know what her intentions were, turns out she had feelings too, but not enough to break up with her boyfriend. Time was passing and the school year was ending, she came to my hometown one week end in June and we finally slept together, just one week before her boyfriend was due to come back. Then during the summer, we couldn't see each other as we were both working and she feared that she would be tempted again, I convinced her to meet me up for a day in August and then again we slept together so I was thinking that thing were getting pretty serious at that point. But she was remorseful and it drove us apart for a while as we had an argument about how this thing was going. 
Finally in September we moved back to the same town for school and ended up in the same class again, this is what we had both wanted but it felt strange as she had mixed feelings, wanting to spend time with me and at the same time fearing that she would cheat again. It lasted a month and one night we slept together again and this time it kept on, we became lovers and she shared her time between me and her bf when he was in town. We became even closer and one day the L word was finally uttered between the two of us. She was in love with me, but still had strong feelings for her BF. I hated the whole situation because I can't share the women I love with another man, when we were together I was always calm and caring but as soon as I knew she was with him I became furious and distant, it kept going back and forward for a while until one day I told her that this could not go on forever and that she needed to make a choice, otherwise she was going to lose me for good. 

About 3 weeks ago she made that choice, I came to her place and she told me that she couldn't choose me, she feared that our characters were too much alike and that it would not last in the long term, it had been a terrible call to make but she couldn't choose me. At first I felt devastated, then furious because it didn't make sense. I stormed out of her place but when I opened the door, we both looked at each other and cried in each other's arms. It felt unreal as I was really shaken. She had been the only person in my life that mattered and letting her go all of a sudden was hard. So I made a choice, maybe a poor one but I still did it, I decided that I was not done with her, she has feelings I know it for sure and I can't let her go like that. I need to convince her that she made the wrong choice. So now we are still in contact, we saw each other again a few days later and we kissed again. Things are still strange but I have hope. Now I have to figure out what to do, what do you guys think? Should I wait and be patient or make the BF know somehow? 
TL;DR : I'm in love with this girl, so is she apparently but she won't break up with her boyfriend. 

Ps : sorry for the long post and the approximate english (I'm not native). Thank you in advance for your advice."

I've been here for about four months now. 

I'm the youngest here-there's another intern who's 20, but she only comes in when she can because she moved for college. Other than us, there's a woman in her late 30's, two guys in their 30's, and my boss and his wife, who are both mid 50's. 

Today was a fun day because we just finished a big project. (Fixing computers for a bigger than normal company) And he was talking about how happy he is to have everyone, etc. On his way out, he shook one guys hand(who he'll see after Christmas), waved at the other intern(who he'll see tomorrow), and gave me a half hug and a kiss on top of my head, and said he was really happy I joined the company. 

Am I overreacting on feeling weird about this? I can't really do anything, I need this job to save for college and we don't have an HR or anything since it's so small. 

EDIT: Thanks to those who responded seriously. I think you're right, I just got really uncomfortable(my stepdad hurt me sexually when he was around, so I have that going for me, and my boss has a lot of the same mannerisms as he did so I get a little on edge, no fault to him). To those who were being dicks, it's not like I was going to sue. I just wanted to know if it was a situation where it'd be valid to remove myself from. "

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn"" I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be a representative from a competitor who seduces me into giving you control, or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anything else that comes to mind! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well.

Will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused. 

Bondage, foot worship, and petplay are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. 

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

I'm finishing up a post-bacc degree in CS and am anticipating graduating August 2017.  I spoke to a couple women who work in tech for a big bank and they suggested I intern in the summer and graduate in Fall of 2017 so I could go to Grace Hopper (my university is generous with GHC scholarships).  They told me that as a company they prioritize GHC applicants and that there are special mentorship programs and such for employees hired through the conference.  I do have a tech internship under my belt (though for a startup and not a structured, developed company).  I'm torn between just graduating and getting a job asap (since I'm a post-bacc student I've already been in school for 4 years for my first undergrad degree and am anxious to finish up this program), or holding off graduation in hopes of a better job prospect.  I'd love to hear any feedback.  The conference sounds amazing but I just don't know if it's really as important as they're making it out to be.

So I'm kinda in mid career crisis right now. I'm a junior at an elite private university studying computer science and electrical engineering. I began programming when I was 16 (am 21 now) and have held three successful summer internships at a well respected tech giant. While I still really enjoy engineering and have great career prospects, I'm beginning to think I want to do something more humanitarian and more challenging with my life. I've got credit for math through differential equations, physics through electricity and magnetism, and a semester each of chem and bio. I also tend to do well on standardized tests (consistently in 98th - 99th percentile), but my GPA is total crap (3.1). While my school is well known for grade deflation and I'm in one of the hardest majors, I'm aware this isn't going to cut it. Anyways what would I need to do to be premed? Would getting a masters with a good GPA help? I can probably improve my undergraduate GPA too over the next semesters because I'm starting to take graduate courses, which grade much more generously. Is this a pipe  dream?"

I smoked often during this past summer. Yet when college started up again, I smoked the same amount (maybe even more due to stress).

It got to the point where I just would rather go to some classes high because they weren't entertaining.

This quarter of college ended recently and I got the same grades I did last quarter, yet I know I could've done better if I didn't smoke so much.

Now, I have an internship involving programming and I'm realizing now that I've been slacking off on work because of weed. I think in my head I can do this work at home and smoke to focus. I usually just end up being distracted. I want to do more with programming, but just today, I wasted it all because I smoked a bowl, ate, and slept when I could've been working.

I also realized that I don't feel the same really. I feel like when I'm without weed I need to smoke to destress, to focus, to make me not be so hard on myself, to make me not think or feel sad.

It's even come to the point to where I smoke in my car right after I have a ""sober"" night out with friends or family.

What are some ways to fix this?"

You wanted us to work together as a family, you wanted us to be together as family, well guess how that turned out? J is in canada, P is across the country, and you wonder why I dont wanna pick up my phone when you call? Then again, its always been about what you wanted isnt it? Never mind the fact that Dad has been working at the same company ever since he got out of college and works hard for his money, never mind the fact that he wants to retire already, you need to blow his money on more useless fucking ANTIQUES, or another fucking cabin built, or you want the pool remodeled, or this, or that or whatever the fuck your fleeting fancy wants today. You never appreciated ANY of us enough. You dragged us up to that hell hole in missouri for that one christmas break and then worked us like dogs, tearing that fucking nasty ass mold infested shitpile apart, lugging those goddamn heavy ass mattresses around and then act like you dont understand why were all frustrated and ready to kill one another. I SHOULDVE KNOWN YOU SAW US ONLY AS FREE LABOR, THATS ALL WEVE EVER BEEN TO YOU ISNT IT?! All of the house remodeling, all of the ponds and the deck and the patio, I shouldve known thats how things wouldve gone.

Or maybe its your constant shittalking about all of us. Yeah I figured your game. I figured that shit out a long time ago. You shit talk to me about J, P, and Dad. It didnt take someone telling me for me to figure out you were shit talking about me to everyone else. But everytime something comes back to bite you, someone gets pushed a little too far, its all about how ""We dont appreciate you, and everything you do for us.""

Lets talk about how you took away five summers away from me. Lets talk about how despite all your promises to pay me, I never saw a fucking dime. Lets talk about the way you treated E when he came for those two weeks. 

Actually lets talk about that in more detail. I cant help that Im gay. I understand you came from a different time and place. Im thankful youre atleast accepting it. But for fucks sake, the way ou treated him was  appalling and embarrassing. First off, you cant fucking tell me that I didnt say he was coming down I told you months in advance that he wanted to come down for a couple of weeks. I know for a fact I did. I told you in december that he wanted to come down. If J and D wanted to come down for a couple of weeks in the summer, you would have the best room all set up and ready to go for them. But because E is a guy, he has to go sleep in a hotel?! And then you SET HIM TO WORK?! LIKE HE FUCKING OWES YOU ANYTHING?!  But no, seeing as hes my boyfriend, lets screw him over as well. Thats just another part of my life that you can exploit and take over. 

""Another male in the house? Great, set him to work while I complain from my office.""

Oh, but your precious would be daughter over there is the best thing youve got going. You treat her better than you treat the rest of us. You built her a house, you pay her salary, you give her free rent and let her friends come over any time they want. YOU BUILT HER A FUCKING HOUSE. LEMME REPEAT THAT. YOU HAD DAD BUILD HER A FUCKING HOUSE WITH AC AND WIFI.
But its too much for me to get paid. God forbid I ask for the summer pay you promised me time and time again that you were going to pay me. Only when it comes to pay day, you cry and yell, then storm out because I never appreciate anything you do for me. Yeah, you dragged me away from my friends for five christmas and summer breaks to work for you, all without pay because you couldnt be bothered. Never mind a summer internship to help further myself, or taking a few courses at school during the summer so I can graduate on time, You need someone up there to BITCH AND COMPLAIN AT. And then you wonder why I wont go into buisness with you. BECAUSE I LEARNED THAT LESSON FIVE TIMES IN A ROW. 

You know what, Im glad Im not spending christmas with y'all. Id rather be alone than go up there to that fucking hell hole. 

I'm not giving you my address after I move out with E, and I wont answer any of your calls after that point either. Im taking my cat back with me and that'll be it. Keep the inheritance, I dont give a fuck."

**tl;dr: Done everything to separate except the legal aspect. Is there any rush?**

Background: husband and I (married for 9 years, together for 14, one child) have had serious problems for several years, mainly regarding emotional abandonment, codependency, and (consequently) sexual dysfunction. Once I finally got tired enough of being ignored, I asked for a separation, at which point my husband agreed to seek counseling with me. Spent most of this year in therapy, together and individually, but I think for me by that point it was just too little too late. I moved in with my parents for a couple of months at the end of summer and moved into my very own place two months ago. Everything is amicable other than the fact that my husband very much disagrees with my choices.

Anyway, it's clearly been a very long struggle to get this far. This is due in part to my own learning process. I've known my husband since I was 14 years old, and we started dating when I was 18. I'm now 33 and learning how to be a person without him. 

It's also due, however, to the fact that my husband has been having such a hard time dealing with every little baby step. He becomes so emotional during conversations that he often can't continue talking, can't make eye contact with me in public, etc.

 I understand it's a shitty time, and he's hurting, and it's all my fault etc., but I'm doing what I need to do for what I believe to be the best interest of everyone in my family. I'm also doing it in the most gentle, gradual way I can to minimize trauma on everyone (particularly our young child).

Bottom line: I have my own place and my own bank account. Our child has been splitting time between us since August, and seems to be adjusting well. I'm a graduate student with a paid internship (read: I'm not a deadbeat), and my husband and I have a good-faith financial agreement that we are both comfortable with. I'm not dating or anything, but I don't at this time see a path to reconciliation with my husband. We are, for all practical purposes, separated.

I've had a couple friends ask when I'm actually going to get divorced, and my therapist has also encouraged me to ""rip the bandaid off"" as soon as I know for sure. 

My question is: what's the rush? Why create this pressure to ring a bell that can't be unrung? Am I just stalling? I have made peace with the selfishness of my choices so far, but now I'm being told I'm being selfish for *not* moving forward with an actual divorce. 

What do you all think?

Thanks so much."

Body:

We all have those moments from our youth that make us cringe.  Perhaps it was pouring your heart out to a woman who saw you only as a friend, or maybe it was when you discovered that your significant other had been fooling around with another.  It hurt at the time, and worse, it was humiliating and made you less attractive to every girl you knew.  But one day you moved on, learned from your mistakes, and found someone better.  This is not an option for women.

A woman's promiscuity will follow her forever, particularly if she chooses to stay living in the area where these decisions were made.  There was a girl I knew in high school that I still looked back on fondly, and I was considering contacting her recently.  As luck would have it, a few days ago a mutual friend of she and I informed me that she was not nearly as innocent as she acted back then.  For our day and age, she was still quite innocent, but not in any historical sense.  Not good enough for me!

Passed over for a mistake years before, because I know the damage has been done.  Women are like fine china.  Once broken, you can make them look nearly the same, but they will never be truly healed.

In the modern western world, where children are not being taught how to be masculine and feminine, the family unit has been disintegrating for decades, and ""alternative"" lifestyles have become idolized.  You and I can still recover our masculinity, and grow it until the mistakes of our past only make ourselves and others chuckle.

Men and women both, if they wake up, seem to do so sometime in their early 20s mostly.  For women, it happens when they are at 60 hours a week at that internship or whatever, or maybe waking up with a hangover for the hundredth weekend in a row, when they realize all they ever wanted was to have children and raise them with a man she can respect.  Finally realized, when it is too late.  When the receptors in her brain that were supposed to bond her to a mate for life have chemical burns.  When her past is so shameful that she won't respect any man who would still have her.

I myself am nearly halfway through my 20s now and I feel I finally cleansed myself of most propaganda and became truly masculine only sometime in the past year.  Many say men hit their sexual prime around 30-35, so I still have a decade to enjoy my peak.

For women, this is not possible.  Women hit their sexual peak sometime between the ages of 15 and 20 on average, and yet they don't awake and shake off the lies we've all been told until the same time as we do: the early 20s.  How can a woman my age, with her most beautiful days behind her and a history of bargain sales, ever hope to sell herself for a high price?

I pity the boys I grew up with, but I pity the girls even more.  The other day, I saw that an old crush of mine had broken up with her boyfriend of many years.  On her profile, she was looking absolutely stunning, but as I browsed her photos, I came across photos from when we knew each other...there is no comparison.  At 21, she looks damn fine, but at 16 and 17 her beauty was almost beyond belief.

Those four or five years of beauty were wasted.  All she has is memories and a person she must try to forget if she ever wants to be happy.

Lessons learned:  No matter how hard your life has been, or how hopeless it can seem, be grateful you are a man.  Being a man means you have a chance!"
5jrl05,2,2016-12-22,[31/f] trying to figure out when/where to draw the line for a partner (30/m) who isn't putting in the effort,GingerBubbles,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5jrl05/31f_trying_to_figure_out_whenwhere_to_draw_the/,"Good morning! I ended up here over marriage difficulties. I strongly prefer to keep my own council when making decisions, but I've reached the point where I'm going in circles and need new input to change the trajectory of my thoughts. I've been unable to reach a conclusion I felt confident enough about to take the step to either break or re-affirm my marriage, instead staying in a holding pattern. I need to come up with a new way to address or think about my marriage issues, so I can get to a decision.

I am 31 and currently working on my master's of biology. I am a confident detail-oriented introvert that likely has undiagnosed Asperger's. I grew up the oldest of 3 in the midwest with solid, mostly hands-off self-employed parents.

I met my husband when I was 23, about 6 months after graduating from my undergrad. We began dating exclusively right away, mostly because there wasn't much to be had in the dating pool around us then (middle of nowhere Florida). About 5 months in, I went to SC for an internship, while he began his career as a teacher in Tampa. The following August (dating for over a year) I got an internship in St. Pete, FL and being as he lived only 45 min away, moved in. We got engaged in December after 3.5 years of dating and married only a few days shy of 4 years after we met.

My husband, is the youngest of 6, but all his siblings are half-sibs from his parents' previous marriages. He grew up in rural Florida with hovering, self-employed parents. He likes to socialize and tends to end up leading whatever groups he becomes part of. He is socially aggressive and most people think he's hilarious, or hate him, not much in between. He got his undergrad in music education from a private university, but taught for only 2 years before getting sick of the politics and now sells high-end kitchen appliances. He's paid on commission, and does not make as much money as he would like. He definitely grew up as a big fish in a little pond, and entering the wider world has beat a lot of his self-esteem out. He has told me he has serious feelings of inadequacy.

I am attracted to his alpha male persona. I like that he's more social than I because he get me out and talking, but he can be my back up if I need it. I never feel pressured to be more social than I want and am happy to let him go out by himself, but he often stays back not wanting to go out if I don't want to go out even though I've not even implied that he must do as I do. I need lots of space.

There are a few things that I expect from him though, ***all of which I was explicitly clear on before our engagement and all of which he heartily agreed are good and necessary things.*** I need a clean, organized home or I am unstisfied until it is. When we are both working, I expect to do half of the household upkeep. I expect us to be aware of our current financial situation and discuss purchases. I expect both of us to play by the same rules (Ex: If he goes to Christmas at his parents', I can do the same. If he can go out alone, I can too. If he can hold hands with a female friend, I can do the same with a male friend. ect.) I'm confident enough that I'm flexible with our relationship boundaries, just so long as everyone knows what those are. I hold him to the same high standards that I hold myself to.

2 years ago I began my Master's (I have maybe a semester left assuming I can get enough samples) and my husband was going to come with me, but he got the promotion he'd been trying for a matter of days before I got my acceptance letter. So we decided he would stay at the house we bought in Florida with the dogs and a real job, and financially support me for anything my stipend didn't cover. ***I have received 0 financial support from him including paying for my part of the cell phone bill and health insurance. I'm actually making payments towards our joint credit card to cover his spending, despite making 1/5 of what he does. The house mortgage is also half-way paid for by a roommate/friend in our extra bedroom.***  He wasn't excited, but 100% supported the idea for the long term. Being away from him gave me lots of time to asses our relationship, and I have now come to the conclusion that in our 3.5 years of marriage, I have developed the feeling that my husband is using me to drag him up to the level of basic adult function.

I have tried a variety of ways to address these issues with him, straight-on confrontational, polite requests, a logical discussion of why he would benefit, explanation of my feelings on the subject, offering him the initiative by inquiring what he thinks we should do to solve the problem, stop talking about it and hope it goes away on it's own....

His response to every style is either get mad and shut down or say yes, he's got a plan to work on it, then changes nothing. This has essentially become our entire relationship. It has gotten to the point that I don't want to go visit him. I don't want to talk to him. I don't trust him and feel I can't rely on him. I want an equal partner in life. If I wanted a dependent, I would have reproduced. He knows his behavior has made me consider divorcing him, but even that hasn't changed anything. So you can see where I've run out of ideas.... I think fondly upon the times when he had as much drive as I do, when we weren't drowning in debt because he won't stop spending more money than he makes on frivolous things, when I could trust him to be faithful, when everything that left his lips wasn't negative.

I've tried supporting him verbally, emotionally, physically, socially... I'm out of ideas and dread interacting with him because I know I will just be unhappy afterwards. My mood naturally is perhaps a little higher than most people. When something goes wrong, I freak out for a second, then view it as a challenge. When I moved away to Texas, I realized that my mood was much lower than it used to be, but once I was not in constant contact with his negativity, I returned to my old self and am much happier now.

What I need to figure out is where I draw the line. I'm seeing very little effort from my husband, and have consequently stopped putting in effort myself. I can't work out if it's better to cut ties now while I'm living away, or redouble my efforts to make this work. If I do the latter, I don't think he will match me, and that makes me sad because I want him to, but I can't do it for him.

I have been trying to get a job at a production company, management firm, or agency for a while. I have years of experience in film/TV on set (PA, AP, Segment Producer) and really want to break into more development or Lit. I have gotten some final interviews with boutique to Big 4 agencies and so far every single one has personally emailed or called saying they liked me but felt ""they had to go with someone with just a little more experience working in the office"". Which becomes that cycle of need the experience to get the job, need a job to get experience!

Some of my ideas include:

* Internship (Problem: Graduated; some postings say these don't count)
* Temp (Signed up with Apple One)
* Just bust my ass to network my way in at new events (WGA, PGA, panels)
* Volunteer for known film festival committees in more volume heavy roles

But I didn't know if people had more ideas? My college alumni network unfortunately only cares about football and 95% of the people I've worked with only can help hook me up with more reality set jobs. Really would appreciate any ideas or networking events I should try!

5jsa83,6,2016-12-22,How much student loan should I take out?,gomavz41,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jsa83/how_much_student_loan_should_i_take_out/,"Hello PF, I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate and I am looking to get a loan to pay for the rest of my education.

Background: Started freshman year at large state school as engineering major, parents were paying. I had a rough year adjusting to college life (got a 3.6 GPA which is horrible for Asian parents), so my parents made me transfer to local state school in my town. Switched to CS, spent the first semester going to school from home. Since then I realized living with my parents commuting to school is destroying my sanity. Parents said I could move out if I pay for school myself, so I decided that it is worth it to take out student loans. Currently I am trying to decide how much to take out for just this coming semester. 

Numbers (by Semester):

Tuition: 6500

Apartment: 2500

Scholarship: 2500 (don't know when I will receive this)

Expenses (food etc): 2000 (I think I should be able to get by with that much for all expenses)

Income: I currently have a part time job making about 1000 per semester, but I won't have a car after I move out, so this is not a guarantee that I will be able to work this job.

Savings: 200

After this semester I have another one more year in school before I graduate, so I have another 2 semesters of loans to take out. I have an internship lined up for this summer that will pay around 6k post tax to help me out.

How much loan should I be taking out. Doing the math says I should take out 7500 but I have no idea what kind of expenses I will run into living on my own. Also, is this a good decision to be making. I can still stay with my parents and graduate debt free, but living with them is driving me crazy. I guess that is more of a personal question but I am still torn on whether or not to do this."

5jtl1l,1,2016-12-22,Raising children with Ngrandparents,mooser0956,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5jtl1l/raising_children_with_ngrandparents/,"First time commenter, but I grew up with a nfather and enabling mother. Where to start?

In high school, I thought something was wrong with me. I'm the oldest of four, but I was the one getting into a shouting match with my father multiple times a week and grounded for months on end. Why was I the only one who couldn't get along with my parents? Years later, I would find out that my Ndad was threatening and pitting my siblings against me in the shadows. He would say, ""your sister has done blah blah blah, why can't you do as much as she has?"" He once told my youngest brother that my brother was a mistake and my Ndad regretted having him. In light of all this information, I have been able to repair relationships with 2 of my siblings. The last sibling has completely relinquished control to my Ndad and is very resentful toward me. We have absolutely no relationship.

My Ndad is obsessed with status and money. He is under the belief that his offspring cannot make adult decisions and he does everything in his power to take on that role. In college, I was medical school bound. At the time, I was getting involved in research and I really enjoyed it. I had decided to apply for MD/PhD programs instead of MD. I had learned to make decisions prior to telling my Nfather because, frankly, he's a moron. Case in point, I told him I was changing my career path and his reaction was: ""What? It sounds like you're trying to take the easy way out. I think you should stick to 'the plan.'"" It didn't matter how many times I tried to explain what the program was, he would not hear it. Finally I told him to fucking wikipedia it. Next thing I knew, my parents were posting something in the newspaper about this ""accomplishment."" The news article was a word-for-word plagiarism from wikipedia.

The year continued with him trying to control my decisions. I progressively stopped calling and coming home to see them. My last year in undergrad, we got into an argument that 'broke the camel's back'. In retrospect, I admit it wasn't my argument to have, but, at the time, I thought I was standing up for a girl who had no preparation to have an argument with my Nfather. My (now estranged) brother had been dating a girl for 3-ish months. Earlier that day, she had told me that she wanted to do a summer internship in the town where she was going to college. It was a great opportunity, which she would receive a stipend (unusual for the area) and get great experience. Fast forward to evening, I could hear my Nfather and brother in the kitchen. My Nfather was saying: ""Look at how much better you're doing than your high school friends. You're in college and what are they doing?"" It went on like that for about 20 minutes, then they walked into the living room. At that time, they (my brother and Nfather) started to discuss my brother's girlfriend's (Katie's) future. (For a little background, my Nfather expects women to sit quietly, as they are the weaker sex. He enjoyed using fear tactics to control me as an adolescent. You shouldn't go to that college because you'll get raped in that huge city. Don't stay out late because you'll get raped. You're never going to find a man that will put up with your attitude. You better watch your mouth, or you'll get it punched some day.) Anyway, they were discussing her future with the expectation that she sit there and be quiet. Unfortunately for them, I was also sitting in the room. Without bringing this girl into the argument, I tried to argue for the internship. They didn't want to do it because my brother (and by association, Katie) wanted to live at my parents' house that summer and work at a local restaurant. I argued it was a great opportunity for when she applied for graduate school in the following year. I tried to emphasize how rare it was to get a paid internship in this part of the country. My Ndad has a tactic when you get into an argument with him. In the start, he's completely against you. In the middle, he tries to ""friend"" you and make him believe you might have something. In the end, he's again against you. It's the strangest thing, but it's part of his manipulation. In addition, he does something that really boils my blood. He went to college for four-ish years, but didn't complete the requirements to gain a bachelors. Regardless, he tells everyone he has a bachelors and then tried to use that as justification for his argument against the internship. Needless to say, my brother and Nfather were screaming at me and I was screaming back at them. My husband had been napping in the room and we were so loud, it woke him up. He looked at me and said: ""you ready?"" ""Yep."" We picked up our things and left. I felt so angry and embarrassed that I had let them get under my skin.

Every couple weeks, my mom would call and tell me how bad I'm hurting my dad. You know, he ""loves you kids more than anything."" You need to ""love him because he's the only father you'll ever have."" She would then tell me how bad she had it with her father and that I have it easy. You need to ""accept him for the person he is because he's never going to change."" He tells you what to do because ""he only wants the best for you kids."" I told her that he hasn't earned my respect and I see no reason to communicate with him. I told her that my husband and I never yell at each other and I hated going to her house because I always felt that I had to defend myself. I told her that I hate visiting my hometown because I dreaded going to their home. It fell on deaf ears because this pattern continued for about a year.

Three or four months after the argument, my (now estranged) brother called me out of the blue. As a precursor to our relationship, he's always had a tough time fitting in when in high school and college. He flunked out of three colleges before finally landing on his feet. In the phone call, he wanted to make sure I knew how immature I was being by not visiting or talking to my dad. The conversation sounded oddly familiar to my mother's rhetoric, if not more vengeful. I recorded the conversation (it's legal in my state, I checked. I say this because my brother and Nfather are sue happy and I needed to cover my bases), so I have more details for this one.

- ""You hold grudges against everyone. You're tearing this family apart.""
- ""You shouldn't tell the other siblings that Nfather is a horrible role model and that they should not love Nfather (I never said this) and that they should come to your side. Don't tell me there are not sides, there are sides.""
- ""Dad only has your best interest in mind.""
- ""It's not that we're (estranged brother and Nfather) are trying to make decisions for them (other siblings), we see what's the best outcome for their future.""
- ""If you're so certain about what you're going to do and you're not looking for anyone's opinion, why are you letting something he says get to you? Are you so desperate for his approval every step of the way?"" -- Which I responded with: ""The fact that you would say that shows that you know nothing about me.""
- ""You were always out on the fast track, you were always hanging out with the cool kids.""
- ""You have got to get over some things. I'm not the one that is refusing to talk/see my family. It obvious that this is what dad is dealing with.""
- ""I don’t know why you think you're entitled to judge people and why you're being so petty. I didn’t do a damn thing to you, yet here I am reaching out to you when you have a problem. I don’t know what it is, but you need to get over it. This isn’t right. What you’re doing is not right. This is common logic, I know you're smarter than this.""

For the past two years, I've managed to avoid going to my parents' house. Every couple of weeks, I will speak with my mom. I haven't spoken to my dad on the phone in a year and a half and it's been at least two years since speaking to my brother. I saw my Nfather for the first time six months ago when I met him and my mom for dinner in a public place.

Now for my dilemma: I'm six weeks pregnant. My mom has been talking about having grandkids since I was 17, when my now husband and I first started dating. A strong part of me wants them to never see my kids, but another part of me thinks it's not fair to my kids. My husband and I have decided to type, email and give them a hard copy of ""rules and regulations"" they must follow. We have a short list started:

1. You will never lay a hand on my children in any form of punishment. -- Reason: when I was a kid, they used to leave bruises up and down my legs from using the belt/fly swatter/wooden spoon.
2. You will never be with my children in an unsupervised setting (without me or husband).
3. You will never raise your voice in front of my child.
4. If you choose to visit our home, you will stay at a hotel or in your camper at a camp ground. -- Reason: before the big argument, husband and I had moved into a new home and offered to let them come visit (it's a 3 hr drive). They always made up an excuse why they couldn't visit. Post-argument, they asked multiple times to come visit. We need them to stay somewhere other than our home, so when we need to ask them to leave, they have somewhere to go.

In addition to this list, we are in the process of making a will to make sure my parents or estranged brother will never, ever gain custody of my children in case of an emergency.

Thoughts or advice? If they ""break"" our rules, I suppose we leave and that's the end of it. We see them twice a year, maybe it's enough for our situation? Outside of that, I don't know how to show them I'm serious and there's zero negotiation. I would really appreciate any input.

5jtl9m,1,2016-12-22,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5jtl9m/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

The company that I work at there is about 7 or 8 guys (programmers) and a girl (who takes care of operations). There was a previous girl that did the operations who is a friend of mine. And this friend of mine went to the happy hour as she has a good relationship with people from the office. The girl that currently work with us has a kid and didn't go.

Just to be clear, I never had anything with this friend of mine, we worked together in another company and she recommended for this job. We never even considered having anything romantic (or sexual).

On the way back home I got a cab and picked up my girlfriend and we went home. I was a bit drunk, but she says she asked me who was there and I mentioned that even the new intern went and it was very nice. (obs.: I left really early because my GF send me a msg asking if it would still take some time for me to leave, when I got that message I left because there is some history of fights and I try to avoid it.)

In the happy hour a picture was taken, and this friend posted on facebook with the text ""me and my guys"". After a month or so my girlfriend saw this picture and got crazy. She says that I should have told her that this friend was there. We had a fight, this was not the first time that a situation like this happens.
  
I really don't understand my GF behavior, she just want to be informed if any female friend of mine was there. I feel that she doesn't trust me, and keep asking if she thinks that I cheated (which I never did) on her or something like that. It was not the first time that I didn't mention a female friend, sometimes I forget because I feel that is not important to me, a friend was there and that was it, it's just like she is one of the guys. I feel that I have to keep reporting to her every contact that I make with any female friend. She says that she want's to feel secure with me and that's the reason that she want's to know those kind of things.

I feel that I can't relax around my girlfriend and that, if I forget anything there will be a fight, so I keep nervous sometimes because I'm afraid to forget to tell her everything. Am I being to paranoid about letting my GF know everything? Or she is insecure?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: If I go to an event and don't tell her about the presence of a female friend, she fights with me"

2. Rad-hard. I would like a chip that is NOT rad hard to start off. But I need it to be easy to upgrade to a chip that is later on. 

3. Ethernet. I'm thinking I will blast the videos out on UDP, but if you have any better suggestions, please let me know. I'm constrained to a 4 conductor cable, so i was thinking PoE. Is this feasible? How much data can I push over 40 feet of 4 conductor Ethernet cable? Is there a better option for this?

I appreciate any guidance you guys can give me here. I prefer Xilinx since I have a little experience in Vivado. My university is funding the project, so money is not a huge object. 

Finally, if you have any thoughts on camera selection, please let me know! I've built a camera interface for an internship a few years ago, but this is the first time I've lead a team on a project like this. "

19 years old. So I've been lurking for a little more than a year now and am seeing definite improvement. Been lifting for almost 2 years, steadily improving my wardrobe, read the sidebar, most of the recommended books (48 Laws, No More Mr Nice Guy, Models, How to Win Friends...etc) and slowly but surely becoming less shy around women. Studying engineering, started doing martial arts, play guitar/sing in a band, and am even experimenting in some small business ventures and graphic design.

When I look at all this compared to even a year ago, it looks pretty  promising. I have fun with it and try to challenge myself.

And yet, one thing I still struggle with is self-worth and recognising my value, so to speak. 

I noticed this recently at work, when talking to coworkers. I work as an intern at an engineering firm, so most of them are older than me. Sometimes after ending a convo, I'll feel this sense of loneliness I can't explain and get self conscious about talking to others. Just today I was chit chatting with a fairly attractive coworker (not hitting on her, she's married and much older than me) and felt lonely afterwards for a while. Yet, at other times, I can converse without problems, crack jokes and talk to anybody. 

Another thing is, I do have some good friends, some still since grade school that I hang out with. Thing is, I'll sometimes catch myself comparing myself to them and belittling myself. While I keep reminding myself against it, I also still find myself trying to please others, and I think this comes from a low sense of self worth.

A few months ago, a fellow RPer figured I was coming off as a Nice Guy because of this, and he was spot on in my opinion. 

Now, while I have measurable proof that I'm improving, I still can't seem to find confidence in my abilities, and still sometimes consider others as better/more important than me.

What are your thoughts on this? How do I up my confidence, even when logically, I feel like I should see myself in a better light? I'm really struggling to get to the bottom of this and quite frankly, it's pissing me off.

Thanks in advance, bros

5jud4d,2,2016-12-22,Trying to find out where I went wrong on a kiss rejection. Also did I handle the fallout correctly?,SearchForAns,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/5jud4d/trying_to_find_out_where_i_went_wrong_on_a_kiss/,"So last night I invited an intern over at my place, we ended up cuddling on my couch watching Netflix.  I had my arms wrapped around her, her head was on my chest and we would be playing with each other's hands and  I would rub my hands on her waist and the side of her hips. 20 minutes after we started cuddling, I started thinking about kissing her, as I read before, if you start thinking about kissing her, you should have already done so.  So I went for it, then she backed off and said.
"" I don't want you to have the wrong idea, I'm not like that, I have a boyfriend (she does), and I am happy with him and you have a gf.  Arent you happy with her?""  I shrugged, keeping calm and said ""Well sorry to make you uncomfortable, I find you attractive and I was just expressing how feel I feel and me and my gf are good.""

Then she says, ""I think I should go,  I don't want you getting the wrong idea.""

I said, ""if you feel that way cool, sorry you feel uncomfortable"".  We hug and off she goes.  I felt really, excited because after 6 years of being in an LTR (semi-long distance, gf lives an hour a way) I made it that far and I wasn't afraid to go for it when I felt it.  But of course, this was my first rejection in a long time so I had periods when I felt down.
2 hours later I sent her a text saying, ""Sorry I made you feel uncomfortable.  I enjoyed my time with you and I was hoping we can keep this just between us, but at the same time I understand your discomfort.  Have a good night.""

She responds, "" yeah definitely.  you too.""

So some backstory, I first met her 8 months ago when she started working at my company, I saw some IOI's, she would always notice when my fly was undone, when we hung out in groups on weekends, she would hang off my arm.  When we would talk she would try and extend the convo but I wanted to move on to the next thing.  So eventually I decided to ask her over and see what happens.  

I know you would be questioning why I decided to go after another girl despite being in an LTR, well I know this is shameless, but I felt like being out of the game so long, I just wanted to see how I would do, if my skills were intact and she grew on me.  

Anyways, I wanna see your guys view on the situation.  How to handle the resistance she put up and any other perspectives you guys want to share.

Thanks."

Let me introduce myself - I'm 19, female, 5'5 and currently 175lbs. My goal weight is 120lbs. I would've put that in the title but I figured it was long enough already! I'm new around here, but I know my way around the place - I've been lurking on this subreddit for about two years now, because it was this little haven of the internet which inspired me to lose weight at the start of 2014. Now, with this year coming to a close, I figured it was time to leap in myself. I'm hoping some of your courage and dedication will rub off on me for 2017! :) Below, I've written out my story up until this point. It might not be a riveting read, but it should be cathartic to get my thoughts down on a page and be completely honest with myself, so I apologise if this post becomes a little self-indulgent on its winding path to the present day. **If you're not up for a hearty tale of woe, then I just wanted to say hi, and I welcome any tips you might have for fall-off-the-wagoners like me!**  



----- 



As I mentioned, I started losing weight in April 2014, right after Easter. I was 200lbs, 17 years old, and unhappier than I'd ever been. I've always been chubby - I was 7 years old when I was first called 'fat', and I remember agreeing with my bully - but it had reached the point of being unbearable. I binged on chocolate every day at college to soothe my discomfort there (itself a product of being overweight). I blushed at theme parks as I struggled to fit into rollercoaster seats. My least favourite place in the world was the changing room of a women's clothes shop, especially in those shops where the music plays really loud and all the shop assistants are sleek and slender. Late one night, after polishing off a whole Easter egg and feeling like I'd hit rock bottom, I burst into my parents' bedroom and announced that I couldn't go on this way: I'd heard (from you guys) about an app called MyFitnessPal which would change my relationship with food, and from that moment on, I would use it religiously until the day I died, forever and ever, amen.  



And it worked. For the first few months, I was extremely diligent with every bite of food I put into my mouth, and I lost weight pretty quickly. Even when I was away at summer school or invited to parties with my friends, I made sure to count everything. I'd tried diets before - my parents were aware of my weight issues and had tried to sign me up to WeightWatchers or enrol me at the local gym, although they'd never quite had my full consent, given that I was reluctant to acknowledge I had a problem in the first place. MFP was the only one that seemed to work. Maybe it was the fact that I was finally losing weight for myself, or the fact I'd hit rock bottom so the only possible direction was up... hey, so long as it was effective, I wasn't going to start asking why. My progress was slow but consistent, and by the summer, I'd gone down a dress size. By the winter, I'd dropped another size, and my whole life just felt *better*. My skin was clearer, my school work had improved, and I cared less about what other people thought of me because I had an inner reserve of strength which I drew from my success in weight loss. Every NSV pumped up my ego a little bit more as I basked in the comments of people who were beginning to notice.  



It wasn't an easy winter - I was applying for universities, and there were moments when I thought I'd thrown my future away by messing up an interview. Still, I drew upon my commitment to MFP as testament to my success in *something*. In January, I found out that I'd got into my dream university, and this just added more fuel to my fire. I could look around the hallways of my cold, unfriendly college and relish the fact that I'd soon be headed out of there to a better place. And when I got there, well, I wouldn't be *this* girl any more, oh no - I was determined that the friends I'd meet at uni ought not to see me as overweight. Exam stress slowed down my progress but I never stopped, and by the start of the summer, I'd dropped another size.  



I reached the peak of my physical fitness in the summer of 2015. I completed Couch25k and found I could suddenly run 5k with relative ease (something my old school PE teachers would never have imagined!). I also went to the gym 5-6 times a week and worked harder than I ever had before, burning upwards of 400 calories a day (on top of the calories already burned from running). I'd been a gym member since 2013, never losing weight with it until I started going in conjunction with my diet plan, but I had always gone casually about 3 times a week until then. Every early morning bus trip to the gym seemed like another stepping stone to my independence; I dropped one more dress size, got a bit more toned, and took up an internship which I wouldn't have had the confidence to go for before I'd lost weight. At last, clothing stores weren't my enemy - in fact, they were my new best friend! For the first time in my life, I brought dresses and skirts as the running made me proud of my legs and the distance they could carry me. The day before I left for university, I stepped on the scales and found that I'd hit 130lbs.  



I never felt like I was skinny - I always wanted to go further with the weight loss and still considered myself to be chubby. I know that I look back on that time now as my peak of fitness, but it didn't feel that way at the time, which is something I ought to remember now. Still, when I went on holiday that summer with my family and wore my new clothes, I felt different. I finally felt confident in myself, not just because of my new appearance but because of the fortitude I seemed to have developed through my commitment to MFP over the previous year-and-a-half. I'd heard of the Freshman 15 but I was determined to beat it. I mean, I'd already lost all this weight, so I was practically a pro, right? I knew all the pitfalls - I'd spent my summer diligently researching nutrition and I wasn't about to fall into that trap!  



For the first term, I did avoid those 15 pounds, even though I wasn't using MFP. I had decided to suspend it for the first term because I was happy with the point I'd reached (though I still wanted to go further once I'd settled in to uni) and I wanted to see if I could live without it. Even though I felt like I gorged on biscuits and was eating a lot more than I had done over the summer, I came home after an amazing term and found that I was exactly the same weight as when I left. Brilliant! I felt assured that my rocky relationship with food had finally been fixed, praised the MFP gods once more, and decided to cut down my calories again so I could lose those last 10 pounds before reaching goal weight.  



Christmas 2015 was when it all started to crumble. My first term had been incredible but I hadn't really engaged in all the activities that truly incur the Freshman 15 - I was still too timid to drink alcohol, go out with friends or be very reckless at all. On top of that, I'd been hit with a killer workload which, while enjoyable, had led me into the dangerous habit of stress-eating. I'd always been a binge eater (even while on MFP - I'd lament into my diary on the rare nights when I'd experience a binge that I'd thrown all my little victories away), but this was a new level. It wasn't unheard of for me to finish a jumbo pack of biscuits in one sitting when an essay wasn't going my way. Everyone at uni was struggling with the same issues, talking about how the stress drove them to overeating or drinking or drugs or other bad habits, so I took it to be normal. When I went home, though, the stress-eating didn't stop. In fact, it increased. I continued to binge, and binge, and binge, and I felt worse and worse about myself. I would do no exercise for weeks and then suddenly force myself into a full 5k run, which felt good at its end but would leave me sore and binge-prone the next day. It was a dark winter full of overeating and procrastination, and on New Year's Eve, I was horrified to find that I'd put on 5lbs over the Christmas period alone. I vowed to change, to go back to the girl I had been over the summer.  



My New Year's Resolution was a tough 100-day plan. I wanted to change myself completely - I wasn't satisfied with my productivity at uni and I definitely wasn't happy with my eating habits, so the obvious solution was a drastic detox to 'reset' my brain. I carefully divided the calendar into 4 roughly equal quarters. In the first 100 days, I promised to get up at 6am every day, go for a 5k run, stick to MFP, do 6+ hours of work, read, cut down on technology use, and go cold turkey on a few other bad habits. It wasn't meant to be easy or permanent; I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it for 3 months or so.  



Dear reader, I. Went. Mental. I more or less stuck to the plan for the first two months of 2016 and then went *completely* off the rails. It was the 6am runs that truly killed me - I've never been so bone-tired, so weary and miserable and pained, as when I dragged myself out of bed on those freezing January mornings and forced myself on to the paved streets of my city. After a month, I started to get aches in my legs from running on pavement without a day's rest, but I ignored them. As you would expect, this stupidity led to me getting a stress fracture at the top of my leg and a similar injury to my knees. At the same time as I was hobbling around uni from this daily assault on my legs, my friends were noticing my tiredness and dogged commitment to my mysterious 'plan', and they started to tell me gently that I should probably take it easy. Much like the pains in my legs, I brushed them off as insignificant concerns that would pass with time, not realising the truth that they were trying to get through to me. My uni work improved because I was committing more time to it - but when I was up every day at 6am and spending all the day working, I was left with very little social time, and it became an incredibly lonely period. I would hear my friends laughing outside as I was headed to bed at 10pm for my 6am start and tried to tell myself that these 100 days would pay off in the end. They didn't - I ditched my 100-day plan at around day 60 because I had to stop, or else my stress fracture would get more serious and I would permanently damage my legs. On top of all that, the stress of my work meant that I was still binge eating throughout this period, so I didn't lose any weight (though I did fulfil my other goal for the start of 2016, which was better work).  



Once I'd been told that I couldn't exercise for the rest of the term, I decided to return to plain ol' MFP - except its magic seemed to work no longer. I just couldn't stick to it; it seemed like my will power had just disappeared, or like the dedication which had lasted me since April 2014 had finally withered away. My second term was a lot more emotionally stressful, and I resorted to my old ways of eating my feelings, even though I had sworn when I was losing weight that I'd never go back. I also discovered alcohol. The newfound delights of wine, combined with the end of the 6am starts, meant my social life flourished - but I just hated myself more and more. I felt like I was losing the girl who I had come to be in the summer of 2015, the one who'd got the bus to the gym every day and fit into the slinky clothes I'd once envied on shop window mannequins. The weight piled on.  



Thus was the story at Easter, and then in my third term, and then in the summer, and then in the first term of my second year... 2016 has basically been one long binge (and then one long regret-fuelled promise to be better next time, only to break that promise as soon as I see another cake). I kept looking for some kind of sign from the universe that it was time to put away the binges and go back to MFP once and for all. I felt ashamed of my truly monstrous eating patterns - I would eat dinner ridiculously early just because I wanted it, and then might up eating one or two *more* dinners that evening for no real reason other than it tasted good or I wanted to avoid doing work. Just like Kylie Kardashian promised, 2016 has been the year of realising things, except I've realised some things about myself that I kind of wish I'd never known. I've discovered the depths of my gluttony and, aside from trying to lose weight, I've discovered all new kinds of emotional stress. It hasn't been a vintage year. Great things have happened, of course, but I think I'll struggle to see this year as anything else except truly rock bottom.  



So, this is where you come in, LoseIt. I've browsed you for years now but if I'm going to make a brand new start of this and truly be *honest* about this year's mistakes, then I want to be more than just an onlooker. I promise I won't bombard you with essays in every post! ;) I just feel like I need something bigger than myself to make me stick to these promises once and for all, because I've put on the weight I said I'd never put back on and I feel worse and worse about it. If you guys will hold me accountable, then I want to be here to support everyone too and to offer what little guidance I can. This is the rollercoaster that finally brought me to membership of this lovely subreddit; here's to hoping that with your help, I can make the rest of this ride a successful one! (And hey, I can finish off 2016 with 8 days of MFP. That's better than nothing!) If you've made it this far, you're a trooper - I hope to see you around soon!

School is costing me a negligible amount, and I have about $6000 from high school graduation gifts+previous work+etc in savings right now. 

I have another year and a half at the community college before transferring to a university in fall 2018, at which point I plan to use my available savings to cut down on the amount I take out in unsubsidized loans. 

I have a job ~$300 a week which, after expenses and tithe, gets me about $150 to work with, so about ~$600 could be added monthly, plus my financial aid(also after expenses)gets me about $2000 per semester(for three semesters), so $6000 can also be added before I transfer.

--also I'm probably going to get an internship this summer which I get a $6000 stipend at the end(not sure if taxed) but that's not guaranteed so I haven't factored that in yet--

I was wondering if there are any options for me to grow my nest egg beyond lumping it into a savings account for another year as well as the pros and cons of each and how I can get started.

Thanks!"

Basically, I have really ambitious plans to up and move to the Pacific Northwest (namely Northern California or Portland, maaaybe Seattle) and hopefully work in the ""Big Data"" world. I was hoping to get some guidance along the lines of what I can do with my last few months in school and how/where I should begin my job search, maybe even looking over my resume, MAYBE EVEN A.. A MENTOR?? I'd love suggestions for websites, podcasts, anything. Here are some quick facts about my situation...

-I will be a full-time student and working 20hrs/wk for the next two quarters. I'd love to dedicate a lot of time to beefing up my resume, but I'm not sure if I have the time/mental capacity. In addition, I have been having a lot of trouble getting motivated to do well in school.. so there is a chance that I might even have to take a class in the summer. Thus, I need to start looking for job opportunities for June/July or maybe even September.
-My gpa is very shitty so this is the thing that worries me the most... However, I do have a lot of leadership experience and I do have internship experience in the IT field.
-I worked with Splunk at my internship and I was really interested in the whole ~data visualization / business intelligence~ side of things. My dream is to be a part of a team in the social media world... like Spotify or Groupon or something.

Thank you all so much. :)"

I'm just really scared",ThrowAway123789ppp,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5jvkyh/can_someone_relate_even_a_little_im_just_really/,"I'm about a year into being on medication for anxiety and depression. I started off on Lexapro, and while it did help after awhile my doc felt I should try effexor instead. This helped even more, and even though it wasn't perfect I was feeling pretty good. 

I'm not sure when exactly I started going south, but I started to notice I was feeling in a funk right before Thanksgiving when my housemate was away for a week. I thought the funk would pass once she was back but it didn't. Then I was home from college for Thanksgiving and it still didn't pass. It got worse and worse until it reached the point where I was just trying to make it to the end of the semester. 

It was similar and around the same time as last year when it got bad enough I had to go on medication. My housemate started bringing up seasonal affective disorder and pushing therapy, I started missing classes and couldn't keep up with work, but I was just so desperately focused on making it to the end of the semester I didn't even notice until one of my professor pulled me aside because she was so worried about me. 

Thankfully I managed to pull through the semester without fucking my grades too bad, but now that I'm home and have some time to sit and think, I'm scared for the doctors appointment I have soon. I'm scared I'll just get switched to another medication, and it'll be fine for a little while, and then it'll just start all over again, that I'll never really be better. 

I'm afraid my doctor is going to push therapy, but I have no idea how I can keep appointments while being a full time student, not to mention I'll be on internship soon. I can't take a break from school, I know I'd never finish.

I get stuck on worrying about the future, I'm in my senior year of college, I have one more semester to go, but I'm so scared I'm fucking this year up and won't be able to get a job. I tell myself that it's just my anxiety making the future look bleak, but of course anxiety says, no you're really just screwed. I'm just so fucking scared, I don't know what to do."

We had something huge change our life the year before we were going to graduate. Up until this issue, we were doing so well. Both of us were on the distinguished honor roll, both of us had all A's, he nearly had a perfect grade in his Pre-Calc class, but the issue happened right before the end of the school year, so he missed the final. We had our pharmacy internships ready and our senior schedule was identical. Then it happened and changed everything (mentally, educationally, socially, with family, with our jobs now, with our living situation.) and we have absolutely no guidance or help through any of it. It's been a little over a year since that stuff ended, but we are forever feeling it's effects. In fact, he told me last night, fro the first time, that he believes he has been depressed. I will go into detail if you want (which you probably don't), but basically we were screwed over by an idiot authority that took everything from us, which in turn, convinced no one to help us. By the way, none of it was our fault. You might disagree without knowing the whole ordeal, but I promise you it wasn't our faults. 
Anyways, since and during this problem, we've been seeing the number 341 whether it be the time, on a license plate, on a phone number, a score on a game, you name it. When we are listening to music in the car, one of us will unconsciously look at the seconds on the song, and it will be something like 1:43, or 3:41. We started to point this out to each other whenever this happens just because. Sometimes it will have variations such as 143, or 1143. We think that's also the reason why our apartment is apt. 8 (3+4+1). One time, he told me about how he saw 1:43 on a clock (this was when we started to keep track of the number) and said to himself out loud, ""I swear, the next time I look at the clock it will be 3:41."" He was playing Xbox, so don't think he was keeping track of the time, but then he tells me the random moment when he looks at the clock, it was 3:41. Additionally, at the store I work at, I found out my EMPLOYEE NUMBER is 341, so I see it on each receipt I give. 
He's looked it up a long time ago and he believes it has something to do with a thing called angel numbers? I don't know what that is, but I am still not entirely sure what these mean. One time, when he began to study into the Bible and got, he looked up the page in a Bible (page 341). At the top of the page was his name. It was the Book of Isaiah, which is his name, right at the top of the page. Anyways, I would greatly appreciate if anyone could give us meaning insight on this number. I have had a lot of regret, a lot of sadness, and I lot of anger for the past year. I hate it! I have it because I feel like if I could go back in time and change the past, I would prevent ALL OF THIS from happening, we would be HAPPY, he wouldn't have had to go through all he did and we would be GOLDEN! We wouldn't both be depressed, I wouldn't be a burden on his happiness simply because I cannot stop regretting. I wouldn't be always talking about how much I miss that year before the ordeal happened, how happy I was, how I didn't have to worry about a job and college and rent. How I was living at home with my mother, and it was so comfy. I wouldn't be always talking about this and telling him I miss it while, at the same time, I never knew back then what a horrid life he was having at his own house and why he was always at mine. Do you get what I'm saying?? I just need something to hear me out. I need to know what has happened wasn't a bad thing, and something good will come out of it. I need a reason to keep going."

I am looking to get into product management. I absolutely love the intersection of product/engineering/design/users, however, I do not want to solely be a software engineer. My passion is at this intersection of great products. Any advice on 1. How to get into PM 2. How to position myself when applying (since they might be looking for more exp.) Any advice would be much appreciated."
5jzhj6,1,2016-12-23,"Me [20 M] breaking up and going no contact with my GF [19 F] 2 years, I don't know how to break it to her... should I?",Buchananboiz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jzhj6/me_20_m_breaking_up_and_going_no_contact_with_my/,"I really don't know where to start with this but I guess the best point would be why I'm leaving. She's extremely emotionally abusive and controlling of my sleep schedule and free time, above that she is also physically abusive, 3 nights ago she spent 2 hours dragging me by my hair, slapping my face, punching my stomach and groin and so on. It's not the first time she's done that, she hits me alot. She also will cut or threaten to if I ""make her mad"" often, holding that threat over my head and then showing me the scars later.

I don't like what I've become dating her over the last 2 years either, I feel like I've grown bitter and I think we've become co-dependant in the sense that our whole relationship is based around me taking care of her. She is obviously emotionally unstable but I just feel this need at this point to try to be there for her. It's like I'm trapped by her, but I think that's because of the way she's emotionally controlled me over the last few years. She's cost me alot with my work and education and even relationship with my family. She constantly tells me I'm ""mean"" no matter what the situation, anytime we have a calm moment she will suddenly burst out furious over something from months ago or nonsensicle. Alot of times she does that right as I'm leaving to go home and go to bed, even if we've had a fun night.

She's here on DACA and we were going to get married legally on the 5th and she has been insane over this. She basically wants us to move out and me work more (internship plus job plus full time school) so that I can provide everything for her. She's also opposed to me sleeping at my families house after were married legally (I live in a dorm so during the break I stay at my Dad's house). We fight about the wedding now constantly too.

I've been working on her christmas present (a vanity mirror and table decoupaged with pictures of us on it), and I know she's bought mine a day or two ago. But I can't give her that and leave. I know she's going to be emotionally destroyed and leaving that gift would just be a table of scars. But I can't wait till after Christmas because her Birthday is on New Years.... I can't take another night of this. 

I'm leaving this here asking for advice and trying to reafirm wy I need to do this.

 I don't know what I should do. What do I text her. She's going to call me 50 times at least on every social media platform (she does this any time she feels I'm ignoring her)

I'm going to have to explain to my family today too, my mom is waiting for me to come over in half an hour to finish the table and I don't even know what to say to them.
  
  ---   
  TL;DR: Girlfriend is abusive, need to break up with her today and go no contact but I don't know how to break the news to her.

EDIT1: Forgot to add, she has for the last 2 months been strongly insistant that I get her name tattooed on me, I almost went through with it a few weeks back after a 6 hour fight on the subject. oh and when I'm driving she will start beating on me and threatening to jump out of the car, full on opening the door while were on the freeway and then launching into breakdowns where she screams and kicks the dashboard

Edit 2: We've broken up over two dozen times in our relationship, usually getting back together in the same night. She constantly tells me things like ""I don't love you"" or ""you're not the one"" and gets furious when I show any kind of displeasure 

UPDATE: I blocked her on everything. going out to meet a friend of mine tonight, dropping a letter off to her house in  the evening.

Update 2: I left a letter in her mailbox and had a great night hanging out with a friend of mine. Haven't gotten to do that in a long time and it feels really good."
5jzhjv,5,2016-12-23,My [21F] coworker [27M] tried to kiss me last night and now work is uncomfortable,cminusminus42,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5jzhjv/my_21f_coworker_27m_tried_to_kiss_me_last_night/,"Sorry for the rambling post, but this requires a fairly long backstory...

I’ve been interning at where I work for about 8 months. I am grateful every day for the privilege of getting to do something I love and I have gotten very positive reviews of my work from the higher-ups, where a full-time job may be on the table for after I graduate in the spring. I love what I do, but my coworkers have really made the experience amazing. Without giving too much away, the company is a very small IT and tech-based company, so I’m the only female employee, but all the guys are incredible and treat me like one of their own. Because everyone is young, loves to geek out about what we do and hangs out outside of work a lot, I feel like I wouldn’t get this kind of camaraderie working anywhere else. 

Over time, I’ve developed a crush on my coworker Jay [25M]. Jay is an all-around awesome guy and I feel the closest to him out of everyone at the office. He’s incredibly smart, his sense of humor is identical to mine and we text outside work all the time, sometimes with flirtatious undertones. He even gave me a really nice gift a few months ago just because, and I’m still glowing from it. We sit next to each other almost every day at work and his passion for what we do is so apparent and contagious. He was recently promoted and I couldn’t be happier for him. A few days ago, I had decided that if I don’t end up getting a full-time offer, I would ask Jay out closer to/on my last day. Jay lives with a guy named Adam, who also works with us. Like Jay, Adam started out as an intern and was also just promoted. Adam has always been super kind and helpful to me, especially when I was just starting out, and I’ve always considered him my “work-brother”.

My birthday was earlier this week and Adam texted me a few days before saying that we should all go get a drink to celebrate when I was in town. I assumed he meant that Jay and other work people would join as well, so I excitedly agreed. My birthday comes, Jay texts me to wish me a happy birthday, Adam does not. When I get back to work Thursday, I find out that almost everyone (including Jay) is leaving town that day to go home for the holidays, so I figure this drink thing isn’t going to happen. That night Adam texted me asking if I still wanted to get a drink the following day (Friday), even though no one else would be there. I thought it would be rude to say no since I had said yes so enthusiastically before, and I expected it to just be a friendly coworker thing, so I agreed to go with him.

We go get a drink at a bar in town and for the most part had a really good conversation, mostly revolving around work. The only sort of “red flag” that came up was I casually mentioned that Jay had sent me a nice text for my birthday and out of everyone at the company, I probably felt the closest to him, and he had an odd reaction to it. I had always assumed that they were super close since they lived together and they always gave off that vibe whenever we’d hang out. Very shortly after, without getting too much into it, he started bashing Jay and how he felt like he didn’t deserve the promotion he got. This really surprised me, because as I said before, I sit next to Jay and he works harder than anybody. I kind of just ignored it at the time. 

After we finish up at the bar, he follows me to the parking garage, which I thought was odd at the time, but in the moment I figured he was just keeping an eye out for me, since the part of town we were in is known for being a bit unsafe. I go to give him a hug goodbye once we find my car and out of nowhere, *he tries to kiss me*! I kind of stepped back to dodge him because obviously I’m not interested. I was so shocked in the moment, I don’t even remember what I said other than I’ve had things with guys I had working relationships with in the past (not quite coworkers, but similar enough) and I didn’t want to do that again. Obviously that’s a lie, since had it been Jay I would’ve been completely receptive. I know I probably would’ve been better off being truthful, but in the heat of the moment I was so confused, I didn’t know what the right thing to say was. You guys have to understand that he and I were friendly and hang out in groups with other coworkers, but we don’t talk much outside of work, so this whole thing was a total blindside. He said it was okay, and left, and seemed really upset about it. 

So now the dilemma: I went into work today and I couldn’t focus at all. Instead of being excited about going into work like I usually am, I had this horrible feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach all day and I feel like I got nothing accomplished. I saw Adam briefly when he walked in, and I said hi to break the tension, and he seemed like he had no interest in talking to me (which, given the situation, is completely understandable). So now I don’t know what to do. I love my job and the other guys so much and I really don’t want to leave, but I also don’t want to continue to feel this way about work. I’m afraid that if he tells people and word gets out to my bosses, that they’ll decide not to promote me since they’ve already committed to Adam, and they could just as easily find a “drama-free” person to do the job they need. I’m also kind of afraid of it going in the opposite direction, where they might fire Adam if they find out. This post paints him in a bit of a negative light, but out of the context of this situation, he’s a really good guy and I don’t want to ruin his life because of one stupid mistake. 

We have an extended break from work starting today, is this the kind of thing that will get better with time? Should I have known that Adam was expecting this meet-up to be a date? If I don’t get an offer, should I just not bother asking Jay out (even though I really like him), because of the potential drama it might cause with Adam? Also, how’s the best way to handle this if I come back and I still continue to feel uncomfortable/Adam still refuses to talk to me? I know the first reaction might be to tell me to quit, but I’d really rather not do that. In my field, it’s really the gig of a lifetime for someone just starting out, so just leaving really isn’t an option. 

TL;DR: Co-worker who is also roommates with my crush tried to kiss me, now I’m uncomfortable at work. "
5jzj9x,6,2016-12-23,"Graduation is delayed, should I pick up a minor?",Moonagi,KSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/KSU/comments/5jzj9x/graduation_is_delayed_should_i_pick_up_a_minor/,"I'm a senior getting my degree in IT. I was lucky to receive a co-op offer with great pay so I decided to take it. My thought process was that it's better to work in my field plus go to college with a delayed graduation, than to graduate with virtually 0 actual work experience (granted, I was looking for internships to fill that gap but after several interviews with different companies I was offered the co-op)

That being said, should I get a minor or stretch out the rest of my classes for about 3 semesters? Seems silly.

I'm just not sure what to couple my IT degree with. 

Has anyone been in a similar position?"
5jzqsx,25,2016-12-23,"Jess, Rory and Logan as ""troubled youths""",MSoliloquy,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5jzqsx/jess_rory_and_logan_as_troubled_youths/,"When I first watched the show, I wanted to insert myself into the role of Rory Gilmore (even though I never wanted to admit it). In many ways, she's a Mary Sue who is beautiful, constantly lauded and has guys throwing them at her feet. I always pictured myself at a prep school like Chilton and having the opportunity to do stuff like summer leadership internships in Washington. I wasn't really interested in any of her boyfriends, but I especially hated Jess. IRL, there was no way the young me could identify with a character like that, and I couldn't even imagine myself even being friends with a guy who was rude to all my family and friends. 

Now as a professional who has worked with many troubled young people from broken homes, I'm starting to see Jess in a different light. Namely, I'm somewhat impressed that all the trouble he got in consisted of skipping school to work, being sullen, drinking beer and ruining Rory's prom. The amount of attitude, swearing and sometimes outright aggression I've encountered make Jess seem like an angel. Many of the young people are already hardcore drug addicts and felons. They treat people who are genuinely trying to help them like dirt, and there are days where I just can't take the sneering and the wisecracks anymore. Through it all though, I can tell that the vulnerability and fear that drove them into these actions. When I rewatch Gilmore Girls again, I'm somewhat ashamed at my lack of empathy towards a troubled young man who came from a terrible home with a flakey mother and no father figure. I know he's a fictional character, but he reminds me of a lot of the kids I've worked with. I'm glad that he's able to make something of his life and I wish we got to see a bit more of his journey. I just hate that everybody right away dismissed him as ""trouble"", and I wonder how much the town's attitude towards him actually set him back. Season 6 and revival Jess is certainly no saint, but I find his journey inspiring, and I've started to experiment using him to connect to some of the kids I'm working with (to get them to read more basically). 

Vs Rory. I think enough has been said about her entitlement. Intentional or not, I find the show's treatment of her, Logan and Jess's ""acting out"" behavior to be a telling example of injustice and class privilege. Just like Jess, she was not yet equipped to deal with setbacks in a healthy way. In fact, she dealt with Mitchum's criticisms by committing a crime, dropping out of school and being rude to her mother. Her grandparents took care of the legal bills. She could live at her grandparents' mansion, work for the DAR and continue to party with her rich boyfriend. In fact, Logan, who's from an even more privileged background, did not seem to get in trouble for what he did at all. Can you imagine if somebody like Jess did what they did? First of all, I don't think he'd have anyone sitting him down and reassuring him that everything would be alright. I think Luke would try his best, but ultimately would be unable to afford a good lawyer. (Also, I think Luke would want him to face the consequences of his actions because he's a better parent than Lorelai, but that's beside the point.)

I know Jess has lots of fans, but as a person working with troubled youths, I find the lack of empathy towards young Jess and the tolerance for the much worse behavior from Logan and Rory to be quite disheartening. "

5k05sg,15,2016-12-23,My line-manager (26F) accused me (24F) of having sex in our office and now I feel really upset and uncomfortable at work. Should I complain?,dontknow3211,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5k05sg/my_linemanager_26f_accused_me_24f_of_having_sex/,"My co-worker/line manager for some reason has always had it in for me since I started working with her 1 1/2 years ago. However, over the last few months we've been getting on much better, and I've really started to love my job and almost look forward to coming in on a Monday morning.

We had a Christmas night out for all people that work in our building at a bar within the building. I had been a bit nervous all evening as a guy I had been dating over the summer was going to be there and I was worried it was going to be awkward as I hadn't seen him for so long. Me and her and a few others were drinking together as friends and thinking of how I would approach him etc.

We all ended up getting very drunk and I ended up just biting the bullet and talking to my ex. It was such a busy bar as it was the last night of the work 'term' I guess so I took him up to the office that I share with my co worker so we could talk about things in private. We ended up being gone for over an hour and I admit we ended up making out. I came back down and obviously it was a bit obvious something had happened as we were both being a bit coy and giggly. However nothing else happened and I spent the rest of the night with the others.

Fast forward to a few days later and it was the first time I'd seen the CW properly since that night. She told me she was really upset with me so I asked why. She then proceeded to start having a go at me, saying I was 'absolutely disgusting' and she was so disappointed in me for what I did. I said I was sorry for seeing the ex in the office, but that I just wanted some privacy to talk as the bar was so busy. She goes on to say things like 'don't treat me like a fucking idiot, I wasn't born yesterday. You are disgusting'. She was accusing me of having sex in there, which I denied because one it didn't happen, two, I'm really not that kind of person. She was hurling insults at me and how awful I am, how gross I am, how I loved 'rubbing things in her face' and it really upset me.

I was even more upset as I mentioned that our old intern used to boast that he used to take his girlfriend up there and have sex on each of our desks and she used to say 'ewww' but laugh about that, admitting everyone does it at some point, so I didn't think it was fair she was giving me the total opposite reaction. She then said things like 'oh if he jumped off the bridge would you do the same?' and 'Is that a response an adult would give? You're so fucking childish'.

In the end I said I was sorry if she was offended by anything that I did and I shouldn't have taken someone into our office, and she can think what she likes of me but it wasn't true and wasn't fair to say. She just ignored me after that and pretended in front of other people like nothing had happened.

Anyway I haven't seen her for a while now but it's bothering me so much that she could speak to me that way. Especially as the amount of times I have come back after a weekend to the office and my keyboard is sticky and there are wine glasses everywhere and mess everywhere from her having people in there, but I never say anything - let alone throw insults at her about her private life.

Am I wrong? Should I say anything? I was going to leave it as she is leaving next month so I thought there was no point, but she has really upset me and I think the whole thing is really out of order and made me feel so uncomfortable at work now. I feel like I am at school again!


**tl;dr**: Co-worker accused me of having sex in our office and called me all sorts. She's leaving soon but I feel really upset about what she's said. Should I say something?"
5k0rx7,9,2016-12-23,Need to get this out somewhere,ladysomwhere967,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5k0rx7/need_to_get_this_out_somewhere/,"More than anything I need to get this out where others who have experienced similar things can give some advice or insight.

When I was young I don't remember much that felt off or messed up within my family dynamic.  I grew up with my mom, dad and twin sister.  It was in high school when shit really hit the fan.

My Nmom is very critical and controlling of my dad.  She would always be subtly cutting him down and would make him question his judgement by chastising him when he wouldn't ""do the laundry right"", or wash the dishes well enough by hand, or would forget something/be oblivious.  Of course, my mom could do no wrong and no one was happy if she wasn't happy.  My dad would never stand up for himself or us.

At the time, just entering high school I was a companionate and hard working kid.  I saw how my mom would complain about how difficult it was to run the household without enough help from my dad when he at the time was working a lot more than 40 hour weeks.  And so I would pitch in with chores more than my dad and sister.

Another thing, as long as I can remember my mom has been insecure about her body.  She would make comments about how other women looked that she was envious of, she would always notice when someone lost or gained weight, and she would never tell me that I or my sister were beautiful, but would tell my aunt how beautiful her daughter was (an amazing gymnast).

So by the time I reached the end of high school I had an eating disorder.  I thought that I needed to punish myself and change myself to be ultimately what my mother admired.  I remember that when I was reaching my smallest my mom would make remarks about so many things that I would wear, and how I should change, it was unflattering, etc.  I never knew what to expect when I would wake up in the morning and walk into the kitchen. 

I also got a boyfriend earlier than my parents ever wanted while my sister stayed single.  And for that they suddenly started restricting everything I would do.  I would have to pay for gas to drive to see my boyfriend.  I would do so many chores before leaving the house (laundry, take care of dogs, wash dishes, clear out the dishwasher, take out garbage) and make sure I had practiced my instruments/done extra schoolwork.  My sister wasn't held to any of these standards and my mom would praise her so much while talking poorly of me to my sister behind my back.

So naturally I got amazing at getting chores done quickly and efficiently because my social life depended on it. I continued this cycle of trying to please my parents while secretly dealing with my eating disorder and trying to graduate from school.

One time I tried to bring up my food restriction to my mom and she told me that she did that in college until her dad told her to stop.  That was the end of the conversation.

I was young and didn't realize that when you have a messed up family dynamic you are likely to attract that in your personal relationships because that's the type of love familiar to you.  And so my relationship with my boyfriend slowly became all about him and less about my needs.  I was slowly being drained by everyone close to me and thought my purpose was to make everyone around me happy first.

So after high school I knew I had to get out.  I learned how to code and got an internship.  I moved into and apartment I shared with my sister and basically supported both of us for a year working 50+ hours a week until I had the skills to land a full time position at a different company.  I kept low contact with my parents and was just sliding by.

If you didn't know working in tech as a woman is also very difficult.  There aren't many women engineers out there.  Which means I was pretty isolated working with a bunch of men at least 10 years older than me.  I've also experienced a fair amount of sexual harassment having been in the industry for only 2 years.  And the tech industry idolizes people who work themselves to death.

I've also served on the board of two organizations, one of which the head decided to constantly pick on me for my age and two of the men were sexist.  I ended up resigning once I realized my self worth was greater than letting those salty assholes tear me down.

I now live on my own and support myself.  I just turned 20 and I'm working full time at a job that also provides health insurance so that my parents can't guilt trip me with any health expenses.  I'm slowly working on costing them nothing.

I love my sister so much.  She has a much better relationship with my parents and doesn't quite understand why I have unshakable resentment toward them sometimes.  In the past she would defend my parents in their manipulative ways.  She has certainly also taken advantage of me.  I find it hard to forget that for a year I did my parents' job of putting a roof over her head and providing some of her meals when I was 18 and she was the same age as me.  That being said the relationship with her now is much healthier and she is very responsible and on top of her shit.

All of the chronic stress has finally caught up with me and I've started cutting everyone out of my life that is draining.  I've stopped doing most volunteer work for now.  I'm realizing that the best thing I can do right now is take amazing care of myself and I am looking forward to 2017 as a year where I am strong and don't overextend myself for the needs of other people.

Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy and I forget everything that I've been through.  Sometimes I feel guilty for having nice things or for little things my parents have provided for me that parents are supposed to provide.  I still attract men who take advantage of me if I let them.  I have trust issues.  

Hoping that people here will relate and have advice for living your own life after narcissistic abuse.

Happy Holidays everyone!"
5k17cx,9,2016-12-23,I finally had THE conversation with my parents...and things turned out okay.,cosmicwhalenoises,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5k17cx/i_finally_had_the_conversation_with_my_parentsand/,"Hello ladies of /r/TwoXChromosomes...I've been a long time lurker, and I've considered posting about this for a long time to get some advice. But tonight everything came to an explosive head. 

&amp;nbsp;

For the past 3 years, I've been dating a wonderful guy, we'll call him Tom. We went to the same college together, though he graduated last year and I'm about to graduate this coming May. We've had the talk about what we want to do after college, about where we want to end up down the road... and eventually we came to the decision that we're very serious about one another. Though we're not rushing into marriage, we've definitely talked about it, and when we're ready, it'll happen. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, my parents didn't feel the same way. Or at least, I thought they didn't. Whenever I would try to talk about Tom, my parents would clam up, as if they just didn't want to hear it. They never asked me about him, or about my relationship status, so I just assumed they didn't approve, or didn't care. I go to college a few states away, so they only had the opportunity to mean Tom once. I invited him to come stay for a couple of days over the summer when we had just started dating, and that was where things went wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

When Tom came to stay, we were still in the lovey-dovey stage of our relationship. He had previously been in a bad relationship, so he was a little clingy at first. Holding my hand, putting his arm around me, being close all the time... that sort of stuff. One night when we were watching TV with my family, he put his arm around my shoulder and his hand rested on my breast. Though not intentional, my mom saw it, and as I would later learn, thought that he was disrespecting her and my dad by touching me inappropriately in their home. During that same couple of days, I went downstairs to watch TV with Tom at night and we both fell asleep on the couch. I'll never forget waking up to the Kardashians on TV and my mom yelling at me to get upstairs before my father found me. I knew that that must of looked bad to my parents, but it was a completely innocent mistake. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fast-forward to today. My parents, sister and I had gone out to dinner. We had a couple of drinks, ate some delicious food, and even debated a little bit about politics... but eventually they asked me if I had any plans for after graduation. Now, for a little background, I have always wanted to work for a company in Austin, TX. Tom is also from Texas, but further south than Austin. My parents know where Tom is from. So when I said that I was considering moving to Austin, the table got quiet. We were nearly done with dinner, so my mom asked for the check and my dad started to say something, but then said we would talk about it later. I knew something big was coming. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the car, my dad, a bit inebriated (we had my sister drive home), said ""You can do whatever you want with your life, even if it's following some boy somewhere..."" and trailed off. I started to grow enraged. Ever since Tom had stayed at my home, they had acted so hostile against hearing anything about him, even blaming him for me not coming home more often, and not taking an internship opportunity I was offered in my home state (I had a better one offered to me where I go to school). He was always just 'some boy' to them. I knew they must think I was just giving up on my own ambitions to follow him. When we got home, they dropped the bomb that because of their first impressions of Tom, they thought he was disrespecting me, taking advantage of me, and possibly abusive.... they didn't want to talk to me about it because they feared it would push me further away, and towards this 'abuser'. 

&amp;nbsp;

We argued for a time. Tears were shed. Mistakes were owned up to. Misunderstandings were cleared. After Tom's visit, I had always known that it was a mistake to introduce him to my parents so early on in our relationship... but I could have never imagined that they thought him abusive. What was even more disturbing is that they thought that they couldn't talk to me about it because it would push me away. Eventually, after I assured them that Tom was the complete opposite of what they thought he was, my Dad explained that all they wanted was to make sure I was happy. That they love me. And that all their concerns simply came out of love. I told them that I was happy, and that Tom and I want to build a life together. They were hesitant, but it meant a lot when they said that they want to get to know him, and us as a couple, more. At the end of it, we group-hugged. 

&amp;nbsp;

I guess what I wanted to say in this post is that there are other girls like me. Girls too afraid of what their parents will think about their SO, so stressed about what this conversation will look like... that they hold it in until things explode. I thought my parents didn't like Tom because they're simply over-protective, and had their own bad experiences with relationships in college, but it turned out to be far more than that. I knew that this conversation had to happen eventually, and I'm glad that it finally did, but I wish I had just talked to them in the first place. We still have a long way to go, but I plan on inviting my parents to dinner with Tom and I. Hopefully we can get started on the right foot this time. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for listening ladies, I hope this story helps someone out there. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR Couldn't talk to my parents about my boyfriend because I thought they were just being over-protective... They thought he was abusive. Just talk to your parents, don't wait until things explode.**  "
5k1nmj,12,2016-12-24,Should I take an out-of-industry internship?,AllTheKingsHorses95,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/5k1nmj/should_i_take_an_outofindustry_internship/,"I need some advice. I'm a third year ChE student at a large state University with a fairly high (3.75) GPA. I've worked a summer in the past in a research lab, but otherwise have a pretty mediocre involvement record. I have a part time job while in school, but no leadership experience.

I was recently offered an internship with a Fortune 500 company in business analysis/data analytics. The position seems heavy in coding and ""Big Data."" The location is ideal, and the pay is decent ($24/hour for ten-twelve weeks). 

That being said, I'm very uncertain where I stand with what I want to do after college. I like ChE. But I dont want to live in the middle of nowhere, and it seems most 'typical' ChE positions (ie manufacturing, process engineering, refineries) are in less than ideal locations. I'm not a talented coder, but I'm eager to learn. And the people I talked to at this company seemed pleasant. I haven't heard back from anywhere else I've applied (maybe 16-20 positions since September) but I also know a lot of ChEs don't have internships yet, so I dont know when I should begin to panic so to speak. 

Any advice? They only gave me a week to decide on the offer, but I may ask for more time. 

Thanks in advance, reddit "
5k1tmi,6,2016-12-24,A message from someone who's been there,MetaGamingKnight,TwoBestFriendsPlay,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/5k1tmi/a_message_from_someone_whos_been_there/,"After just getting back from visiting family I hear the news about Matt and Liam. I was surprised to say the least, but I was also happy. Not happy that they were leaving, far from that, but I'm happy that they were smart enough to realize there was a problem and to take steps to fix it. I've been there and I didn't and things got worse for me and made the past few years of my life bleak to say the least. 

So I'm happy that they are stepping back and, re-centering themselves as my therapist would say. I'm also incredibly greatful for all of the Best Friends as their videos have been a source of joy during those dark times. 

Now if you don't mind, I would like to share an abriviated version of my story and just how much impact they've had on me. 

Since I was two years old I've wanted to make video games. At 13 I realized I could actually get paid to do it. And so I set my sights on a career in the video game industry. 

The year is 2011. I don't have any money but I really want Mortal Kombat 9 which has just been released. So I open up youtube and the first video I stumble across is their Machinima episode of it. I loved it. I loved Matt and Pat's sense of humor and I've been with you guys since. 

Things started to go downhill about two years ago. I was in college at one of the best game design schools in the country. But its a very intensive program. And it wears down on you. At the time I blamed the school for doing that to me. But looking back the problems have been there for my whole life. 

I'd been having horrible anxiety, panic attacks coupled with bouts of depression. I went to see a therapist and a psychiatrist. The doc diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The gave me some pills and I went to my thealist weekly. I thought    I was getting better. And I was, the road was just a lot longer then I realized. 

School brought everything to a grinding halt. And it got to a point where my depression was so bad that I didn't even want to get out of bed let alone play video games. So often times, after I was done torturously forcing myself to do homework, I would lay in bed and watch the newest episodes of the LPs. 

Fast forward to just six months ago. I go on an internship that had me working over 100 hours each week. For 8 weeks. I came back burned out, just in time to begin my senior project. My depression and anxiety were still out of control and I was having severe mood swings. 

It got to the point where i was cutting and having suicidal thoughts. I went to my mom, my arm bleeding from my newest cut and that same night I was in a mental hospital. 

While I was in there they decided it wasn't an anxiety disorder but that I was Bipolar. They got me on some new meds and when released I went on to ace my senior project. 

To me the best friends play throughs have been like little nuggets of happiness that were given to help push me along. 

So I'm incredibly greatful for all four of the zaibatsu members. And I'm glad they're getting help before they end up in a mental hospital. 

Thanks again for all that laughs you've given me over the years you guys.

P.S. sorry if this is written rather weird I just got back from a 7 hour trip. It's after 1 in the morning and I'm tired.

5k2bn8,1,2016-12-24,Questions regarding CDCR,insitution,OnTheBlock,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnTheBlock/comments/5k2bn8/questions_regarding_cdcr/,"Background: I'm 21, live in California, I hold a TS clearance with the DoD, and I have about 90 college credits. 

A friend from college told me about his dad who works for the CDCR and makes $140k+ a year from his base pay and overtime. His father is a former Marine and has been working for the CDCR for the past 20+ years. His father does  not a have a bachelor's degree.

I've switched majors various times and nothing seems to fit (currently Computer Science). But during my internship with the DoD this Summer I learned I wanted to be hands on in whatever career I choose. A career with the CDCR sounds promising, and I have my written exam scheduled for early January. I just want some input from people who have worked as a CO and has some advice for anyone coming in.

My questions include:
- How much does a 1st year Peace Officer/Correction Officer make working 10-20 hours overtime on top of the base 40hr work week (50-60hrs/week)?
- I wear glasses, will this be a problem? (Correctable eyesight)
- Will having a clearance speed up my background investigation?
- How does one get promoted to higher ranks? (Lt. and Sg.)
- Can a Lt. or Sg. work overtime as well?
- Is tuition assistance provided?

Any information regarding FAQs I might be interested in is appreciated. Thank you for your time.

5k3dxr,20,2016-12-24,22T4M - Lilith Fairchild: High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5k3dxr/22t4m_lilith_fairchild_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- ~~*The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?~~ **Temporarily retired due to overexposure.**

- *The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The New Kid*: This is just too easy... Some poor little lost thing, torn away from her comfort zone, perhaps from some country where their grasp on English is less than fluent... Let's just say that I've always wanted a pet.

- *The Competition*: All right, to be honest, I've never been what one could consider a *sporty chick*. Tossing a ball around and pretending I'm hot shit? Fuck. That. Boxing, on the other hand... Working up a sweat and *clobbering* some pretty little thing? Sounds like my kind of evening. And you'd be surprised what kind of things happen happen in the locker room afterwards... **Bruised skin, bloody lips and perhaps a lost tooth or two. Not for the faint of heart.**

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful summertime employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *The Jock:* All right, I know one or two guys are reading this. Well, I don't top dudes, and if you want inside my ass, you've got to be *hot* shit. I'm talking chiselled-from-marble, fuck-happy *and* able to go toe-to-toe with me at my worst. Four therapists haven't been able to pull off that last one, so I doubt you can. If you're some needledick pillowhumper who's looking to feel a thick rod rearranging his colon, find a dude. On the other hand, if you think you can pin me, drill me *and* tame me, well... I'd like to see you try. 

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5k4ewh,2,2016-12-24,How long does accounting+CPA actually take?,racksonracksonstacks,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5k4ewh/how_long_does_accountingcpa_actually_take/,"(maybe i searched wrong but didnt find answer on reddit)

Im kinda confused looking at these posts and this is what i understand...

So i go to school and i see on my course schedule have at least 4 full years of school curriculum. Some **time** between there i have to get at least 1 but best if 2-3 (1-2 lower than Big 4 to get into big 4 internship later). Some people say get a winter internship (when? bc i have classes right?) 

Ok so i graduate with 127 credits get a Big 4 job then... ('x' time goes by?) then i get 150 credits so that i can be eligible for CPA.

I know that Big4 wants to see that you are trying to get the CPA so ... (x time goes by here?) i get CPA.

Total time?

And thats basically the recommended path right?

I have 2 different answers on whether to work during summer for experience vs take classes during summers to finish faster. We need tie breaker"
5k4fdy,4,2016-12-24,[Advice] Dress watch for banking internship,Aerodye,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/5k4fdy/advice_dress_watch_for_banking_internship/,"Hi all,

I have an internship at a large bank coming up (back office, not investment banking, but they're paying well regardless). As such, and having read a few articles online, I assume I'm expected to have a fairly decent dress(y) watch.

I don't have a great deal of money to blow on this, and so would like to spend less than 200-250GBP if possible. I've narrowed it down to 4 watches, and would just like your opinions on the below/ any further recommendations.

Watches I'm currently considering:

- Seiko SNX family (http://imgur.com/a/M6JXR or http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a397/Skitspuce/seiko5-1SNX123.jpg)
- Tissot Le Locle second hand from /r/watchexchange or eBay (http://imgur.com/a/FwXsR), I realise finding it for this price will be a challenge
- Tag Heuer 2000 second hand as above (http://imgur.com/a/NtnWq) 
- Hamilton Khaki second hand (http://imgur.com/a/jhkAv) / how appropriate would this watch actually be? (I assume not very)

Thank you very much for any advice."
5k4pgc,7,2016-12-24,It all feels so bleak,forget4,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5k4pgc/it_all_feels_so_bleak/,"This year I ended up transferring into a great university and had a fun time there. I met a lot of great people, I went to the gym 3 times a week, I gained weight/muscle and things were looking great. One day my car got towed at my place for no reason and lost money cause of that. I had tried putting myself out there and got led on and rejected a lot. It makes me feel even more stupid looking back at all the times that's happened to me.

A month or two before the end of my first semester I found out I couldn't continue my major at the main campus so I had to go to a small off campus site to finish up my last four semesters. I spent the last few weeks stressing and trying to decide where to go. I even paid the enrollment fee at another university to transfer there to continue with my major. Eventually I went to the off campus site and it looked like it was going to be boring and dull. I was going to finish up my degree at a non social campus, basically community college and I have to drive about 50 minutes to get there. 

Over the summer I mostly worked. I dated a girl who was leading me on for a while and kept me as a back up basically. I went to counseling at the main campus for one session but had to wait until the semester started at the off campus site to go to counseling. That all threw me off for a while and I didn't know what I was doing. I decided to go take a trip to California and spend a few days with some relatives out there. It was really fun but it didn't last long.

I went to my optometrist and my eyes got worse so my lenses got thicker and I feel so unappealing and weird when I wear glasses. I don't know how to help my eyesight and I fear it will only progress by the time I can get Lasik surgery. My friend set me up with her friend and I thought it would lead to me finding out what my problems with girls are since my friend can tell me what the girl says or to a great relationship.

We dated for two weeks and I just kept hearing great things about me. The girl knew I was inexperienced but she didn't care apparently. After our second date things went downhill. A week was spent with her avoiding me and barely texting me, the complete opposite of before. Eventually she ended it and I didn't know why. My friend avoided me for a while but eventually told me she was sleeping with her ex of 3 months and got back with him. Again things went bad and I decided to go to counseling to figure out my problems since the semester started.

One day me and my parents went to the store and we got rear ended. This lead to about two to three months of physical therapy three times a week. With school and work on top of that things weren't easy. Eventually my counseling ended after a few weeks and I found that my counselor thought that there was nothing wrong on my end. She told me to be patient and things would work out once I get out into the real world. 

A week or two after that I met a girl that became part of my group of friends. I felt great about myself after counseling but this girl started flirting with me and tried getting my attention a lot. I took a while to understand since I had been through so many rejections and games that I didn't want to create any problems. I finally decided to give it a try and we started dating for a month. Things were great and I even ended up with an internship for a dream company of mine but she ended it the day I got it.

We talked a few days after and she said she wanted to try again. This lasted for about a week and a half. Something seemed off and I tried asking her to talk so we don't end up running into any issues she had before when she first ended it. She kept postponing the talk so I wasn't sure what to do so I decided to wait until we went out again to bring it up. She ended up ending it and I was so confused. We talked about it a few days later and I still didn't find out exactly what caused us to end after the first or second time.

I told her before that we would be friends with whatever happened between us so I kept at it instead of avoiding her. It took me a while to really accept it, I would avoid being around her but I'd text her. She would get worried about me when I did that but I could also see she would do things the way she would when we were together. Things were confusing for me everytime I saw her but I needed to accept that we were just friends.

Eventually we had a small party for a friend and it turned into a surprise birthday for me. I was mostly quiet and didn't really want to be at the party because it was hard being around her and I didn't want to celebrate my birthday. I didn't feel good enough at all for any of that. My birthday is never special and it never feels like as great as other people have it. All I know is years of lonely birthdays and not having much.

One of our mutual friends talked to me and said the girl cared about me and was worried to see me that way. The mutual friend talked me into being around our group more and to try to get over her by being around her or else she thinks I would end up shutting myself out of my own friends. A few days later, right before my birthday, the girl talked to me and said she was dealing with some things and wants to try again sometime in the future.

She doesn't expect me to wait around or even want that but since she could tell that I was still into her and she was too, she wanted to tell me. She felt bad about telling me that after everything that has happened so I said we could talk about it when that happens. We have been talking and texting a lot since then and it's been weeks. I am trying to be her friend but it's not easy. I don't even know what to really do in this situation so I'm just lost.

As for my birthday I didn't do anything special. I ended up hanging out with those friends and that girl. There were awkward moments that our friends created so my birthday wasn't special at all. I didn't even get to do what I planned for that day. I ended up finishing the semester barely meeting the requirements for my internship. I don't think I'm getting anything for Christmas, I couldn't even get anything for myself for my birthday or Christmas. 

I'm worried about my parents affording the bills but they still bought stuff, I'm worried about my own medical bills from the accident, tuition, how I'm going to make it through the next semester by barely working, taking 6 classes, and so much more. I don't see a light anywhere but I just want to have my degree. If I end up alone, if things never get better in my life, I just want to have that degree. I can make a living for myself and I can be on my own. Being alone at least let's me avoid putting myself in stupid situations like getting rejected or thinking that something like my birthday matters. I can just work and make money for myself so I don't have to worry about bills or payments anymore. That's all I want, some stability if I can get that.

Tldr; 2016 went downhill but all I want is to get through school so I can seclude myself and not have anymore worries."
5k77mu,21,2016-12-25,Rant - Sexism in the DJ/Producer Industry,norvocaine,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5k77mu/rant_sexism_in_the_djproducer_industry/,"19 y/o female DJ here. I came here to vent, and share my experiences as a female in a male-dominated profession. I DJ Electronic Dance Music, and specialize in Bass Music (Dubstep, Riddim, Bass House, Future Bass, etc.). I'm proud of my work and have absolutely found my passion, and I couldn't be happier having the opportunity to do what I love. I'm not a wedding/event DJ - I play at shows for other artists as an opener or on side stages, and recently had my first headlining gig as a local artist. Things have been going incredibly well, especially considering how young I am relative to others who DJ, and considering the fact that I only first touched decks 7 months ago.

Despite my lack of experience compared to those who have years of DJing under their belt, I manage to book shows almost every week. I've been told it's very uncommon to progress in a DJing career this quickly, but I practice DJing almost every single day, and have committed immense amounts of time to advancing my craft. Now here's where the sexism comes in:

DJing and producing music (EDM especially) is a historically male-dominated profession, which I'm sure is not a surprise to those of you who have an interest in the music industry. I have yet to meet another female DJ in person, although I do know they exist (Alison Wonderland and Mija are my favorites). As a result, I experience a lot of apathy and even animosity from other artists and from crowdgoers - usually male - who have not seen me perform before. They immediately discredit me upon first look, which frankly, makes me feel like total shit. It also makes me feel like I have to prove myself even more than I normally would, which results in me feeling an immense amount of pressure and anxiety each time I get a gig. I know everyone is judging my performance extra hard. 

First of all, there's an awful stereotype some people still believe, in which they'll think, ""who did this female DJ have to sleep with to get this gig?"". This is total crap, and even so, at venues I try to distance myself from other men before/during/after I play so people don't get the wrong impression and assume such things. Second of all, I have literally been told, ""wow, I thought girl DJs sucked but you actually did super good!"". It's always men who tell me this. I always thank them for their support, but still, the inherent sexism makes my blood boil. Female show-goers have always expressed how empowered they feel to see another woman up on stage, which is a huge motivator for me. Third, and most frustrating, I was recently told by a male friend in the industry that the only reason I've been able to book gigs being a newbie is because I'm an ""attractive girl"". I was so taken aback, and felt like that statement had discredited all of my hard work putting in hours making mixes and practicing in my bedroom. I've been questioning myself ever since then, and hoping his statement wasn't true. But, considering the sexist nature that can prevail in this industry, I can't help but think that maybe it did have some validity. This breaks my heart. I do not want my sex and gender to be the reason I get booked for shows, I want to be booked because I'm talented and because people enjoy what I play. 

Anyways, I've never been one to give up. I've been attending University full-time, holding down a part-time internship, and kicking ass up on stage all the while. I'm not going to stop anytime soon. If anything, these frustrating incidents are only going to motivate me more to act as a good example for changes in favor of a more egalitarian environment. Shoutout to all you other women working in sexist environments. Keep doing what you love and proving to others that you are fully capable of excelling. I'm with you all. 

EDIT: clarification."
5k8j6p,1,2016-12-25,What should I [21/F] do with this guy who disappeared [23/M]?,adasbeep,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5k8j6p/what_should_i_21f_do_with_this_guy_who/,"So a few moths ago, I've been talking to this guy (called Doug) that I've met about 2.5 years ago on Reddit. The whole time we've been talking on and off through Kik and Skype (sometimes video chat, sometimes voice). We talked about all kinds of things like college, family, relationship etc. I used to dislike him because he's quite flirty but he'd stop it when I told him to tone it down. Like it's he's flirty but he respects me.

Until in August, he contacted me again (he had been consistently contacting me for the past 2 years but I didn't always reply). And we started talking a bit more because I was having a really bad time back home in the summer. And I was quite troubled with my internship, my relationship and my family issues. And he was the one who talked me out and supported me most of the time, regardless of the time difference. We have developed a very close bond and a much deeper understanding about each other. At the same time we started developing some feelings for each other.

It wasn't long until we both admitted our feelings to each other though we never said ""I love you"" to each other. It's not unusual that we Skype talk for a few good hours and texted each other every day and night. The longest time we've Skype was 6 hours (I still don't know how we did that). We would give each other nickname. He'd try to learn my native language. We would both say that ""I wish you were here"" and ""I really wanna visit you"" for a least a hundred times a day. 

Things have been going on for a while - even when I've broken up with my boyfriend, after the break up, and after I got back with my boyfriend again. I couldn't stop living with the guilt that I was with my boyfriend while texting romantically to another guy. So I made things clear with Doug that I didn't wanna lie and hide things from my boyfriend. He respected that though he was upset and we both cried on the phone for a few times about it. 

I still tried to talk to him though afterwards (I know I know...) on friendly terms but he seemed to be so much colder and distant to me. He said he was busy and stressed with his work (he's in medical research in the State). And I would still text him things like ""how are you?"" ""I hope things are okay with you"" but much less since he rarely replied. I was very upset that he didn't reply and I felt left out and forgotten but still I thought he's just busy. I sometimes call him with international call (it's quite expensive) because that's the only way to reach him but he didn't even pick up my call once. 

And October 8 (yeah I just can't forget it) was the last time we ever texted. I assumed he'd blocked me on WhatsApp (I only have his number, Snapchat, Kik and Skype). So when I checked his Snapchat, he's deleted me as well. Even when I sent him messages on Skype, it's never been sent (and hence I never got a reply).

It's been a more than 2 months already and I can't seem to forget him. I don't know what to do with him. I can't get over him and I cry about him at night every now and then. I really really wanna find out what happen but I could never reach him, even just as a friend. 

Redditors, what should I do? :("

5k8lku,185,2016-12-25,I [28 M] was told by my cousin's wife [25 F] that I'll never be happy in my life and will not find a place even in hell.,_Juan_Cena,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5k8lku/i_28_m_was_told_by_my_cousins_wife_25_f_that_ill/,"TL;DR : My cousin's wife had a breakdown and expressed how much she hated me by letting me know that I'll be responsible for their divorce as I was for my parents', I'll never be happy in life, and I am such a disgusting animal that I won't even get a place in the depths of hell.


After completing graduate school, I moved back with my cousin. We've been best of friends since we were kids and enjoy living together. Over the year, he got engaged and married to this lady. My (other) cousins and I thought that she was a bit odd at first but were going to support our cousin since he had sacrificed a lot for us. After getting an internship in our area, she moved in with us. This is when I got a retail job and started saving to move out. A couple of months in, my cousin started talking about privacy concerns. I promised him that I'll move out as soon as I have enough money. Over the months, my anxiety and depression got worse and I started losing hope. I was a wreck and got a lot of support from both my cousin and his wife. That being said, there were times where she would offer unsolicited advice on how depression is all in the head and shouldn't be a factor etc. I was also unaware of how she felt about me at the time. During my stay, I was actively trying to form a healthy brother-sister like relationship. There were times when she'd annihilate my cousin for the most trivial things ever. She'd throw tantrums almost anytime we were talking to our family on the phone. She was also a terrible drunk and would make things very uncomfortable for all of us. Not to mention the times where public display of affection turned into groping...especially in front of our younger family members. There are a lot of things that we put with because our cousin was in love with her. 

The fairytale ended one morning when we were out for lunch and they were arguing about household chores. Before we could go on a road trip, I suggested that I should go back so that they could talk to each other and sort things out. They insisted that I came along and I did. To nobody's surprise, they started arguing at the top of their voice and my anxiety got worse. Before I lost control of the car, I took the first exit, parked the car, and got out. I was in a state of panic. This wasn't the first time that this had happened and I was not going to get back in the car. I asked them to continue and ordered an Uber. That's when things went south as she smashed her phone and started running on the highway. My cousin ran after her while crying. I had never seen him cry before. We eventually got a hold of her and went back home. She told my cousin that he had to choose between us. I volunteered to leave the apartment immediately. While I was packing my bags, she gave me the business (see the TL;DR post). Throughout the verbal assault and the panic attack, I did not retaliate and left the apartment with my stuff. I felt miserable for not being able to express how I felt about it all. And the amount of hatred was unbearable. I decided to take a break, and took a trip to see family and friends. While it helped, every night was a struggle. I'd wake up to what she had told me and cry my eyes out. I felt like I had ruined two people's lives. If only I knew about the situation, I'd left a lot earlier. Throughout the episode, I was depressed and sober. I got a lot of support from the small circle of family members that knew about her. After a terrible attempt at suicide, I'm attempting not to concentrate on the negativity. I have a sense of betrayal of trust. They were with me when I was the most vulnerable. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that someone would be capable of such hatred for me. I've to attend their ""traditional wedding ceremony"" in a few weeks and pretend like nothing ever happened. I'm apologize for not articulating my thoughts properly. Feel free to ask me any questions.

Should I apologize to her? Should I tell her how we feel about her?"
5k8tko,1,2016-12-25,A very bad truffles trip causes me occasional panic attacks to this day. I want to trip again but am afraid. Could you guys give me some advice?,papablessbitch,Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/5k8tko/a_very_bad_truffles_trip_causes_me_occasional/,"Hello psychonauts,

I had a near death experience in March 2015. I had a circulatory accident in my brain that i luckily got out of intact. As i was in an internship that i liked and wanted to turn into a stable job i got the hell out of the hospital as soon as i could and i never really processed the experience since i got back to Madrid to keep working and hacing my usual agitated life.

I quit the job a year later and got back to my family home. One day, alone, i ate pandora truffles, i didn't really weigh it but it didn't feel like too much.

I took this in a very bad moment in my life, where i felt stuck, lonely and powerless over my future. The thing is the trip was really good, but i misread it and when i thought it was over i loaded my bong and smoked a lot of cannabis. Everything was going so good until this happened. The trip wasn't over yet and the substances amped it up and a little bit later i started feeling weird. I had been feeling that weirdness before because it is how the trip felt in my body, but i was dealing with something more powerful than i though as it wasn't over and i added the cannabis...so i started to get paranoid and i felt in my body the same things i felt when my accident happened a year before. This had me panicking, a lot.

I called my best friend and a girl i really liked that is now my gf and they helped me calm down. The problem is since then, every time i feel something different in my body and I'm alone, i get panic attacks.


I am now in a very different place. Job is good, i am progressing to really cool stuff that i like. I have a wonderful gf that  is an inconditional support and loves me. I am in a good economic situation...everything feels right so i really want to have a good trip experience, but i wonder what would you guys recommend. How should i go at it? Do you think it's a good idea? Do you have any recommendations for the setting and what to do?

The plan is to go to a very beautiful place with an isolated country house near the sea and surrounded by green fields and nature with my gf and have a truffles/shroom trip there. She'll tripsit me and I'll do it for her later.

Any thoughts and advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time guys"
5k9569,7,2016-12-25,University of Calgary student looking for advice from Oil and Gas professionals,geolandman,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/5k9569/university_of_calgary_student_looking_for_advice/,"Hi everyone,
I am currently a 4th year student enrolled in the BComm Petroleum Land Management program and minoring in Geophysics. I have worked on the drilling rigs for 8 months, worked for Shell Canada as a land analyst, and now moving to Edmonton to work at a distribution terminal for an 8 month internship term.

Currently, I am having a bit of a dilemma about my career. Essentially I am very interested in Geophysics, but right now I know that employment is rough in that field. I have a solid job with Shell and could become a negotiator after this internship. However, if I forgo any grad opportunities to pursue Geophysics it would only be 8 more months and I would have a BSc/BComm combined degree and be qualified for APEGA professional status as a P.Geo if I work in that field before moving into a commercial role.

I have read a lot about how landmen have been getting pushed down by the oil industry over the last few years in Canada because landmen do not have the same technical stature as engineers and geoscientists. I have also read a lot about how landmen fail to add value to organizations and are seen as more of a service because they seem to add less value than engineers, finance people, or geoscientists.

From your professional perspective, how much value could I add with a combination like that? Would I be able to be accepted by my technical peers more and have a say at the decision table amongst other professionals? Would the extra 8 months in school foster a greater return on investment in my future and open up further opportunities? Should I go to law school instead? Are there any other factors that come to your mind?

Any advice on this issue will help me immensely! I have to make a choice by early January, so the sooner I get your insights the better!
Thanks everyone!"

My absence has been due to a few challenging and devastating events over the past year: funds were tighter than expected and I needed to alleviate some debt; this summer brought me out of state to work an internship with grueling hours and an unsatisfiable boss; and my 7 year old best friend died suddenly due to gastric torsion (aka *dog bloat*). I'm still not ready to return to regular additions to my stack, but every once in a while I wanted to treat myself.

Anyway, thanks a lot for your help and your gift, buddy! I hope you have a wonderful Christmas!"
5ka35y,0,2016-12-25,My Sports Hernia Story,SadHernia,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/5ka35y/my_sports_hernia_story/,"Where to being?
Checking the news on latest injuries for athletes, you will notice many athletes suffer groin injuries. These injuries are usually categorised as Sports Hernia. The term ""Sports Hernia"" is a misnomer, or a blanket term for many injuries that can exist within the groin. The word groin in itself is another blank term, thus googling your symptoms can be frustrating, especially when your pain is not in your thigh area of even the connection between the thigh and the lowest part of the abdominal muscle.  

Before my story begins: SPORTS HERNIAS ARE NOT AT ALL SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL INGUINAL (BULGE) HERNIAS. Sports hernias involves soft tissue tears from the muscle in the pelvic floor and thus nothing is actually herniated. Inguinal hernia actually involves misplaced items in your body, eg. intestine bulging out from its pouch and entering your testicular sack. 

Anyhow, my story is as follows:

The Incident:

From Jan 2015 - August 2015, I worked as an undergraduate intern for an oil company in a northern-central town in Saskatchewan. There I worked 15 days on and 6 days off shifts which consisted of 10 works hours and 2 commuting hours daily. The job was awful, the co-workers were awful and my boss expected too much from me (The commuting involved my boss and myself in a carpool). 

Numerous events and stress factors contributed to my injury. In April 2015, the injury took place. In one particular week, I made a terrible mistake at work which could've resulted in a slowdown at the oil plant. This mistake was made at the lack of supervision and care from the lead engineer, needless to say, immense pressure was applied on me that week. Furthermore the heater was making irritating water noises which kept me up all that week. At the end of this awful shift, I volunteered myself at the mosque doing manual labour and helping a friend out for his roofing business. Finally the unfortunate day came when I went to the gym for leg day. A year before I was able to easily deadlift close to 400 lbs.  Angered by my inability to do so because of a lack of exercise from the semester before my internship, i was foolishly and stubbornly wanted to get back to that pinnacle as soon as possible. Now for whatever reason, i wore a weightlifting belt on this particular day, something to which I've never done. Pulling up approximately 375 lbs for a set, I felt a sharp pain in my lower right abdomen. It is my belief that I wore the belt too tightly and it acted as a pivot point, causing my pelvic floor muscles to tear away from the pelvic bone. That, in combination with bad form that day and the immense stresses from everything else has put me into the situation I currently am in. I take full responsibility.

Lost and Astray:
This injury is truly odd. I could not summon the pain on demand with certain movements like other injuries between the time of the incident to my surgery. Anyhow, from April 2015 till December 2015, I went crazy and studied and researched dozens of scientific papers, aswell as online athletic forums. There seems to be an absolute lack of knowledge of lower groin injuries. Googling anatomical images of the groin and you can tell why. SO many layers of muscles, nerves and other components intertwine in this sensitive location. As a result, there really seems to be only less than 10 doctors WORLDWIDE that claim to solve this issue:

Dr. William Meyers of Philadelphia (Doctors whom have studied under his wing include Dr. Litwin and Dr. Busconi in Boston)
Dr. William Brown of California
Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck of Germany

To make matters worse, they all do different repairs.

Dr. Ulrike was too far for me (reside in Canada) and though Dr. Brown is the cheapest alternative ($5000 USD), I have spoken to many of his patients of his who claim they would not recommend him. It is a pity, as Dr. Brown was very nice through his emails and has a very detailed website (http://www.sportshernia.com/). Up till this point in Nov. 2015, I could not make up my mind and explored local surgeons in Canada. It was at this point in December 2015 that my left side started hurting me. It made no sense as to why after 8 months of pain on the right side and none on the left, the left side decided it was time to be in pain.

Mental Anguish and Scammy Canadian Surgeons:
Looking at these astronomical prices in for American surgeons, I opted to see if any surgeons, doctors or chiropractors have any knowledge on the subject in my home nation, Canada. Afterall, we have a world reknown health care system. Many Toronto sports doctors claimed on their websites that they know all there is to know about Sports Hernias. They are liars. They know nothing and my surprise, it doesn't seem that many Canadian hernia surgeons and groin doctors do not keep up to date, let alone discuss new discoveries in this field together. I knew more about sports hernias and the history of its treatment than all of these surgeons. These surgeons are very scam like. They wanted to cut me open so eagerly, however after asking key questions, I was soon to find out they are all egotistical fools and need a clue. They all said that I needed mesh patches and nerve removal to fix my problem. A simple search on google reveals MANY patients with horror stories of meshes and nerve cutting for sports hernias. This is a very archaic/barbaric method popular in the early naughties (2000-2008). These doctors persisted on the fact that I had inguinal hernia, despite the world re-known doctors at Shouldice saying that I do not have one. 

Think of it this way with a car analogy. A sports hernia can be thought of as a slight bend in a car axle. These scammy doctors wanted to cut my perfectly good tire, patch back the hole (Mesh), fill it back with air and cut a wire (nerve) that electronically sends a signal to my dashboard to turn off the caution sign that would not turn off (pain). This would leave me with my bent axle and my tire in a worst condition that it was previous to the repair work (surgery). Including the fact that they would cut my signal warning and thus I could possibly break my car even further as there is no warning light telling me to stop.

The Problem is Socialism:
Why couldn't Canadian Doctors come up with a solution in 2015 when their southern brothers already did. Knowing that they didn't have a solution, why were they so persistent on cutting me up? Its Socialism and the large Egos known for surgeons. 

Competition drives innovation. Canadian health care system is good for WELL KNOWN DOCUMENTED problems. But when it comes to unknown problems, Canadian Doctors shy away from experimental surgeries as the Canadian Health care system does not provide money for it. Whereas, because USA is a capitalistic society with a drive for athletic entertainment, much money is made for any surgical innovations that can get a star athlete back in the game. Furthermore, all surgeons want to publish their success rates and large volumes of patients in their scientific articles and be well known to the scientific community as a whole, even at the risk of YOUR future. 

Always ask a surgeon who claims he treats sports hernias the following:
1) Whats your track record? How many did you complete this year?
2) WHICH STAR ATHLETE DID YOU TREAT in the past?
3) Provide me your scientific articles

Most surgeons cannot provide squat and shy away from the 4th question: why were you willing to cut me up and slide mesh of foreign material into my body if you do not even know whats a sports hernia?? Dr. Kashif Irshad SHOVED the surgery papers and a pen and told me to sign without even telling me how he treats theses injuries. I never felt so betrayed by my country so much before. I never felt so betrayed by so many surgeons before. Not one (besides the good surgeons at Shouldice hospital) refused to cut me up.

Canadian Health Care Fails Again:
From January till March 2016, with bilateral pain, my mental health started deteriorating. You see, I identify as an athlete. I am happy by accomplishments, which involve getting bigger, faster and stronger from the day before. This injury gave me a severe identity crisis as a result. Mixed in with the fact the OHIP (Ontario Health Coverage) rejected me several times from receiving out of country coverage for surgery. Great.

May-July 2016:
I coughed up the $25000 (Two internships in oil) USD money needed for surgery with Dr. Meyers and got a consultation and surgery during this time.  He is a pioneer of this surgery and is very competent.

Oct. 2016:
Right side heals 100%

Current day:
Left side did not heal it and as a result i may have to go back for a revision surgery. I do not blame Dr. Meyers as this surgery is complicated and all surgeries has its risks. I am happy that atleast one side has permanently healed and is fixed. 

Description of the Pain:

Dull testicular aches. I have been misdiagnosed several times, from Varicoceles to Epididymitis. The pain is so hard to pinpoint. Its pretty much the where the soft tissue meets the pelvis forming an outer rim around your testicles. Very low pain and many chiropractors shy away from massaging it as you have to pretty much massage the testicle as you push it aside. It sucks all around.

Just wanted to vent. I am broke and cannot find a job in the field I graduated in (I dislike my field which is engineering). As a result, I will have to put aside my police applications and ..... I don't know anymore. I am a security guard making nothing in wages in an expensive city. I enjoy nothing. I cannot play my sports and become a better athlete. Its been nearly two years. Suicide never crossed my mind per say, but there are days where I wanted to remain in dream-sleep state and not deal with my problems anymore. I have been depressed since the time of the injury and haven't felt happy for nearly these two years. 

As you can tell, THIS IS A RICH MANS INJURY. 

Thank-you if you read it all.

5ka5tg,8,2016-12-25,I want to suicide because I'm already dead,gallagher222,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5ka5tg/i_want_to_suicide_because_im_already_dead/,"I'm dead in the sense that the person that you are as a result of social interaction is not there for me. I haven't had enough social interaction to be a person. Instead I'm just a random collection of nonsense. I don't know what my principles are at all. Its all up in the air. My personality shifts wildly because there is nothing tethering it down, and ultimately none of it means anything so it doesn't even matter how crazy or outrageous my personal beliefs might get. They'll be different the next day. That my friends indicates that I have no actual life. And that's why I want to commit suicide: because it makes sense to finish what is already basically dead. 

Think about it this way. When people go on a safari and they watch a leopard eating a warthog and the warthog is squealing and squealing for like 30 minutes because the leopard won't put it out of its misery, its just eating it alive. The people in the truck start wishing the warthog would just die already, because its already basically dead. 

Well that's what's going on with me too. I'm the warthog getting eaten alive. My life is terrible, and the world would like it if I just stopped existing entirely because I'm upsetting to all the other warthogs that aren't getting eaten alive. And I'm upsetting to myself. It would be better for me and everyone else if I would just die already. 

I've tried hard this year to live like the other people do. I've talked to and gotten to know people that I know I have nothing in common with, to try to learn their ways of living. But their ways are so alien to my ways. They shock my nervous system. The shock feels awful as I realize just how different and retarded my life is. I've opened up and changed a lot this year but its not enough and I don't think it will ever be enough. I've lived too much misery and despair to ever go back to being a regular functional person I think. And I'm tired of shocking my nervous system over and over trying to assimilate with functional people. 

I had an okay Christmas with my immediate family but I skipped this morning's extended family reunion for the time ever in my whole life. I did this because at this reunion are the relatives who personally took it upon themselves to ruin my life when I was a child and teen. They deprived me of that social interaction and basically killed me. I've been holding on by a thread ever since. Well I'm never going to be in the same room as those relatives again, whether I live or not. They cost me way too much for me to consider them family. 

And now I'm probably going to skip my other extended family reunion because even though they are fine people, we never actually bonded due to my depression. Their ways are very alien to me and I don't want to shock myself. Not to mention its awkward AF because of all the hundred family reunions we've had where I just shuffle around staring at the floor and barely saying 5 words in 4 hours. We haven't bonded yet so its safe to say we're never going to bond. My parents won't like my absence but honestly they should not expect me there considering I'm incapable of having a conversation with anybody there. If they wanted me in the family so bad they shouldn't have allowed me to hover around the periphery being extremely awkward all these years. That shit is so damaging to mental health. 

I just want to sleep. Soon I have to start a goddamn internship at a professional office. Those people are going to eat me alive. They will not respect my complete lack of confidence in myself. This world sucks because certain people break your spirit and then nobody bothers to put you back together. They just let you hover around for decades with nobody in your life, slowly letting the suicidal impulse grow to epic proportions. I've made positive changes this year that sort of gave me a reason to live, but its all too little too late. I can't handle a normal human relationship. They are out of my depth. I just wish I could lose myself enough that I could actually go through with suicide rather than just thinking about it all day long.

5kaopo,14,2016-12-25,"HELP! Me [24 F] with my brother [20 M] who failed all his classes at college, have no idea what to do.",5newspapers,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5kaopo/help_me_24_f_with_my_brother_20_m_who_failed_all/,"I feel so lost and shocked. As from the title, my brother is a junior at a state school and he failed all his classes this semester. I have no idea what to do. 

A little background on us: my parents are immigrants, and were strict growing up. Both my brother and I got great grades in high school and got scholarships to a university in state. 


My experience in college was pretty different from high school.  I didn't get great grades, basically had a 2.8ish cumulative, which meant I lost my scholarship after my freshman year. But, I took out loans, got a part-time job at a restaurant, had internships, and I ended up getting a paid internship after graduating college which led to my first job. After my first job (a temporary, contracted job), I ended up moving back home for a year and was depressed and unmotivated. I ignored my friends and stayed in the house all the time. Fortunately, after almost a year, I ""woke up"" and got my act together. After a few months, I had a job in my field, and I'm happy to say that I'm gainfully employed and have moved across the country. I'm still a struggling young professional, but I'm working with a therapist to deal with my depression and I'm being more sociaL. Slowly, I feel like I'm making my way back to being my old self---more confident, motivated, outgoing. But, after that rough year of staying at home, unemployed and doing nothing, I never want my brother to go through that. 


I came home for Christmas after having been away since May. I got in last night and my dad told me that my brother failed all his classes. I felt like someone has dropped a bucket of ice water on me. My brother and I are different, but we both do well in school. I was much more outgoing and extroverted in high school and college. He's always been more extroverted, and the type to stay home, in his room, on the computer. He graduated as valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar, and went to the same university that I did. Now, while i stayed in apartments off-campus, he chose to stay in the dorm, even as a junior. He is in the honors college, and was pre-med neuroscience, but ended up dropping the pre-med part. No big deal, he's not really a people person. But, while he's kept a good GPA (at least 3.7 cumulative before this semester), he hasn't really gotten involved in anything. No volunteering, and more worrying, no internships or research positions. I fully believe most college graduates need internships or the equivalent experience to get a job or go to grad school after college. 


My dad said that even with failing all his classes this year, my brother has a 3.2, but I have no idea what this means for him. Does he still have a scholarship? Should he got back next semester, or should my parents pull him out for a semester and maybe get him in therapy? I have no idea what happened---my dad said he was sick. I think he might be suffering from depression like I have. I just feel like such a shitty sister---how could I not have known about this? I called him fairly regularly and would ask how things were going, but he doesn't really talk about things that are personal to him. I had no idea that he was failing his classes this semester. I just want to get him help and I want him to be successful and independent like I know he can. But, I'm also worried that if he takes a semester off from school, he'll end up just staying home and not doing anything like I did. And, I'm trying to remember that this could just be a temporary hurdle, and this mistake doesn't dictate the rest of his life. Also, I can't just push and and nag him--his motivation has to come from himself! 

But my parents are looking to me for help, and a) I'm his sister, not his parent! b) I don't know what to do. Help me, Reddit---should he come home for a semester and get therapy? Be given a timeline to get a job so he learns how tough life is? I don't think he can take classes at the community college, since he's a junior and already completed his gen ed classes, but I'm willing to suggest he take 1 or 2 beginner computer coding classes? Maybe my parents should go with him to the school counselor and see what would be best? I have no idea what to do and everyone in my house is stressed beyond belief. 

  **tl;dr**: My brother failed all his classes at college and my parents are wondering what the next step is. "

I start a $65k/year job in January and I have a decent amount of money saved up from an internship I had over the summer (about $3k). I currently have an Xbox One and don't play too much, but I do play when I'm not working or at the gym and get the urge. I've compared several similar possible system builds and the one I'm looking at is a little under $1k and has free shipping, and most of the parts are on sale.

5kbsc5,1,2016-12-25,MacBook Pro recommendations for CS student?,passacaglia7,AppleWhatShouldIBuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWhatShouldIBuy/comments/5kbsc5/macbook_pro_recommendations_for_cs_student/,"Currently own a 2011 MacBook Pro 13’; used it throughout high school and my first year of college. It has 1700 battery cycles on it and dies all the time randomly, and programs frequently crash. I’m a college student studying computer science and need to upgrade. 

So a few weeks ago I bought the 13-inch TB MacBook Pro, with 16 GB RAM and 512-GB SSD. (Last summer at my engineering internship VMs wouldn’t run on my 2011 MBP until I installed an extra 8 GB of memory to bump it up to 16 GB RAM; tons of dev environment hell so it’s important to me to max out specs). It arrived a few days ago. However, when I got it, it seemed small; took a trip to Best Buy and compared with the 15-inch and wished I’d bought it instead (should definitely have done this before ordering, I know); it seems very light for the size and screen space and I’ll be using it for coding and all my school projects for the next four years at least. I don't have an external monitor and I do a lot of work away from my desk.

But the 15-inch 2016 TB MBP (with a 512-GB SSD) is incredibly expensive. Is it worth it? I’m also considering a 2015 MBP (the 15-inch seems bulky though; I bike everywhere at school and already overload my backpack with books), the 2016 15-inch MBP without the touch bar, or just skipping the extra screen space and keeping the 13-inch I'm typing on now. It would also be fantastic if I could have the new computer in my hands within two weeks before I head back to school; I don’t trust my current computer to function well enough (thinking about replacing the battery). 

Any thoughts on the 2016 TB 15’, the 2016 nonTB 15’, the size of the 2015 15’, and the value of the new computers compared to last year’s? I’d really appreciate recommendations. Thanks."

5kca7v,11,2016-12-26,Scissor-wielding Landlord,notsolittleliongirl,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/5kca7v/scissorwielding_landlord/,"My mom was 21 and still in college when she and a friend both landed a summer internship in the same city. They spent the first part of that summer on a temporary lease while they searched for a more permanent place to live. As the temp lease was running out, they found a couple who was renting out their finished basement. It was relatively cheap, in a decent neighborhood, had its own kitchen and bathroom, and a door that led directly outside from the basement. All this led them to believe they could peacefully coexist with the couple living above them. Their temp lease ran out, so they moved in. 


They never saw much of the wife. They really only interacted with the husband, and his behavior and list of rules for living there got increasingly controlling. The couple were immigrants, originally from somewhere in the Middle East, so at first my mother and her roommate excused his behavior as stemming from cultural differences. They decided to just deal with it and try not to upset him. 


As agreed upon before they moved in, they were never allowed in the upstairs of the house, which makes sense. But the landlord just walked into the basement whenever he pleased, as if they weren't paying money to live there. Before moving in, they had agreed not to have guys over. Then he changed the rule to say they were never allowed to have friends over at all. Then he said they weren't allowed to go out at night, because apparently their re-entering the house through the basement door might disturb him and his wife. Then they weren't allowed to dress immodestly because ""it might reflect badly on him"". Then he started threatening to call their parents for their perceived misbehavior. Then he ACTUALLY CALLED my grandpa, who used some rather colorful language to tell him that my mother was an adult and the man should attempt to act like one himself. 


The final straw came a few weeks after moving in. The man stomped down the stairs, yelling about how he knew that a few nights before they had invited guys over (my mom says they didn't and anyways, why would he wait a few days to get mad about it?). He called them whores for having guys over, made some other sexist comments implying that American women don't know their place in the world, and then made some vague threats about what he would do next time they broke the ridiculous rules he kept adding onto.


After he finished his rant and went back upstairs, my mom and her roommate immediately started packing their things. They made arrangements to live with friends and moved all of their stuff out two days later. My mom had talked about her living situation at work, so one of her work friends, Matt, offered to help her move out. He also offered the help of two of his buddies, who were Marines, just to make sure nothing bad happened. 


They were just about to carry the first boxes out when the landlord stormed into the basement, wielding a large pair of scissors. He didn't come down the stairs from inside the house, he went around the house and came in through the basement door that led outside. He saw the guys, stopped, and began yelling about my mom and her roommate breaking the rules. One of the Marines interrupted him and told him that my mom and her roommate were moving out and if the man attempted to stop them, they would have him arrested. The landlord was pissed, yelled some more and insulted them some, but ultimately left without hurting anyone. 


Immediately after the landlord left, my mom picked up the landline, intending to call the police and request an officer to ensure the landlord didn't get violent. No dial tone, so she checked the cord. The cord had been sliced clean through. As soon as she told her friends this, Matt checked the door from the house to the basement. It didn't have a lock, but it wouldn't open more than an inch. Like something heavy had been shoved against it. The guys immediately escorted my mom and her roommate out of the basement and instructed them to drive away and just meet at Matt's apartment. The guys carried the boxes out (there wasn't that much stuff to move, so it was quick) and left. 


Back at Matt's apartment, they talked about what had just happened and concluded that the landlord hadn't known the guys were there and had they not been there, might have hurt my mom and her roommate. It's definitely strange that he would choose to assault them with scissors, but he had cut the phone line, blocked the exit upstairs, and presumably would have controlled access to the only other exit, the basement's walk out door. 


My mom mailed him the keys, along with instructions to forward any mail to her parents, who lived hundreds of miles away. The jackass had the nerve to mail my grandpa a letter claiming that my mom owed the entire summer's rent, to which my grandpa mailed back a letter pointing out that there had never been a contract, because the guy had been illegally renting out his basement (that area had rules against it) and as such, my mother didn't owe him ""jackshit"". She never did pay any rent."
5kcdeg,1,2016-12-26,Girlfriend [22F] broke contact with me 21[M] after a strange period of little contact.,boager95,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5kcdeg/girlfriend_22f_broke_contact_with_me_21m_after_a/,"Hello everyone

I apologize about the long text, I will try to include every relevant detail in my case. I am a college senior who met a girl in one of my classes when the fall semester started. She took a lot of interest in me, however, I did not initially show her the same affection towards her. I was sort of weirded out by her needy nature (always asking me to come to her and text her). She had an emotional breakdown one day, telling me how I did not make an effort to show her affection when she clearly liked me. I told her I was very busy with school and liked her, but did not always have time to be with her. She gets angry and stops talking to me. The next week she sees me and acts like nothing happened, we eventually have sex and start a ""relationship"". 

The semester had been a wild one for me, both academically and emotionally. On one hand she is a wonderful girl. She's incredibly beautiful, studious, caring, and fun. On the other hand she is very needy and emotional. She went to college from home (her parents are really strict, she cannot go out much unless its for school) and would usually act strange when she was at home for too long. She would randomly get emotional, and at times, would say she didn't want to be in a relationship. The minute she came to school to see me everything would change, she would act her normal happy self. I have been really patient with her and have gone out of my way to be there for her on throughout the semester. When she got sick I took her to the doctor and paid her bills, I have stayed up late on many occasions to help her with school, and have tried my best to give her emotional support (issues related to her family life and her previous relationship). 

Here is what I found out about her life and her past. She dated a heroin addict for about two years (he was in rehab during the fall semester) and her parents were pretty harsh on her. Her and her ex boyfriend split about five months ago when he was sent to rehab. Her parents almost never let her get out of the house, and she is frequently criticized by her parents. She told me about her troubles at home and her ex boyfriend. Her past relationship was toxic, she always worried about him and had to call 911 on multiple occasions due to him overdosing on heroin. He was possessive, jealous, emotionally brittle, and was prone to anger. She wanted to marry this guy, but was hurt by the issues he had with drugs and his behavior.

Fast forward to the end of November. Her ex boyfriend gets out of rehab and contacts her. She initially tells me she does not want to be in contact with him, however, he persists. They start talking like old friends. She then agrees to eat lunch with him, and finally, allows him to come to her graduation (extremely awkward for me). She also breaks up with me at this point, but still wants to maintain a romantic relationship. She says she loves me, but still cares for her ex boyfriend and sees a future with him, if he can clean up. I tell her how I feel and how hurt I am, but she tells me she only wants to remain friends. We still continue to act like boyfriend and girlfriend however, we still talk, kiss, and sleep with each other. Her sleeping with me causes tension between her and her ex. 

Winter break has started and we have not really seen each other or talked much. She seems very distant and depressed. Last night I asked her what was wrong and why she was distant, she says she has a lot on her mind, but did not want to talk about it (it has to do with her ex boyfriend and she would like to keep it to herself). It was late, I was tired, so I went to sleep, but told her to call me if she wanted to talk. 

She texts me today and tells me how she has always been there for me and how inconsiderate I am for not calling, and how she is always the one who has to call me. I told her I was extremely worried about her and wanted to talk, however, I did not want to be pushy or nosy. She refuses to talk and cuts contact with me, she wishes me luck in the future ( I am moving out of town in January for an internship) and stops talking and texting me.

I understand she has her issues that she needs to get over, and I can understand why she is angry at me. But her reacting like this is completely unwarranted after all we've been through and after all I have provided her. I know I do not have a future with this girl but I deeply care about her well being and do not want to be cut out of her life. I feel lost and depressed about the whole situation and I honestly do not know what to do next, we cannot really see each other or meet up since she is out of school. What can I do to mend relations with her? I don't want this relationship to end on a bad note. 

Thank you for reading 

TD;DR: A girl I am romantically involved with cut contact with me after I did not call her when she was having a horrible night. "

5kcr69,0,2016-12-26,Considering ending long term LDR over increased distance/time apart,onion7623,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5kcr69/considering_ending_long_term_ldr_over_increased/,"I [21 M] have been dating my girlfriend [21 F] for four years since high school, and we're both now juniors in college. We've made a long distance relationship work reasonably well despite being about 7 hours apart; we see each other on breaks and visit each other at least once a semester.

Next semester my girlfriend is going on a study abroad program, and I will be doing an internship in California for the summer, while she will likely be staying on the east coast. So, we will likely not be in the same location for more than a couple days over the next nine months. 

We have a pretty good relationship, but we do have some issues communicating our problems well, which I feel are exacerbated by the distance. I'm also just worried that we will turn out to be less compatible than we think, because we haven't spent more than a couple weeks together at any single point since high school. I was really hoping we could be in the same location this summer, and I'm pretty disappointed that it didn't work out. I'm worried that this is indicative of our ability to find jobs in the same location in the future, or to make sacrifices for each other. I have talked about this fear with my girlfriend at length, but at the same time I don't think either is us can be blamed for making career focused choices at this point in our lives. 

I think in general being in a LDR is growing increasingly tiring and stressful for me and so this continued decrease in physical contact seems like it will be difficult to handle. Breaking up would be terrible, but if I'm going to do it I have to do it now; I can't end a 4 year relationship over the phone. Looking for advice on how best to evaluate the situation. "
5kcurc,1,2016-12-26,[nmom] Am I taking crazy pills?,Crazypillskills,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5kcurc/nmom_am_i_taking_crazy_pills/,"I'm writing this on mobile so excuse any formatting issues in advance.

&amp;nbsp;

I think I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that my mother is a narcissist and I think it's causing me emotional issues as an adult. This Christmas vacation with my mom and dad has confirmed it for me.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm currently a Junior in college with OK grades in a competitive college and school has been very stressful for me. I finally got an internship starting in spring (yay!), but I still fell short on getting into my major (I'm technically a premajor after not being able to get into Computer Science due to complications) and they're raising the GPA requirements meaning I won't be getting in and will have to review my options. I'm an only child so this has been a touchy and very relevant subject in my small family over this break. We travelled cross country and spent Christmas out of state and she used this as a talking point to upset me even when I told her I didn't want to talk about it while we were in vacation for the week.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, a lot of my frustration comes from the fact that my mom cannot communicate with me about emotional problems, at all. I've dealt with anxiety and depression the last several years and everytime I bring it up with my mom she just minimizes it. She'll say that ""most kids feel this way, college is stressful"" and if I try to argue with her, saying that doesn't make it any better, she'll get angry with me and make me feel bad for even bringing it up. This has been an on going thing and she's pretty much made it clear that unless I'm on the verge of having to be institutionalized, I'll be fine.

&amp;nbsp;

Any other conversation where she doesn't agree with my opinion will be met with a quick change in subject. For instance, she'll try to provoke my dad e.g. ask him if he's going to call my grandpa (Dad's dad) for Christmas. They have a poor relationship and almost never talk, if at all, and she knows this. So if my dad reacts, negatively even in the slightest, she'll IMMEDIATELY start asking why he has to be an asshole and make it even worse for him to deal with. ""I talk to my dad"" or ""you know, you're just like him"" or ""you never used to be like this"" will get thrown around even if he answers with a calm ""No."". At 21 years old, I've seen this happen so many times that I've begun to memorize exactly what she'll say to the T in every situation, and telling her this will send her into tantrum. If I speak up for my Dad she'll make us feel guilty for teaming up on her to make her feel bad and go on about how she hates being treated the way she does. Even if I calmly tell her that she created the situation and that I don't see how it's our fault, she tells me to just stay out of it and will immediately change the subject or start to pout. At this point if I bring it up again the rest of the days fucked and she'll just use the situation as a tool to antagonize us for the next week or so.

&amp;nbsp;

If I try to end the argument, I'll be harassed until she gets the answer she wants to hear and THEN SHE'LL end it. After that she won't let me talk anymore usually by getting irrationally upset or changing the subject/walk away. If I piss her off badly enough (disagree with her) she'll give me the silent treatment and refuse to accept an apology. One time I gave the silent treatment to her, after she did it to me, and she got so upset she broke down crying and just got in the car and drove away for an hour or so without her phone. The she came back screaming at me for being mean or something along those lines, making me feel like a piece of shit.

&amp;nbsp;

I've had many conversations with my dad about how neurotic she is and he agrees with me. However, he always tells me ""just make her happy and she'll leave you alone"" which drives me fucking insane. This requires me to be exactly how SHE wants me to be at all times or I risk setting her off, which is not hard. She can't take a joke and will actually get TRIGGERED for no reason other than sounding slightly sarcastic or not speaking loud enough. My Dad just asked her to set an alarm in the hotel room for tomorrow and it turned into argument about waking up for our flight. She started quietly crying and texting my dad (while they're lying in the same bed LMAO) bs about spending her Christmas alone next year and how he should just go stay with his family for Christmas. His phone was right next to me charging and I could see everything that popped up on his notifications. She acts like this almost every day.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, I am very financially dependent on them right now due to school and will owe them money when it's time to pay off loans. I love them both and me and my Dad get along great. I've had great moments throughout my life with my mom as well, but as of late I can barely be around her. If I don't act like a docile 13 year old, it's next to impossible to interact with her. There's been many times where I fantasize telling her to fuck off and just dropping out at this point, it's gotten so bad. It makes me question my sanity almost every time I have an interaction with her.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry if everything is a bit scattered, I'm writing this in the heat of the moment 8 hours before my flight in the morning. I just can't sleep. I have a lot more details, but I just wanted to get some of it off my mind. Thanks if you read this far. I know some of you have it a lot worse."

5kdl2g,1,2016-12-26,Budgeting and Financing for Full-time MBA,payingforMBA,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kdl2g/budgeting_and_financing_for_fulltime_mba/,"I recently received acceptance for fall 2017 to a well-renowned MBA program (one of the following programs generally ranked among the [top 5](http://poetsandquants.com/2016/11/21/2016-poetsquants-mba-ranking/3/): Kellogg, Booth, Wharton). While that's all well and good, it leaves the daunting task of trying to think through budgeting for those two years of expenses as well as how best to finance them. I would appreciate whatever insight I can get from the good people of PF.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Costs:**
The school has an estimated total cost of ~$200k for tuition, books/supplies, and living expenses across the 2 years that the program lasts (http://poetsandquants.com/2016/03/07/mba-costs-keep-rising-four-schools-now-200k/2/). This estimate does not take into account the fact that I am also married with one child (my wife doesn’t work, opting to stay home with our child full-time), and I will have to pay living expenses for the two of them as well. I’ve seen some estimates that going through an MBA with a spouse and child adds approximately $30k to the total expense. Looking through some programs’ high-level budget breakdowns (see, for example, [Kellogg](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/tuition-financial-aid.aspx), [Booth](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/full-time/admissions/tuition-financial-aid), and [Wharton](https://mba.wharton.upenn.edu/tuition-financial-aid/)), the estimated budgets feel directionally correct, but I don’t feel qualified to judge whether they match what people *actually* end up spending.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Potential Funding Sources:**
(1) As part of my acceptance, the school offered me a $60k scholarship to use towards tuition
(2) $55k available in liquid savings/investments
(3) Up to $20k from my 401k in the form of a self-loan (not looking to withdraw from it and pay early penalties for obvious reasons)
(4) Up to $41k in Federal Stafford Loans available at a fixed 5.41% interest rate
(5) Private loans at around 6.1% interest rate (available up to whatever amount I could possibly need, essentially)
(6) Some money that will likely come in during a summer internship after my first year. Typical summer MBA internships in my desired industry seem to pay around $8k/month, which is enough that it could cover all living expenses and still allow me to pocket an additional 5-10k for other expenses later on.
(7) Lastly, and most interestingly, a trust fund that was set up for me by my grandfather some time ago to use for my education. I’ve never drawn any money from the trust, instead funding my undergraduate education through scholarships and work. The trust has a current market value of about $190k, of which approximately half of it is in the form of unrealized capital gains.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Clearly being able to draw from the trust is a huge difference-maker (and a benefit for which I feel supremely fortunate). I don't have any idea where to begin, however, in navigating the paperwork, laws, and taxes around it. My limited understanding is that I would need to pay a long-term capital gains tax on the unrealized gains in addition to having to treat all disbursements as household income when I receive funds withdrawn from the trust (and given how much I would likely be withdrawing, the effective tax rate seems likely to be quite large). As a result, at this early stage I feel like I have almost no sense for how much money I could actually expect to have access to from the trust.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**TL;DR:**
I’m looking to attend a full-time 2-year MBA program, but could use PF’s help to: 
(1) Get a more accurate understanding of the likely costs (especially given that I am married with one child) and 
(2) Figure out how best to finance those costs from my available set of options. In particular, I could use help understanding how much money I can expect access to after taxes from a trust set up for me with a current market value of ~$190k.

**Childhood**

Where to start a story... I have a few memories as a young child. At the age of 3 I started playing video games. My parents bought me a Nintendo 64 at the age of 4 and it became symbolic of my childhood. Preschool went well, but I often pretended to be sick to avoid touching textures I didn't like or having to touch other children. I have vivid memories of sitting behind the counter, eating animal crackers provided, and pretending to be ill until my Mother would pick me up. I was well known among the family for staying around the adults at family parties and not associating with the other children my age. 

I remember repeatedly throwing my back against an old brown couch we used to have in joy, and my Mother’s negative reaction. Fear? Anger? I couldn’t tell, but I remember being very confused by my Mother’s reaction. My parents nicknamed me 'boohoo' because I cried so often and for reasons they couldn't understand.  I had 2 younger sisters close in age (2 and 3 years younger) and they were a large part of making my childhood a happy one. I was a tad bossy--I sabotaged their dolls and barbies and made them play Pokemon, video games, and legos/blocks with me. You know the type: I was always first player. I loved jigsaw puzzles as well. I was obsessed with Pokemon through grade school. I memorized not only their evolutionary levels, but their pokedex index, heights and weights at the time. 

I didn't really make friends in grade school. There was a boy named Nick in 2nd grade who I can only remember had Pokemon Blue and the Pokemon Master Trainer board game. I also remember walking into his house and seeing the Spyro video game displayed on the TV—hah, you can tell where my focus was even then. I was also minorly bullied in 2nd grade by a kid named Kohl.  I used to draw Pokemon at that age (go figure) but Kohl was the son of an artist and his skills dwarfed mine. He'd gather a couple of other boys and stand over my desk taunting me to draw in front of them, simultaneously making fun of every line I made. I would give myself bloody noses to avoid class--to the point the teacher openly asked what was wrong with me. 

I often touched my mouth and face. I bit my nails and picked my lips. I still do. My Mother often scolded me about touching my face. I often mumbled or spoke at a volume people couldn’t hear. “Stop with the mumbling! It’s so annoying, speak up!” she’d scold.

In school, other kids would mention my eccentric hand movements--and when I complained to my Mother she fed me the excuse of having 'Italian hands'. I couldn't sit properly in my chairs, often propping myself up on one leg (and to this day, still do). I would hide in the basement putting glue on my feet. I’d peel it off my skin for hours—I had no idea why I was more preoccupied with it compared to other children. 

In 5th grade Nick was in my class again, and I often teased him trying to get his attention. He was uncomfortable and embarrassed to be around me, but I wasn't aware at the time. I was also the Teacher's pet in that grade as well--even getting to sit in her chair, eat her candy and play computer games 6 hours a school day. I wasn’t good at math and I had difficulty memorizing things (like multiplication tables).  I did my homework assignments multiple times pushing myself to learn. Academics did not come with ease to me, but through hard work and effort.  My parents encouraged and pushed for my best similarly—praising me when my grades were good. At recess, I'd often chase a boy from down the street making hissing and growling noises at him. I was also often alone on the swings. I made a friend with a girl named Nikky who invited me to a birthday party. I went to that party, but at the sight of how many other kids were there I felt overwhelmed and ended up in the bathroom crying for reasons I couldn't understand at the time.

My parents were firmly against vaccinating because they believed it caused autism among other problems. I would bring waivers to my school.

------------------------------------
**Middle School**

I started middle school. I had no friends throughout 6th grade. I began to feel lonely. I started hiding in my closet every single night for 30 minutes at a time--having conversations with manga book covers (Rurouni Kenshin--and props if you know the character). That trend continued for a few years. I was an active kid as always, often jumping on my bed. It was around this time that I have a vivid memory of jumping on my bed, slipping and then hitting my chest on one of the ball posts on the end of the bed--falling to the floor struggling to get air. 

During middle school I became obsessed with volcanoes. I read books about volcanoes, watched movies about volcanoes and very importantly drew volcanoes. I drew the same exact, page-sized, detailed volcano over and over again for *years*. Each volcano I drew was chronologically numbered at the top. I drew somewhere over 700 volcanoes.

In 7th grade I picked up the habit of tearing out notebook paper and scrunching it up for hours in my hand during class. I found that if I did that the paper would become compressed to a smaller size, but extremely **soft**. I often stroked the 'soft' paper between my fingers and found it irresistibly soothing.

In 8th grade I was introduced to a small group of friends by a girl named Milisa from band class. It was around then I also had an eye doctor appointment, where she commented that my pupils were irregularly larger. 

I also remember sitting up by the kitchen counter and eating one of our home dinners. I bit into something descriptively 'gooey' and immediately an intensity was racing up my spine. I arched my back and spat out the food onto my plate. I vividly remember asking my sisters next to me if they 'felt food in their spine'--but they returned only confusion. To this day, I still carefully inspect my food for unpleasant textures (like in ham or chicken) and pass them discreetly to the dog. I fear trying new foods, especially one's with various textures (like sandwiches) afraid of that profoundly unpleasant *sensation* I may experience.

I started randomly making high pitched noises often—what we came to refer to as ‘meeping’ for years to come.

------------------------------------
**High School**

In high school things weren't much better. I often sat alone in a cafeteria of over 350+ students--the only one to have a whole table to themselves. I could always feel the eyes on me as I ate. I ate the same packed lunch every day, and it still hasn’t changed. Overtime I was eventually invited to a lunch table out of pity. It was often commented on during lunch conversations that everything I added seemed 'random'.  I had difficulty following conversations in groups. I would often bounce my leg and rock from one side to the other. I felt lonelier among others than I did alone. 

I hung out with that small group of friends I had made in middle school, but they'd remark with astonishment how awful it was that they were my only friends. I never hung out with them after school, but for some reason having it laid out in front of me hurt more than I cared for. I was often told how weird and strange I was, so I often exaggerated it as a joke. I still obsessively played video games.

I took a technical and mechanical design class. When it came to making shapes in inventor I was several weeks ahead of the other students—able to manipulate shapes in my mind better. My Father proudly exclaimed I took after him (little did he know in what manner). When it came to the workshop portion though, I found myself afraid of using the equipment. I did not trust the coordination of my hands and body. I wasn’t aware of my motor deficits at the time, but I knew my hand movements often felt ‘clumsy’ and ‘foreign’. I fell behind in class suddenly and didn’t finish. 

I went to band camp. My small group of friends also noticed at the age of 16 I had no idea how sex worked while joking around about Pokemon sex (I thought girls got pregnant from kissing). It was also at that time I was made very strongly aware of why I didn't want to be near other people though and I quit soon after. 

I had gym class with the girl named Milisa. At the time, I was obsessed with health (courtesy of my Mother). I talked obsessively about the subject. We were in the locker room getting dressed for volleyball practice and I was speaking on the subject again. Innocently, I remarked how unhealthy the school lunches were. Milisa erupted, she stood up suddenly from the bench and started shouting along the lines of: “Wow, you just love to rub it in my face!? You never shut up about it, shit, you’re skinny and pretty…and I’m not! You don’t have to rub it in my face you think I’m fat! You’re such a jerk!” Everyone was silent in the locker room suddenly, and all eyes turn on me. She wasn’t even overweight. I couldn’t speak, but I trembled and attempted to hide my face—the only thing I could think about was escaping. We went to volleyball practice. I kept my face hidden behind my hair. We got on the court and Milisa was on the opposing side. My motor movements have always been poorly integrated, so I am unable to set the ball when playing volleyball, only bump. Fate would have it that someone on her team spiked the ball at me, and I was too distracted by my emotional turmoil to move away. I took the shot to the face and started bleeding profusely all over the gymnasium floor. All eyes were on me again. Milisa ran over and helped me to the bathroom. She helped me clean up, but she was silent as she did so. I only repeated one phrase like a broken record: “I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I’m sorry…” I scratched my arm vigorously, my hands shaking. Eventually she spoke, scolding me for not thinking about other people’s feelings. I probably repeated that phrase over a hundred times that day and I couldn’t stop.

I started speaking much less after that.

Unknown to me I started falling into depression. I wrote poetry about gray days. I lost interest in everything. I felt tired all the time. I'd quit doing things not even 5 minutes into it. I would lay on the couch thinking of all the things I could do, but not feel like doing anything. I started to lose my appetite--my weight along with it. I had chronic and severe headaches a few times a week--doing my homework before school rather than after because of it. I focused on my grades. Spending a ton of my free time carefully doing my homework assignments and studying.

Grades, to me, were symbolic of a better future. 

I started to realize how simple it was for me to disappear and no one to notice. I’d walk a few steps back from other people—I no longer felt like I belonged. They wouldn’t even notice I started trailing behind.  I cried just looking in the mirror. I focused on everything I saw wrong. I couldn’t stop thinking.  

I was watching the world from the outside.

Around this time, I started getting involved with an online flash game community. 

------------------------------------
**College**

I went to a community college instead of away at a university. I commuted but I still struggled. I couldn’t bring myself to use the restroom at school fearing others would hear me. I ate lunch in my car every day--uncertain about the college’s cafeteria. I skipped over half of my lectures and did the majority of my studying at home. I frequently gagged each morning as I got ready for the day. I pursued Computer Engineering. I told people I wanted to go into it over Computer Science because I adored blinking lights and beeping noises. Computers behave in way that is expected.

My bedroom was moved to a different room. No longer could I spin in my chair, launch myself at my spring bed and hop—giggling and rubbing my face into the mattress incessantly. My bed was no longer a spring type, and the chair no longer had room to spin.

I started jumping around my room instead, running back and forth often throwing myself at walls and doors—the same pattern each time though. I flap my arms slightly, neck pulled back and to the right tightly. My right leg tensed and bent at the knee. I’m on my toes and my elbows touch my sides. My limbs are loose. I make strange noises. There is a mark on my wall where my hand touches the same spot while I jump. I lacked awareness about much of this, as it is a subconscious stim. It happens enough that on any day I perform the stim over 200 times—some days reaching over 400. My Mother commented on the mark in my bedroom and I honestly suggested it was from the vent. I’m ‘somewhere else’ when I do it—not even registering pain as I often collide with objects. 

I also have a subconscious aimless running stim. One moment I’d be sitting in the kitchen chair eating, the next I’d be in the front room. My family is well aware of both of these and I still do them.

My 'meeping' became louder--sometimes turning into 'squawking'.

I skipped meals. My ankles became swollen and red. My legs were littered in bruises I couldn’t remember getting. I felt exhausted often. I became ill to the point I would lose vision for over a minute just walking down the stairs. My pupils started dilating more often. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night with an intense craving for sugar. I would drive places and not remember how I got there. I began to have frequent nightmares—sleeping so disturbed my Queen-sized mattress would be on a 45-degree angle upon waking. I’d wake up some mornings covered in sweat.  My Mother began to strongly think I had anemia (because of the bruises we didn’t know were from my stimming), and she pushed me to take iron supplements. It had been over a decade since I last seen a doctor, and I was old enough to know what she was doing was wrong. I drew a line and went to a doctor. He asked me what was wrong—and I told him about my ankles and general fatigue. My blood was taken.  I was told I was experiencing hypoglycemia and to change my diet—eat more often too. What he and I didn't know was that my loss of appetite and resulting hypoglycemia was likely from depression.

My sisters often treated me to condescension and avoidance during this time. One even complained to the other how she wished I wasn’t invited to her birthday party because I was so strange. I started closing myself off. 

I started playing League of Legends, investing most of my time in playing that aside from school.

While I was having an argument with that guy online—my little brother opened the door to my room. Shocked, I immediately shut the door, locked it, and told him to stay out—not wanting him to see my tearful face. He told the parents, and they reacted righteously. My Father started harshly banging on my door, threatening me to open it or he’d break it open. Hesitantly I opened the door and my Mother’s face was there--glaring.

“What’s wrong with you?! You don’t talk to your brother like that!” she yelled.

“I didn’t want him to see me like this!”

“You know, no one in this house likes you. You are. A mean. *Nasty* person. Do you hear me!?”

“I’m not—“

“Do you think anyone in this house wants to be around you!? Huh!? You are rude to everyone in this house--always on that fucking computer. Can you not turn your attention away from it for a second!?” 

I covered my ears and backed away—sitting on my bed. “I’m not--Leave me alone. Leave me alone,” I began to repeat.

“You always do this! Talk! Use your words like a normal human being! You can’t act like this! What are you going to do in the real world!? Do you want to go to a mental hospital? Huh? Is that what you want!?”

“Leave me alone—leave me alone—leave me aloneleave mealoneleavemealoneleavalon,” I sped up, gaining volume. 

She left, shutting the door. I continued repeating, bringing my knees in close and rocking. I could hear my Father who was pointedly loud enough behind the closed door so I could hear: “You know there’s something wrong with her. She can’t be acting like this—you’re going to go to a mental hospital you keep this up!” he redirected.

Mother said something in agreement.

I kept repeating.

My trust was broken with my parents after that. Something snapped around that time. My personality became volatile—shifting around enough that my friend from that online flash game forum (I was becoming closer to) began to notice changes. 

My physical health was worse again. My hands and feet so cold I wore gloves in the house and multiple socks. They ached to move. I thought I might be having circulation problems and bought a hot foot bath. I started eating less again. My hands would shake often. I started gagging again every morning, discreetly vomiting on occasion. 

Concerned about my blood sugar again, I set out to see a doctor.  Not even 5 minutes after stepping into his office, he put his hand on my shoulder (which I was uncomfortably aware of) and told me I was showing huge flashing signs of anxiety. I disagreed with him. He set me up with blood tests, gave me a script for an SSRI, and provided me a referral to psychologist. 

I ripped up that script and referral. I’m not crazy, I thought.

I started my first internship, all my symptoms from before continued. Additionally, I became breathless often. My heart would randomly race. I would lay in bed and hear my heart pounding in my head—I remember thinking I was going to die. On the way to work I might have to pull over, sometimes feeling nauseous and even on rare occasion vomiting. I missed work a couple times because I’d break out in hot flashes and experience fainting like symptoms. I’d show up at urgent care on occasion for attacks I was experiencing. I even screamed at the nurses I was on fire one visit before passing out in the chair. 

I was convinced it was all hypoglycemia. 

I also bought a kit to check my blood sugar. I spent several months testing my blood sugar approximately twice a day—recording the readings in an excel sheet along with my symptoms. I showed up again at the doctor’s office, excel sheets in hand and attempted to convince him that blood sugar was likely the culprit. Seeing there was little convincing me he referred me to an endocrinologist. I met with that endocrinologist and had more blood tests performed, some as long as 4 hours (which I also pushed her to do). After the testing, I had to go to her office. I mixed up some things like location and time, and when I finally got there I was having a meltdown. I couldn’t speak and was escorted and treated carefully by the staff. When I sat in front of the endocrinologist again she said all my levels were normal and that I was displaying a lot of symptoms that suggested a neurological problem. She gave me a referral to a team of neurologists at a nearby university.

I ripped it up. I wasn’t *mental*. I wasn’t *weak*.

I read Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl. 

I started rewriting my personality. I spent a lot of time alone answering the questions my emotional turmoil addressed me with. I spent more time thinking. I began to understand that I couldn’t find happiness in friends because I was looking for it in the wrong place all along. I didn’t care to have friends. That’s why I didn’t pick up the phone. That’s why I never wanted to hang out after class. I wasn’t invited, but I wasn’t initiating it either. I wasn’t interested in doing things to maintain relationships. I no longer felt rejected upon realizing that it was **I** that did the rejecting. I started to notice changes. When I looked in the mirror my eyes no longer immediately drew to my flaws. For once, looking in the mirror actually made me feel impressed with myself. It was foreign and noticeable—I became aware my thinking patterns were shifted as well. They no longer spiraled downward and it was so significant and noticeable that I finally came to two conclusions: One, I had been depressed for a number of years. Two, I no longer was. I mended my trust with my siblings at this point as well.

My personality stabilized, very different from when I had been younger. I started to feel confident in my person. I talked more often and allowed my eccentric characteristics back to the surface. I was even quite cocky in demeanor. I skipped most of my classes in university still, but I spent long hours studying. I became familiar with the small place I worked and the guys that worked there. Some of my worse anxiety symptoms subsided. I started dating that close friend I met online.  I became obsessed with studying human behavior, genetics, etc. to further demystify the world around me. My studies began to mend the misconception I had about psychology and neurology.

In my senior design course I was in a group of about 8. The women in our group did nothing but boss the others around. When it came close to deadlines they threw myself and another student under a bus (creating a lie that we refused to work on it despite having put in a majority of the hours). I was told I would not graduate by my professor because of it (in caps lock, no less). I spent over 36 hours straight in the lab completing the project with the student who also did a majority of the work. Hard fought, I graduated university with a degree in computer engineering. 

------------------------------------
**And now…**

I continued working at the place I had my internship and gained a position of full time employment.  I paid off all my student loans. 

However, I found the issues I once avoided becoming a significant problem. I might be able to work on industrial applications and impressive software, but I can't do basic things like shop--can't even figure out a drive thru. At work the social interactions I have long avoided are required, and I find myself unable to use words sometimes and pointing to a notepad like I'm attempting telepathic communication. I practice at home, but I notice as soon as try speaking my thinking is switched off. The emptiness that has me grasping for words and attempting to organize my thoughts--ultimately failing and unable to meet conversational deadlines...if at all.  My anxiety also became an issue even at work, often propelled by changes to my routine. 

One day my route home was unexpectedly closed and a detour was posted. I tried to follow the detour, but I became lost. My phone was out of battery. I became increasingly distressed and drove around aimlessly panicking. A police officer noticed me and pulled me over, but with all the anxiety I couldn't speak. He managed to figure out I was lost as I repeatedly pointed to my map. He gave me directions and I managed to get home--but when I did I melted down. My parents scolded me for being weak--for not being able to handle anything. They were also frustrated with me for not thinking of using my car charger for my phone. I escaped outside and listened to the rain.

There was a different day I was running low on gas on my way home, but the gas station I routinely go to was further away. I passed several gas stations. I ran low, panicked, and then exited the freeway and drove into the first parking lot I saw--a hospital parking lot. I called my parents unreasonably distressed--my words broken. I started hyperventilating and sweating. My Father showed up and was able to help me, but informed me they originally thought I was inside the hospital the way they deciphered it--and were simply relieved to figure out that wasn't the case. My Father helped calm me down and get me back home.

I consistently couldn't handle simple changes, sporadic events, or basic communication with clients.

I'd often find myself feeling like I was being suffocated while sitting in a crowded car--like on the way to lunch with coworkers. I was still experiencing the symptoms from before--accelerated heart rate, shaking hands, gagging, etc. 

I **finally** set up an appointment with a therapist.

I recorded my stimming for one appointment—and it was the first time I actually saw myself doing it. I cried watching it. I was rather quickly informally diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Chronic Tic Disorder, and an Anxiety Disorder. I asked for a formal diagnosis some visits later when I was ready, which I was given rather effortlessly.  I had significant sensory issues, most notably hyposensitive proprioceptive and vestibular—which is why, for example, I repetitively jump around in a cringe-like fashion and accumulate injuries without notice. I have eight large bruises right this moment on my legs alone because of it. Tactile—which is why I stim often by feeling fine textures (denim jeans or this texture from a leftovers’ box I cut out, for example). Auditory—why I often have to pretend I understand what people are saying to me.  

Many things began to make sense after I was diagnosed—why I made loud noises multiple times a day, why my head has been chronically tilted right since I was a child, why I rocked often, why I often took sarcasm literally, why, why and *why*. It provided me with clarity for my behaviors. It helped me understand that there were some elements beyond my control and that just because something was psychological or neurological didn’t entail that it was directly under my control. Further, knowing I had alexithymia helped me understand why I associated my emotional and mental state with physical conditions—because I couldn’t identify them.  I finally understood where my weaknesses were and what strategies I could use to better support those things. There are many things I still work on and will always struggle with, but they are simply my own personal set of challenges.

I’m currently saving up for my own place to share with my SO and I have a bright future ahead of me. For now, I still live with my parents, although I can’t tell them I attend therapy or that I’ve been diagnosed with autism.  I have tested the waters once by informing them that my noise making was a result of a chronic tic disorder--but was treated to senseless mockery when I attempted to explain it being neurological. I was told that I do not have brain damage and that the tic, they aggressively informed me, was a result of 'magnesium deficiency'. My Mother has since bought products to aid in naturally curing my verbal tics. 

I am now leading a **happy** life though and looking back—I’d write it all the same way. My challenges shaped me into who I am and still do. I like the person I turned out to be and the future I earned. This year I celebrate having successfully worked a full year at my job.

I made it here. We have to understand our weaknesses, our struggles and yet *still* find a way to manage, fight for our happiness, and focus on our strengths.  

What I’m hoping others will take away from this is that maybe you *aren’t* having a good year. I’ve met and heard from plenty of people that have had even harsher challenges. I want to let you know that maybe this year wasn’t yours, but maybe the next will be. Don’t sit at your obstacles, but push yourself over them. Maybe you weren’t born ‘gifted’ or ‘savant’—so what? I wasn’t either of those things. You can influence your future. Perhaps start this upcoming year by addressing what you want and your idea of tackling it. It might not work right away, heck, it might even take years. You have to forge a better future for yourself and not wait for it—you probably know at this point the world won’t do it for you."
5keece,54,2016-12-26,Do you have any good memories of past relationships?,M3cha,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/5keece/do_you_have_any_good_memories_of_past/,"I recently experienced a breakup with my ex a couple months ago. First girlfriend, the first one is the hardest, yadda yadda. I have so many good memories of that relationship!

I first professed my love to her when I was headed to San Diego for a family vacation. 22 at the time, stuck with family, and the girl I loved was doing an internship in Maryland. The huge gulf of time and distance was worrying me. As I was leaving with my family, I was texting my ex and kinda just casually mentioned my love for her. 

She texted back ""haha"". A pause. Then: ""wait are you serious?""

I definitely was. For the 3 months she was in Maryland, I woke up 3 hours early to talk with her in the morning. Talked with her constantly throughout the day and we texted pictures back and forth, usually about what we were doing our where we were.

My birthday was in the middle of her internship and she sent me a care package to my house full of cookies she baked and a letter. I had sent a care package with her to Maryland with candies she could eat, my personal copy of Stargate (one of my all time favorite movies), and a letter about my feelings.

We started dating for real a couple weeks after she came back.

It's such a positive memory for me, haha. While I'm sad the relationship ended, I can only remember the good parts of the relationship, which outnumbered the bad to an extreme degree. 

How about you guys? Do you have any positive lasting memories from past relationships?"

In the past month I have been rejected by all of the graduate schemes I applied to, one was two days before Christmas. The same happened last year. I struggle to get any kind of job and my history is littered with temporary assignments. My latest application is for a stockroom assistant post in a retail store.

Everyone has moved forward in life apart from me. A lot of people my age have started families of their own, whilst some have obtained careers, even abroad - really exciting careers that I would give my right arm for. I feel lonely, and I still sleep in my teenage bedroom.

I went to university later than most, but my grades could not be any better. I published work in a physics journal in my final year and I volunteered. I don't have a sparkly internship like other people. Internships are just as competitive as paid roles and they have all rejected me in the past. Everyone who applies for these so called ""graduate"" roles are already armed to the teeth with experience.

I feel like I haven't even started my life. Careers, relationships, you name it.

Having a really big dilemma. My brother is in his second year at college studying IT and I have been helping him apply for jobs and internships since he was 17. He has only really done a few part time things with my family's sign company, but I want him to try something more official and relevant.

Recently, through a lot of contacting other departments in our university, we secured him a job as a tutor in the Computer Programming department, making $11 an hour. I love it because it's not a big time commitment (10hrs per week) and it's relevant to his field. 

My dad is very controlling and verbally abusive. When I moved out to college, he said I would never fnid a job without his help. I instantly got my first job, and make a decent part-time income. I still visit home every weekend, but now I can just take an Uber back to my college whenever he starts insulting me.

He has been telling my brother not to accept the position because he doesn't want him to have to work. He wants to keep babying him, since he knows that I can't be under his control anymore. I don't fully understand why my dad is trying to mess this up for him, but I'm worried that since my brother lives with him, he might start to believe him or get manipulated.

Any ideas on what I can do? I want to invite my brother more often to my dorm as an escape, but he refuses because he wants to play his video games in his room. How can I talk to my dad about this?

5kfbw0,0,2016-12-26,Marvel's Fantastic Four: Coming to Netflix [FAN PITCH],gkkiller,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/5kfbw0/marvels_fantastic_four_coming_to_netflix_fan_pitch/,"I had this idea after watching the disaster that was F4NTASTIC (2015) ... What if Marvel makes Fantastic Four a Netflix show? And it ties into Doctor Strange too! Here's my idea. It draws on some F4 characters and combines some of them a bit, too. 

Season 1 is divided into Act 1, Act 2 and Act 3. Act 1 introduces the Four themselves, Act 2 sets up the conflict and the villains, and Act 3 delivers a resolution. 

Act 1 - ORIGIN: The very first episode introduces us to Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben, who have had their powers for a few weeks at this point, and shows them working as a team under Dr Franklin Storm at the Baxter Building. Dr Storm is trying to understand the nature of the Four's powers. The Baxter Building is a former SHIELD facility, having been nationalised, and is now divided into several teams. We are also introduced to the ambitious Andrew Burchill, who heads a military robotics project and is competing for funding with Dr Storm, and Owen Reece, a shy low-level intern. We learn that the Four received their powers in an accident when they were trying to reverse engineer Dr Erik Selvig's gateway device, after which they have been placed under 'house arrest' and are confined to the Baxter Building. Reed's family believes that he is at college, while Ben has cut off contact with his own family. Burchill is secretly attempting to use Chitauri technology to improve his robots' artificial intelligence. The accident itself is not shown (except in bits and pieces) until the later episodes. 

Tony Stark announces a hefty grant for the Baxter Building, research funding to be given to the most accomplished team. It is soon apparent that the only real contenders are Dr Storm's team and Burchill's robotics team. Although Dr Storm believes that the grant will enable the team to rebuild the Gateway device, and better understand their powers, his team is not in complete agreement that this is a good idea. Johnny in particular is enamoured by his powers and wants nothing more than to escape the Baxter Building, while Ben bottles his self-resentment in the hopes that Dr Storm can cure him. Furthermore, they do not have concrete results to show from their work, which could put them out of the running for the grant. On the other hand, Burchill believes that the Storm team is more accomplished than they really are, and wants the grant to further his own ambition. Spurred on by an anonymous admirer of his work online, he acts in haste, implementing Chitauri technology without rigourous testing. As a result, Burchill's military robots gain sentience. 

At the demonstration, things seem to be going fine for Burchill, until his robots malfunction. They spiral out of control when the Chitauri tech takes over, identifying all humans as hostile, and a fight breaks out. This leads the Four to jump into action, and they eventually destroy the robots. The grant is awarded to a different team, but Stark himself donates a small amount to Dr Storm's team in gratitude. Burchill is disgraced and fired. 

Act 2 - SCHISM: Work on the Gateway device continues, but Johnny's misgivings about recreating the accident become more apparent. Tension within the team rises. Dr Storm himself is privately troubled by self-doubt as a result, but continues to strive on. With the additional funding, the second Gateway is nearly finished. However, Johnny refuses to cooperate and withdraws his participation in the project, believing that the accident will result in something even worse. 

Meanwhile, independent of Dr Storm or any authorities, the Four privately conduct their own investigation into the Burchill incident, as Reed believes that something is suspicious. This leads to a discovery: Ben finds out that Owen Reece, the intern, was the one who massaged Burchill's ego, knowing that it would lead him to screw up. Ben is troubled by the revelation, but Reece convinces him to keep it a secret. He persuades Ben that it was for the greater good, as the accident led to funding for Dr Storm's team. Ben later decides to confide in Reed, but before he can do so, they discover that Johnny is nowhere to be found. The Baxter Building goes into lockdown, while Johnny escapes into New York City. During lockdown, Reece later destroys the evidence leading back to him, which means that Ben is the only one who knows the truth. He also steals the work of the team that did receive the funding: a psionic device nicknamed the Wand, meant to be used as an industrial tool. 

In New York, Johnny indulges himself, going on a drinking binge and street racing. Eventually, the government catches up with him, which leads to a scuffle. When Johnny realises how much damage his powers cause to property and people, he surrenders, and is taken back to the Building. Lockdown is lifted, but the Wand is nowhere to be found. Ben realises what has happened, and tells Dr Storm, but Reece has also disappeared. 

Simultaneously, a series of flashback side-plots follow Victor von Doom, a charismatic young genius who returns to his home country of Latveria in 2009, shortly after obtaining his second master's degree at the age of 21. The von Dooms are an offshoot of the old Latverian royal family, although Latveria has been a democratic republic for the last two centuries, which makes Victor the sole heir. The current President of Latveria, Vladimir Fortunov, is a puppet for the US government. Filled with hatred for the pitiful state of his nation, von Doom begins garnering support from the shadows and orchestrating a conspiracy to seize control. At the same time, he ingratiates himself in political circles, and eventually becomes part of the Ministry of Technological Development. In 2013, Vladimir Fortunov is re-elected (in a rigged vote) for a third term. He appoints the 23-year-old Victor von Doom, Minister of Technological Development. 

ACT 3 - COUP: All plot threads come to a head in the final arc. The Gateway device is finished, and the Four are now in agreement that they must recreate the accident and travel through the wormhole. However, before they can do so, Dr Storm is arrested, as Reece has framed him for tampering with Burchill's devices. Government agents attempt to arrest the Four as well, but they escape the Building. Sue hacks Reece's email and they find that he might be hiding at an abandoned trailer park outside the city. There, they find that he has converted the trailer park into a laboratory and has weaponised the Wand, which he plans to present as his own work. Reece returns and is ambushed by the Four, but holds them off by using the Wand, revealing that he has enhanced its capabilities so that he can control it mentally through a headpiece. They eventually outsmart him, using an electromagnet to disrupt Reece's headgear while they take the Wand. The Four then apprehend Reece and turn him in, clearing Dr Storm's name. The Four's authorisation is finally cleared, allowing them to go out in public once again. 

In Latveria, it is almost election time again. Victor von Doom, now in a position to make real changes, has revitalised Latveria and is making his mark on the rapidly developing country. His popularity is increasing, and rumours say that he will soon run for President. Feeling threatened, President Fortunov tries to have Doom assassinated: first, by a car bomb, and then, by a sniper at a public function. However, both times, von Doom's spies come to his rescue and prevent his death. Fortunov then devises another plot to take Doom out of the picture. He invites Doom on a month-long diplomatic trip to America. 

In the USA, Doom attends a conference at his alma mater, MIT, where he meets Reed Richards, also in attendance, over their shared intrigue in extradimensional travel. Reed also invites Doom to the Baxter Building. An offhand comment by Reed leads Doom to seek out a new contact in America: the disgraced Andrew Burchill. When Doom learns of the Baxter Building incident, he asks Burchill to provide him a favour; in exchange, he will enable Burchill to take revenge on Dr Storm. Doom meets with Owen Reece in prison and learns of the Wand. Using Reece's modifications to the Wand technology, given to him by Doom, and his own Chitauri-modified robotics technology, Burchill builds a 10-foot-tall android. While his intent is to control it mentally, the Chitauri technology causes Burchill's consciousness to be channeled into the android, while his own body is rendered catatonic. The Android proceeds to rampage through New York and assaults the Baxter Building in search of Dr Storm. Although the Four protect him and eventually manage to shut down the Android, Dr Storm sustains grave injuries, eventually leading to his death. 

Doom learns of the attack on a train as he travels to New York to visit the Baxter Building, and finally reveals his ambitions to Fortunov: he plans to rule Latveria. Fortunov orders his soldiers to kill Doom, but Doom has planned for the assassination attempt, knowing Fortunov's plot all along. The soldiers turn on Fortunov, and Doom contacts his men in Latveria. He orchestrates a silent coup, reinstating the monarchy, making his ambitions reality. 

The series comes to a close in the Baxter Building. The Four decide to abandon the Gateway device; their powers helped them protect Dr Storm, and they are better off with them. Doom visits the Baxter Building and has a conversation with Reed about the device, which turns to a discussion of his own political ambitions. Reed disagrees with Doom's means, even after Doom explains his motive: to free his country from what he sees as servitude, and to bring glory to a downtrodden nation. Reed agrees to donate the Gateway device to Doom, who transports it to Latveria. The closing scene shows Doom instructing his men to use Burchill's robotics technology to 'build an army'. He then turns his attention to the Gateway device, which he activates and attempts to use. This results in an explosion, although Doom survives. The final shot focuses on Doom's castle in Latveria, his screams echoing. "
5kfccl,1,2016-12-26,University charging me for Federal Subsidized Direct Loan and the money I paid is unaccounted for,adviceseekinghandle,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/5kfccl/university_charging_me_for_federal_subsidized/,"Hello /r/StudentLoans.

As the title says, my university charged me what amounted to $2498 in September of 2016. I went to a public university and graduated in May of 2016. On My Finances under my student account, this fee is listed as ""DLS1 16Fed Subsid Dir Loan 1"" for the Spring 2016 term. I took part in a pilot for an internship with the university where a non-university-affiliated benefactor donated a large sum so that students and recent alumni like myself could work full-time for 10 weeks and be paid $5000 stipend. This money had to go through the university's financial aid department and be given as ""gift aid.""

My university's financial aid department is very difficult to contact, and I moved back home, which is 500 miles away from the university. I've had to do all my correspondence via telephone, and the last actual conversation I've had with someone from the department was about 1 1/2 months ago. (They recently consolidated all their services into a ""Central"" phone number, which means a lot of the time I get told ""We're experiencing a high call volume and can't answer you. Goodbye,"" after having waited 10 minutes on the call).

During that conversation, I asked why I was being charged this amount for the Spring semester in September. I was told that this was because for the Spring semester, I had already reached my ""gift aid"" cap because the $5000 stipend put me way over the cap.  I made it clear I was worried I'd just lose $2500 dollars for reasons not being made clear to me. The person I spoke with assured me that the $2500 I needed to pay would go toward my federal student loans instead and wouldn't just disappear, and advised me to make this payment before starting my monthly payments toward Greater Lakes. I made this payment toward the university under the impression it would have an impact on the total sum of all my Stafford loans. I've checked Great Lakes regularly since I made that payment on 12/19, and that number has stayed a solid $24,600.

I have no idea what that payment has actually gone toward. When I called Great Lakes, the person I spoke with told me that ""if the Financial Aid person said that's what the payment is going toward, then wait 3-5 business days for it to process."" It's been 5 business days, but so far nothing has changed on Great Lakes and I'm getting worried.

I don't even know how to approach it. I'm angry that I worked full time for that 10 week period, but the university seems to have just taken away half of that for what seems like a bullshit reason. I'd be fine if it had actually gone toward my Stafford loans, but it appears that they just made an extra charge on my account that LOOKS like a Direct Subsidized Loan, but isn't. (It's also not listed on Great Lakes - the last Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford loans that are listed there were distributed in September 2015).

MyFinAid states that for the 2015-2016 year, my Cal Grant A Fee Award, Federal Pell Grant, and Undergraduate Grant total $18,303, while the ""stipend"" is listed there under ""Other Gift Aid"" as an extra $5000, bringing my gift aid total to $23,303. My Federal Subsidized Direct Loan is $2949, Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan is $1107. MyFinAid doesn't state what semester they're for, but by looking at Great Lakes' breakdown, they seem to correspond to the loans distributed Fall 2015. It says nothing about the ""DLS1 16Fed Subsid Dir Loan 1"" fee of $2498 charged in September 2016 on My Finances at Cal Central.

I don't know what to do. I understand that I got too much gift aid, but I don't know where the payment I made to My Finances at Cal Central went. Who do I need to call? The university isn't answering my calls and the office is on Holiday for an indefinite period (the call I made today doesn't give a return date). I plan to call Great Lakes tomorrow (they're on holiday as well, but the message they left said they'd return by tomorrow), but I wouldn't know how to phrase my questions.

I want to understand where my money went."

We have never broken up. We have had fights and stuff, but nothing to crazy. However, this past month has been a disaster. I decided to go on spring break and she was not overly thrilled about that, I was supposed to be with her on Christmas, but went to a once in a lifetime chance to go to a football game. I ended up having to much too drink and went to her house. I was doing okay, playing it off nicely til she gets her present and says I did not really put a lot of effort into it. After this I get pissed tell my mom to come get me, now everything just got worse, no screaming match or anything, but her parents were pissed. We are in a huge fight now. The problem is we have no common interests are three hours away in college, I am moving somewhere this summer for an internship and she informed me that she will come up there and live with me a couple years out of college. So, now this would 6 years of seeing each other every once and awhile. I love her a lot, but am seeking advice on how I should proceed. We just have not been in a good place for awhile. No real physical intimacy anymore either. I agree that it almost all my fault, but I am tired of mentally hurting her. I love her to much to see this keep going like this. I am working on changing myself too. If I did end things, what would be the most non-hurting way to do it?"

5kfks0,0,2016-12-26,Should blizzard port WoW to consoles?,orchardtemplar,MMORPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/5kfks0/should_blizzard_port_wow_to_consoles/,"Let's just get the obvious replies out of the way, knowing people will say things like, ""Never, the game was designed for keyboard and mouse"" with counters like, ""Look at FFXIV! So many skills can be mapped to a controller""

Blizzard could obviously port WoW to next gen consoles and have skills logistically mapped to a controller. The game could run without breaking a sweat, the question is how they could implement it, and if it would be worth it in the long run. Lets take a look at what would need to be done.

Separate Servers: When this question gets asked on official forums or places like MMO-Champion a sense of PC elitism is brought to the forefront, and rightly so. A player with a keyboard and mouse will have an advantage in most genres, especially with a theoretical WoW console port with how the game was designed. Bosses/Mobs would be nerfed compared to their PC counterparts, and chat/communication would need to be handled differently. 

Action Camera: Why would blizzard even make a tool like this, and is it telling of things to come? On the PC side of things where this feature would NEVER be competitive, even at lower levels of PvP/Raiding, this feature seems like a waste to work on unless it was done by some interns as a side project. The feature can be used in the live game, but requires a chat command, and an add on to adjust its full functionality. But if a console version came out, a locked action camera which would automatically zoom out for combat could work beautifully, and look stunning as well.

UI Revamp: We are half of the way there, and I expect more to come. Parts of the stock UI we have today look so dated, and it would surprise me to not see changes in the next expansion. With a simpler UI similar to other RPGs of recent years(like Souls games, Skyrim, etc.) combined with the aforementioned Action Cam, this game could look very good on consoles, especially if they decided to make PS4 pro/Scorpio adjustments for 4k tvs and such. 

Combat: We have already seen many skill animations updated, and the game looks the best it ever has. Other ranged classes are in dire need of updates as well however. Mobs/NPCs/Players would probably need to have Collision at such a close range/camera angle.

So why not have two separate versions of the game, and try to grab some of these massive playerbases? Diablo made a successful move to console, and Overwatch launched on both. A better trial version would be needed, with something like free to play to 100 etc. There could be in game awards for blizzard games for trying out the console version, i'm sure many Overwatch players would try it out.

Personally I believe it would be an incredibly smart move, but what do you guys think?

5kfv6l,7,2016-12-26,It finally happened.,nadrekab,radio,https://www.reddit.com/r/radio/comments/5kfv6l/it_finally_happened/,"After chasing the dream of a bright career in radio, I've finally exited. Last Thursday I left my station for the last time.

I worked as an intern and eventually a producer at one of the largest and most well-known radio stations in the country. I've worked with legends in the business. Then I became a board op and mini-engineer at SiriusXM. (I say min-engineer because I had to solve many engineering issues since our channel had a studio away from the rest of SXM.) This year I had job interviews with high-profile stations and shows in other major markets, but nothing panned out.

I've always worked other jobs to support this dream. Finally, another company offered me a full-time, better paying job. My days were easily 13+ hours, 6 days a week, and now I will have a normal schedule.

People have offered their congratulations and asked if I'm excited or happy. Honestly, I don't know what to tell them. Radio is all I've ever wanted to do with my life.

I don't write this post to sound negative or fish for condolences, but rather look to advice. So to anyone who has left the industry, I have to ask - what were your emotions after leaving?"

This is my experience the past 6months, I didn't want to write this story the way I usually write, but rather small, quick sentences which catch my thoughts at that moment. Sorry if it's annoying to read this way of typing, just an experiment.

--------------------------------------------------------

It's a month or so before summer hits. Sex has been dwindling, girlfriend has been stressed out at school. Me too, but I'm  a strong guy, right? Figure it's the stress on her part that we aren't having much sex. 
Spend some evenings at girlfriend helping her with homework hoping she will have time for me after and be less stressed out. I know nothing about nor have much interest fashion. But whatever, I'll help you, because I love you. Finish her homework together, I want to go to bed, she says.  Okay cool, I go home. 
 Summer is nearly here, she tells me she might want to get a summer job in a different country (about 2 hour flight away, Europe). Cool I say, who am I to stop you from perusing your dreams. I really mean it. I would never want to stop anyone from doing what they want while they are young and have the world to explore, and I guess it isn't too far away, I can visit. 
Before she goes to the summer job we plan a holiday together to some Greek island. She doesn't have much money. It's okay I say, I will help you with paying. She is my girlfriend, has had a stressful couple of months, I don't mind paying a little extra if that means we're able to get away together.

Spend 8 days together, great holiday, except....we have sex ONCE.  I initiated nearly every day but ""we can't leave the hotel room too late, will be waste of holiday!"" and other similar excuses. Holy fuck I think to myself, I spend 8 days ALONE with my girlfriend and we have sex once? Fuck if this is my relationship at 23.

I don't mention I'm unhappy but yeah I'm disappointed.  Before she leaves for the summer job we have sex a couple times, can't remember exact number.
OK, she's at the summer job now, great. We don't see each other for 3 weeks. Then it is time to visit, can't wait to fuck her brains out! I sit in the train for 8 hours, finally arrive. She's really happy to see me, I'm really happy to see her. First night it's late, we head to bed, I try to initiate but she isn't feeling it and wants to sleep. OK, can happen I guess. Second day, same thing. Third day, still nothing. Fourth day, we have sex. It lasts like 10minutes because she's tired. Next day she's tired again at night, I pathetically beg her to let me finger her, nope. Just reading that makes me cringe. We don't have any sex for any of the other 3 days I'm there. 8th day, I head home.  Sit in the fucking train for 8hours again. Arrive home, guess I'll fap.

It's late at night. Receive a long text message from her. Oh boy, wonder what this is about. Start reading, she says she loved it that I came to visit but that I must be disappointed about the lack of sex and she apologises saying she just makes very long days and is tired. I am kind of glad, atleast she acknowledges the fact we barely had sex! I don't want to be too harsh, send back that I know that she has long days and yes I was disappointed but we should make up for it when she arrives back home.

She arrives home couple weeks later. Have sex maybe 4th day she is back. Remember her text message, I start logging my calender in my mobile phone whenever we have sex (i'll tell you results end of post) because maybe I'm just crazy? She is actively avoiding sex now. ""We have to go X now!"", ""Lets not hang around in bed too long"" (should see her face when I jump out of bed and use this sentence on her, she's lazy.) , ""hungry, lets go get breakfast downstairs""  or any other excuse. I know she is avoiding it, and it's hurting. Any attempt to initiate is shot down, again. This is hurting my self esteem.
Have a friends birthday. Make a joke about her. Female friend jokingly says ""oh you watch out or you wont get anything tonight"", I laugh and say ""Oh I wasn't getting anything anyway"" ..some people laugh,  probably because they don't think I'm telling the truth. I'm dying inside. 

Next day. I remember the comment I made last evening, this is a signal that I should confront her with the lack of sex the past few weeks since she returned from holiday, rather than make passive aggressive comments at a birthday party. Tell her that I love her and think our relationship is great but the lack of sex and intimacy is killing me. She tells me she has spoken about this with  a friend and suspect it might be her changing her birth control a few months back. She says ""doesn't know why she doesnt want sex"". I ask her if I think she finds me attractive, she says she does, I ask if there is anything else I can do to help her. She says no. I chose to believe her story about birth control and tell her I don't want her to do anything she doesn't want to do. Who the hell wants pity sex? I want her to WANT ME, not just have sex with me out of fear of a breakup. I tell her I will stop initiating if she doesn't want sex because it just hurts me and makes her feel uncomfortable. She says she will go to the doctor soon to get new birth control. I'm happy we had a good conversation about this and hope that different birth control will fix the problems. She has a very busy internship and can't really go to the doctor for something like this so I will have to wait a few weeks, OK.....we'll see I guess?  Fast forward 5 weeks later. Still no sex. I've been thinking about cheating and/or breaking up a lot. She doesn't seem to be aware of any problems at all, how the fuck? Maybe I'm just good at masking it, I guess. Sexual frustration is high. 
She tells me she has holidays from her internship from like the 17th of December till 3rd of January. Tell her she should finally go to the doctor, she says yes, I will go next week.


Fast forward a week or so, It's now 27th of december. Still no doctor visit. Last 2 times we had sex was, this hurts typing....9th and 27th of SEPTEMBER (this was AFTER she returned from her summer job). After that: NOTHING, no handjob, no blowjob, no NOTHING, never even touched my penis for 3 MONHTS.  Great christmas though past days! But my frustration is huge. Not going to bring it up again, she should be actively fixing the problem her self, not because I nag her about it. Thinking back at the past couple of months blows my mind. I've told her multiple times I NEED sex or masturbation every day because it really helps me relieve some stress. Told her I don't expect sex every day. 2 or 3 times a week would make me a happy man, even though my libido craves for more, I'm aware you need to settle somewhere in the middle. But the fact she has left me sexless when she KNOWS this and has acknowledged there is a problem is mind baffling to me and makes me really angry and frustrated. You have a mouth, you have hands, use them for 15minutes if you don't feel like having sex...it would atleast show you're trying. Meanwhile a girl at university told me I was wearing a pretty shirt because it matched my eyes and proceeded to playfully squeeze my arm.  This simple gesture made my week, why? Because it showed someone appreciating me, showing some kind of affection. A year ago this gesture would've been in my mind for maybe 1 hour, I'm a confident guy who works out 5 days a week and was popular with the girls when I was younger, yet now my confidence has been hurt badly due to this situation.

Reading /r/db for the past couple of months, especially from the older guys out here almost begging for young guys like me to get out while we're fresh and unmarried has got me thinking. It's a shame really, she's so pretty and MY GIRLFRIEND, yet when I'm walking on the streets with her and guys think ""damn I'm jelous of that dude banging her""  all I'm thinking is ""only if you knew...."".  

I know what to do guys, this relationship most likely doesn't have a future. It's difficult, seeing a girl every day for 2.5 years and sharing everything you have together isn't a small thing...but I guess it really is time to break up with her soon. 

Thank you for reading my vent, and thanks to the experienced users here who can help young guys like me not feel guilty for ""breaking up just because of sex"" but really notice the problems that go with such a situation.

5khdn7,9,2016-12-26,This show makes no sense!,bille2021,blindspot,https://www.reddit.com/r/blindspot/comments/5khdn7/this_show_makes_no_sense/,"So we semi binged the show. We started the show during season one for about 5 or 6 episodes, then just came back to it in the last few weeks, finishing most of season 2 today.  
  
Season 1 was okay. Had a decent plot-line and I thought it had a lot of room to grow. But season 2 just ruined anything that could have been.  
  
1. The show was about using the tattoos to simultaneously catch bad guys and embed Jane into the FBI. Season 2 abandoned this altogether, I think prematurely, and didn’t look back. Bad move IMO.  
2. They don’t seem to know anything about simple gov’t structure. Like Weller. What exactly is his position? They say Asst. Director of the FBI, but that wouldn’t make any sense posted in NY and leading a field team. That would be a DC desk/meeting/exec job wouldn’t it?? Then you have Naz injected to the team from NSA and suddenly she runs the show as to how they operate? No way, at best she’d be a liaison embedded into the team, but most likely a go between for Weller’s team and NSA. But left in charge when Weller is missing, not a chance!! Get real. They could have paid an intern for a week to research some of this.  
3. Sand Storm…what are they doing? I don’t get the plan, but that’s okay, either do they. So they erase Janes mind, and she hatched the plan. Her lover is her handler, kind of a trigger wouldn’t you say? Then when he’s out we have her brother who has been through all the tragedy and trained as an elite fighter from early child hood come in the picture, then the woman that supposedly loves them, and they love her as a mother, but when they find out Jane is working with the FBI, their just gonna kill her?…uh, hello, this seems like the most likely outcome didn’t it? There really was no plan for this other than kill her as a trader for not remembering…what they intentionally made her forget?
4. More Sand Storm: Okay, so the mission starts out okay. Get Jane in, get them to trust her, use the tattoos to take out general bad guys and gov’t operations that are ruining the country (Orion). They are using the tattoos for good to work out a long term plan to take down those parts of the Gov’t and they are going after things like sex slave rings. All good. Then season 2 hits, and its all about a pending plan as of right now. We go from patriots working a well thought out plan (well, a plan at least) to all of a sudden, they want to just blow up power grids with no worry about civilian life and suddenly want to just kill the entire FBI team? What sense does this make in any realm?  They supposedly started this to stop the Gov’t from killing innocent people from the inside, and they turned into a common terror group with no warning or reason? Horrible horrible story line.
5. Patterson…ugh. This may be just because I work in the network security field, but again, an intern with very little research could hammer Patterson out. Writing code for other another agency’s programs on the spot. Supper hacking on the spot. Not just breaking encryption, but writing encryption algorithms to break encryption...on the spot? Come on, someone in some room in the development phase had to say something about some of this…right? This isn’t how this works, this isn’t how any of this works!!  
  
Okay, that was just on the top of my head. I didn’t go read online about the show or anything, so I am only going off of what was on the show. If I missed some major plot points that make some of this show make more sense, please clue me in.

I hope I will be hired on when I graduate, but either way I'm not making a whole lote of money at the moment: ~$16k a year since I'm working part time.

After I pay all my expenses (which isn't a lot, eating out and car maintenence, mostly), I have been leaving the rest of my money in a savings account. Now that I'm getting closer to having 5 digets in there, I'm wondering if it's the best place to keep it. On one hand, my car is 18 years old, and I'll probably need a new one soon. I'm also considering moving out sometime in 2017 (provided I get hired after I graduate in the spring), and I know I'll need money for that. On the otherhand, I have more than I need for an emergency fund, so having all that extra money sitting around earning under-inflation-interest isn't making it work for me.

Does anybody have advise on striking a balance between knowing I'll have lots of expenses within a year or two, but wanting my money to work for me now?"

&amp;nbsp;


I occasionally suffer bouts of low motivation, but most of the time I am highly motivated, even workaholic I would say. I go to one of the top universities in the country and am set for a highly prestigious job, which I got by hard work. It’s almost compulsive levels, where I feel the need to always be chasing a goal- taking hard classes, studying a lot, getting internships, competitions, leadership positions, etc- but the goals never satisfy me completely. I get a flicker of enjoyment, but I feel mostly hollow on the inside. The truth is, I don’t enjoy anything really. TV, videogames, movies, hanging out with friends, hobbies- I try to force myself to go to social events and pursue new hobbies, and I tell myself I like it, but I really don’t… I just pretend. I think my anhedonia actually motivates me to work so much- since nothing is really that enjoyable, I might as well be doing something productive. It helps me feel like not a total piece of shit. Work actually keeps me going, I think- when I lose hold of my discipline, I spiral totally out of control and fall into deep depression and suicidal thoughts.


&amp;nbsp;


I don’t know what to do- I do everything “right”. I exercise, sleep enough, eat healthy, get sun/Vitamin D. I try to force myself to do “fun” stuff, over and over, in hopes that things will change, but they never do. I just don’t like life much I guess, and really- I’ve been this way for pretty much my entire life. Is there anyone else who feels this way?

Oh, sure, she was happy for the two of 'em, but mostly she was happy that the ceremony was finally over and everyone could fucking relax for a little bit.

Chloe was a great friend of her's and, though the two had been friends for a very long time, Ashley still felt like she hardly knew her best friend after today. I mean, sure, some people move through life faster than others, but *married at twenty two*? Jesus, Ashley was only a year behind her and she could hardly hold a boyfriend for more than a few days.

Still, she was happy for her bestie. Chloe had met Mark through an internship, playing the stereotypical role of the office assistant who fell for her boss. Mark was a great guy, though, even if he was ten or so years older than Chloe, and the two *did* make a super cute couple. Still, Ashley couldn't help but silently judge for the rather quick development Chloe had gone through.

Of course, she also couldn't help but feel like *she* was being silently judged by quite a lot of people in the audience. Chloe looked so perfect in her tight white dress and dolled up blonde hair, but she looked...well, to be honest, she figured she looked a bit slutty. Not really knowing how to dress ""fancy"", she'd put on a bit too much eyeshadow and eyeliner and, complimented by her wavy black hair, it made her look a bit too much like an ""adult entertainer"" for her own liking. This was, of course, complimented by the fact that she'd forgotten to rent a new dress and had to go with the simple black one that she'd worn for her high school prom. It was a fine looking dress, but her chest had grown from fitting in her handfulls to fitting in a doucle-D bra size, so the fact that the dress was made for a smaller measurement made her breasts 'pop' just a bit too noticeably.

Of course, all of this wouldn't have been overly remarkable if she wasn't *the only bridesmaid* attending. Oh sure, it was gimmicky, but Chloe had insisted that Ashley be the only bridesmaid at the wedding because they were ""totally besties"" and she didn't want to diminish the value of her best friend or...something like that. Ashley figured it was mainly because Chloe was only ever partying, hanging out with her fiance, hanging out with her, or some combination of the above and never actually speaking to anyone else, so she *might* not have enough friends to invite. Still, the fact that six groomsmen stood on the opposite end of the alter was...daunting, to say the least, if only in symbolism.


---


Right, so, obviously a pretty loose prompt. As you can probably tell, the prompt boils down to ""Ashley is a hot girl dressed provocatively at a wedding. Slutty things happen."" What those slutty things *are*, however, is totally up for us to decide!

There are some prompts that are just staples of weddings and some that I was obviously leading up to, of course. Maybe the groom snags Ashley for a bit of side action, or maybe he has a bit of fun with his newlywed wife and her best friend in the back room? Maybe, since it's traditional for the best man and braidsmaid or maid of honor to date, Ashley ends up ""dating"" all of the groomsmen at once and, one thing leading to another, ends up on her knees in front of all six?

Of course, the roleplay doesn't *have* to tie directly into the wedding - that's just there to be a setting. Maybe you play another attendee of the wedding who's had a thing for Ashley for some time, or maybe just someone who thinks she looks hot in that dress.

In any case, message me if you've got any ideas at all, or if you're interested in one of my past prompts!

24 yr old.
Stuck on finding my second internship, as my interview skills just tanked after being rejected a thousand times. Even volunteer work has been at most 3 months when I require 6 months for the requirement.

So, I've been pressured to finding an alternative route. Currently, there are two options available to myself. I have a decent academic record, no more than 2 fails:

1)  I can transfer to MQ university or any other that has my course, I'm curious on how the process will go? Should I just go visit MQ for a chat, if so, what should I ask?
Is there an internship program too?

2) Drop out, find any other job that isn't in my field.

Thoughts?

[TBP Reply Thread](https://archive.fo/uzJ3Y)


I looked at their reply thread as I expected... quite pathetic. Most of them played the proxy coin, i.e. 'Oh, we're only a satirical subreddit! We are not ideologues!' (e.g. One of the Best Rated Comment: “Repeat: TheBluePill is not an ideology. It is a subreddit dedicated to making fun of you morons”). In regards to this, I wonder why they are so clearly invested in other subreddits to the point where they are more active that actual subscribers of said subreddits. I wonder, if they are truly unideological, why they made so many threads about Donald Trump? I wonder why they don’t recognize obvious sexism that occurs to men and just brush it off as bad data (or hell, if someone actually does, you just downvote the fuck out of it with no argument).

A few others made some responses, most of which weren't even actual arguments, but I'm going to respond to some here. Since it is now abundantly clear that the great bulk of them are a bunch of idiotic trolls who have nothing of any actual argumentation value to input. The few that did at least TRY to attempt to formulate an argument would argue the same bullshit feminists have been arguing for decades – e.g. if you read in the dialogue below, you'll see that one actually tried arguing a variation of the wage-gap argument, something that has been thoroughly debunked for quite some time now. 

&gt;""You know he's got faith in himself when he describes it as a ""quasi-counterargument"".""

No moron, I called it a quasi-counterargument, because an actual counterargument implies there WAS an actual argument to reply to. 

&gt;""/Sinister_Hand already nailed the response to this. Thanks for posting this rotten apple lying on the ground! ... 
Sinister_Hand: Complains that we're irrelevant because we only pick the low hanging fruit.
Proceeds to lay out a vast field of potatoes to harvest.""

Again, conjecture without making any points, no surprise here. 

&gt;""It's a pretty common manbaby canard so, yeah, I'm sure it's been addressed countless times. My take is you're making an extremely loaded argument and your assumption that divorce rates are a reasonable Relationship Satisfaction Index or whatever the fuck you're using them as a proxy for is somewhere between questionable and utterly hilarious and/or contemptuous""

Again, yet another non-argument. The point of the matter is we're trying to save men from making a play that completely immobilizes them. Once a man commits and signs a marriage document, he is absolutely and completely at his wife's will and desires; his best bet in this situation is to either hire a hitman or flee to Russia – two options that are highly risky and something that could have been avoided simply by avoiding marriage.  

Obviously, such solutions are very unrealistic and incredibly risky simply for a man to protect one’s own rightful possessions, that is why it is simply imperative that men avoid marriage at all costs today. 


&gt;""Second verse, same as the first: loaded arguments based on all sorts of assumptions like the initiator of the divorce being ""at fault"" for the divorce.""

Assertion, assertion, assertion. Guess what? NOT AN ARGUMENT. 


&gt;""I think your misogyny is showing, Mr. ""there are two kinds of women: sluts and lying sluts""""
&gt;""Wow, is this were the telephone game that started with that OkCupid clickbait article ended up?""

Not an argument. 

&gt;""Oh I haven't heard this one before can anyone clue me in on some detail it's probably going to be as good as the bit where feminism/women gets blamed for being ineligable for the draft.""

No, it, more or less, has to do that women are the primary recipients of entitlement spending and government resources, while men are the involuntary benefactors of such. 

&gt;""So, what's supposed to be argument here? That women being ""only 20 percent of STEM"" currently is some kind of obvious proof that women can't lift STEM? It's not like we murdered the existing workforce when they started pushing trying to get women. It was 12% in the 70's, if you look at college majors/newgrads the gap closes to ~40% women/60% men. So, yeah, it looks like it's working to me.""

Going to college no longer has anywhere near the same value it did back in the 90s and early 2000s, let alone the 60s and 70s. College attendance is inflated and overpopulated, and most women are majoring in the most worthless of degrees, which was the overarching point that you completely missed [somehow]. 

&gt;""hahaha ""you're all just financial/emotional vampires that are right about some things that will not be named just confess!"" I don't think I can logic my way out of this one if only I had a dick to do my thinking for me. Hey, wait a minute, Dick, what do you think?""

Yet another non-argument. 

&gt;""Source: Angry male monthly. And what about the implications? (I'm never getting that scene from It's Alway Sunny out of my head, ever, am I?)""

It’s called male scarcity and female hypergamy in conjunction with each other acting in a free and open environment. 

&gt;""Wait when the fuck did we start advocating monogamy I missed that meeting?""

I think it's something like, 'NAWALT, most women just want a nice man who treats them right', but maybe I'm wrong. Just look at your own sub-reddit's past history, or are you too incompetent to do that? 

Hell, I remember a few months ago one of TBP members were saying that MGTOW are generally correct about somethings, but then you guys completely shamed him into subservience, because he's too much of a pussy to stand by or defend his views that disagree with the status quo. He told us the reason he even browses TBP to give him hope and mental stability with his own marriage, lol. If I recall properly, I am quite sure it was /Omega2 (the creator of this follow-up thread). 

Unfortunately, I do not have a link to this thread as I am pretty sure it got deleted, but is it not ironic that you label us as an ‘echo chamber’, but whenever someone brings up the most blatantly obvious and demonstrable truths that MGTOW presents that you just shame and ridicule the life out of said person without even recognizing that there may be more to it? 

&gt;""The word you wanted there was ""inherent"" not ""implicit"" :)""

I don't see how the usage of 'implicitly contradicts 'inherently'. I meant to write implicit for a reason, because even in our arguably unnatural environments of advanced, modern civilization where sex/gender is seen as 'fluid' and a 'social construct'  — gender roles will always have an implicit effect on how we view each other sub-consciously (thus, implicitly), regardless of how strong of a notion of egalitarianism you push. 


&gt;""Nope. See your problem here is you're trying to argue against the definition of the word. Mysogyny means ""dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women,"" whether or not you feel those opinions are valid is orthogonal here. Even if we take at face value the concept that contempt against women (#yesallwomen) is valid, it's still, by definition, mysogyny. You belive it, embrace it bro! Come out of the closet, you'll feel a lot better (at least it worked for me)!""


I am a proud misogynist, but maybe you should read what I said in that quoted lined itself:

&gt;AND THERE IS VALID REASON (not the ""MISOGYNY"" they constantly bitch and cry about) behind it?

Even if said reasons are misogynistic, does it really matter if said reasons are true or significant?  

&gt;""I don't know how to break it to you but EvoPsych and EvoBio are the 21st century versions of Phrenology and Eugenics, they're crackpot pseudosciences that pull ""scientific"" explanations for bigoted garbage out of their asses and are about as respectable as Homeopathy or maybe Accupuncture.""

Oh, please go tell Richard Dawkins that in addition with any Professor in Biology, I'm sure they'll love to hear what bullshit you have to say. Eugenics is proper in theory too (if Mendel's experiments with artificial selection demonstrated anything) – the real concern with Eugenics are the ethical concerns, not the Biological realities of it. 

[Richard Dawkins’s endorsement of Evolutionary Psychology](https://richarddawkins.net/2014/11/evolutionary-psychology-sexual-dimorphism-and-ideology/)

Here's a favorite of mine:

&gt; The most obvious answer is male-male competition: our male ancestors competed with each other for females, and bigger bodies made for more successful competitors. That size difference can be useful in both direct physical competition (as in mule deer!) or simply in dominance, like establishing territories, or even in showing you have “better genes”.  (In fact, mate choice based on size may still operate in humans if females prefer bigger or taller males as opposed to smaller ones like me.) And if males competed for females, that reflects a difference between the sexes in reproductive strategy—that is, in behavior.  Finally, if the physical result of this behavioral difference remains in our species, why would the behavioral difference itself not remain as well, with males competing for female attention? Various psychological and sociological studies in fact show this to be the case in modern humans.

OH NO, was that too RedPilly for your fragile selves? I guess you better go back to your safe spaces and talk about how reality and science triggered you too hard. 

I’ll be honest, I did expect a lot of incredible imbecility out of this thread – I did not expect TBP to actually deny one of the most fundamental and most heavily demonstrated pieces of Biology.

&gt;""even if they did (the rate has been going down- the myth that it did was heavily bolstered by a massive amount of divorces as divorce became more acceptable) i fail to see how that's a negative. getting a divorce is infinitely better than staying in an unhappy or abusive relationship""

Okay, finally, something that ADDRESSES something I said. Here's why it's bullshit, while the divorce rate has gone down (really it's only plateaued actually, because it hasn't been adjusted for separations that are in the process of divorce. The even greater reason why this is bullshit is because it doesn't account for the fact that the overall MARRIAGE rate has decreased significantly so, which inherently leads to a lower divorce rate. 

[Demograhpic Model] (http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/marriages_divorces_per_capita.png?w=640)

As you can clearly tell, this statistic is very misleading at best. The divorce rate has not gone down as a result of the non-existence or lesser existence in recent times of hypergamy, gynocentrism, female solipsism etc – it has only occurred at expense of a lower marriage rate overall.

Even if said person was correct, is it really rational to play Russian Roulette if the chamber has one bullet instead of two? 

&gt;""first off, the statistic is actually closer to 70% and maybe if you want women to stop divorcing their partners, men should stop being shitbags. women are often a lot less satisfied in marriage than men, often due to unequal workloads at home.
also, wee nitpick, you mean ""70% of divorces are initiated by women"", not ""70% of women initiate divorces.""""

Oh, grammar and semantics! Sorry, I don't have time to proof read all of my reddit posts that I type on five-minute bus rides on my laggy smartphone (let alone spend all day snooping through other people's sub-reddits, but that's not my problem), maybe I should ask one of the underemployed female English majors to help me with that. 

Let’s start with the household disparity. I’m going to run off some general estimates:

Washing Dishes/Loading Dishwasher: 5-10 Minutes (Maximum, 6-7 days a week) = 70 Minutes MAX per week
Cleaning Bathroom: 20-30 Minutes (Maximum, once a week)
Doing Laundry: 20 Minutes (Maximum, Once a week)
Vacuuming: Varying, 20-40 Minutes depending on Square feet of premises (Once a week)

So, under VERY LIBERAL estimates, you are looking at roughly 2.5 hours of low-intensity, simplistic labor work to be done around the house? Does this even remotely makeup for the income disparity most couples have? I’m assuming a near unanimous NO to that. This doesn’t even account for the fact that actual major electrical and mechanical that require some level of aptitude and skill are all done by the man, if not mostly paid for by the man. Let’s not forget that men almost always must do the higher-intensity labor work like taking out the trash. 

Also, it's not men's fault that women are incapable of being happy and are never being satisfied. Women are intrinsically opportunistic and hate being told they have to settle for something (very similar to how children get upset when they don't get everything exactly as they want it). 

In regards to the divorce initiation frequency, it fluctuates between 70 and 80 percent of the time (unfortunately, the CDC privately archived their data set, so I cannot provide you a direct link). No intelligent man is going to want to get divorced, because that effectively ensures he's going to lose a ton of money. Regardless of which, 70 percent is still an abundant majority and plurality, so it hardly weakens my point (as it is hardly a strong suit for “your side of the argument” to argue in favor for). Women divorce far more than men do primarily because women are far more likely to benefit from divorce, and it's almost always at the man's expense. 

&gt;""i mean, like, it's linked to the fact that men tend to earn more than women as a group, and women are also the partners who tend to make career sacrifices for their partners. so what you need is feminism, friendo""

Or maybe, instead of being a parasitical and hedonistic cockroach claiming to take the moral high-ground by ""sacrificing your career"" (when in reality, you're simply too lazy and incompetent to generate a high enough income, and you simply want a free ride), you should make your own money and stop feeling entitled to a man's money simply because you had some affiliation with him. The fact that you are legally obligated to pay some bitch who you're not even affiliated with anymore is preposterous. 

When you get fired from a job? Do you expect your ex-employer to continue paying you an income after all the i's are dotted and everything is settled? 



&gt;""idk, when are you going to address that, in the majority of cases where men actually ask for custody, they're more likely to get it than their wives? or that women tend to be relegated to the caregiving parent, which is one of the most important factors when it comes to custody decisions? (hey another thing feminism helps you fucks with)""


Um, amptoons is your source? Not a single active feminist has done one thing in regards to reforming divorce court or child custody cases, but nice try. Only recently, where women have started to be held accountable in extremely small proportions (relative to men) to pay alimony have feminists actually started to bat an eye at alimony reform.  Homosexual men are the only men feminism has implicitly helped, and that was more or less by accident too. 


&gt;""are you talking about that okcupid study? that was actually flawed for a lot of reasons. first, if you look at the male data, it shows men are less likely to consider women that aren't rated as attractive for partners than women are. second, it ignores the fact that when you rate someone, you're not just rating their photos- you're rating their profile. and if you rate a guy high on okc, he tends to take it as a comeon, because he gets a little notification. when i was on there before i met my partner, i ended up rating a lot of guys less attractively than just their physical photos showed, because their profiles had a lot of things i wasn't interested in and i didn't want them to see my like and message me when we were going for different things in relationships.""

I'll let Colttaine do the work for me on this one. He's thoroughly debunked this: [Gender Attraction Differential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vqRbScCIPU)


&gt;""source on the inflated acceptance rates? as for the scholarships, only 5% of all scholarships have any gender restrictions at all, and of those, 1/5 are for men. so that brings us down to 4%, which doesn't even touch the fact that a hell of a lot of those are restricted to certain majors, not all of which are STEM.""

Sure, let's look at the world's greatest institution for science and engineering. Surely the greatest technical institution would only consider merit and demonstrated aptitude, no? 

[MIT Accepted Student Data Set 2013-2014](http://archive.is/8TwK1)

Let's see:
Male Acceptance Rate: ~6.0% 
Female Acceptance Rate: ~13.2 % 

Oh, and even then, women still fail to makeup even 50 percent of their respective student population (LMFAO). 

So, even per your own data, 80 percent of gender-oriented scholarships are dedicated towards women. How exactly does this help your argument? Also, in regards to applying for STEM scholarships, often being a woman gives you an advantage in winning the scholarship. 

Most of my female engineering classmates that I know are on some sort of scholarship to attend and just to give you reference, my school isn't the type that gives scholarships out on merit (it's a top ten engineering school). These girls weren't exactly the cream of the crop either. 

&gt;""that statistic is a bit overblown- it leaves out fields where women are more likely to be represented, such as healthcare. there's actually been a lot of study done on women in STEM! i hate to be that guy, but there are actually a hell of a lot of studies linked in the wikipedia page that indicate that discrimination is a significant factor.""

Sorry, I really don't have time for the bullshit, professional victimhood excuses women make for being too incompetent to do their jobs. I've worked at several engineering internships, and many of my bosses were assholes –  I still did what was expected of me; it's called work for a reason. Also, while women make up most nurses, men make up most doctors, which is a significantly more valuable and scarce service provided relative to nursing. 

&gt;""coughcoughsource? and not the statistic that shows that women tend to marry men who make more, because, you know, as a group men tend to make more, especially at the same level of education.

&gt;good question! have you managed to actually find that data on the study? because, like, all the links i've found in articles are dead. and all of the articles say that the study was self-reported and also controlled for things like happiness in the relationship, which opens it up hugely for bias. they didn't even ask for number of orgasms, which is a mess. what does it mean to orgasm ""often"" during sex? ""sometimes""? because that's going to mean something different for me (who generally orgasms at least once every time) than it would for a woman who's only had one orgasm in her life before.
oh, and one more thing- they retracted the interpretation that richer men make women orgasm more.00064-6/abstract) whoops.""

This is such bullshit. The clear majority of women, especially married ones (or to-be married ones), have no intentions of working full time and do not want to either.

[Atlantic Article]( https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/unequal-unfair-and-unhappy-the-3-biggest-myths-about-marriage-today/276468/)

&gt; Take family work. When you combine paid work, housework, and childcare, today's married parents both put in about 55 hours, according to a recent report from the Pew Research Center. It's true that married mothers do more of the housework and childcare, but in most households this doesn't amount to an onerous burden for them. That's because most married mothers do not work full-time (43 percent work full-time) and do not wish to work full-time (just 23 percent wish to work full-time, a fact rarely mentioned in media accounts of work and family life).

&gt; The big factor, Harvard sociology professor Alexandra Killewald found, is the husband's employment status. For the past four decades, she discovered, husbands who aren’t employed full time have a 3.3 percent chance of getting divorced in any given year, compared with 2.5 percent for husbands employed full time. In other words, their marriages are one-third more likely to break up.

Please schedule a formal debate with Richard Dawkins and David Buss. Clearly you know more about their supposedly pseudo-scientific disciplines than they do! Let's see what actual scientists in the field of Biology say about your mostly emotionally-fueled conjectures about Evolutionary Psychology and Biology. 



&gt;“because the majority of studies show that men are more likely to cheat than women?”

Whether this is even true anymore is heavily debated upon, [newer data]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21667234) strongly suggests that the infidelity rates are really on the margins in terms of differentiation. 

However, I’m going to demonstrate, while supposing your claim is true, why it’s irrelevant.

Women are far more sexually selective than men are. Just to account for extremities and outliers (because I know you incompetent fucks LOVE to dwell on them), the only scenario that this doesn’t hold as strongly is when a women is ovulating or moving against the gradient in terms of her Biological Clock – I can safely assume that these are not the majority of conscious experience women have.   When women find a mate that they’re willing to start committed relationship with, that said potential mate has likely gone through very heavy selective testing and processing (e.g. shit-testing) before the woman has decided that she wants to form a relationship with said man. This man in this scenario had to demonstrate and provide evidence that he is a man of high sexual value before he could get the woman’s approval in this scenario. As you would expect, a man of high-value is going to be found attractive by other women as well (should I even, and since men are not as sexually selective as women are – men in relationships have a higher likelihood of cheating. 

So, what’s the back side to this? Men on average have a significantly harder time initiating mutual sexual attractive with women as a whole – let alone the chances of initiating a relationship with a woman. 

These are the fundamental grounds of sexually dimorphic selective proclivities and hypergamy. See the video I referenced from Colttaine for more information. 



&gt;""okay, so, like, ignoring the evopsych ""it is how it is so therefore that's how it's always going to work"" nonsense, let's go back to some of your previous questions. about how hard it is to be a man, who earns more and is seen as less capable of taking care of children. that is because of those same gender roles that you're defending. you can't be all ""abloobloobloo why do women get custody"" in the same post as ""abloobloobloo we all know women are just naturally there to take care of babies!""
these roles are shitty for everyone. not just women. you spent half your post railing against them.
come off it, bro""

Strawman at its finest. Let me cover my bases first, I did not implement the definition of gender roles – you believe society did; I believe nature did.

Additionally, I did not say women are better at taking care of children. I believe they're better at nursing and caring for INFANTS and toddlers, past that age, a child has much more to benefit from by being with their father (especially a son). This also overlooks for the fact that there are several cases where even the CHILDREN themselves ask to be with their father but are placed under custody of their mothers, because the court system is so Gynocentric. 

I've stated it before, but I am NOT an egalitarian. I believe the notion that everyone is equal in capability and ability, especially when stratifying by gender/sex is imbecilic. The problem with feminism is it expects men to retain to their default gender roles (if men don’t, then the aggregate sum of funding necessary for all of the entitlement programs women and feminists vote for vanish completely), while women get the power without the responsibility of being a man. The only thing feminism has done to help men is that it is a clear and distinct socio-political manifestation of true female nature in an open and uncontrolled environment. 

&gt;""Since women (and men) are far more likely to have bad experiences with physical abuse issues from MEN, and women and their children are even likely to be killed by MEN, why don't such equivalent spaces about men exist? I mean, where is beatingmen /cutemalecorpses /rapingmen ? Why do subs like /feminisms actually focus on FEMINIST issues, and not sit around bitching about how evil men are?""

I'm sure you're right, that's why only over 40 percent of men [are victims of domestic violence](http://www.saveservices.org/2012/02/cdc-study-more-men-than-women-victims-of-partner-abuse/) in heterosexual relationships.

&gt;""Why do subs like /feminisms actually focus on FEMINIST issues, and not sit around bitching about how evil men are?
If your 'safe spaces' are indeed about coping with the terrible injustices you face, and a space to talk about 'true' female nature where's the flipside where women do the same to men?""

Have you not seen tumblr feminist blogs? Also, I thought this was made ABUNDANTLY clear years ago, but MGTOW is not a political activist group. We do not have any explicit political partisan associations, and we generally see both political ends as Gynocentric, just in different manifestations. MGTOW != MRA. The MRM has accomplished nothing in its decades of existence, and I doubt it ever will in a Gynocentric society. 

I’m even willing to say the MRM and MGTOW aren’t even allies at this point considering they’ve been doxing us as much as many feminists have. 

[Barbarossa on the MRM]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmQRVdI579M)

&gt;""..the fuck?
Where's the discussion about male nature asshole?
Where did the ability to prioritize issues go you imbeciles? Apparently women taking selfies and being loud are more important problems to talk about then ISIS (most of whom are MEN) and, basically every serious criminal ever.
Where's the talk about that, huh??
God they don't even try to hide the bias in that one.
It's either ""women nature"", ""human nature"", or...""female nature.""
No mention of male nature.""

Quite a few MGTOW scholars have discussed male nature, I'd reckon the most significant topic is the male's Biological propensity for a male-mother need. If I recall correctly, TFM has an entire guide dedicated to male behavior. 

In regards to ISIS, that’s because strongly patriarchal nations understand the primary purpose of women, i.e. they are a reproductive resource. You only need a single man to fertilize a dozen women in a given time period; a single woman can only get impregnated by a single man and reproduce at about a ~1.33 reproduction rate per year. Women would probably fuck up the execution on an attack anyways, which would inhibit ISIS from accomplishing its goals. 

Due to the lack of any really insightful arguments or points made (mostly just the same debunked bullshit you hear by feminists and Gynocrats), this is going to be my last reply to them. I regret wasting the last 15 minutes of my life responding to the most indolent and facile ‘arguments’ at best or to completely vapid and infantile statements at worst – but if it even saves only one man from the chains of Gynocentrism or the hallucinogenic delusions of the Blue Pill, I will be happy.  


**I'm going to end with my most major point. You simply cannot debunk the rationale behind going MGTOW –  it's impossible. It will never be rational to put yourself in a legally binding contract that entitles an existing entity that is not you to over half of whatever you own and earn (and other things that result from the said relationship) merely at said entity’s own will. The only rational way is to walk away and not get married and to not have LTRs with women – the legal risk is far too high and there are effectively no benefits whatsoever, especially utilitarian ones.**

I am optimistic about Trump and his rule. So I wanted to ask Canadian citizens /Dual Citizens 2 simple questions.

How is Justin Trudeau running the country and what kind of a person he is?

And

What do you think about r/Canada ?

As I have seen people bash him (justified by his globalism and his ""eulogy""). I also call him the tumblr Incarnate. But also I wanted to know what are your opinions on the Canadian subreddit as it is pro Trudeau and also tried to defend his gamergate shit. So what are your opinions my dear friends. Even they bash rebel media (P.S Is Ezra Levant good ?) . 

Also I like you guys. You guys are calm collected rational. A true liberal than those self diagnosed commies in a Liberals clothing. I would like to post some things and talk with you guys. I am pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology in information Technology. And learning android. I have good grade points and looking for an internship job abroad. I am an Indian from a better area . Pleased to meet you all

I hope I am accepted here. MAGA and praise Kek. 

Also please post your opinions on the comments. I would be pleased to reply if there are any queries.

5kj7fl,1,2016-12-27,Severe lack of motivation,blueblooblu,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/5kj7fl/severe_lack_of_motivation/,"I'm in my third year of college. Ever since around the end of 5th grade I've gradually lost my motivation to do schoolwork and take life seriously and I don't know why, but here is a (somewhat disorganized b/c I'm typing on mobile) list of key thoughts surrounding my concern.

I did a little above average in high school and people who don't know me well probably think I'm still at the top of my game. I've had a few spurts of motivation, though. For example, in my senior year of high school my mom advised me to channel my anger and hurt from a breakup into my schoolwork and I ended with a 4.0 both semesters. I thought I could bring that effort into college, but my anger and hurt subsided and I did terribly the first and second years of college. This year I'm doing well, but I'm burnt out and feeling miserable already. I'm scared for the next quarter. I should be applying to internships but my skill level doesn't even compare to others applying. I feel like everyone around me is a genius.

I should also mention that I have a perfectionist personality, and I have the worser end of it. I get scared of not doing something perfectly and end up abandoning it and it snowballs into other things when I procrastinate more and more and more. I've tried methods to avoid procrastinating like talking to people about my goals or going online and trying methods that others have found successful, but all of that just made my thoughts worse and gave me slight paranoia. However, I've recently found that not telling anyone my goals and seriously thinking about and acting upon them myself has helped immensely.

I don't have any hobbies, although I've been paying more attention to art lately, which I think is a good thing. But then I feel like I don't have time because I'm either procrastinating or doing schoolwork. Which I now suppose I could do art instead of procrastinate.

I am a very laid back person, and there's little that makes me urgent. When I was little, my mom used to ask me what I preferred and I would respond with ""I don't care."" I used to not care about decisions and let others make the decisions (still do sometimes). Since realizing these things, I've opened my mind up a lot more these past 3 years and I've sort of trained myself to feel a little more than before.

My mom is the most generous and loving person I know, and she has given all to support my education. But she's in a marriage where she doesn't get any support from a lazy, detached, and also laid back husband, and her only child is unbearably disappointing. She's always had a temper and really gives it to us because of those reasons. She's also one of those people who don't ""believe"" their children have depression, but I'm positive there's at least something wrong in me. 

I'm not ruling out going to a therapy session, but I know I'd just like to ask Reddit for some advice right now.

5kl09e,0,2016-12-27,Me [24M] with my GF [24F] of 6 years. Help me understand what's going on,what_to_do_help,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5kl09e/me_24m_with_my_gf_24f_of_6_years_help_me/,"I and my GF have been together for over 6 years now, right from the end of our school days. A lot has happened between us over the last 6 six, good and bad, but we have always stuck together. 



She was a topper during her school days and an average student during her college days. She was also pursuing CA besides her college degree and has been unable to complete the course until now. She has given the final exams thrice now over the last 2 years, but failed all the time. She was supposed to give the exam in November again this year but backed out at the last minute. 




The failure has gotten to her since she was always good in studies. Due to this, she has not been able to get a decent job, and it was only in July this year that she was able to join a big firm as a trainee for six months with below average pay (compared to her friends).




She was having to force herself to study for CA, and I pointed her out that she does not seem interested in CA anymore. She realised that and decided not go give her exams this November (Not based on my advise here. It was an out of the blue decision). In her previous attempts, she used to go stay with her mom/dad for six months and leave everything else to focus on her studies. I pointed her out after the first time she did this that by the end of six months you get bored/frustrated with studying and completely give up on the exam. 



The problem is she is confused now. She clearly knows that she is not interested in CA, but she does not know what else to do especially since her internship also ends in December and she will be jobless after that. So she has decided to sit for the exam again in May next year. For this, she will again go stay with her parents for six months to focus on the exam. I tried explaining her that she should try something else/new since she is not interested in CA and even if she completes the course, she will probably not enjoy the job afterwards. She is not financially independent which is further making matters worse here. She wants to earn a decent amount of money, and right now, the only road she sees here is completing her CA and getting a job. 




I tried multiple times to explain that she should handle her failure in CA in a better manner, leave it, and move forward with something else. However, she does not know what her passions/interests are and is clueless on that front, and she cannot come to terms with her failure to complete the course. I kept telling her this repeatedly and this got on her nerves. We had a huge showdown about this and she told me not to talk about her career anymore. I realise I was trying to help her and make her realise something, but I also accept my fault of being too overtly helpful/giving advice. 


The cumulation of all this have led to some huge issues in our relationship over the last six months or so. She thinks our relationship is in tatters, when I don't think it is/fail to understand why it is. Yes, we had some big fights, but everyone does. I am willing to work with her on our fights. For at least 2 months after we had a big fight this September, she was completely out of love with me. She kept saying she did not feel connected to me. I tried my best to rekindle the love, but that only made her feel more guilty because she was not feeling anything for me. Things have improved since December as her actions show [we go out/have fun/she gave me a very thoughtful gift this Christmas], but she is still apprehensive of replying to my love yous for some reason. She is not sure about our relationship and cites the differences in our living style/life etc as us being incompatible. 



Biggest problem is while I am willing to talk about our fights, she will not. She will say I am going through a bad phase, so I don't want to talk about this fight right now or let it pass. Or please bear with me for six months etc and push things away.  I can understand doing that every once in a while, but all the time? It will take us 10 mins to solve a matter, instead of deferring and fighting over it again after sometime. [Ok, she might not do it all the time, but its still a solid 7 out of 10 times for major fights]. We discuss about a fight/issue only when she is in the mood. Otherwise, there is no discussion/talk. 



Not sure what to do here, Reddit? I gave her an ultimatum after a fight this Tuesday that she should only call me when she will be willing to talk and solve our problems because she again said that our relationship has been very wonky and she does not feel connected to me when we had spent some quality time together over the last week or two with only some minor fights that were handled pretty well. 
  

I love this girl from the bottom of my heart and can do anything for her. I am here to support her until she figures out her career path, but she keeps making the same mistakes. The painful part is when she does not reply back to my love you or says that she does not feel connected to me. Makes me feel like a fool. I am willing to talk, but she is not. What to do?


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Gf is struggling with her career. This has led to her doubting our relationship as well. Defers talking about issues citing bad phase or skims over them. I feel we could communicate better. What to do?"

Newark is like a day in NYC when no one showed up, and even rush hour (when the traffic is worst) still pales in comparison to New York City. I learned so much as a math student and always felt super prepared at my internships. My only gripe is that the school could work harder on it's reputation and spend more time helping students get jobs/internships instead of trying to cultivate a ""college experience"" with the stadium and things like that.

5km89k,3,2016-12-27,University of Calgary student looking for advice from Oil and Gas professionals (X-Post /r/landman),geolandman,geophysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/geophysics/comments/5km89k/university_of_calgary_student_looking_for_advice/,"Hi everyone, I am currently a 4th year student enrolled in the BComm Petroleum Land Management program and minoring in Geophysics. I have worked on the drilling rigs for 8 months, worked for Shell Canada as a land analyst, and now moving to Edmonton to work at a distribution terminal for an 8 month internship term.
Currently, I am having a bit of a dilemma about my career. 

Essentially I am very interested in Geophysics, but right now I know that employment is rough in that field. I have a solid job with Shell and could become a negotiator after this internship. However, if I forgo any grad opportunities to pursue Geophysics it would only be 8 more months and I would have a BSc/BComm combined degree and be qualified for APEGA professional status as a P.Geo if I work in that field before moving into a commercial role.

I have read a lot about how landmen have been getting pushed down by the oil industry over the last few years in Canada because landmen do not have the same technical stature as engineers and geoscientists. I have also read a lot about how landmen fail to add value to organizations and are seen as more of a service because they seem to add less value than engineers, finance people, or geoscientists.

From your professional perspective, how much value could I add with a combination like that? Would I be able to be accepted by my technical peers more and have a say at the decision table amongst other professionals? Would the extra 8 months in school foster a greater return on investment in my future and open up further opportunities? Should I go to law school instead? Are there any other factors that come to your mind?

Any advice on this issue will help me immensely! I have to make a choice by early January, so the sooner I get your insights the better! Thanks everyone!"

What is the best method of searching for an internship abroad? Do I focus on getting a visa first, or do I need to secure an internship before worrying about that?

#[Last Week](http://redd.it/5jcg04) | [All previous threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/weekly_posts) | [Ratings for This Week](https://redd.it/5kviqc)"
5kmwex,6,2016-12-27,The best session I’ve ever ran (Also ‘Incomplete spells’ request update),NotAPowerfulWizard,dndnext,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5kmwex/the_best_session_ive_ever_ran_also_incomplete/,"This is an update to [this!](http://reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5hb3lo/need_some_ideas_for_incomplete_spells/?st=ix859o71&amp;sh=0525ec39) :  


Spoilers, my players completely left all of your fantastic ideas behind but it was one of my favourite sessions I’ve run so I had to share! Sorry for the long post, I hope you enjoy it! (Expect copious amounts of formatting and grammar edits)  


**Party:**  


**Yessi** - Elf Cleric (life) and dedicated pacifist and servant of Milikki  


**Puck** – Pixie Bard (lore) lover of plants and frequent guest lecturer at the Arcane University  


**Kriv** – Dragonborn Rogue (assassin) unafraid of using torture for the good of the mission  


**Aid** – Human Druid (moon) who owes his life to the party   


**Tolgar** – Goliath Paladin (Vengence) who is no good at stealth and couldn’t make this session  

**Back story:**  
This is a homebrew world which uses the names of Forgotten realms gods and set primarily in a city with dedicated worship to Milikki, God of forests. The party managed to get buddy buddy with the king and were sent on a personal mission to investigate rumours of monsters in the Queens Forest. After finding an immense amount of arcane fire and explosives in a man-made tunnel system under the Queens Forrest and having anecdotal evidence from alchemists stationed there that the Arch-mage was behind it, my PCs need to infiltrate the Arcane University to find evidence that the arch-mage is actually plotting the destruction of the holy forest as well as, hopefully, finding a reason why.   


This all had to be done in secret as the city is run by several factions – The Royal Family, the Arcane University, The Cathedral of Milikki, and The Grand Market. The king, not wanting to incite civil war over accusations, had the party gather evidence whilst distracting the Arch-mage at a banquet.   


**Pre-infiltration:**  
Puck decided to send flowers to every high-ranking mage in the University signed by ‘secret admirer’ (accidentally inventing valentine’s day) so that he could cast Talk with Plants on them to discover if anything fishy was going on.   


Kriv decided to use a few of his underground connections to procure a level 1 runestone (think different key passes needed to get to different floors of the tower)  


Yessi went in search of an artefact to improve her stealth and traded one of her magic items for sneaky shoes (can’t remember what they are, it didn’t matter in the end!)  


**Ground floor – open to the public:**  
The party were planning to act like they were meant to be there on the first few floors, so they entered through the front door and Puck, who had been here several times, said he was looking to set up a lecture. He and the receptionist, Gwen, have a bit of banter and despite not being in the calendar, she allows them to go through and set up because “it’s obviously Mark not telling me about bookings again!” Great – they go through to an empty lecture hall (a small pocket dimension) then when Gwen isn’t looking they sneak up the physical stairs.  


**Floor 1 – offices and residences:**
This floor was all doors, tons of them all leading into mini pocket dimensions. The party ignored everything and went to find the stairs (thanks – throws away copious notes). They went up to raised platform where they presented the level one rune and platforms raised from the ground, building them their floating staircase.  

 
**Floor 2 – The library:**  
This floor was a huge library filled with Book Imps organising the entire thing. Aid decided he’d use this opportunity to learn about the Arcane tower and find a book on it. One 18 on investigation later and he has his book – they now know the layout of each of the floors in advance and what they’re built for – all except the top floor where the Arch mage resides – that page has been torn out. The stairs to the next floor are blocked by the librarian, an elderly lady elf. Puck casts an illusion of a level 2 rune on a table within her line of sight so that she gets distracted whilst the others search her desk for a real rune. She wanders over but before she sees it’s an illusion Puck flies over and talks to her like she was an old friend whilst the others head up. He says goodbye and ends the illusion – she looks over to the table and sees nothing. Confused, looks back around to ask puck if he saw anything, but he’s already cast invisibility and joined the party up on Floor 3.   


**Floor 3 – The Testing rooms:**  
This floor was made with the help of all you guys! These testing chambers were pocket dimensions, used by wizards to test and build new spells safely. They had built in safety features that deleted themselves if a wizard accidentally created a universe breaking spell. There were 12 doors surrounding a central water feature and statue depicting several great wizards failing at using spells with a plaque reading ‘Great minds fail and great minds learn from that failure’.   


Among this water feature were a few flowers, ones sent by Puck. He casts speak with plants and finds out that someone with a high-level rune went into testing chamber 3. Puck throws out another invisibility and sneaks into Room 4. There’s a wizard sitting, reading, with a small scroll case and several other scrolls spread out on a desk. There’s also a cow mooing away in the corner (thanks /u/TheWardVG for the spell Herd Cattle). Puck gets behind him and notices the rune in his pocket but before he has a chance to grab it the guy moves and begins casting a spell. A small Spectral Spoon appears in front of him (thanks /u/AverageJoe417 for the spell spectral spoon) and he laughs. He writes a big F in red ink on the scroll and makes a note in his diary ‘Spectral Trident: Too small to be useful, also the wrong kitchen utensil’. The teacher gets the next scroll and as he opens it, Puck casts minor illusion so that spiders crawl out. The scroll is thrown down and Puck uses the distraction to nab the next Rune. (I ask him if he wants to grab the scroll case on his way out but no of course he doesn’t! Throws away copious notes) He flies off and tries to exit the room. An ethereal voice asks “Are you sure you wish to exit? Unsaved rooms will be deleted and become unrecoverable.” The teacher hears this and rushes over, not seeing an invisible puck “NO! NO! SHIT!” He storms out of the room to see the rest of the party.  


This is great. Everything has gone so smoothly so far! So our Cleric, Yessi, had to step in. Whilst Puck was inside Yessi decides the talking flower is her best friend “Aw” she says, “let’s give this little flower guy another friend”. She grabs her magic beans she got as loot in a previous session and plants one. I sigh, I grab the DMG and get her to roll. 42.  She waits patiently. “Pass me the Monster manual please”  


“OH SHIT!” everyone’s freaks out. The Marble statue is cracking and breaking and it bursts as 6 giant mushrooms grow. The entire floor is covered in water.   


 “I don’t know what Shreikers are, but they don’t sound good to have in a stealth mission”   

“Can I cast Silence?”   

“If you know what these are! Roll Nature?”  

“20”   

“You can react in time”  


They quickly kill them all covering themselves in the thick goop of mushroom innards. This is when Teacher McTeacherface turns up.   
They lock eyes for all but a second before Yessi blurts out “Hi! We’re hear to clean up the shreikers, Nice to meet you” There’s a pause as I try to process this. Roll Deception. 24. 

“Fucking kids right!?!” he says “I just had spiders crawl out of their scrolls! Anyway, don’t go in there, that room is faulty, just tried to delete itself with me inside! I’m just going to see Gwen about getting it fixed.”  

He wanders to the staircase (which is now lowered) and straight up walks off the edge thumping in a heap on the floor below, right next to the librarian. Puck has his rune so the stairs didn’t appear for him. Yessi throws him a heal so he’s not dying and they scamper up to floor 4.  


**Floor 4 – Museum of magical items**  
This was a temptation floor. Filled with a ton of magical items I know my party wants. They thought about it for a second but there were velvet ropes separating them from the exhibits, so they politely made their way forward (I know right??? Throws away copious notes). To their surprise the rune the teacher had activated the stairs and got them up to floor 5.  


**Floor 5 – The grand scrying room:**  
This floor had a huge pool of water. The book that Aid found earlier explained that this scrying pool was special and that if they had anything personal to the person they wanted to scry on they could cast the scry spell with a DC15 arcana check. They thought for a moment and decided they had a few items from a few NPCs that they had met. Only one item worked which was a mug they had stolen from a bishop, Dross, with ‘World’s best cleric’ inscribed on the side. I have no idea, I didn’t remember they had the mug. All the other stuff I had planned for them to scry but those didn’t work! (Throws away copious notes). I got the pool to show Dross with the Alchemists who were setting up the Arcane fire in the previous session. He was yelling at them but they didn’t know what was being said. He was getting them to work on a neutralising agent for the Arcane fire but I thought it would be fun to throw a little suspicion into the mix. “Fun” they think, “lets move on”. Again, to their surprise, the rune got them up to the next floor.

   
**Floor 6 – Head of School Offices:**   
It’s at this point that they realise that the teacher they crippled was one of the magic school heads (conjuration) and they begin to feel bad about leaving him for a moment. That moment passes.   
This floor is incredibly full. There are department heads running back and forth with a trail of interns following holding books and scrolls and weird artefacts. 

For a moment they think “We can take these guys on” then remember that a head of department in a wizarding tower have to be massively powerful people (and innocents, maybe). Time to rely on RNGeesus. Invisible puck grabs a bean and so does Aid. The sneak in a plant them in two pots. 8 Shreikers burst out of Puck’s pot and a low grumbling can be heard from Aid’s pot. The Mages are holding their ears and before anyone can cast silence the other pot erupts geyser style spewing gallons of oils all over the mages. Its chaos. Most people are blinded and deafened. Perfect. 

Fly is cast on Yessi and Kriv and they zip to the next floor, ignoring the need to get a runestone. They (correctly) guessed that the floors were alarmed and set to go off if a runestone wasn’t used to summon the stairs so Yessi casts Dispel magic immediately as it was triggered. No one heard it even go off because of the shreikers.   


**Floor 6 – Arch-mage’s quarters:**  
They did it, having to roll like maybe 1 stealth check in an entire stealth session. The room seems like a regular office. A load of book shelves and a desk, basically. A door leads to a sleeping area. Aid searches the desk for a key and/or some sort of arcane lock thing. He finds both and promptly opens a secret door.   

“Does she have a toilet?” asks Yessi  

“She has a pot in the corner”  

“Bullshit, this place has pocket dimensions for everything! She has a magic toilet that goes to a shit dimension! Where is it?!”  

“FINE! She has that! It’s in that corner”   

The party proceeds to be fascinated by this toilet/bathroom for 15 minutes (begins writing copious notes). In the end they decide to leave a magic bean just on top of the pile of shit in the shit hole dimension so that next time she goes number two the beans will be burried and a geyser of oil or shreikers or something will appear!  

“Aid fly down there and place it down”  

“NO!”  

“Pixie, you do it!”  

“Hell no!”  

“Do… do you have mage hand?”  

Eventually it was done! Their trap was set!   
They then remember the secret door.   


**Floor 6.5 – The Lair:**  
Classic evil vibes coming from here. They walk up a short staircase and see a large room with an alter and a large chest behind it. Two beholder-like creatures attack (the ones from Volo’s guide it think (will update)). These things stun real bad, the party rolls low. They’re all down to nearly single digits before Puck manages to save and snap out of it. Puck has no idea what to do, everyone at the table yells at him to punch them in the eyes or something. He doesn’t, it’s not in his character, and he can’t just stand in eyeline because he’s currently invisible. It takes about 5 minutes for him to decide what to do and it ends up being grab Aid’s hood and pull it over his eyes. Aid immediately turns into a giant elk and grabs Yessi and Kriv out of the room with is antlers (20-something on athletics – I allow it). They compose themselves and chug a few healing potions before literally blindly storming in and wrecking the monsters but not before Aid is knocked out of his Elk form in basically one his thanks to a load of failed saves.  


In the chest they find a phylactery. Yessi rolls high and knows that a lich can sense people nearby to its phylactery. FUCK – They run as fast as they can. They hear screaming from far below them.  


Aid throws up a Windwall in front of the door to buy them a few seconds while the Lich storms up the tower. Someone casts fly on Aid who carries Yessi down safely out the window with the phylactery stashed in her bag. Puck follows but kriv has to climb. He rolls high, he can do it. BANG, a blast of fire destroys the door and burning door bits fling into the room.  


“Isn’t the whole of the floor below covered in oil?”  

“Yes, but the door bits were flung inwards and she’s an arch-mage, she knows how to carefully cast a spell”  

“What about my wind wall, she didn’t know about that?”  

“Fuck!” 

The burning door pieces fly into the room and into Aid’s Windwall, immediately flinging themselves back down the stairs into the oil filled room. A huge blast goes off and blows out the windows of that floor.   


Kriv rolls low on his athletics and falls from the force. He’s saved, just, by Aid and they both take minimal damage. 

They all rush to the palace where the King was hosting the banquet, all while saying “quick to the temple!” to trick the Lich who could hear them through the phylactery but not see them due to the bag covering it.  


They crash in covered in Shreiker goop and a fair bit of oil as well as most of their clothing burned off by eye rays. They’re yelling “Declaration from the king!” over and over while holding up a crumpled document. They make it up to the king who lets them into his private dining area. Tolgar who’s just been enjoying himself up to this point runs up the stairs after them swearing and casting lay on hands as much as possible.   


This is where we stopped the session. Hope you enjoyed!   


**TL;DR : My party approached a stealth mission by just being quieter than the explosions they created around them and bluffing like hell and it worked perfectly**

I recently accepted an internship position over the summer at Intel. I'm looking for a roommate who's willing to split rent with me on this nice 2 bedroom apartment I found in downtown Hillsboro. The place is fully furnished and just a 6 min commute to Intel, so it's perfect for people who are also doing an internship.  

I'm looking for an outgoing person, who is neat, and enjoys anything that has to do with technology. For me, I get along with those that are respectful of one another, clean, and are focused on their work.  You should be laid back and not into hard partying, as this property is not a party pad. I love the great outdoors, so I'm mostly looking for an individual who is willing to explore the city and not just stay at home all day.

Please message me if you're interested and I'll give you more information on myself and the property.

I'm absolutely grateful that I was able to obtain an internship for this past summer, but I'm scared that nothing will ever be enough. Many other people have a tremendous list of projects and a bounty of internships under their belts.

How could I compete with that much experience? My grades aren't bad. My grades aren't extraordinary. At job fairs, I can't help but notice what I'm up against.

At the time I was working a long term contract in an Asian country where pot is very much illegal. I am from Cali and my 1st line supervisor was from Oregon. Both pot friendly cultures. 

Anyway one night my boss and I are out drinking when he asks me if I wanna smoke some pot with him. I inquire as pot in this country is super rare and very expensive. He says his brother brought it over last time he visited. 

So naturally I agree, we go to his house and he has about an eight of weed. We roll up a small joint, smoke it get high as our tolerances are super low.

At the end he says ""I never really cared for this pot, do you want the rest?"" after some back and forth I agreed (I didn't wanna take it)

All was good

Over the next few months I would occasionally smoke in the privacy of my home. Naturally being just an eighth it didn't last long. After about a year one day my boss and I got into a professional disagreement. He thought we should do things X way and I felt that he was wrong. The truth of the matter is both ways got the job done its just we preferred different ways.

At the end of the deal his superior liked my idea better and we went with that.

A month later I get called into a meeting with HR and some senior level mgt both foreign and local leaders.

Long story short I've been reported for being a drug user, and that since the company owns my apartment they'll be searching it for evidence of drug use and I'll have to take a drug test.

I chuckle inside, you see I'm not a chronic user and I had smoked the eighth my boss had given me many months prior to this meeting. I knew it was out of my system, even hair as typical hair tests only go back 90 days.

So what did I do?

I obliged, I allowed them to drug test me and search my apartment. Naturally nothing of consequence was found. My boss did compliant my wife on her cooking though! (She was cooking when we came over to do the search)

The next day I walked into my VP office and basically had a chat with him.

I explained that I don't do drugs and I think they cloud my mind and my judgement and I'm offended that someone would think I would do drugs. I inquired on who ""ratted"" me out. I could tell the VP wouldn't directly tell me however I threw it out there

""My boss has been upset with me lately, recently I won an argument (he was aware of this) and I feel that this is retaliation for successfully getting the company to agree to implementing X in the method I thought was best and that working for such a supervisor makes life difficult if I can't respectfully disagree with said supervisor""

My VP listened intently and then asked me ""Even if this is true, why would he assume you smoke weed"" to which I said ""He knows my brother in California owns a dispensary. Maybe he assumed that since my brother works in the marijuana industry that I have to be a user? But I don't like drugs I like a clear mind""

My VP is a big time christian and also a former alcoholic. He takes great pride in being sober.

The VP nodded and said ""Look we'll look into this""

I went back to my desk, my VP went to HR who then called in my supervisor.

After about a 2 hour meeting I saw security guards walk into the VP office and escort my boss out as a intern cleaned out my supervisors desk of personal belongings.

The next day we were informed that my supervisor had been let go for violating the company drug policy.

I later found out what was said in the meeting, after a lot of back and forth about the professional disagreement the VP accused my supervisor of accusing me without proof of drug use.

His response? He told them the story of the time that him and I smoked pot together! 

He was terminated for admitting to illegal drug use.

I actually ended up getting promoted and I was the new team lead. Finished out the contract with a promotion!"

(F23),TheStormAfterTheStor,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5knt68/long_distance_is_tearing_me_m22_apart_sexually_f23/,"To make a long story short, me and my girlfriend live in the same state, but live a few hours from each other because we found our dream jobs in different locations. Both of us being fresh out of college it was important that we got established in our careers and get into the system right away.  
  
We've been together for four years now and sex has tanked considerably. During our last semester in college not much was going on because of our internships as well as worrying about graduating. Well that time away from each obviously made any sexual contact worse. It's been since early this year the last time we had sex.  
  
What's been driving me insane lately is that there's so much temptation where I live. There's a ton of women where I live that I know from high school. Most of them I haven't thought of as more than friends but we they post sexually charged things on social media it makes me feel ashamed for getting aroused. It almost feels deliberate with the posts they make about ""being lonely and single"" or provocative posts, or just simply liking a handful on my stuff on social media.  
  
I would never cheat in a relationship. That is my biggest, most profound ideology I have in relationships. I could be stabbed by my significant other and forgive her than to be cheated on. That being said her sex drive was not as high as mine. When it happens it's magical, but my significant other is satisfied with having sex once or twice a month while I crave it weekly sometimes more in a week. In a serious post sex conversation she even said she's scared that having a lot of sex while we're young will cause us not to want to have sex more in the future.  
  
Masterbation can only go so far and I always feel unfulfilled afterwards. And it doesn't help that the Masterbation ends being to those local woman discussed before. Don't know what to do anymore. I want to feel less sexually charged since sex is out of the question. And just because of the nature of our careers in terms of how young we are we're not trying to take time off in order to see each other as the progress we make at work could get compromised. Seeking advice or even just a ear to listen to.  
  
TL;DR: Me and SO in long distance relationship. I'm constantly aroused by the woman that live by me locally. Sexually frustrated with no outlet."

Initially it was very difficult for me to adjust to this school however hard work has paid off.  I am still a Junior and was grateful to receive an internship through the schools career fair which then became a co-op with the same company.  I am a little worried though that my contract will end this coming March of 2017.  The reason why I am worried is because I would have never thought to reach a personal level of success and I wonder if I will be screwed when my contract ends.  I would still need 3 semesters expected to graduate May 2018 (including taking and paying for summer courses out of pocket) but I will most likely not have a job unless they renew my contract which is I doubt they will.  I've never been in a situation like this before.  Could anyone share some thoughts on what I should do?

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

Our fathers are best friends, and run a law firm together. As a result we spent a fair amount of together while growing up. We were never best friends, but we got along well enough and enjoyed each others company.*

*However, for years I've wanted you. You're four years older than me, when you were fifteen and I was eleven you joined your high schools cheer squad, your uniform fit your body perfectly, and the sight of you in it practically jump started puberty for me. And as we got older you only got hotter and my lust for you grew. When I was thirteen and you were seventeen our families went on a joint vacation to the Caribbean, while we were there you and I took a picture together on the beech. I kept a copy of that photo in my room, and would often jerk off to it. Your body was so perfect, especially in the bikini you wore that day.*

*I never acted on my desires, fearing that you'd reject me or that it would make things weird given how often we saw one another, but by the time you left for college I could barely keep myself from getting hard whenever I was around you.*

*After you left, my lust died a little bit, you were still without a doubt the hottest women I'd ever seen. I still wanted you, and I still used that photo when horny, but I wasn't as filled with desire for you. I'd even dated and fucked one of the girls who had joined the cheer squad your senior year. But each time you came home, I noticed you become even hotter.*

*This past year I started as a Freshman at the college you attended. You were doing an extra semester and my parents had asked you to show me around and watch out for me while you were still at school. As a result we ended up spending more time together in a few months than we had since you left for school.*

*It drove me mad! You had spent all summer at an internship for a company you wanted to work for. I hadn't seen you since the previous Christmas, and since then you'd somehow gotten so much better looking. The lust I'd had for you in my early teens returned tenfold, but I still didn't act on it. You were fucking perfect, and I couldn't imagine confronting you with my desire.*

*You found out though. For Christmas this year, your parents decided to go on a second honeymoon. As a result you were staying with my family through the holiday. I tried not to, I didn't want to risk it with you sleeping down the hall, but I broke. Earlier that day I had walked in on you changing, you were only wearing a bra and panties, and I couldn't get the picture out of my head. That night, when I thought everyone had gone to bed I jerked off to that picture in my head. Moaning your name under my breath, almost grunting it.*

*You caught me. You'd left your phone charger in my room and came to get it, and instead you found me, half naked, hard cock in my hand, moaning your name. Before I could react you had stripped down and mounted me. We didn't fuck long, I had already been close when you barged in. But it was the greatest pleasure I'd ever felt. You seemed to have enjoyed it as well. Before you went back to your room you told me ""Just let me know if you want to do that again."" *

*It's been a week since then and I haven't taken you up n your offer, fearing that it was some kind of joke on your part. Meanwhile you've grown impatient, and have decided that if I won't make the first move, you will.*

In this Roleplay, I want you to seduce me. How you do it is up to you. Maybe you just tease me until I snap and pin you to the ground. Maybe you still have your high school cheer uniform and decided to fulfill my earliest fantasy. However you do it, I want to be teased and seduced by you. Don't worry, you won't be in charge the whole time. Once you break me down, I'll be much more aggressive. ;)

Kinks: Being seduced, teasing, semi-rough sex, spanking(giving, not receiving). Breasts(Watching them bounce might turn me on more than anything)

Turn offs/Will not do: Toilet play, incest, rimming.

5kugj2,5,2016-12-28,My Brother and Father Have Addictions,throwawayalanon92,AlAnon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/5kugj2/my_brother_and_father_have_addictions/,"I found this sub and just want to write out my situation, express some of my thoughts, feelings, and concerns, and read whatever responses are generated as a result. Shared insights and/or experiences are appreciated. 

Background: I'm 24. My dad is 55 and my brother is 20. My brother started high school the year I started college and it was a rough year for him. He dealt with anxiety and depression and my mom regularly found drugs in his room. At the time I was concerned but I didn't think much of it beyond, Oh he's just experimenting, he'll get over it. I had been experimenting with drugs myself, but I always limited myself to weed, alcohol, and psychadelics. I suppose I thought that since I was able to draw ""safe"" experimental boundaries, that my brother wouldn't ever let things get too far. But at the time I didn't understand anxiety and depression very well, and I wasn't familiar with the concept of self-medicating. I also didn't know how addictive pain killers are. After his freshman year things seemed to subside, but when I came home after senior year, my dad told me that my mom had found prescription opiates in his room and that he admitted to doing heroin a few times. My whole life, my dad has been a functional alcoholic and pothead. I always knew that he drank pretty regularly, but he managed to keep his weed usage secret from me until after I left for college and I became more familiar with how people look and behave if they have been smoking weed. Another thing that happened after I left for college is that my brother says he started to drink a lot more in the living room, instead of in his workroom that is connected to our garage, so it became apparent that he wasn't just having a few beers during sports games.

Current Situation: I left home shortly after graduation to work an internship in another state and then went to grad school for a year. Since coming home from grad school, I have been living at home so I can save money and pay off my loans more quickly. During the time that I have been home, my brother has definitely been using on and off, if not constantly. He has been put through a few outpatient treatment programs, to little avail. He claims he had been sober for a year prior to his most recent relapse, but I am dubious of that. He has been trying to get clean recently, going to church and NA meetings, but couldn't stop using, so right now he is in a 1 month inpatient program.

My dad has been dealing with an adult-diagnosis of asthma that has recently been rediagnosed to COPD after he had to take a trip to the emergency room. Since the rediagnosis I haven't noticed any signs that he has been high on weed, but it definitely seems like he has been drinking more, presumably in part because of the escalation of the situation with my brother, but perhaps in part because he has lost the long-time crutch of marijuana. The company he worked for dissolved 3 months ago and as far as I can tell he isn't even really looking for a new job, and all the financial responsibilities now fall on my mom. I have recently started paying my mom a little bit of money to help her out with the utilities. But my mom doesn't know how she's going to be able to pay the deductibles for my dad's emergency room trip and my brother's inpatient treatment program. I have some money in savings but I know I would break the bank if I gave her the money for those two bills (considering I myself have tens of thousands of dollars of debt). 

My Thoughts: I already feel like I have exhibited so much codependent behavior (like not voicing concerns about my brother's odd behavior sooner, or not telling my dad that he's going to drink himself to death), I would just be throwing myself in the proverbial deep end if I helped pay for either of those things. Like I would be sucked even further into the role of playing the golden child that oldest siblings in dysfunctional families often end up playing. My college loans are not so overwhelming relative to my income that I NEED to live at home with my parents. None of my friends understand why I'm still living here. Part of it is that I'm a very frugal person but another part is that I sincerely hoped, naively and mostly in vain, that by living at home I could somehow set a good example for my brother and father of how to lead a healthier life. At this point though the stress has really become a heavy burden, and I realize that my efforts are futile if they don't want to change themselves. My brother, for the time being, seems like he does want to change, but my father doesn't even think he has a problem and doesn't even notice the parallels between his usage and my brother's. I hate to leave my mom to deal with this mess on her own (she is another reason I have continued to live at home for so long) but I worked really hard to get to this point in my life, to try to make things easier for myself, and I feel more stress and anxiety than I ever have.

I already wrote a long wall of text, and don't want to add any more detail because I want to get some sleep, but hopefully this makes sense and I didn't gloss over anything too important. I will continue reading the posts in this sub to try to learn from other people's experiences."

-Looking to leave my job ASAP to relocate and want to make the career change at the same time

-I have to be able to work full time during anything I decide to do, I am willing to work extra if necessary to get experience

-Goal is to get my Masters in Accounting and CPA


I have a goal, but I'm a little unsure of how to get there with my current predicament. I've researched but I need some advice in two areas: obtaining the education and gaining experience.


For the education part, I have no accounting experience. I tried job searching for entry level but everything in the CA Bay Area in AP requires two years of experience. I need to relocate ASAP and need to find something accounting related. 

Option 1: Get an Accounting Certificate--&gt;about a 3 months process, not sure what the job prospects would look like for this alone

Option 2: Do some prerequisites and start a Master's in Accounting program--&gt;1-2 years, but would I be able to get anything entry level in the meantime or am I stuck working my current job until I'm nearly complete


For the experience part:

Internships: I don't have a choice and really have to continue to work Mon-Fri, if there were internships available early mornings, late nights or weekends I'll jump on that

Entry-level: everything I saw requires experience. I did read somewhere that I could look for bookkeeping or accounting clerk positions in the interim. 
Does anyone have any advice on where to start for an entry level experience with virtually no experience? Or am I looking at having to complete x number of classes before I can even apply?


Ultimately, I would really like to have left my current job like yesterday, but I want to make the move to Accounting if I'm leaving my job and not just a meaningless in-between job. Any advice at all would be such a great help. Thank you for reading this and helping me out!

5kwjt3,1,2016-12-29,Craggy Exterior couldn't be more confusing for such simple on paper ability as it stands currently,ZzZombo,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5kwjt3/craggy_exterior_couldnt_be_more_confusing_for/,"7.00 update has the following regarding Craggy Exterior:

&gt; Craggy Exterior Armor increased from 2/3/4/5 to 3/4/5/6  
Craggy Exterior proc now only affects melee heroes, no longer has a 300 range.  
Craggy Exterior proc damage increased from 25/35/45/55 to 40/50/60/70  
Craggy Exterior chance rescaled from 10/15/20/25% to 25%  
Craggy Exterior stun duration rescaled from 1/1.25/1.5/1.75 to 0.5/1.0/1.5/2

While in-game tooltip says:

&gt; Causes damage to bounce back on Tiny's attackers. Melee enemies have a chance to be stunned.

Contradicting quite badly with the update notes: 1) it implies ranged units still get some effect from the ability, the ""damage to bounce back"", 2) implies that it's only the stun effect that discriminates between attackers. Considering it's Valve we speaking about here, I wouldn't be surprised that a) the patch notes were wrong from the start, b) they were correct at the start, but at some point it got changed, but they forgot to update them, c) the intern who worked on the page poorly worded them, d) the intern who worked on the tooltip misunderstood *horribly* the first intern.

Piss me off some more, Valve."

5kx5sx,7,2016-12-29,"I fear my GF (25) and I (27) are headed for a crossroads, and I don't know what to do",crazytom57,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/5kx5sx/i_fear_my_gf_25_and_i_27_are_headed_for_a/,"So some background on us: my GF and I have been doing distance for 6.5 years , 3 of them USA - Austria (2 years we were both studying, 1 were I was working), 1 Chicago - Minnesota (where I was still working and my GF studying abroad) and now 2.5 years Germany - Austria (I was able to get a transfer to my company's Frankfurt office and my GF finished her studies and is now doing her required internship).  

Now, after my GF (who is an english/German language teacher) finishes her teaching internship in July she wants us to live together or she is ending the relationship.  I am all for living together, because I love her, so this is fine.  So what she wants is to take a year to go move to an exotic location (Africa, Asia or South/Central America) where we work/travel for 1-2 years and then find somewhere to settle down.  

Again totally on board with this, however the issue is that she wants to pre-decide on the location, meaning that we both apply to jobs, and the first one that gets a hit, the other follows no matter what.  Now, as she works as an language teacher, and myself as an advertising/marketing executive her skillset is much easier to transfer to other countries than mine.  I have tried to explain this, but she has told me that if I do not get a job in the country where she does (assuming she gets one first), then I will need to quit my job and go live with her, or she will break with up with me because ""all my friends do this, if we are really right for each other you would choose me over your career.""

I do love her, and want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I also care a lot about my career as I have been busting my ass at my job to get transferred to Europe in the first place - (which was a long shot, though my GF has never forgiven me for only getting transferred to Germany, and not to Austria, even if it meant quitting) - and have a lot of potential in this industry (my boss even says I have future CEO potential). However, she interprets this as me putting my career over her, but how can I tell her that I want both? Is that too much to ask? 

To be perfectly honest, I do not care where we live, as long as we live together.  There is no chance that she would move to Germany (she hates it there).  There COULD be a chance that I convince her to move to somewhere else in Europe or the US with me (which would be easier for my job) - but I know to her this would be like settling, as her dream is to go on this exotic trip, I am just worried that my job will not be able to facilitate this - but I hope I am wrong.  

I am not the best at communicating, as my GF can get very defensive/aggressive when I try to have tough conversations (she gets it from her father, an emotionally/verbally abusive retired truck driver) - so I am looking to a neutral party for some guidance.  What do I do? What do I say? Help is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: After 6.5 years of distance, my girlfriend (who I want to spend the rest of my life with) and I can finally live together, but she wants us to move to an exotic location, and wants me to even quit my promising career if it achieves that - or else it shows I don't love her enough.  How do I make her understand that I want her and my job?"
5kxcqn,12,2016-12-29,3 months sobriety today,yoghity,quittingkratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/5kxcqn/3_months_sobriety_today/,"Hey guys. It's been awhile since I last gave an update. Today marks 3 months sober and my life has changed so much in just this last quarter of the year. 

I've been working full time as an intern and making money. I've also routinely been attending drug counseling. 

I last talked to my ex on my birthday earlier this month telling her I appreciated the birthday wish, but I feel uncomfortable talking to her right now. I went on to tell her that she left me at the worst part of my life and although I can understand why she did it, I'm trying to forgive her for abandoning and hurting me. Counseling has helped me realize that she chose to leave me and trying to make things work with her won't help me. My ex's sister texted me on Christmas saying I should talk to my ex and wish her a Merry Christmas because she's feeling depressed. That's really not my job, so I refused and said I'm trying to move on. 

Speaking of moving on, I met a new girl. Ironically enough, she's a counselor who has worked as a substance abuse counselor. She's working on her Ed D, which is exciting. We met through a mutual friend and we clicked instantly. She's been super helpful and I feel I can confide in her. 

Counseling is going well, but I still get cravings at times. A big reason for deciding against relapse when I have cravings is that in counseling, we have to confirm our sobriety date. I could just lie about it, but I'm at the point where I would feel too guilty about that. I don't think I would have felt like that before the counseling. 

My life is going very well right now. Thanks everyone for the support. I'll try my best to keep this up. "

Our fathers are best friends, and run a law firm together. As a result we spent a fair amount of together while growing up. We were never best friends, but we got along well enough and enjoyed each others company.*

*However, for years I've wanted you. You're four years older than me, when you were fifteen and I was eleven you joined your high schools cheer squad, your uniform fit your body perfectly, and the sight of you in it practically jump started puberty for me. And as we got older you only got hotter and my lust for you grew. When I was thirteen and you were seventeen our families went on a joint vacation to the Caribbean, while we were there you and I took a picture together on the beech. I kept a copy of that photo in my room, and would often jerk off to it. Your body was so perfect, especially in the bikini you wore that day.*

*I never acted on my desires, fearing that you'd reject me or that it would make things weird given how often we saw one another, but by the time you left for college I could barely keep myself from getting hard whenever I was around you.*

*After you left, my lust died a little bit, you were still without a doubt the hottest women I'd ever seen. I still wanted you, and I still used that photo when horny, but I wasn't as filled with desire for you. I'd even dated and fucked one of the girls who had joined the cheer squad your senior year. But each time you came home, I noticed you become even hotter.*

*This past year I started as a Freshman at the college you attended. You were doing an extra semester and my parents had asked you to show me around and watch out for me while you were still at school. As a result we ended up spending more time together in a few months than we had since you left for school.*

*It drove me mad! You had spent all summer at an internship for a company you wanted to work for. I hadn't seen you since the previous Christmas, and since then you'd somehow gotten so much better looking. The lust I'd had for you in my early teens returned tenfold, but I still didn't act on it. You were fucking perfect, and I couldn't imagine confronting you with my desire.*

*You found out though. For Christmas this year, your parents decided to go on a second honeymoon. As a result you were staying with my family through the holiday. I tried not to, I didn't want to risk it with you sleeping down the hall, but I broke. Earlier that day I had walked in on you changing, you were only wearing a bra and panties, and I couldn't get the picture out of my head. That night, when I thought everyone had gone to bed I jerked off to that picture in my head. Moaning your name under my breath, almost grunting it.*

*You caught me. You'd left your phone charger in my room and came to get it, and instead you found me, half naked, hard cock in my hand, moaning your name. Before I could react you had stripped down and mounted me. We didn't fuck long, I had already been close when you barged in. But it was the greatest pleasure I'd ever felt. You seemed to have enjoyed it as well. Before you went back to your room you told me* *""Just let me know if you want to do that again."" *

*It's been a week since then and I haven't taken you up n your offer, fearing that it was some kind of joke on your part. Meanwhile you've grown impatient, and have decided that if I won't make the first move, you will.*

In this Roleplay, I want you to seduce me. How you do it is up to you. Maybe you just tease me until I snap and pin you to the ground. Maybe you still have your high school cheer uniform and decided to fulfill my earliest fantasy. However you do it, I want to be teased and seduced by you. Don't worry, you won't be in charge the whole time. Once you break me down, I'll be much more aggressive. ;)

Kinks: Being seduced, teasing, semi-rough sex, spanking(giving, not receiving). Breasts(Watching them bounce might turn me on more than anything)

Turn offs/Will not do: Toilet play, incest, rimming.

Send me a letter if you're interested.

Upon the completion of this semester, the 12 credit hours I took pushed me past the 150 mark required by the AICPA for CPA certification. I have successfully passed 2/4 of my CPA exams and have a full time offer with a Big 4 firm that I received after my internship this past summer. The reason I am seeking advice is due to the fact I am unsure if I want to continue in the masters program I am in. To continue will cost me thousands of dollars for credit hours I no longer need. I feel that the theoretical concepts I am learning, while interesting, are further preparing me  for my career that I begin in August. What I would like to do is spend this time to wrap up my last 2 CPA exams (REG and FAR), and then refocus my attention to improving my skills in Excel. I am posting this before I reach out to my mentor at the firm, but I just wanted to see what this community thinks. I am not normally a person that quits things, and that last thing I want is for the firm to perceive it that way, but the monetary and time costs of continuing are very significant and it seems the cost benefit is not there. Many professionals have expressed to me that they do not feel a MAcc is that valuable of a degree and that a CPA says it all. Thank you for any feedback!"
5kyytb,2,2016-12-29,Should I tell my parents?,rickyHowy,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/5kyytb/should_i_tell_my_parents/,"Hi I'm a 20 year old college student and I'm not sure if I should tell my parents that I vape weed, and that I want to vape weed at home. 

I'm in my sophomore year at a good local public University studying Computer Science. I've just had the most successful semester, and I started vaping seriously last semester. I got A's in all 4 of my classes including two hard computer science courses), became a Computer Science tutor for the school, and recently got a job to be a resident assistant for my university next year. The resident assistant job was very competitive and I ended up getting one of three spots, that 145 people applied for. I also started a moderately succesful art club at my university and managed to get funding from the school - about $4000 actually! In addition to all those things I'm also interviewing at several large tech companies for a summer internship, which would provide me with a good income.

My semester was incredibly difficult and very stressful. Vaping helped remove a lot of stress and made it easy to sleep at night, it's also fun  for me. 

I'm home staying at my parents house for Holiday break, and I don't have to go back to school until February. I half a half oz of good weed with me that I was planning on using all through January with my Arizer Solo.

I want to vape while I'm on vacation. I'm in an illegal state and I know my parents are against 'drugs' in general. They only drink wine and I've never seen them drunk in 20 years and we are very close. However my dad does dip every night, so he's kind of a hypocrite in my eyes. My parents caught me smoking out a shitty pipe last summer and they were both extremely disappointed and asked me to stop. I told them I would. In reality I ramped things up and I think they will be disappointed that I lied to them. 

Last night I vaped in my bathroom and it was awful. I feel like a junkie having to try and hide all my stuff and it makes me super paranoid. The paranoia of getting caught actually ruined the whole experience. I can't really vape anywhere else in secrecy, unless I do it in my bathroom after they go to bed - which is sometimes never because my parents work at home and often work all day and night.

I was thinking of just telling everything I've told you guys, giving them links to a few studies and websites explaining marijuana in depth and asking them if I can vape at home. Stupid idea? 

EDIT: My fear of telling them is that my parents pay for everything. I pay for my weed stuff with my tutoring money exclusively however. I'm afraid they'll pull all their funding, which is over $20k a year that I wouldn't be able to make up."

I've been home for Christmas break since the 16th of December, and while school does not start again until January 9th, I intend to go back on the 2nd with my boyfriend when he swings by for New Years. We've been apart all break, and I didn't get to spend much time with him finals weekend and the week leading up to it.


When I casually mentioned that I was going back on the 2nd to my parents, they both just said no and acted like I wasn't going. My parents and I have always had a fairly good relationship, but there is nothing for me to do in my home town, so I rarely visit during school except for breaks. During the summer, I generally have an internship elsewhere, but I try to visit at least once. 


However, when I am home, we play board games the first night and that's it. Every other night besides that my parents are on the computer/Ipad/tv and we do nothing. It's a small town, so there's nothing to do here and no one I'd particularly care to do stuff with. I understand they'd both like to just relax after work, but it seems ridiculous to expect me to spend the extra week with them instead of going back to college, where I actually have things to do, instead of sitting bored at home and doing nothing productive.


Am I being disrespectful by wanting to leave early? Should I just suck it up and leave on the 8th instead of the 2nd? I understand they miss me, but I call them every Sunday, and when I'm here we never end up doing much together. I'm concerned it will hurt my Mom's feelings if I do and she will lash out by threatening my financial aid (happens often when we argue but seems to just be talk). On the other hand, I would like to assert my independence, as I am treated like a child when I am home.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Parents both said no when I told them my plans to leave on the 2nd instead of the 8th (break ends on the 9th). I've already been here for two weeks and am bored out of my mind. Am I being disrespectful/unreasonable for wanting to leave on the 2nd instead? Leaving on the 2nd will probably hurt my Mom's feelings and cause her to lash out by threatening my financial aid, which happens often we we argue but seems to be just talk."

I originally started off college strong 4 years ago as an English major, then after researching the job market decided to switch to computer science after my freshman year. My grades tanked although I usually withdrew before the deadline to keep my GPA safe. I tried, again and again, thinking this semester would be the one where it would click and I would enjoy it. I had internships each summer of the 3 years I was in the program, one in a small business with a start-up style culture; one in a corporate environment (which paid a college intern VERY well but it was the most miserable summer of my life); and one in government. Finally, I decided that I was just wasting my time/money and rather than starting a semester just to later withdraw, I needed to take some time and just work and figure out WTF I want to do. 

Please, I know it was really stupid of me to continue starting semesters thinking this would always somehow be the semester I rocked it, only to withdraw. What's done is done, I can't reverse that. 

So here I've been, I worked two part-time jobs for a while, about 30 hours a week each. I was so burnt out on not knowing what to do with my life and disappointment in myself for dropping out of college and feeling like a failure compared to my friends, I attempted suicide. I was hospitalized for 3 days. Thankfully, once I was no longer in school I could no longer remain on my parent's insurance, so I had gotten Medicaid through the marketplace, so my whole stay and subsequent treatment have been almost free. 

However this hospital stay triggered a new drive in me to go back to just finding something I enjoyed/loved and as long as I could at least provide for myself/ maybe a family in the future, I was ok with that. I ended up getting a phone call to Vet Tech for a local animal hospital for 10.00/hr and no required certification. The time since I left school was about a year and a half ago.  I had deferred my loans this whole time, dealing with so much even though I knew I should have been at least keeping track with my balance. I just checked them today and...

I owe 20,000. That's not even what I make in a year, but I guess it could be worse. "
5l1787,4,2016-12-29,One month tomorrow,Bigblueduck,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/5l1787/one_month_tomorrow/,"I turned 24 yesterday. I didn’t do much, ate some pizza and cheesecake (my favorite dessert) and watched 30 Rock. I always hated my birthdays because they reminded me about how much I hadn’t done that year. Mostly because I spent all my free time gaming. I saw a video of myself from before I was 13, before I’d started playing runescape, and I looked so happy. I was smiling and laughing. I was full of energy. I had all my hair (lol).
When I saw that I cried. I haven’t laughed or smiled genuinely like that in sooo long. 

Gaming took away all of my youth. Ever since I quit 29 days ago I’ve felt like I’m playing catch up. Yes I’ve graduated college and done some things while gaming, but I have no real hobbies, I haven’t done anything exciting in months. I’m still unemployed because I didn’t meet people during college, and I didn’t want to do internships because it would take away time from gaming, and I spent a good four months after graduating playing to make up for the pain I was feeling about not having a job.

The worst part of addiction is that most of that time is lost. I gave up meeting girls, meeting new friends, going places, being healthier, learning cool hobbies, all because I wanted to get better at a video game. I know I can’t get that time back, and there’s no point thinking about it but sometimes I just can’t help it. Now that I’m trying new hobbies, they just feel so flat compared to gaming, so I can’t really tell if I’m enjoying them or not. It sucks. I think that’s why I played so much, because even though I hated it, at least I was good at it. Now I’m starting my life over from square one pretty much. I guess I get to build myself how I want to be, but it’s also a pretty daunting task. I have a lot of work to do and that scares me and demotivates me. 

When I turn 25 next year, I don’t want to look back on a wasted year. I want to fill it with new things, all of those ‘firsts’ that I never had time for when I was gaming. I guess that’s one good part about addiction is that you want to make the best of your future and you’d do anything not to fuck up again.

5l1ap0,9,2016-12-29,"I had a sexual relationship with my botany teacher. To this day we still keep in ""touch"".",_Dorkus_Prime_,real_sex_stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/real_sex_stories/comments/5l1ap0/i_had_a_sexual_relationship_with_my_botany/,"I've posted about it on reddit, but I had a 1 1/2 year sexual relationship with my botany teacher in 11 and 12th grade. It started out as romantic, then moved on to very passionate romance. Her and I were just absolutely into everything together. We loved plants, we loved the same music, we even would always see each other at the same films and our in the same stores.
About a month into my 11th grade year, She took me on as a Teaching assistant (I took the class the two years prior and I fit the reqs for my highschools aid program, essentially elective teachers could ""intern"" a student and it'd go towards their grade). I would have to stay after class with her and arrive early to school to help her set up. One morning we (I shit you not) reached for the same folder and we kind of just eyed each other for a little bit. 

That afternoon we talked, kissed for a bit, made out for a bit more, then I made a move. I started sucking her neck and she got incredibly uncomfortable knowing her husband would see it. So told me I couldn't ever do that again, no matter how much she wanted it. Two days went by, and there was nothing but pure sexual tension. I stopped by to work on the greenhouse with her on weekends. Saturday morning I come in, she's already there bent over some pots filling them with dirt. I move in behind her and grab her hips and say ""busy stuffing some holes?"" we both laughed it off. On our lunch that day, she kissed me, and then moved on to kiss my neck.

From here on, everything in this will be incredible NSFW.

She noticed my boner and instantly made a move for it. She was shocked. I've always had a larger cock, it's what got me into porn. I was 17 years old with an 8 inch cock and a 40 year old woman drooling over it. She started with a really simply blowjob, then we just talked after I came in her mouth. She had always fantasized about bigger cocks. And she apparently said mine looked just like she imagined it would while she masturbated/slept with her husband. From then on, we had sex pretty much every day..for a year and a half, even over the summer we would meet up in parking lots and hotels. I was fucking her more than and better than her husband ever did. I even got to cum, which she told her husband grossed her out, and even got to be the first man in her ass.

Sadly, her husband eventually found pictures and videos of us on her phone which she got away with claiming ""they're just old"" and or ""they're just from a porn site"". He never met me, and I'm glad he didn't.

The summer of 12th grade I taught a class in summer school, she'd come down and we'd fuck after the classes. We spent hours in that greemroom exploring each others bodies and discovering kinks and fetishes. Eventually, we broke it off. Sometimes she still text me and I text back. I told her when I Got into porn, and I would always send her my videos and stuff and she'd send me videos of her watching them and playing with herself.

I would give anything to be with her one more time."
5l1e1f,1,2016-12-29,I wanted to share my story. Little Red Riding Hood from the Wolf's perspective.,Wildely_Earnest,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5l1e1f/i_wanted_to_share_my_story_little_red_riding_hood/,"My ex dumped me on September 8th at 6pm. I remember the date and time exactly because it was two hours after a repeat exam which she told me I ""need to take seriously, because people do fail those, and I won't be able to go out with you if you're not in college anymore"". Needless to say this freaked me out and I spent the summer stressing over my first job - an internship I couldn't perform well in; spending all of my remaining hours studying in the library; desperately doubting whether she was pulling away from me, or if I was expecting an unreasonable amount of contact due to being in an apartment by myself with no friends in the city and no free time. This is not a story of her being a bad person by the way. I worry that in her story I'm the villain. In mine we all wear grey hats.

We met just over two years ago and started going out before we really knew each other. It was in the first month of college and borne of that atmosphere of improvised chaos. As it turned out, we got on incredibly well and almost all of our interests overlapped. There were times when she questioned whether we were too alike, and I had been described to her family by friends as ""basically a male version of [my ex]"". However, I felt that things got too intense sometimes. There was moment when we were playing around in the bedroom and she said ""it's like we're connected"". Those words freaked me out -- I was eighteen and not one for the idea of being fated -- but I let it slide without comment because she was amazing in so many other ways. However, more issues cropped up over time. She was very possessive of me. When I was with her it felt like she wanted all of me, when we were apart, it felt like I got none of her. I was missing out on what college life had to offer because of how all-encompassing she was.

Then came the Christmas holidays and I began to think about things. She had been acting very sensitively lately (a product of going on the pill I heard, so I forgave it), and I was struggling to maintain a life apart from her, both socially and academically; I had only one friend, a girl from the same hometown as me that I met in my first week of college, and my girlfriend. I didn't feel like her love of me was rational or would last; I felt romanticised into someone else whose image I couldn't live up to. Add to that the fact that she refused to visit me on my birthday, and I felt like I had had enough. I was going to break up with her.

Step up New Years Eve and a night out with my very close friend (female) who was not fond of my gf at all. Add a group of homosexual friends of her's exchanging bets on whether or not I was gay and which of them could get off with me. Add a dash of my other friends, none of whom had a romantic interest in each other, preparing to kiss each other at midnight. My friend says I have to kiss someone at midnight. I reply that my gf didn't come up. She says 'kiss me'. We do. It was world-stopping and she went off to cry immediately after. I started to freak out and tried to hook up my friend with a guy she liked to get her away from me, but it didn't happen. We decided that it happened last year (yeah, we were hilarious), and to just pretend it didn't happen.

I decided not to tell my gf because I was pondering breaking up with her anyway, and if I did, and we didn't, I would be forced to push my only good friend away, something I really didn't want to do. After returning to college, a week or two passed of my gf being truly amazing and kind, but with me not being emotionally present. It climaxed in us having sex and me really not caring about it or being involved at all. Afterwards, she began talking about how things hadn't been going well recently but with some work she felt they could be righted again. I panicked. I couldn't commit to fixing things while I was contemplating ending them, and I told her so. I broke up with her. She got angry and left. I went to my friend's place because she told me not to be alone. I cried non-stop. I kept crying for two days. My gf got in touch and sent me a letter detailing all the good times we had, how the concerns I had would be dealt with, and begged me not to do something I would regret. I decided to get back together with her and apologised for everything, laying myself at her feet. We agreed to see each other every wednesday to prevent us getting too on top of each other, a routine which slowly decayed as our relationship improved, which I was okay with.

A month or two passed and my friend made another move on me. I was supposed to be helping her write an essay, but it became apparent that I was the only one with any interest in the essay. She casually placed her hand on my thigh. I pushed it off. Tense minutes passed and the hand returned. I parried. I began disappearing into myself. Eventually the hand began undoing my fly and I resisted again. This time I was pushed back onto my bed forcefully. I can't pretend that a certain part of me wasn't enjoying the attention, but I definitely didn't want anything to happen. She was stronger than me though (I am quite thin) and I didn't feel I could force my way out. In many ways, it wasn't that she was physically imprisoning me, more that I didn't have the confidence in my physicality to view it as a resource to end the situation. She took out my penis and put it in her mouth. It was nice, but I was staring at the pillow where my gf, who would never push me in this way, or make me do something I didn't want to do, or make me feel violated and ashamed, slept, and I gathered my resolve. I pushed her off me (as it turns out ladies and gents, the gesture of pushing is often enough without the need to physically move them). I zipped myself up and told her 'no', or some paraphrasing of that. She left shortly after.

Days later I received a text apologising for the previous night and asking if we could hang out without anything happening to be friends again. I was very keen for nothing to happen and agreed. I have always been an incredibly naive and social ignorant person. We were watching a movie at her apartment, on her bed, when she began to kiss me and lie on top of me. I'm sure this wasn't meant to be dominating, but her weight on top of me (it was muscle btw) told me uncertainly that I couldn't shake her off this time. That this was happening again also told me that 'no' and its synonyms offered no solutions. She moved towards my crotch again. All I wanted was for her not to touch me. Throughout this entire debacle I felt that if I did nothing, nothing would happen. That if I did no wrong, no wrong would be done. I suppose it was because of my naive thoughts on what it means to be a man on the subject of sex. All I could think was 'don't let her touch me'. I used my hand to please her, slid her limp body off of mine, and left.

The next day I was at my gf's. I received the message ""last night was really fun ;)"". I replied ""yes it was, but it can't happen again"", though I had absolutely no idea how to prevent it happening again. I logged onto my fb account on my gf's laptop. Opened the conversation, stared at my friend's message and closed it down again before my gf walked into the room. She later confronted me and I told her what had happened, but not everything. Not until a month ago did I tell her everything. I thought that the fact was stranger than fiction. That it would sound and seem too much like I was editing the story to my benefit. I decided to surrender myself to her utterly and offer no defense to myself. I remember feeling like I wouldn't believe my own words, so why should she?

We stayed together. My friend was kicked out of my life and things got much, much better. I was no longer depressed. I realised I had zombified myself to escape from the situation and misappropriated those feeling to being due to my gf. We became incredibly close again.

We stayed together for another year and a half when she pulled away over that summer that I was utterly and totally alone and overworked. I still love her very much and completely understand why she left me. The words ""I don't want my only relationship to be with someone who cheated on me"" still ring in my ears as very true and understandable.

However, after what happened, I surrendered my life to her completely, meaning that most of my friends were her friends etc. After the breakup, whenever she saw me, she felt like I was trying to corner her. I felt like I was being painted as an insane person. I know that I'm a kind and empathetic person and I care deeply about her, it just felt like neither of us were ready to meet the right person at 18. We couldn't handle the obstacles life throws at a couple. I became very depressed but tried to be assertively civil to her when our paths crossed. There was a night where the degree of my depression was apparent to her and she passed me off to my cousin and cut-off contact. A completely understandable move, and my greatest regret was getting drunk and opening dialogue with her that night. It was incredibly stupid (my shame from that moment fueled me seeking help from counselling and I've recently begun a treatment of anti-depressants).

When next I saw her she ran from me, into a locked door, turned around and begged me to leave her alone (I was coming down the stairs at a college event we both happened to be at). She'd been giving my the look of death in the moments before. I offered to lie down and let her kick me for a bit if she wanted. She just begged me to leave her alone. I felt like a monster and left before her friends could gather the pitchforks and torches. The guy she was with was able to score bonus points with her by comforting her from the monster that was me. That was what hurt the most.

From counselling, I was able to talk about what happened with my friend in the earlier paragraphs; the details of which I had never shared with my ex. I wrote a very deliberate account of what happened, explained my reasons for not feeling like I could it prior to now, and emailed it to her. She responded thanking me for giving her the full story, said she was sorry I never felt secure enough to talk about it while we were together and asked me not to contact her again, citing my actions since the breakup as having being the reason for a lot of her pain. This was two months ago and we haven't spoken since.

My current state of mind is I feel I am being blamed for too many of her emotions. That she was always going to hurt from the breakup, but that she spent the summer transforming her image of me into someone im not and is now attributing the reason for her pain to that person. I understand why she broke up with me, but I still deeply care and love her. I don't think she understands how her actions over the summer hurt me. She cut me down, made excuses constantly, and essentially lied to me for why contact was so difficult for her to make. I still have nightmares about that summer and it baffles me that she can't see that she did wrong.

Long story short, she was everything I loved in my life and I'm now searching for a new love. Though hopefully this new love will be less temporal than a girl. As Oscar Wilde said, to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance. I just wanted to share my story. I don't enjoy being the bad guy. I hope that you see me a little greyer than the people I used to know. (sorry for the long post; I've been bothering my friends in search of catharsis for far too long)"
5l1fsf,1,2016-12-29,[Advice]Soon to graduate engineering major interested in analytics,loner-_-,Analyst,https://www.reddit.com/r/Analyst/comments/5l1fsf/advicesoon_to_graduate_engineering_major/,"Hey everyone, I'm about to graduate with my electrical engineering degree but am looking to see if I would be good candidate for data analytics.


My experience is pretty broad, but I'll give you a good idea. I've worked in engineering internships ranging from controls engineering, avionics testing, machine learning research, and finally software development. I'm not about to summarize all of this but the following is a good list of what I think would be relevant:


* SQL experience (work with postgreSQL in my current software development role).

* programing and agile development in general (I use python, ruby on rails, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, and other frameworks as a full stack developer)

* I write a lot about research results due to also being an undergraduate researcher in computer vision and machine learning. I typically use Matlab for prototyping machine learning algorithms, but use python with scikit learn too. I've literally taken classes specifically for machine learning to give you an idea.

* I have experience working with rather (honestly, flat out) unpleasant people in my controls engineering days. Just picture a plant manager ripping into you because he forgot where you installed the controller...

* Before my engineering internships, I worked as both a tutor and an administrative assistant. So communication is something I'm not new too.

* I took a workshop in data wrangling and visualization in R, which actually got me into data analysis in general.

* Finally, I really do like being a pleasant person to people. If you met me and got to know me as a coworker, you may say the same my past and present bosses would tell me --&gt; ""You just make everyone feel important and ready to work.""


Based on what I just listed, am I qualified for a position in analytics? I realize there're a wide variety of jobs out there that have similar roles but different focusses, but would like to hear from those working in those jobs currently. What position would you say I would fit best in? I do like messing with data, making predictions/decisions, and communicating/collaborating with others. I am considering going back to school to become a data scientists, but right now would like to simply go to work, get experience, and focus more on my personal life.


Thanks in advance for any input everyone, I really appreciate it."

I'm a gay guy, young ""twink"" college student. Go on chatrandom and find someone, I like getting people off and being commanded around.

I've talked to some guys who think I should start camming for money like on Chaturbate. He thinks I'd make a lot of money doing it. I could use the money for college so why not. It's something I've thought of doing though one thing kind of worries me.

I'm studying Computer Science and Geography, with intentions of probably working for the government or some security contractor. I'm worried this may be something to come up in a background check when getting a security clearence. I could find an internship for the summer that requires one, or it could be for a job after graduation, or it could be I never need one.

5l1i4s,5,2016-12-29,Summer sources of income for graduate student?,notmadatkate,academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/5l1i4s/summer_sources_of_income_for_graduate_student/,"I just started my graduate studies, and am curious about the best ways to look for sources of income during the summer. I am on a TAship with a 9-month stipend, but it just isn't quite enough to get me through the other 3 months of a year (unless I moved in with my dad). I don't have savings. 

I feel that in my industry (computer science), most companies don't want employees with advanced degrees. Therefore, there aren't a lot of graduate-level internships available. Those that exist are highly competitive and only at very large corporations. As this is my first year, I won't have much to put on those applications, so I'm not hopeful.

I'm also not sure how research grants tend to go. Would the grants with proposals due this spring offer funding for summer 2017, or just for summer 2018?

I'm a gay guy, young ""twink"" college student. Go on chatrandom and find someone, I like getting people off and being commanded around.


I've talked to some guys who think I should start camming for money like on Chaturbate. He thinks I'd make a lot of money doing it. I could use the money for college so why not. It's something I've thought of doing though one thing kind of worries me.


I'm studying Computer Science and Geography, with intentions of probably working for the government or some security contractor. I'm worried this may be something to come up in a background check when getting a security clearence. I could find an internship for the summer that requires one, or it could be for a job after graduation, or it could be I never need one.


**Would camming/getting money from chaturbate effect my security clearence chances in the future?**"

I'm a 21 year old woman who is going to be graduating this upcoming May moving to Dulles to start working. This past summer, I was an intern for the same company and I lived in Ashburn...I hated it.

I would like to live closer to DC/a metro station so I can more easily get into DC after work on some nights if I wanted to, or at least more easily on the weekends. If going into DC after work some nights from wherever I lived would just be impossible, then I'd like to be in a town that had some things that I could go do. Obviously, I'd like to find a healthy medium of being closer to some things to do and having a not too awful commute.

Some people I worked with recommended Reston to me, but I'm not exactly sold on it. Does anyone have any suggestions on towns/cities that I should look into living in?

Also, if anyone has any recommendations for places to look online for apartments/roommates, please let me know too! Any input is appreciated :)"

Thanks to the leap year, my 365-day dry streak landed on my birthday!

This process wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. I slowly decreased my addiction over the two months leading up to my birthday, and it helped me a lot. Two months before I quit, I stopped using porn altogether, but kept masturbating almost daily. The month before I quit, I slowly backed off from once a day to once a week. I cranked out one last one on my birthday, and called it quits for good.

My life has improved immensely since I quit. I've become much more confident, my grades have improved, I've gotten a good internship along with my now larger classload, I sleep better every night, I met a great girl and lost my v-card, I can stand up for myself and come out on top in all my confrontations, I'm taller now (but that may not be related), my general outlook on life is better, I have an easier time handling my ADD, and much, much more.

To those of you just getting started, the first three weeks were by far the hardest. Giving up gets you nowhere, but if you do fall off the nofap horse, get back on it. This journey's well worth it. Best of luck to everyone."

However, I'm having a hard time getting a job (or even an internship) in my field. It's been years (~4-5 years) that I have searched and nothing. Now, I'm trying to go university to get a bachelors degree. I went to the university career counsellors and they told me ""what are your accomplishments?"" and ""what past projects have you done?"". That's when it hit me where it hurts the most. 

The reason why I said ""graduated"" (in quotations) is because after my 1st year in college, my program sort of collapsed, which means: literally all of my teachers were gone, the school spend a year and a half to replace them. They got other departments' teachers (similar programs) to fill in while they were searching. Thus, I was forced to learn computer languages (C,C++,,C#, Java, etc.) and theories in electronics on my own. They didn't even give us any projects to try and the grades were somewhat randomized. Yes there was a lawsuit against the department but the school just brushed it off the side. So I graduated with such dissatisfaction.

Now I'm starting over in university and struggling now because I also need to do their prerequisites too; thus, making me doubt I should keep going. Maybe, I am just clinging onto something I can't do anymore because before I wanted to be an engineer, but I don't even have the motivation nor guidance to move forward. 

Now a days I spend my time cooped up in my home, since I can't even get a job. And feel my mind slowly tearing itself apart. And Yes even thought about killing myself a few times. Barely talk to my friends and family, I even lashed out of them most of the time (not physically, just yelling or throw stuff around). I even feel like I wasted 10 years of my life pursuiting something that I wanted to do.
I really don't know what to do. I feel like I been in solitary confinement for a year or more. 
Maybe there's someone out there who can help me."
5l221i,3,2016-12-30,Highly successful but its never enough,stoptryingyourbad,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5l221i/highly_successful_but_its_never_enough/,"I am a 27-year-old male that comes from a relatively well-off family. My father was an immigrant from a war-torn country in the mid 80's. And my mother was a small-town farm girl. During the DOT-COM era they founded a highly successful tech firm that helped establish monetary stability for my siblings and I. 
The bar was set high, I did everything that society and my parents expected me to do. I attended a Tier 1 university, established leadership roles in many clubs and obtained very well regarded internships. I graduated top 15% of my class.
After college, I received a front office position at highly regarded Investment Bank where I worked 80 hour weeks for the next six years. I am now 27 years old, make over a quarter million a year and have accomplished everything that I once said ""I wanted to do"".
So what’s the problem? It may sound dumb, but no matter what I accomplish its never enough. No matter how much money I make, its never enough. No matter how well I perform at work, its never enough. Nothing is ever enough. I set goals in my life, but once I achieve them, I pass them off as “Fake”. I consistently compare myself “to the next guy” and never give myself credit for what I have accomplished. I have been going through this process ever since my parents small business blew up. And here I am, 27 years old, living what most people would call “the American dream” and I couldn’t be unhappier.
My work is my life, it takes over every aspect of my life. In the beginning, I was able to handle the 80-hour work weeks but time has taken its toll. No longer am I able to function at 100% capacity on 5 hours of sleep. Two years ago, I started taking Adderall to keep myself sharp and on point, but the negative side effects are truly effecting me. I can no longer sleep, I am consistently worried about current deal structures and next day meetings. When I’m not working, I’m drinking. 
To bring this to a conclusion. The other day, I woke up to news that one of my high school friends had passed. This moment of euphoria opened my eyes and made me question the value of my life. My friend has been traveling the world ever since we graduated high school, he worked odd jobs to support himself and married a girl who shares and values the same things in life. To me, he looked happy. I want to achieve his level of happiness. But I’m afraid that I will fail my parents and myself in pursuit of this happiness.
What do I do? Should I give up the “dream lifestyle”? Will leaving my life behind give me the ability to feel accomplished? Is their hope in this world?

So I was doing some research for a future internship and I'm stuck on understanding the linear algebra behind the policy gradient calculation. I know it's super simple, but I really don't understand it. :(

So in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf) paper, the showcase the policy gradient, specifically,

dL/dT = (dQ(s, a)/da)*(da/dT)

Where T is the theta, or the policy parameters. Now this equation makes entire logical sense to me, you are updating the policy parameters based on the direction your model expects to get more reward. 

What I don't understand is how the gradient ""multiplication"" works. dQ(s, a)/da calculates the gradient of a, and then da/dT calculates the gradients of T. If a is a 5 dimensional vector and T is say a 1000 dimensional vector (the weights of say a small neural network), how do you do this multiplication?

Thanks"

He was quite forward and asked me for my number after we had met a few times. We had lunch together with some coworkers and then he asked me out on a date. I really liked talking to him, and I was definitely interested. 

After the second date, we ended up back at my place and started fooling around. I am a virgin not because of any religious reasons, but because I want to be in a committed relationship before I have sex. I haven't talked to Sam about this and he doesn't know that I'm a virgin. Anyway, although this guy is really sweet and caring in person he was extremely rough when we were fooling around. 

I don't know if this is normal because I have never gone this far with someone this fast. But anyway here's what happened: We were making out and things were good. He started to dry hump me and really grind into me, which I didn't really mind but I also didn't feel in control at all. He then pulled down my pants and it all happened so fast. I tried to pull them back up, but then he already had his hands between my legs. I didn't say anything but I also didn't really feel comfortable. He then put a finger in my vagina and then another. I am super tight, and I have to be super turned on to fit two fingers in and even then it has never really been pleasurable. 

It hurt so I scoot my butt back away from him. He just seemed to follow and still try to finger me. I finally sort of involuntarily said Hey! and he stopped and started just rubbing my clit. It all happened really fast, and he was overall quite rough and forceful. 

I'm obviously inexperienced and I need to communicate that with him. He is otherwise a really sweet and caring guy, but to be honest that experience sort of scared me a little. I was shaking afterwards from anxiety I assume.

 I really want to enjoy sexual things and I really like the guy otherwise. How do I communicate my feelings to him? Are some guys just really into it and sort of aggressive like that? I have little experience so for all I know this is quite normal but it seems to have really shook me up. 
Any advice is really appreciated. "
5l33m5,25,2016-12-30,CMV: Academic advantages for women in STEM fields/courses in university and in the workforce is unfair and pointless,sourmilky,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5l33m5/cmv_academic_advantages_for_women_in_stem/,"Hello Reddit! Providing context I am also a young female who is interested and support the funding of STEM subjects and courses.

I value STEM field greatly as it contributes to the economy of society, and improving our well-being due to many scientific and technological discoveries. However, I feel like the gender-based advantaged for women are unfair to those who worked hard and would have a contribution to society in the future based on gender.

Here are my arguments.

1. The point of these advantages is to encourage women in STEM fields, and while some of these advantages are generous (gender-based scholarships, giving them more points to add to their university entry scores*, more likely to be chosen for internship at bigger company based on gender) t doesn't prepare them for 'real life' as these advantages just makes it /easier/ for them. A lot of boys/men have studied and worked hard, and I believe for STEM subjects its more important of the work you put rather than your gender. 

2. Pushing women into STEM fields and the workforce also doesn't guarantee a revolutionary success in STEM, and I find it unfair that some people miss out due to a gender-bias to encourage more people to do /said/ science.

3. There isn't any emphasis on men to get into female orientated courses such as nursing, which is just as stressful and pretty important in our society. Male nurses are also scrutinised - due to it being viewed as emasculating. I feel like there isn't a fair amount of social pushing for each gender in an opposite gender dominated field.

4. The problem is simply a societal issue where people are conditioned certain genders should act x, y and z. However, the solution could be also targeting middle schoolers and encourage more girls to get into science rather than have lenient policies surrounding women where it makes competition to get jobs/internships more harder if you're more qualified.

I know there's a social stigma, but I believe that those who are qualified should get the position in STEM fields especially. I know it's important to break those sexist ideologies but I don't think it's worth the risk to have someone who is not as talented in engineering - get a position over someone who is, based on their gender. The 21st century has been revolutionary due to the increase of feminism and people reinforcing an egalitarian approach to girls joining the army and encouraging them to engage more in the workforce. However, I just don't see the need for excessive benefits and leniencies.

--

* I live in Australia and our entry system is called an ATAR. Which is a scale between 30-99.95. An average ATAR for someone to get into a good university in STEM courses are around 90+. Some universities give 10 atar points to girls for choosing an engineering course. The problem is that our ATAR is ranking every student in the state, so for a girl that got an ATAR of 85, and giving her 10 extra points technically allows her to beat thousands of people for a position who did better than her, in said course.

5l3emc,1,2016-12-30,26M4A - Milking a Star,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5l3emc/26m4a_milking_a_star/,"Good morning, DPP! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

What are my chances for admission?,hereweah,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/5l72wa/is_law_school_right_for_me_what_are_my_chances/,"Hello all, I hope this is in the right subreddit, r/LawSchool seems to be aimed to active Law students exclusively. 

This is long winded, but I just want to provide as much detail as I can. I'm a senior at an average state level institution in the U.S. I have a 3.66 cumulative GPA. I am an Economics major with a philosophy minor. Originally I planned to go to grad school for Economics, but after thorough research and consideration, I don't think it is for me, at least not right away (if at all). Thus, my new plan is to work for a while and figure out the path that is best for me. 

After assessing my own skills, I have began to seriously consider law school. 

First off,  are there any entry level jobs in the field of law available for someone with just an undergraduate degree? If so, what are they and do they actually give someone an accurate picture of what being a lawyer may be like? 

Secondly, here are the caveats to my credentials. 

1) Many of my lowest grades are in classes that I just needed to fill for general education-easy classes that I COULD have gotten As in, but didn't because I was lazy and apathetic towards the material. I'm unsure if this could be a positive or negative to my application. 

2) As I was planning to go to grad school for Econ, I've taken a number of math/technical classes (MV calc, diff eqns, linear algebra, math proofs, computer science, etc). I've gotten an A in some, mostly A-, a couple Bs and one C. 

3) I had one bad semester. Without this semester my overall would be a 3.76. I was working 20 hours a week at an internship, as well as enrolled in two math classes. At the same time, decided Econ may not be for me, became careless and my grades suffered in those classes (C and B). 

4) I've never gotten anything other than a straight A on any paper I've written in college (and I've taken 5 more writing intensive courses than I am required to). 

5) One time when my previous roommate was prepping for the LSATs I decided to take a practice test with him. I only did each of the three sections once. I got 23/24 for the analytical section, 22/26 for the logical reasoning, and 18/28 for reading comprehension. 


To sum up, I'm a capable individual (at least I like to think so). You can probably see a theme in my caveats; if I'm into what I'm doing I generally do well, but if I'm not then I do poorly. 

Based on all this, what are your suggestions? I think I should try to find a job related to law to gauge how much I might actually enjoy it, based on my persona. But I don't even know where to begin. Any help regarding that will be much appreciated. 

And, to the best of your ability with the information provided, is it possible for me to get into (and I know rankings should be taken with a grain of salt), say a top 25 law school? Furthermore, is this top 25 a good threshold? All I can really speak for is Econ, but in that field if you aren't making this top list, it is highly debatable whether it's worth it. How does law school compare in that regard? In short, do you think I can get into a law school that will be 'worth it'? On the same line, how important is the school you attend vs your grades/work experience? 

I know there's a lot of questions. The reason being is before I dive into further research on my own, I'm looking for opinions from a qualified audience so I can gauge my position. Any advice is welcome, no matter how brief. 

Thank you for your time. "

I filled out FAFSA in October when it opened already, labeled Independent (yay!) and expecting full Financial Aid. Both campus project a $26k cost of attendance. This is excluding all FA and including housing/tuition/etc. 

Current financial aid maximum is $5,815. I'm also looking into Cal Grant B after my first year at the community college. There is a living allowance of up to $1,656 and tuition and fee reward after 1 year of max $5,472 at a CSU.

**26,000-12,943 = $13,057 = $26,114**

That's excluding internships of my Sophomore, Junior, and Senior year (doing summer classes in Freshman year), which regularly pay an average of $5k+ a month for 3 months. Which means I could pay off loans before school ended.

**I've also checked and am guaranteed all credits will transfer due to AS-T and awesome CSU and CC school collaboration.**

**ETA: FAFSA Loan Calculations:**

* Subsidized (Soph, Jun, Senior): $15,500

That would make ~11k of my loans unsubsidized.

**Edit 2:** Majoring in Computer Science in case anyone was wondering.

5l7mm7,12,2016-12-30,"Schizophrenic daughter [18] walking through northern Los Angeles since November, using our credit card for food. She refuses help - do we cut off the card?",Tug_the_Pug,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/5l7mm7/schizophrenic_daughter_18_walking_through/,"Our adult daughter (18) is a highly intelligent young woman who was attending (we thought) junior college. Until a week ago we were in denial about her condition, writing her off as ""eccentric"". She is smart but very naive and brittle. Her illness leads her to neglect herself, and since the time she was 16 + 1/2 she has rarely showered, never brushes her hair or teeth, refuses to use toilets (goes outside), wears old torn clothes and seldom any shoes, etc. Her diet is extremely spartan and has been getting more restrictive with each passing year. She engages in ritualistic behaviors like smudging dirt on her face and bumping her head repeatedly against trees, walls, etc. How we managed to write all that off as eccentricity is now beyond me.. it just crept up on us.

Long story short, after not hearing from her for six weeks, we called her landlady to see where she was. We knew she had given notice on her rented room and was planning to find a cheaper place to live, or so she told us. We were shocked when the landlady said she had quit going to classes weeks ago, and left on foot (with a backpack) to ""travel"" alone in late November. The poor lady also shared with us that our daughter had been displaying the same self-neglect as she had at home. We had been hoping it would lessen when she was living with other people...but no.  

Contact with her was always infrequent, so a month without hearing from her wasn't unusual. But now she has made her break from society and we are helpless to do much about it. She is now a homeless vagrant, walking by day and setting up a hidden camp by nightfall. She does not have a phone (her choice) but she does have a debit card and a credit card in her name linked to my account. She had been using the debit card to make small food purchases every few days as she walks alone through a major urban center to reach the wilderness.

After talking to the landlady, we filed a Missing Person report and cancelled the debit card. I also spoke with the therapist who had seen our daughter as a patient the year prior.. he did not make a diagnosis at that time but based on this update he was 99.99% certain she has schizophrenia. He was very sorry for us and said the future was not going to be easy, as she is an adult. He advised cutting off her financial support to get her to contact us and as leverage to get her to accept help.

Sure enough, the day after I cancelled the debit card our daughter called from a grocery store phone. She had no idea why we were worried, or why we had filed a Missing Person case... she was just walking to a farm job / internship and from there do the Pacific Crest Trail, and why was her card declined? She has no proper gear to do this, nor experience nor money of her own to buy supplies, equipment, etc. She has tried WWOOFing before (farm work in exchange for room &amp; board) and it didn't work out, and we don't even know if she is telling the truth or what we want to hear. 

I told her we could not support her dangerous plan and would cancel the credit card as well unless she agreed to get help. I offered to come get her, but she refused. She asked to use the card to buy food that day as she had nothing to eat. I said yes but told her we would cancel it if she did not agree to come home. She said she would call us the next day, and hung up. She never called back.

Our therapist and the police detective say we need to cancel the credit card asap. I am torn, and am looking for advice from anyone who has gone through this... how do you cut off an adult child who is ill and needs help but doesn't know it, and can't take care of themselves or get a job? What will she do with no money? I know the reasoning is to stop enabling, but she does not know she is sick. My husband wants to drive up and look for her... but others say that's a bad idea unless she wants to see us (she made it clear she does not) as she could get even more paranoid and claim we are stalking / harassing her. Help please."

(porting cell phone number, sim card, etc.)",austriastudyabroad,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5l8ywp/completely_new_to_traveling_abroad_and_going_to/,"I know there have been a lot of posts on this, but they have such varied information I'd really like to make a post specific to my situation. Even with all I've read on these issues I still feel so clueless.

I'm from the USA and am going to be leaving in a month to Austria for 6 months and I really need to figure out my cell phone situation. A big issue on my mind right now is keeping my US phone number. Around the time I'm leaving Austria I'll be applying for fall internships and I need a phone number that can be reached both while I'm in Austria and when I come back in case I get any interview offers. I'd like to generally keep my phone bills as low as possible (like 50 dollars and under). I hope to use it minimally except for my interview hunting and plan to use Whatsapp with wifi for most of texting needs. Currently I have Verizon which won't serve me well abroad. So I have a few questions:

**Google voice porting:**  I read by searching that porting my phone number to Google voice is a good option and then I just need to get the Hangouts App and a Sim card, right? Does Google Voice ever charge me beyond the 20 dollars to port my number?

**Sim cards:** will they charge me extra for using my Google Voice number? How exactly do they charge me/ how expensive will this be? Do I need to have a newer phone model (my phone model is pretty obscure)? Any recommendations for sim cards?

**Porting back to Verizon:** Is there any chance that I'll lose my phone number in the process?



**Overall, is using Google Voice and Hangouts/Whatsapp a good plan for me based on the info I gave? What is the absolute cheapest way to do this? At what point should I drop my Verizon plan and port numbers to Google (right away, a week before I leave, day before, etc)?**

5l9ey5,1,2016-12-31,OCS as an Option,vixadd,OCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCS/comments/5l9ey5/ocs_as_an_option/,"Good Morning,

I am an Engineering student in Norfolk, VA. Currently I am a Computer Science and Computer Engineering major. I am considering many options after college. One of which is Officer Candidate School.

Last summer I got an internship at one of the really big defense contractors off the Navy, working on Submarines. I gained a tremendous amount of respect for the enlisted men and the officers I had the privilege of working with.

I have a plethora of knowledge about under sea systems as well as many systems that the Navy uses. However what I want to do is secondary to what the Navy wants me to do. I understand this and all I want to do is serve my country in some way.

Incase you haven't noticed I'm probably going to join the Navy if I do OCS. I am in the middle of my junior year, and I would just like some feedback:

- What did you do to enter OCS?

- Given the fact that I'm a junior in my 4 year program at University, what steps would you take to enter if you were in my position?

- What are your thoughts on someone like me doing OCS, and what are the pros and cons?"
5l9nv6,2,2016-12-31,26M4A - Milking a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5l9nv6/26m4a_milking_a_starlet/,"Good morning, DPP! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

Elizabeth Gillies, Daniella Monet, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lawrence, Cara Delevigne, Jenette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Amy Lee, and Kate Upton. I'm also open to other suggestions.

Kinks: Lactation, mild breast growth, nudity and ENF, humiliation OR shame (feeling humiliated absent being made to), name calling OR romance and tenderness, blackmail OR cuddling, anything vanilla.

Limits: Non-human or extreme changes, blood, toilet, vomit, beast, incest, under 18, extreme violence, snuff."
5la2su,17,2016-12-31,My [21M] boyfriend is becoming very over controlling towards me [20F],itsheysarah,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5la2su/my_21m_boyfriend_is_becoming_very_over/,"I have been in a relationship with my current boyfriend for almost two years now and things have been going fine for us until I moved out for university. Since then, things have gone downhill. We have constant arguments (mostly about stupid shit) he gets easily jealous about anyone I talk to or if I chat to my friends about someone else whether they're celebrities or not. He has even gone as far as telling me to block and delete my college friends because he doesn't want me talking to other guys. 😒😒 Even during freshers, I went out once and since then he complained every time I tried to go out.  When he goes out I don't complain but I'm not allowed to have my own freedom. 😡

Recently, I have become very depressed about certain things like my diet/skincare/friends &amp; family and whenever I post something about it on my social media, he messages straight away and takes his anger out on me. I understand that sometimes he wants me to talk to him about this things but I have told many times and he is already aware that I personally like to deal with my problems myself before asking for advice and he should respect that but he never does. 

The most annoying I still face is when I bring up my career, I'm a professional model and whenever I get booked in for certain shoots he tells me to decline them because he doesn't like the concept or he doesn't see the point. And this is annoying because this is my only source of income (excluding my student loan) and I'm really struggling financially so having to decline doesn't help. I have also brought up discussion about me wanting to work abroad after I finish university whether as a model or taking an internship for my major but it always seems to be an issue. 

Either way, I keep telling him I'm tired of being treated this way and it's getting frustrating that someone else is dedicating my life but he acts like he is not doing it at all (not really sure if he pretending or he doesn't know) but I feel like every time I speak up goes in one ear out the other and becomes a repeated cycle.

Most of my friends think I should break up with him, but I give second chances to people because I believe the can change that's why I would rather resolve things first before ending the relationship without thinking. 

You might say why not take a break from this, I have attempted twice in the last 3 months but it never lasted long and he blamed me for his depression and said I was selfish to ask for a break.


**TL;DR**: My boyfriend is always arguing with me and he has started to become really over controlling and when I speak up about it....the situation gets worse I'm I doing something wrong here? Because I seem to be trying so much but nothing is changing

I recently graduated and was hoping to get some resume and career advice from those in the field. I posted my resume above and any feedback would be highly appreciated. 

I'm hoping to either get: A) a local data/financial analyst position in order to gain relevant experience then switch; B) land an entry level actuarial position right away.

A few of questions:

1) Should I focus my attention of trying to score an entry level actuarial position (willing to relocate anywhere) or is my lack of internships and relevant experience going to be to hold me back too much? Am I better off focusing my attention towards a data analyst or financial analyst position in order to gain some experience and then switch?

2) A lot of people say don't bother with cover letters because no one reads them. Should I be sending out a cover letter with my resume?

3) Lastly, should I invest any significant amount of time beefing up my technical skills (SQL, C++ etc) or is that time best spent on exams?

Thank you!

I feel I've been wasting a lot of time because I stopped caring about myself.

I transferred from an out-of-state university to one in my city.  I had some financial problems at my other school, didn't have a good job or reliable transportation and I just wasn't happy anymore. My grades suffered, I got behind on rent because I didn't want to work and became this really negative person. I thought transferring back home would help me get it together. 

In a way it has. I've got a much better job and I work to pay for school. My grades are much better. But that's all. I go to school, work, sleep. I lost passion for the things I liked. I want to be a journalist but I don't write anymore, I graduate next year but I haven't attempted at joining an organizational at school and I haven't tried to get any internships. I don't read or socialize. I have two friends from high school but they're busy with their own lives. I've become very lonely. I don't have motivation to do anything. I do the bare minimum just to get by, with everything in my life, and it's always last minute. Everything I do is last minute. And I'm sad all the time and I cry often but I have no idea about what. I'm still very negative. I always think about the bad things that could happen and I talk myself down. I've realized I tell myself I'm not good enough and I'm very suspicious of everyone's intentions when they want to get to know me. 

I sit around a lot and think about the things I want to do but I make no effort. There are times when I temporarily break out of my rut and I excercise, write a little bit, practice my Spanish, but then I fall back into the same pattern. My main excuse is that I don't have time but really if it's too much work I will give up and just stop caring. I want to use my days to sleep and not think about anything. At the same time I have all these goals and plans for myself and want to put in the work towards them but I don't want to because it feels like it won't matter.  

My mom keeps yelling at me to get it together. My sister thinks I need to see someone. I keep telling them I'm going to do something about it but then I'm back in the same rut. I can't tell if I'm being dramatic or if something is actually wrong. Whatever it is I feel extremely guilty for ending my year like this.

I also have a lot of debt going on from active addiction, I made some really bad financial decisions. I'm really dedicated to becoming financially responsible and would really appreciate some guidance as to how to move forward with prioritizing and budgeting. I would like to stress how much I would really like to start saving so I'm not screwed when I move. Below is a break down of my current situation:  


My credit score is around 470 according to the tracker on my CC's website. I have a CC with capital one, that I've had for a few months or so, and I have a 100% on time payment record.


**Income:**

-I work part-time as a Program Manager at my University. I bring home roughly $650 per month. I've been considering getting another part time job serving a couple nights a week or something. 

-I also have access to student loans, but I am on a scholarship that pays off most of my tuition

-I am native american, and receive checks from my tribe 3x a year for $1,000 each

**Expenses:**

Car insurance - $153/month (I got a DUI a couple years ago, this is the lowest price I can find, it will hopefully drop this October. It's been steadily dropping, but this year is the 3 year mark so my SR22 will be gone)

Cell phone - $63/month

Gas - $60/month

Cigarettes - $70/month

Acne medication - $20/month

**Active Debt:**

Capital one secured card - $386 out of $500 limit (I just found out that I should be paying this off in full every month so I've been selling odds and ends to pay this off quickly....)

Lawsuit for medical bills - $5,700 - **Just received notice that I'll be garnished for this, I believe it will be 25% of my check.**

Treatment center - $2,500 - On a payment plan for $68 per month

My mom (for my vehicle) - $450 (The debt was originally 3200 for my car I now own. No time line for paying this last chunk off, but I'd like to get it out of the way)

I also have about $9800 in student loan debt. I've been wondering if I should just take out more in student loans to get above water, and pay that off once I graduate and can find a decent job. 


**Debt that's in collections:**

I have about $2500 in open accounts that are in collections. I would like to pay these off, but I'm not sure how important this is.

I have $2800 in closed accounts that I've pretty much just lost hope on. 

**Savings**

I have none. 


I'm at a loss for how to handle percentages or if I'm even making enough, I have no idea if I'm a lost cause, do I declare bankruptcy? Should I take out student loans to help with the current debt? Will I be able to afford moving out? Do I work my ass off all summer? I was looking at an internship that would pay $4800 from May till August. Should I invest in my future, or work to pay off the debt and save? I really appreciate any advice you have, thank you in advance.

Our fathers are best friends, and run a law firm together. As a result we spent a fair amount of together while growing up. We were never best friends, but we got along well enough and enjoyed each others company.*

*However, for years I've wanted you. You're four years older than me, when you were fifteen and I was eleven you joined your high schools cheer squad, your uniform fit your body perfectly, and the sight of you in it practically jump started puberty for me. And as we got older you only got hotter and my lust for you grew. When I was thirteen and you were seventeen our families went on a joint vacation to the Caribbean, while we were there you and I took a picture together on the beech. I kept a copy of that photo in my room, and would often jerk off to it. Your body was so perfect, especially in the bikini you wore that day.*

*I never acted on my desires, fearing that you'd reject me or that it would make things weird given how often we saw one another, but by the time you left for college I could barely keep myself from getting hard whenever I was around you.*

*After you left, my lust died a little bit, you were still without a doubt the hottest women I'd ever seen. I still wanted you, and I still used that photo when horny, but I wasn't as filled with desire for you. I'd even dated and fucked one of the girls who had joined the cheer squad your senior year. But each time you came home, I noticed you become even hotter.*

*This past year I started as a Freshman at the college you attended. You were doing an extra semester and my parents had asked you to show me around and watch out for me while you were still at school. As a result we ended up spending more time together in a few months than we had since you left for school.*

*It drove me mad! You had spent all summer at an internship for a company you wanted to work for. I hadn't seen you since the previous Christmas, and since then you'd somehow gotten so much better looking. The lust I'd had for you in my early teens returned tenfold, but I still didn't act on it. You were fucking perfect, and I couldn't imagine confronting you with my desire.*

*You found out though. For Christmas this year, your parents decided to go on a second honeymoon. As a result you were staying with my family through the holiday. I tried not to, I didn't want to risk it with you sleeping down the hall, but I broke. Earlier that day I had walked in on you changing, you were only wearing a bra and panties, and I couldn't get the picture out of my head. That night, when I thought everyone had gone to bed I jerked off to that picture in my head. Moaning your name under my breath, almost grunting it.*

*You caught me. You'd left your phone charger in my room and came to get it, and instead you found me, half naked, hard cock in my hand, moaning your name. Before I could react you had stripped down and mounted me. We didn't fuck long, I had already been close when you barged in. But it was the greatest pleasure I'd ever felt. You seemed to have enjoyed it as well. Before you went back to your room you told me* *""Just let me know if you want to do that again."" *

*It's been a week since then and I haven't taken you up n your offer, fearing that it was some kind of joke on your part. Meanwhile you've grown impatient, and have decided that if I won't make the first move, you will.*

In this Roleplay, I want you to seduce me. How you do it is up to you. Maybe you just tease me until I snap and pin you to the ground. Maybe you still have your high school cheer uniform and decided to fulfill my earliest fantasy. However you do it, I want to be teased and seduced by you. Don't worry, you won't be in charge the whole time. Once you break me down, I'll be much more aggressive. ;)

Kinks: Being seduced, teasing, semi-rough sex, spanking(giving, not receiving). Breasts(Watching them bounce might turn me on more than anything)

Turn offs/Will not do: Toilet play, incest, rimming.

Send me a letter if you're interested."

It's just that the secondary roles are underdeveloped and the stories don't move forward at a reasonable pace.

The rotating crew of housemates was once Meredith,  Alex, George, and Izzie.  Now it's Meredith, Alex, Maggie and Amelia. Meredith's love interest was Derek and now it's Riggs.  

Cristina and Burke were a major side pairing, then it was Crowen.  Now it's Japril.

Bailey, Weber, Owen, and Arizona have been around for a while.

No one has the Calzona prominence and no one has Callie's lead but not a housemate status.

Slexie was huge and there's no ship in that role.  Maybe Owen and Amelia, but they both tally up elsewhere in the headcount.

DeLuca, Jo, Ben, and Stephanie are basically C string characters, and while we used to cycle through them (Ellis, Adele, Shane, Rose, syphilis nurse, love triangle interns, Lucy, grumpy peds guy with a crush on April) and then get rid of them when there was no more story to tell, they aren't really taking up space that was previously empty.  

Just my two cents, but do we really need fewer characters or do we need to do something with the ones we have?  Was the show stronger when C string was cut when their stories ran out?  Do we need a mass casualty or do we just need Steph and Jo to move on to new jobs and DeLuca to fade into the background like Morgan or rise like Arizona, Callie, or to a lesser degree Ben did?  Do we need patients who last more than an episode, arguably adding more characters but keeping those short term?"
