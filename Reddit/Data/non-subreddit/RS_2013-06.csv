I've been having these episodes the past three weeks. The first one happened a few days after I found out I was denied for a summer internship which was my plan for the summer. This made me anxious, since I had counted on getting this internship. Days later, I was cleaning my room when I felt the anxiety that I felt when I received the news but much more stronger. My heart rate shot up as if I was running. I started heating up, my face was flushed and I had a sudden feeling of helplessness. The entire time I was scared shitless, and after it stopped I had a knot in my throat. I wanted to cry but I couldn't because I was too freaked out.


This happened again very recently after some emotional turmoil having to do with my ex. But it happened minutes after I lay down to sleep. I hate this. I've never been to the hospital for anything serious, much less psychological issues. What is going on with me?"

The dream is to become a game developer. I've loved programming since I learned how to do it, and I realized a long time ago that it was what I wanted to do.

Except I don't think I'm ready. The university I go to offers a single year in actual programming classes, then it moves on to other topics and it's possible to not even touch Java/C++ (the two languages they teach) again for the rest of your college career. I feel like I could be good at programming, but I'm the type of person who is awful at teaching himself and needs a mentor. The game-industry-centered classes are taught by awful people who don't know how to teach (seriously, reading the textbook word-for-word is not teaching). 

I wish I could get a portfolio going to show off my programming skills, but every time I try I think, ""This is too simplistic, a child could create this."" I look at websites like codify.com and I stare at their tests without a clue of where to even start. I've applied for internships but they don't even get back to me. I feel so worthless and I don't know what to do."

The Temple really did exist, just like my arcane books and rumors said it would. The only real ""proof"", if you could call it that is a horses' head etched in an irregular, but smooth amber-like gem. Carbon dating places it at the time that the temple would have been an integral part of tribal life....but that was tens of thousands of years ago. I've grown quite fond of it and wear it around my neck - a good luck charm.

Half a dozen wrong turns in the dense, South American forest combined with a slip on a tree root has done more for anthropology than the last Two Thousand years of state-funded research. We stumble out into the clearing and just....stare.

The temple ruins look exactly like the old drawings I've kept in my long years of study. With a gentle fist-bump to you- my trusted intern we move from the green forest to the dusty promenade that leads to the Temple steps. The stone is red-caked and crumbling slowly but the main structure seems intact. As we move closer, we can see glyphs...

Strange markings....

You bite your lip, sensing my thoughts as we look at the etchings that mark the post and lintel of a large, sealed door. Unusual creatures are seen in relief against the red soil and underlying stone. Human creatures....yet not completely human. All of them naked. One (obviously) male statue has the physique of a weightlifter...yet his head is that of a horse.

""Looks to be a draft male horse...man...with a tail, too! Some sort of hybrid? Doctor does this con-"", you ask with a mix of breathless wonder and naivety...almost transfixed by the strange creatures.

""Yes, it does concur. Here..."", I say, looking feverishly through my backpack...eventually finding a stained, old parchment portraying a crudely-drawn horse-man and horse-woman...their bodies in some sort of sensual embrace.

""Horse-people!"" The words would have sounded incredulous a moment ago...but now as they escape your lips, it seems perfectly plausible...even normal. I nod in approval and praise of the eager intern.

""Yes. Apparently this tribe all worshipped the Goddess Epona. I suppose this is her Avatar...."", I gesture with a finger for emphasis ""Maybe her guardians...or the priests, perhaps. The tribe was so remote and ancient that we know little else...other than this stone I wear has a connection to this place.""

We stand there, gob-smacked in reverent silence for a few moments - just taking the whole tableau in. The figures in stone look almost lifelike...and very detailed. No two are alike...though the types of equine hybridism varies from glyph to glyph.

As I approach the door, I notice there's no latch or keyhole. Instinctively, you press your hands against a stone pillar and a soft click causes a slowly-depressing recess to appear in the column. A woosh of dust and musty air fills our nostrils as the door begins to unseal - triggered by your ingenuity...or was it something else?

The stone begins to rise, revealing a darkened passage...until the door freezes, unable to move higher...but high enough for us to stoop down to enter.

We look into the darkness...then to each other with a knowing smile that this is the adventure we've been waiting for. I've always been fond of you but unable to show my appreciation especially with strict school rules.

""I just wanted to say.....,""as I flick on a small flashlight, mouth dry with excitement and wanting to find the right words...

I feel a light pressure against my hand and look down, startled at first but realizing its what I've been looking for.

""I know."", comes a soft response from you with a smile.

I softly grasp your hand in mine and lead us into the chamber...the air sweet, cool and inviting.

""To Epona!"", we cry - our voices booming off of the inner walls as we delve inwards...

So I loved labor stories and thought I'd share mine, for the insight of course, as well as a preview to life after delivery.

May 5, Cinco De Mayo, lol I started feeling contractions not consistent or timeable, however no big deal I was scheduled for an induction at 1 am on the 6th because I was actually 42 weeks. I planned on napping from 6 pm to midnight since the house was clean bags were ready and we were set to go. Hubby made dinner we ate at 6, I was like woah gotta go to bed, hubby was like ill meet you in the room, so I went pee had a strong contraction and my water popped, not broke, because I heard the POP! Followed by this gush of water, I was terrified I didn't know what to do thought she was gonna come out while I was on the toilet! I started crying ""this is it!?!??"" running through my head. My hubby came running and said its gonna be okay, tried relaxing me and getting my head together. I got up rinsed my butt and legs in the shower dried myself got dressed as he packed the car. I got in the car and called the hospital they said take my time no big deal, and I was like wtf? We went in anyways, they checked me in and I got the rudest old lady nurse ever, she was so mean, and I tried really hard to get her to like us but she was just plan mean : / anyways she checked me and I was at a 6! Mind you I've been at a 1 since week 38, which is why they wanted to induce. After a few hours I stayed at a 6, she kept forcing me to pick pitocin to dilate faster, again she was rude which didnt help. Finally like around midnight I got an epidural and pitocin. Epidural hurt needle hit my spine, although it hurt for the 2-4 min set up after wards bliss. By 630 am I was at an 8 and nothing else, a really amazing nurse signed on, she was super awesome and sweet. Kept telling the dr to give me more time to dilate. Then drs student intern guy or whatever came in to ask questions and asked if I was having. C-section and of course I said no, since I wasn't. He was kinda like, umm okay, so I asked him, am I having one? He said the form said c-section which was why he came in, but not to worry, since I could still have the baby vaginally. So I asked him in honest truth what to expect from a cesarean he told me the whole thing, mind you I've have 2 previous abdominal surgeries and the recoup sucks- especially if your plus sized. So he said it would last about an hour and I'd be awake and if I was scared to really really cry Wolf so the anethsiaologist would hook it up. After 1 the dr finally came in and said I'm still at an 8 if that, my contraction chart was showing full blown contractions with like 30 sec intervals, yet nothing was happening, nurse knew I wanted to push her out and asked the dr to give me time, so he came back at 2-215, nothing changed. So he said he wanted the baby out because my water had broken a while ago and there seemed to be meconium present, which I didn't know, old hag nurse from previous didnt mention it to me. Babies heart rate dropped also while I was out with the epi and old hag didnt tell me (I wanted to strangle her, even tho she was old and not present) so I was prepped and ready to go by 250 pm and I was crying bc again abdominal surgeries are the worst, let alone any major surgery. They hooked up more pain meds to numb me, but by this time I had a massive amount of adrenaline going nowhere and literally I was shaking uncontrollably, side affect of the epi?, but I shook so much they strapped one arm down, my hubby came in and held my other hand and watched at the surgery started at 3 I asked him if it started yet and he was like they're gonna pull her out and 303 she was out, I just heard my hubby cry and he left to go
to her, and she cried once when they cleaned her, I didn't get to see her as I was shaking so bad and I had so much pain relief I fell asleep. I woke up as they wheeled me out of the room an hour later. Apparently that's what takes long having to seal each later from the inside out. He gave me absorbable stitches and staples, so they don't get removed but dissolve over time. I get sent to a recovery unit and they have me behind curtains, and I wake up with my awesome nurse checking me over, changing my pads totally gross the bleeding it just flows out. After about 10 min hubby's like wanna see her, he was in the same room behind another curtain the whole time, in my head I was like wtf YES!! And he gives me this little adorable girl who just stares at me and cries until I hug her and she stopped. I didn't get to bond right away, which sucked, he was topless bonding with her for over 45 mins, which I wanted for him, but I was cheated out of it : / I was inthe hospital from Sunday to Friday, I lost a lot of blood, my hemo was at 12 before everything and at 6 after it all, they wanted to give me a transfusion, but I didn't want to react badly to it, they let me go when I got to a 7. Since then I've only gone up to an 8, and lastweek I was 9.5. Healing wound still hurts, the thing about ab surgery air gets in and you can't fart it out easily so it hurts it hurts like being stabbed. I've written this over time, it's been such a crazy ride. She is 25 days old, so much had changed. Night time feedings are brutal, especially if your single, I'm not however my hubby is gone from 740 am to 8 pm which is tough. 

Okay insight:
Don't plan on anything to go how you want bc you'll end up disappointed if it doesnt go your way, like I planned to go into labor not get induce, when my water broke I was like heck yes then I got a cesarean which brought me back down. Oh and I wanted to ""exclusively"" breastfeed, yeah right milk/colostrum didnt show up until the following sat/Sunday a total week later. Baby was formula fed for a week straight and I still try to breastfeed sporadically I want her to have some of my antibodies for help. 

So I'm 24 hr non stop baby everything. Your house is a mess, I'm super anal about a messy house but after a few days I def rather nap when she naps then hve mind blowing head aches bc the lack of sleep, and I don't want to get upset at 3 am and take it out on her, which is easy to do if you've had no sleep! so be careful, its easy to get upset with an innocent being.  I try very hard to nap to help cope with her crying. Baby only cries to eat, sleep or diaper change. But I try to be ahead of the curve, I change her before I feed her. And I used to time her feedings, but now I let her sleep since she's not lost weight since birth. Babies cry in their sleep which I had to get used to, they cry and then stop and knock back out. Also, even though its hot in the house/room they are still cold which is weird. Ok so zipper onesies/footies are my fav! They are long sleeve and have feets, zipper makes it so easy to change a diaper and redress at night time. Belly button fell off after like 18 days, it was stuck to the diaper, then it looks raw underneath its been 7-8 days or so and it's still gooey, even baby is different. She cried easily in the beginning an so her belly button bled when it scanned up, I always found dry drops. I have a basket I pre-pack each evening with bottles with measured water, measured formula, a pacifier, burp cloth, suction thing. This basket is placed in her nursery for night feedings so I mix it then and there and she's not waiting crying while I'm in the kitchen measuring and mixing. Baby acne is real, she gets It when perfume, make up come in contact or we go out to a store it gets worse. At home it subsides, just don't mess with it. Oh and lady parts have mini-periods! I read about it, but it still was shocking and made me worried she would have blood/discharge for like 2 weeks. Ask questions if you need! I'm still learning and all I can say is ask nurses everything before you leave the hospital, and ask everyone for experience, as insight, just because they did it a certain way doesn't mean you have to do the same, which I learned also.

&gt;Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2013 is $802. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $0 withheld for 2013 leaving $802 due when you file your return.

For the only job you entered (which has a projected salary of $18,000): 

&gt;8 allowances.


&gt;

&gt;Check the “Single” box on your Form W-4
Assuming this recommendation is in effect for the rest of 2013 your expected refund should be about $125. Following this recommendation will ensure that the amount withheld from your wages will cover all of your projected tax liability while minimizing your refund. 

Is this correct? Am I only really going to be taxed $802 out of my salary? I thought the income tax at my income bracket was 15%. I know as a Canadian Citizen I am except from certain taxes, but not federal income tax. Am I supposed to withhold any money from my pay cheque?

I need advice and perspective.,throwawayhoohaha,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fgf5s/my_m21_girlfriend_f21_and_i_just_had_a_huge_fight/,"Let me say up front that this might end up turning out to be kind of long.  I've been a long-time lurker of this subreddit, but I would like to ask all of you for perspective and would really appreciate it if I could get your feedback.  Thank you in advance!

[M21], [F21], together for 1 year, known each other for 3 total

My girlfriend and I attend the same university and are currently off from school on summer vacation.  At home, we live about 25 miles apart.  I will be returning to school for the summer for an internship, and she will be staying around home for hers.  She is my first girlfriend and the first person I have had a relationship with at all.

Today (Friday), I was supposed to go over to her place for dinner with parents.  I've met them before many times and had dinner with them twice, so this wasn't going to be the first time I met them or anything.  We had initially planned this for Monday, but we had to cancel at the last second.  At the time, I was driving home from a pre-planned event with my mother, but the event ran longer than expected and I ended up being caught in unexpected traffic.  When I called her (a few hours before I had agreed to come over, while I was driving), I thought I wouldn't make it in time, so she decided to cancel the dinner and reschedule so as not to make her parents wait around for nothing.

We then rescheduled to today (Friday).  I had agreed to come over in the afternoon before dinner, but of all days possible, my car wouldn't start and I had no way of fixing it (fuel pump was faulty).  My mom was home at the time, but she was running around preparing for another event she had later this evening.  This was a really important event for her (and planned months in advance), so there was no way I could borrow her car instead.  I asked my mom if she could drop me off at my girlfriend's house before my mom's event, and initially she said that she could.  I called my girlfriend and told her this, and she reluctantly agreed that it would be ok, but she was noticeably upset that I would end up arriving later than expected.  I have no familiarity with the public transportation from her place to mine.

Before my mom could drop me off, she needed to swing by the event venue to make preparations before she could drop me off.  On the way though, she realized that due to current traffic, she would be unable to drop me off all the way at my girlfriend's house and could only take me halfway.  I called my girlfriend and told her this, and she immediately started acting wishy-washy about the whole thing, saying that things were getting too complicated (she didn't want to wait around for me, she didn't know the area, etc.) and that we should just cancel our entire dinner.  She demanded to know why my mom couldn't take me all the way over there anymore, to which I responded that she has her own schedule to follow and her own things to do.  I basically persuaded my girlfriend that I would find the location of a Starbucks or something, that I would text her the address, and that I would wait for her there until she got there, however long that took.

After hearing our phone conversation, my mom (she was driving and heard everything) suggested that it might be easier on all of us if we just rescheduled to tomorrow.  That way, my mom would be able to drop me off and pick me up without my girlfriend needing to meet me halfway or anything and without having to fight through traffic.  I called my girlfriend back and suggested this option, and she flew off the handle.  She began yelling at me over the phone, saying how I wasn't trying at all to keep our plans and our relationship going, how she was the one doing all the work and how she was sick of it, how now she didn't care whether or not I came or stayed tonight, how she didn't care anymore about how I was leaving for the summer.  Whenever I tried to speak, she would cut me off and keep going.  She said that I should have left earlier so that I would know my car wasn't working earlier so that my mom would then have time to drop me off.  Her final words were that if I really cared about her and our relationship, I would find some way to get over there tonight (25 miles apart), no matter if I took the bus or walked. As soon as she finished saying that, she hung up on me.

I understand that part of this is my fault.  I should have planned ahead on Monday and planned to leave earlier in case of traffic so we wouldn't have to reschedule for Friday.  But am I wrong in thinking that she was being very unreasonable and selfish about the events of today?  I didn't choose to have my car's fuel pump break, and my mom doesn't just stay at home with hours free to drive me around unexpectedly.  I offered to meet her halfway, to which I had to essentially persuade her to do, and I only suggested that we reschedule to tomorrow to save all of us unneeded headache.

This fight alone might seem like measly grounds for ending things, but other issues have arisen in the past.  Whenever I text her asking if I can come over in the afternoon/evening, we end up having an hour long text conversation in which she asks me multiple times if I'm sure I actually want to come over and I reply multiple times that yes, I do want to come over and see her.  She ""gives"" me multiple ""outs"" (e.g. you're probably tired from driving, you should hang out with your friends, you should spend time with your family), but if I actually agree with her on one of them, she immediately gets disappointed/upset and acts cold towards me.  Her response to this is that if I really wanted to come over, I should have just come over regardless of what she says.  She has acted (in hindsight now I realize) jealous and insecure about me having any contact whatsoever with any female other than her, whether it's one of my old high school friends, music friends, classmates (we have very different majors), or even a much older grad student (married with kids) working in the same lab as me.  After seeing any of them, she asks me if I feel any sort of physical or romantic attraction to any of them (I don't, they're my friends and class/labmates), to which I constantly reassure her that she's the only one I'm attracted to and the only girl I pay attention to like that.  Whenever we talk after having an argument (usually blaming me for not caring enough), she mentions how she just cares too much and how she should try and care less, which just ends up making me feel like shit and a complete asshole.

There are a few other things that have come up that I don't want to write for now.  She really is a very sweet and caring girl, and I do enjoy spending time with her.  But something about what happened today just caused me to snap, and now I just feel like I can't put up with this anymore.  I talked with one of my best friends about this, and he suggested that I talk to her in person tomorrow with what I want to say ready but with an open mind and without any preconceived plans of continuing or ending things, just to see what happens afterwards.  I feel so anxious and confused and I don't know if what I'm doing is the right thing.  I would really appreciate advice and perspective.

**tl;dr: My [M21] girlfriend [F21] and I had a huge fight stemming from my car unexpectedly not starting before going to see her for dinner with her parents.  Her reaction feels like the final straw and now I'm not sure if I should end it or not.  I would really appreciate outside perspective and advice.**

1fg7mu,33,2013-06-01,"Friends (21f+24m) are having EXTREME money problems, is it my place to say something?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fg7mu/friends_21f24m_are_having_extreme_money_problems/,"I have been friends with ""Sally"" and ""Drew"" for about two years now. (they are dating). They are very good friends, but they spend so much money all the time and then they ask me for help. 

I first noticed it when we would do double dates. She *always* orders the most expensive thing on the menu. He complains to her when the bill comes around, but she continues to do it every time we eat out. 

Then when they went engagement ring shopping, Drew confided in me that he couldn't afford the ring she picked out, but he bought it anyway cause she threw a fit. He told me he is going to be making monthly payments on it for at least the next two years. This is not including the wedding band.

Then they went out and bought a 2012 Chevy Malibu.

Then they bought a German Shepard and a Lab.

Then they decided that the two bedroom apartment they were living in was too small so they wanted to get a two bedroom duplex. They even went so far as to tell me and my fiance that our one bedroom apartment is too small and we need at least a two bedroom. Anyway, they put money aside for **four** months so they could pay for the deposit and when the time came around to pay the deposit they only had $170 and they needed something like $500 to $600. They asked me to pay the difference because I recently got a very well paying internship and they knew I had some extra cash. I lied and told them I couldn't because I had somethings to pay off first. My real reason is that: I HAVE SAT HERE AND WATCHED THEM SPEND THEIR MONEY ON STUPID SHIT!!! They could have bought the cheaper meals at the restaurants, they could have got a cheaper engagement ring, they don't need a 2012 car, or two big dogs. Why should I have to pay for them to keep on this spending like this? 

This is their first month in their new duplex and Sally is texting me about how they have no money. None. They can barley afford food. I feel bad for them, but they put themselves in this situation! Now they have just been putting everything on credit cards :(

On top of all this, I am getting married in a few months. My parents paid for everything (I am so thankful for this). Sally is my maid of honor in my wedding. Her and Drew are getting married in a year. I am the maid of honor at hers.  Her parents are only paying for certain things at her wedding and is leaving about half of it up to Drew to pay for. I can tell she is starting to get upset with the situation because I am having a nice wedding and she is realizing they can't afford to have a really nice wedding. Since she is such a material girl, this is an issue. I think she is getting jealous of me. My fiance's parents have offered to pay for our honeymoon as well. (We weren't planning on taking one until we had my student loans paid off) When she found out about them paying for our honeymoon she forced Drew to ask his mom ""What she is chipping in for their honeymoon"" YOU DON'T ASK SOMEONE TO PAY FOR **YOUR** HONEYMOON!!!

Lastly, she got a letter from the community college she was attending.  Basically it said she has failed too many classes and she can't come back until Spring 2014. She was extremely upset. I asked her why she failed so many classes and she said that ""Well there are always so many other things to do then study or do homework"" I told her that EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD WOULD RATHER BE DOING OTHER THINGS THEN HOMEWORK BUT THEY DO IT SO THEY CAN BETTER THEMSELVES. She said it was Drew's fault she failed cause he wouldn't help her clean the house, so she had to clean instead of study. I told her that during the week my apartment looks like shit but me and my fiance just let the dishes be dirty and clean when we can because *even though my apartment looks like shit, my grades look good*. She said that not cleaning is not an option. She has been going to community college for a few years now. She has only passed probably half the classes she has taken. THINK ABOUT ALL THE WASTED MONEY SHE SPEND ON CLASSES SHE FAILED. I have busted my butt and I am graduating a semester early. (YES!!) She said she feels like a fail for not doing well in school and asks how I do so well. IT'S BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO FAIL CLASSES.

Anyway, they are in a bad financial situation. I really want to step in and give them some tips and pointers. (me and my fiance are very good at saving money) They are my friends and I love them and I don't want to see them dig themselves in a hole they can't get back out of. And I know the money situation has caused a lot of tension in their relationship. What I am wondering, is it my place to say something? Would that ruin friendships? What if they ask me for money in the future? PLEASE GIVE ME SOME ADVISE!

**TL;DR** Friends are putting themselves in financial ruin. They want money from me. I didn't give it to them. Worried they will ask again. 

Edit - thank you all for your advise. I have decided the next time *she* brings up money I'm going to speak my mind, in the most nicest way possible. However, I won't give them any money. Thanks!"

Half a dozen wrong turns in the dense, South American forest combined with a slip on a tree root has done more for anthropology than the last Two Thousand years of state-funded research.  We stumble out into the clearing and just....stare.

The temple ruins look exactly like the old drawings I've kept in my long years of study.  With a gentle fist-bump to you- my trusted intern we move from the green forest to the dusty promenade that leads to the Temple steps.  The stone is red-caked and crumbling slowly but the main structure seems intact.  As we move closer, we can see glyphs...

*Strange markings....*

You bite your lip, sensing my thoughts as we look at the etchings that mark the post and lintel of a large, sealed door.  Unusual creatures are seen in relief against the red soil and underlying stone.  Human creatures....yet not completely human.   All of them naked.  One (obviously) male statue has the physique of a weightlifter...yet his head is that of a horse.

""Looks to be a draft male horse...man...with a tail, too!  Some sort of hybrid?  Doctor does this con-"", you ask with a mix of breathless wonder and naivety...almost transfixed by the strange creatures.

""Yes, it does concur.  Here..."", I say, looking feverishly through my backpack...eventually finding a stained, old parchment portraying a crudely-drawn horse-man and horse-woman...their bodies in some sort of sensual embrace. 

""Horse-people!"" The words would have sounded incredulous a moment ago...but now as they escape your lips, it seems perfectly plausible...even normal.   I nod in approval and praise of the eager intern.

""Yes.  Apparently this tribe all worshipped the Goddess Epona.  I suppose this is her Avatar...."", I gesture with a finger for emphasis ""Maybe her guardians...or the priests, perhaps.  The tribe was so remote and ancient that we know little else...other than this stone I wear has a connection to this place.""

We stand there, gob-smacked in reverent silence for a few moments - just taking the whole tableau in.  The figures in stone look almost lifelike...and very detailed.  No two are alike...though the types of equine hybridism varies from glyph to glyph.  

As I approach the door, I notice there's no latch or keyhole.  Instinctively, you press your hands against a stone pillar and a soft *click* causes a slowly-depressing recess to appear in the column.  A woosh of dust and musty air fills our nostrils as the door begins to unseal - triggered by your ingenuity...or was it something *else*?  

The stone begins to rise, revealing a darkened passage...until the door freezes, unable to move higher...but high enough for us to stoop down to enter.

We look into the darkness...then to each other with a knowing smile that this is the adventure we've been waiting for.   I've always been fond of you but unable to show my appreciation especially with strict school rules.  

""I just wanted to say.....,""as I flick on a small flashlight, mouth dry with excitement and wanting to find the right words... 

I feel a light pressure against my hand and look down, startled at first but realizing its what I've been looking for.   

""I know."", comes a soft response from you with a smile.

I softly grasp your hand in mine and lead us into the chamber...the air sweet, cool and inviting.

""To Epona!"", we cry - our voices booming off of the inner walls as we delve inwards..."

I've gained some weight in college and currently spending my summer in DC/China and decided to lose the weight I gained.
I've been eating a LOT of junk food and irregularly (often snacks past midnight right before sleeping).
For the past week I've been outside jogging every since day from anywhere between 25-45 minutes (2-3 ish miles). I've also changed my diet a lot. Eating healthy vegetables and fruits, cutting out junk food and stopped eating past ten. 

Breakfast: bowl of cereal (regular cheerios) with non fat milk or some toast. (~180 calories)
Lunch: sandwich on whole wheat bread, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, turkey/chicken breast, avocado (~300-400 calories)
Dinner: salad or sandwich with same ingredients from lunch (~300-500 calories)
Total calories: ~1200-1400 calories/day 

My internship doesn't really allow me much time to go to the gym (plus I can't really afford a membership).

I took before and after pictures, but I haven't seen any chance from starting to now (~9 days from starting). 
Also, I'm scared I might gain muscle on top of fat before losing any fat thereby making me look even chunkier. Is this possible?

Any advice or help??? Would be much appreciated

Edit: I'm about 5'3"" female currently around 112 lbs hoping to get to 105 or lower before August."

1fjbhq,0,2013-06-02,"Finishing physics/(+compsci) degree vs starting over in engineering. Decision concerning skills, tuition cost, and time. Advice appreciated.",Remyskii,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1fjbhq/finishing_physicscompsci_degree_vs_starting_over/,"Hi, I’m an undergrad student finishing 2nd year who needs to make a decision soon about which direction of education to continue for next year. Sorry about making another one of these threads, but I’ve done a lot of research, and I could use some advice for making the final decision.

This could become rather long, so I’ve titled the sections. You can probably skip Intro for example.


**Intro**

I’m currently a physics student. After two years of the naïve undergrad mindset that I’ll just find a job when I’m close to graduation, I’ve recently started to critically look at my job prospect after my undergrad.

I’ve read a lot of stories from various different forums and the such, and the gist of outcome from physics education seems to fall into either horror stories, engineering jobs, academia/research labs, or unrelated jobs like finance.

As much as I love physics, I don’t very much feel like I’m among the top 0.1% to be able to succeed in academia and research, so my focus right now is towards engineering jobs. Software development sounds interesting to me.

Many people talked about the employability of a physics undergrad relies much on skills you learned/should learn in order to convince the employer to hire you. And so this brings me to…


**Skills to build**

Here are what I think are applicable skills to the workplace in my education.

* Proficiency in programming like python, C++, C
* Compsci theory like optimization, memory allocation, and algorithms
* Quantitative analysis, data analysis, matlab
* Familiarity with electronics and hardware


**Options in education stream**

My current options are

* Stay in physics major and finish in 2 years. Tuition cost: $14,000
* Enroll in physics and compsci double major and finish in 3 years. Tuition cost: $41,000
* or Transfer to ECE, starting over and finish in 4 years. Tuition cost: $43,000

In terms of learning skills related to software, I feel like option 2 and 3 are about the same. ECE would take longer, but it would give me more options for employment in other fields as it teaches hardware and EE as well. And my impression right now is that employers value ECE degrees more than Compsci degrees.

As for the physics major, I will have exposure to programming and possibly some electronic equipment in the lab, but I would have to try to learn a lot of the compsci of things on my own. However, financially, this is a much cheaper option, and with the 1 or 2 extra years I would’ve spent in a double major or ECE, I wonder if I could self-teach and build skills on my own or intern in order to convince employers I’m hirable.

ECE seems to be the least risky approach, but also the most costly. Physics major depends a lot on how much I can achieve on my own, but has little cost. And physics+compsci double major is an intermediate. Which stream do you think I should pick?"
1fiqwj,37,2013-06-02,He ended everything.,bigbreathein24,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1fiqwj/he_ended_everything/,"I am empty and speechless. My car is full, this apartment we moved in together is empty, and I feel like this isn't happening.

Edit: an explanation of what happened.
So I graduated from college in the first week of week.  He's still in school going to community college.  I moved back how with my parents for a week or so after graduating (they are 3 hours from him) but then I got a call that I got a job in his town.  We had discussed living together (just for the summer) for a while and had both agreed that we could see how it would work.  I was so entirely happy. That was one of the happiest moments. Moving in into his apartment with him, having a job, and then soon starting and internship and training at a rape crisis center.

I came home from work yesterday and he was building a bookshelf. He got mad that it wasn't working out well (the bookshelf) and he went into his room for a while.  When he came out of the bedroom, he said ""I don't think you should live here anymore."" And I asked him why. He said ""I don't need to give you a reason, this is my apartment"" (which it was, before I moved in.

Then he left for work for 5 hours.  I had those 5 hours to pack, figure out what the hell he was thinking, and sort my shit out.  Lots of crying, panic attacks, puking. Then he came home and told me that he thinks we should do our own thing.  He said that he's at a point where going out with his friends isn't fun while in a relationship and that I should be at home with my family. He said that it's ""best for me, but not ideal."" Which is bullshit.

I'm terrified of what's to come and what just happened. I'm entirely lonely because he wasn't just my boyfriend, but my best friend.  I have nobody now.  I'm living in my car for the night because my family is being difficult.  I had to quit my job, resign from the internship, and tell the rape crisis center people that I couldn't do training there.

After 3 years of love, this is so sudden.  I feel shell shocked and heavily depressed. I don't know what I'll do without him. "
1fietb,6,2013-06-02,"Took care of my terminally ill grandmother, now I feel lost.",SunshineVagabond,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fietb/took_care_of_my_terminally_ill_grandmother_now_i/,"When everyone I knew was moving off to college, I decided to commute to my classes, despite receiving a ""free ride"" to a nice, local private college because of my sick grandmother. She helped my mom raise my sister and me after our dad walked out on us, and they said she might not have too long to live. I had been ""taking care"" of her since I was 10 and she was diagnosed with diabetes. I wanted to be a doctor.

Three years passed and a lot of times, I was sicker than she was, and we got so close during it. Tugging her oxygen behind her, she'd bring my medicine into my room after my multiple surgeries, and I'd spend days in her hospital rooms working on my classwork. It took over twenty years, but we were incredibly close. We talked about absolutely everything - politics, religion, science, television shows, celebrities. Even at 74 years old, she never subscribed to the notion she couldn't evolve or improve herself. Fiercely clever and sharp, she pushed me hard to make more of myself.

In January, they gave her 6 months maximum to live. I left her early that morning at the hospital to go to a local mall to buy presents for my niece's birthday. My sister called me and broke the news when I was standing under the awning, Disney dolls in tow. She decided on home hospice care, and I obliged her wishes.

Before she left the hospital, I drew up her advanced directive, outlining her wishes for no resuscitation attempts. My mom and I were given power of attorney. My mom and her sister cried, but I tried to hold it together, knowing there was a good chance I might have to make the decision to let her go. 

She came home in early February, and she slowly started to decline. For the first time, she walked with a walker and slept in a hospital bed away from my grandfather. Every night, I walked her to bed, lowered her into it, and covered her up just like she did when I was a kid. I gave her all of her medicine, getting to the point where I recognized the pills by sight. Slowly, I stopped going to classes and stayed at home to care for her entirely. Then came the ""potty chair,"" the morphine, the electric recliner. 

One night, after over a months' 24/7 dedicated care and many sleepless nights, my mom encouraged me to go off for a night with my significant other and best friend. Shortly after midnight, she called to tell me that my grandmother had fallen, and they couldn't get her back into bed. I rushed home, and while checking her over for injuries, noticed an indent on her shoulder. Her arm was broken.

The hospice decided to not set it, and she was constantly in pain. I helped her up and down into every chair and into bed. She started sleeping in the living room, and I took to late nights in order to watch her. One night, she told me in great detail what she wanted to happen when she passed away, and she made me promise to take care of my mom and aunts when the inevitable happened. She thought I was stronger and more aware of her dying than everyone else; she didn't know I cried a lot when I was alone. That night, she took off her wedding ring and gave it to me.

A week later, my cousin visited from out of state. She sat with me while I baked him his favorite pie. He left to go home, and the next day, I caught her trying to make a phone call on the control for her chair. I laughed it off, but then she stopped eating and could barely remember where she was. 

I'll never forget sitting on the couch she picked out across from the hospice nurse as she explained that my grandmother's organs were shutting down. That she was dying, and it could take weeks. My aunt had to leave the room, and she explained to me what would need to be done to make her comfortable. I sat my grandfather down under the harsh kitchen lights and explained to him that his wife was dying. The entire time, I felt like I had to keep a straight face while I broke his heart. The hardened criminal, the businessman, the father who took my real dad's place cried. For the first time in my life. We hugged like he hugged me after I found out my real dad died; it was one of two times I felt like he sympathized with me. I told my sister. Then I told my mother. That night, I began the process of a hardship withdrawal from my classes.

I can't begin to describe the pain of the following week: visitor after visitor in my lifelong home during the day as my grandmother faded in and out of consciousness. At nights, I barely took naps while my mother and aunt looked over her. I maintained giving her medicine, as we gradually weaned away medicines that were no longer necessary. Soon it was just morphine. Every four hours. Every two. I washed her with a washcloth, aware of how she always smelled of perfumes and lotions. She begged me to get some sleep and asked repeatedly what was wrong. All I could do is explain that she was very sick and it would all be okay soon. I know she knew, but I could never bring myself to say it. 

The final four days she lost function in her limbs. I gave her sips of water and small bites of ice cream (She loved it, but couldn't have it because of her diabetes. We fought over the sugar for 10+ years). More and more morphine. She became less conscious of us. I sat next to her hospital bed in our living room and rubbed her hair, still a soft red after 74 years and no hair dye. Just like my niece's. 

One night, I got up from a short nap, and she was, as a rarity, alert. She reached her hands up for me, calling, ""That's my baby!"" across the room. We hugged, and she said she missed me. She played with my hair, called it beautiful. We held hands until she fell back asleep. 

She never woke up. Over the next day, her breathing became more and more ragged. I continued with the morphine, held her hand, petted her hair. Shortly after one of my aunts forgave her for a long held grudge, she began to pass away. I rubbed her leg until she stopped breathing.

I had never cried like that in front of other people, but I fell apart completely. It was like 3 months of bad news and suppressed emotions caved in on me. I stayed with her until they took her out of the house. 

After she left, I noticed my (rather unfavorable and distasteful) aunt complaining about how allowing someone to have ""power of attorney"" over you was ridiculous (like my mom and I did over my grandmother). She had been complaining because she didn't agree with my grandmother's final wishes of no funeral and cremation. In a manic fit, I told everyone to leave, so unbelievably angry that I still feel ashamed. I cried myself to sleep. 

They had a dinner the Sunday following, in her honor. I refused to go, still attempting to honor her no funeral rule. I sat at home with my SO until it was over. 

I detoxed our house of all of the reminders of her illness. I threw all of her medicines and medical supplies into a closet. I let her last gift of flowers sit on the television set until they all but rotted away. I tried to write thank you notes, but I never could. I still feel guilty about that.

Nightmares plagued me. Most of them forced me to watch her suffering be dragged out or depicted her death as painful and difficult. Sometimes, she'd come back but still be sick. I started falling asleep with the television on; now, I just hardly sleep at all (~8 hours in three days.)

I guess what I wanted to get off my chest was the complete sense of...uselessness and hopelessness now that she's gone. To some degree, I was always taking care of her. It made me want to become a doctor as I watched multiple doctors fail her. Now, I think that it was just me falling into a role I was ""used to."" I was supposed to go back to classes this summer, but the hardship withdrawal messed up my financial aid. All I do is sit at home all day and try to find a job or internship to occupy my time. Before now, I steered clear of those things because she needed me. 

I can't talk to my family or SO about this stuff, even though I play it over and over in my head all the time. They lived through it too, and they have never been the type of people to talk it out. I miss the purpose of my life from beforehand, but more than that, I miss her so much. It seems fitting that she would have been the only person who could have told me what to do in this situation.

I have to clean out her room this week, and I'm not sure how I will handle moving 20+ years worth of memories: my art projects, photographs, lotions, perfumes, pajamas I bought her every year for Christmas. I just needed to work through this so I can face it. 

**TL;DR: Grandmother raised me, and I took care of her while she was dying. Now I feel lost and purposeless. I have to clean out her room, and it hurts.**

1fhr0m,5,2013-06-01,Eating Disorder Recovery,rphalangekadams,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fhr0m/eating_disorder_recovery/,"Hi Reddit, never posted anything before.

I'm a 20F college junior who has been depressed on and off since middle school. This year it got so bad that I used exercise as something to live for and threw myself into it. I started eating as little as possible, and over the course of two quarters of school I went down to eating around 500 calories per day while doing 8-9 miles per day on the elliptical as fast as possible. Also about a month or so in I began binging and purging when I got upset or felt depressed. 

I lost a bunch of weight and feel like I look good, but I'm not happy. I told a good friend towards the end of winter quarter and with her encouragement I sought help during spring quarter. I developed mild bradycardia (slowed heart rate) and at one point it was 45 which apparently is low enough to be hospitalized. Now that I've met with therapists, specialists, nutritionists, and psychiatrists, I've been on prozac for a few weeks, told my family everything, and even started eating more and cutting back on exercise.

 But this really pulled the net out from underneath me. Without obsessing over exercise and every little thing I eat I have nothing, I don't want to live anymore. My psychiatrist was sick this week so I have to make it until Tuesday before we can discuss if the medication isn't working or something. This week I've gone to the gym once, the grocery store once, my appointments, and that's it. I can't get out of bed, I don't even enjoy watching television anymore. 

I had told my friend who has been supporting me about my suicidal thoughts and she has encouraged me to talk to her about it and picked me up when I needed her. Another close friend at home knows but I don't feel connected to my friends at school anymore. I have an internship this summer for Operations Management with Amazon fulfillment to look forward to, but even that isn't enough sometimes. I called my mom because I needed someone to talk to, and she asked if I would be able to do the internship. That's the only thing I have to live for and the idea of not having it, I would take my life for sure. 

Sorry for the rambling and thanks for listening

Although the distance seemed intimidating, it wasn't that bad considering I was making multiple college trips to his area and we were able to see each other several times. I think the longest we went without seeing each other was maybe two, three months?

My freshman year in college I decided to go to a school about 100 miles away from him--very convenient. We saw each other about every other week (or so it seemed...the distance was practically painless now).

Come this summer, he decided to take up an internship near his college town while I am at home. Again, we are 450 miles apart and he works a full-time job 5x/week. Although I haven't seen him since he's moved, we've been maintaining regular conversation (text, phone calls, Skype), so all seems well. Plus, I'll be seeing him again in three weeks!

However, I have decided to transfer schools and will now be 750 miles away from him. Our breaks don't really match up, and it seems like the next time I will see him (after this upcoming visit) will not be for at least another five months...not only that, but it seems like I will only be able to see him once a semester for however long we continue the relationship (I am considering permanently moving to my new college town due to multiple reasons, and he expects to continue his internship at his same location next summer).

While we've had the ""do we still want to do this"" talk once before and we both agreed we do, I am entirely convinced on his part. Last night he told me ""I can't say I'm excited or even very optimistic about it [our renewed LDR]"" and ""I want to be with you but the distance makes it so much harder than just 'wanting to be with you.'""

SO...what are some advice/tips that y'all can offer my boyfriend and me? I want to stay with him and can see us having a successful future together, it's just a matter of making it through these last three years of college together...he seems less optimistic than I do, and I wonder if this is a foreshadowing of what's yet to come?

Any help at all would be much appreciated...I really want this to work and will be heart broken if we have to break up because of the distance!

**TL;DR: Boyfriend and I have worked the LDR before, but never to this extent. I am worried he is not committed to our relationship as I am and would absolutely fall apart if we didn't work out. In desperate need of advice/tips/words of encouragement/anything!!!**"

My freshman year in college I decided to go to a school about 100 miles away from him--very convenient. We saw each other about every other week (or so it seemed...the distance was practically painless now).

Come this summer, he decided to take up an internship near his college town while I am at home. Again, we are 450 miles apart and he works a full-time job 5x/week. Although I haven't seen him since he's moved, we've been maintaining regular conversation (text, phone calls, Skype), so all seems well. Plus, I'll be seeing him again in three weeks!

However, I have decided to transfer schools and will now be 750 miles away from him. Our breaks don't really match up, and it seems like the next time I will see him (after this upcoming visit) will not be for at least another five months...not only that, but it seems like I will only be able to see him once a semester for however long we continue the relationship (I am considering permanently moving to my new college town due to multiple reasons, and he expects to continue his internship at his same location next summer).

While we've had the ""do we still want to do this"" talk once before and we both agreed we do, I am entirely convinced on his part. Last night he told me ""I can't say I'm excited or even very optimistic about it [our renewed LDR]"" and ""I want to be with you but the distance makes it so much harder than just 'wanting to be with you.'""

SO...what are some advice/tips that y'all can offer my boyfriend and me? I want to stay with him and can see us having a successful future together, it's just a matter of making it through these last three years of college together...he seems less optimistic than I do, and I wonder if this is a foreshadowing of what's yet to come?

Any help at all would be much appreciated...I really want this to work and will be heart broken if we have to break up because of the distance!

TL;DR: Boyfriend and I have worked the LDR before, but never to this extent. I am worried he is not committed to our relationship as I am and would absolutely fall apart if we didn't work out. In desperate need of advice/tips/words of encouragement/anything!!!"

Here's the story. I would appreciate any words of encouragement/advice you may have.",breakupthrowaway198,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1flrms/its_been_two_months_since_she_21_and_i_21m_broke/,"[Here's the previous post I made regarding our breakup](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bfcpl/girlfriend_20f_and_i_21m_just_broke_up_here_is/) that may provide some background to this post.

I want to express a huge thank you to anyone willing to read/respond to my story here. 

**TL;DR:** After no contact for two months after our breakup, my ex and I had some thoughtful conversation. My ex doesn't want to date me again because she thought our relationship was too much work. She wanted there to not be any differences between our personalities. I was happy to learn from the differences. Because she wanted to put in less work than I did to overcome those differences, she felt as though we needed to break up and stay broken up for good. I can completely understand this, but I do wish it weren't that way. Now, it is extremely tough to look back and remember the other 99% of our relationship that was so near-perfect, and realize that will never happen again with her.

This past Saturday, I learned that my ex was going to the same party I was going to with my friends. I hadn't seen her or spoken to her since I initiated no contact two months ago. I was immensely scared of going, but I did it anyway and enjoyed myself, and had a few nice conversations with some attendees. When my ex showed up, we exchanged nervous ""hi""s, and, from that point on, we didn't talk to each other. It was hard to see her across the room, but I managed to keep a smile on and talk to and laugh with the people around me.

After I came home from that party, I talked to one of my friends about the whole situation, starting from the breakup itself. He suggested I call her to get some answers, considering we ended on good terms, and considering no-contact may prevent us from ever becoming friends (or anything more) the longer it went on. I thought he made valid points, even though it was contrary to what I thought was the best idea and contrary to what my family, friends, and the Internet thought was generally the best idea - that is, no contact at all.

After a sleepless night, I called my ex at around 11:30 AM, and we talked for a half hour. I got a ton of answers, but none of them were the answers I wanted. The main point to take away from the conversation was that she doesn't ever want to date me again. She's okay with being friends and slowly restarting contact.

I was still holding out hope that she would want to become more than friends at some point, and that she just needed some time to herself. I was especially hoping for this considering we live so close to each other and we would be able to experience so many things together while we lived at home for our internships from July to December. Now that hope is gone. This is good in the sense that I got that answer and can move on, but terrible in the sense that it's not at all what I hoped for.

After our phone conversation, we texted each other some more thoughts. She had expressed on the phone that she thought our relationship was too much work. This was her first relationship, but not my first. I mentioned to her that all relationships are going to take work. She said the following:

&gt;I agree that relationships do take work for both people involved, but I think with us it always ended up being more work than usual. I think if we were to date people with personalities more similar to our own, it wouldn't be as much work.

I responded with the following:

&gt;I understand what you're saying. I think that is true, but we have different opinions on whether or not that's such a bad thing. I think I have a higher threshold for what I consider ""too much work."" When you and I encountered a difference between our personalities, we both had different attitudes on how to approach it. You want to be with someone whose personality more closely matches yours, while I believe being with someone like you whose personality isn't the same as mine offers an unparalleled and positive opportunity for huge amounts of personal growth, which is very important and rewarding to me.

&gt;Your way of thinking isn't wrong in the slightest. My way isn't right. Nor is it right for me or anyone else to tell you that you should change the way you think about this. I think it is mainly for our differing opinions on this issue that we shouldn't be in a relationship. But I think you'd agree that most everything else between us worked out so, so well. 99 percent of our relationship was so, *so* positive, but this is one major issue that is too hard to overcome with our current opinions.

She agreed with me and understood our difference in opinion on work in a relationship. I am glad that she and I were able to talk about all of this and get on the same page. We continued texting with friendliness for a while after that.

After the phone conversation, thinking about it all some more, and talking to my friend again, I've determined that it's a good idea to *not* pretend that my ex doesn't exist, that we can't communicate, and that she isn't enjoying her life. We also have many mutual friends who we frequently hang out with in a group. I think actively blocking her from every aspect of my life is going to hurt more because she's in a separate category of ""blocked"" in my mind. We've slowly started to re-introduce each other to our lives as friends. Right now, I think this is a good idea. We will see.

Even though I know what I have to do (keep my head high and continue through life with a positive attitude), I feel so unbelievably destroyed right now. I've never felt this numb/sick/scared/devastated before. I definitely feel worse than I did right after our breakup. At least after the breakup, I had some hope that we would rekindle our relationship. Now that hope is completely gone, and I am very sad.

Thank you so very much for reading. I would greatly appreciate any words of encouragement or advice you have for me."
1flq1q,1,2013-06-03,New job in a highly female workplace is aggravating my dysphoria.,[deleted],asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1flq1q/new_job_in_a_highly_female_workplace_is/,"I started working with a non-profit elder care group today as an intern. The only problem is, all the other interns and &gt;90% of the paid staff are women. The worst part was the fact that single-user bathrooms are marked ""men"" and ""women"", with women overflowing into the men's room if there's a wait. There were other things that highlighted the difference and made me feel alone, like a comment about ""becoming a sisterhood"" and how awkward conversation felt. Being one of the few ""men"" in the office has led to some uncomfortable silences and has highlighted my dysphoria.

I got home from the job and got a little teary-eyed. It really highlighted my issues with gender and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I don't know if I should try to camp it up and hope they think I'm a gay man, possibly letting me into the social circle, or if I should put on the brave face and be the man they're expecting, seeing as how they're making me do a lot of the heavy lifting already. Neither one is true to me. I am so uncamp it hurts and I have only a passing interest in men as romantic partners. I'm also not that strong, though I probably am stronger than most of the women there. The supervisors have also known me for a few years because of previous volunteer experience and some are pretty conservative, so them thinking I'm gay isn't a great option either.

How do you deal with a job where you're in the closet but your dysphoria is aggravated just by being there?"

One of the most recent paleo oriented meals I've brought to work was a spring mix of greens with peppers, onions, steak, bacon, and broccoli. 


Of course I do not want to eat salads everyday for lunch, so I wanted to ask if you all have any creative ideas for quick lunches I can prepare ahead of time that are paleo oriented.  Being paleo of course, I do not mind cooking the night before (steak, chicken, pork).

A few weeks ago he moved to another part of Spain and started an internship. I am still where we have been studying all semester and I'm leaving back home in a few weeks. I'm going to visit him once before I go. But seriously, this is the hardest thing I've ever done. He's been writing me every day and letting me know that he misses me and such.. but he is also letting me know how much he is enjoying his internship and how happy he is being where he is right now. I am so happy for him but every time he asks me how I am I lie to him and tell him I'm doing OKAY. In reality I am so upset. I wake up every day crying thinking of how much I miss him and the beautiful time we spent together during this entire semester and how unfair it is that we aren't from the same country and how I'm going to go back home in a few weeks (which I don't want to do) and I wont see him again at least until October. 

I wish I could tell him that I feel this way, but I really don't want to put a damper on his good time. From what it sounds like he is really enjoying his time where he is and I don't want him to feel guilty for doing what he's doing.

1fl8ia,4,2013-06-03,Losing It! Fuck This Earth!!!,duprian,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fl8ia/losing_it_fuck_this_earth/,"So I'm here in my school's computer lab with fuck all to do except job searching and begging for an academic internship so I can graduate next year.

I'm in the early stages of actually beginning to resist depression and trying DIY CBT, and I'm making progress with exercise and resume writing and I also just had a great semester grade wise, for once (although some senior pity played a role).

As I'm looking at academic research groups and trying to see if I made the dean's list (not yet published, obviously, but I'm an idiot) I find myself suddenly haunted by the digital ghost of the girl who blew me off/I blew it with.

She just graduated and got into the grad school I used to want to attend back when I gave a shit (I'm pretty sure she heard me say this, too). I was never supposed to see her again and this was a good thing.

I don't have facebook and I specifically try to avoid this kind of thing at all costs, but I randomly ran into two pictures of her, neatly spaced out from the time I first met her to her recent meteoric rise to queen shit of our dept. Her face was cropped into the thumbnail next to the fucking city manager with several others cropped out.

This was almost completely a one-sided thing, where I got the distinct impression she was attracted to me but wholly unimpressed and reluctant, so I put in minimal effort and as expected got brushed off. We still had two years of classes together with awkward looks and bizarre one off attempts at small talk.

I am sexually and romantically dysfunctional and rarely attracted to anyone, so this stupid series of non-events has mildly followed me for much longer than it should have, but I was basically over it until now.

There's something about seeing a significant photograph that hits harder than briefly coexisting in the same room. There's also something about the universe that seems to occasionally enjoy randomly playing with its food for a laugh.

(Fuck everything.)

1fktxj,16,2013-06-03,"Girlfriend [21f] of two years has a crush on another guy, but still wants to be with me [20m]",throwawayaxc,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fktxj/girlfriend_21f_of_two_years_has_a_crush_on/,"I have been dating this girl for almost two years. Things have been really great between us... we have great communication, we have some really good times together, I feel comfortable telling her anything, and most importantly we both love each other a lot. I should also mention that I am living 5 hours away from her over the summer because I have a summer internship, as this is important to the post. We are trying to visit each other every 2-3 weeks.

However, for the past few months our relationship has been kind of strained. I'm not entirely sure what's causing it. It could be that we have been dating for long enough that there has been a lull in our feelings for each other. It also could be the stresses of school. Whatever the reason, we have fought more in the past few months than I can ever remember. Our feelings for each other have also waned a bit.

This past week we both acknowledged that our relationship has been headed in the wrong direction. We had a very long talk where we were honest about the problems we have with each other and what we are going to do to try and fix things. We have decided to try and forget about our problems and just focus on the good about each other and our relationship. If this doesn't work out we will go our separate ways. This talk was very hard but I think it was very beneficial to our relationship.

As part of this conversation, we tried to get all of the things out of our heads that were bothering us. Something that was really bothering me was the fact that she has been hanging around a guy that I do not know very well. She met him this past year and they have hung out about once a week, watching movies with friends and stuff. Nothing crazy and nothing that is honestly very threatening to our relationship. She is always open about when she is with him because she knows it can be hard for me to deal with. She has promised me that nothing will go down between them that would be inappropriate for her to be doing in a relationship with me.

Regardless, the fact that she has been hanging out with him is kind of hard for me to digest. I don't know him and I guess I just don't trust him. I asked her about him when we had our talk and it came out that she has some feelings for him. I kind of freaked out. I felt like she was emotionally betraying me by having these feelings. She had a few things to say to me about that.

* She feels that she cannot control who she likes and dislikes. She has a crush on him and can't control that. She has promised me not to act on those feelings and she can control that.
* When she first started feeling this way about him she decided that he was not worth pursuing at all - she told me that I am so much better of a partner and she does not want to loose me over this because she loves me. She has feelings for him because he is exciting and not like me or her other friends. She is waiting out those feelings and trying to ignore them until they go away.
* She enjoys his company and wants to keep him in her circle of friends. That is why she has kept hanging out with him. In her words, ""I'm not about to give up that friendship because of a stupid crush that I know will go away anyway""
* She didn't tell me before because she wasn't going to act on it and didn't want me to freak out. She knows me well because that is exactly what I did.

Even with what she has told me, this situation is very hard for me. I would honestly prefer if she just stopped hanging out with him altogether, however I understand she is her own person and can do what she wants. I tried to come a compromise with her. She agreed to not plan on hanging out with him one on one, to limit hanging out with him to once and occasionally twice a week, and to be transparent about what she is doing with him and let me know when they are hanging out.

Rationally, I think this is reasonable. She has made it clear that she loves me and does not want to act on these feelings she has. She has agreed to follow some guidelines about her relations with him to make me more comfortable about it. She told me about her feelings and is not trying to hide anything.

However, the way that you feel about something does not always match the way you think about it. I have been losing sleep over this and have not been able to get it out of my mind. It honestly makes me feel a little sick sometimes. I just can't accept the fact that she has has some feelings for him and still wants to hang out with him while she is dating me at the same time. It makes me insecure about our relationship and I'm worried it will make the things we have been working bout our relationship progress backwards. This is all especially hard for me because we are apart for the summer.

So I would like to ask if any of the community here has been in this situation before and has any advice for me. Specifically, I would like to know if I am wrong to feel the way I have been feeling, if what she is saying and feeling is reasonable, and if there is anything I can do to help me cope with this.

Sorry for the wall of text. I've never dealt with something like this before and it is very hard for me. Thanks for reading.

tl;dr: My girlfriend has some feelings for another guy. She doesn't want to act on these feelings because of her love for me and has promised me she won't. She wants to stay friends with him, however. I am having a really hard time being at peace with this and am looking for some advice about this situation. I am very, very hung up over it.

EDIT: I'll be at work all day so I'll respond to things when I get back. Also, I made a comment that has some clarifications that might be important:

She has been hanging out with him the past few weeks since I have been gone. It hasn't been all year or anything. I think hanging out with him started out of boredom. She hasn't been hanging out with him behind my back at all. She doesn't have a problem mentioning it or telling me what they did.

I don't know when the feelings she has for him started. I was dumb enough not to ask her when we talked about it.

Update: We broke up"

__________________________________________

Summer is the damndest thing. I get to work and make some real money (real to a binge-drinking, weed-smoking college student), don't have to worry about school for 3 months, and I'm not under the stress of being the sports editor at the newspaper at school. At the same time, I get to think. A lot. Most of the time, it's good. But other times, it sucks.

I was just in bed, thinking about the past few years and I *had* to get up and write this manifesto, if you will. The main source of my problems in life is probably getting sexually abused by my much older (8 years) brother for almost a decade, starting when I was 6 or 7. I finally told someone in Oct. 2009, and he got a 5 year suspended sentence in Feb. 2011 after the 3 most serious of the 4 charges were dropped. This past summer, he was found with child porn on his computer and received zero jail time for it. He's still living with my mom's folks, ruining the near-perfect retirement that they were enjoying. Because of his probable Asperger's Syndrome, he gets away with raping me. Because of what I think is mine, I'm so fucking awkward that it's almost inconceivable at times. The worst part of his case is that I jumped to defend him. At the time, I wrote a long, though-out letter that basically said ""he's not a violent person; jail won't help him."" Now that I've had two years to stew over it, I wish I had said just the opposite. That little bitch ruined my life and has barely had to face any consequences for his actions. I have had to deal with his decisions for most of my 20 years. My parents are probably ruined forever, and it's a wonder they haven't divorced yet. I'm shaking with rage as I type this. I wish he could be thrown in prison where a dude named Ashley will love him the same way he ""loved"" me. He's not some autistic fatso who doesn't know any better; he's a violent predator who deserves the chair. I can't wait to get back to my therapist and have a few more sessions.

Freshman year of high school, I was legit creepy. With the slightest act of friendliness on any girl's part, they were promptly and awkwardly asked out. I gained that reputation by asking out someone who I'd had a crush on in third grade because of that game where you write a name on someone's hand, and if you look at it, you have to ask him/her out. I was chill about it initially, but over the course of that first week of high school in the backwoods of Maryland with the rest of my freshman class, I ruined my entire reputation before high school had really even started. When it was announced that winter that the winter dance would be a Sadie Hawkins, I was so mad because I just knew that I would never get asked (and with that attitude, of course I didn't). My attitude forever was that I was far too ugly to get a girl - short, glasses, braces, whole 10 yards. That year I asked I think eight girls to prom (200 people in the school = everyone goes to prom). Two years later, someone came up to me and asked if it was true that I was told by the administration to stop asking or I wouldn't be allowed to go; nothing like that happened at all. It was that bad. Prom sucked, and I accidentally walked into the girl's locker room at after prom at a pool it was at (barely sprinted out in time before I was noticed; just blanked for about two seconds. I would have killed myself that day if I had been).

Sophomore year, I really wanted to get a homecoming date. Got one, a decent-looking senior. She broke it off after two days because my mom didn't want her driving me. Oh by the way, I was incredibly sheltered until Oct. 2009. Asked the other girl who wanted to go with me (hotter and nicer freshman, still have no clue why I didn't ask her in the first place), she said yes, but what should have been a great time was fucked up by my sheer idiocy at every turn throughout the build-up to the dance. The same girl who broke things off before homecoming was gonna go to prom with me, but she got cold feet two weeks before and ended it again. No date, prom sucked again.

Junior year, I turned over a new leaf and cleaned up my act. Slowed way down on the girl front and brought my grades up. Didn't go too bad in the fall, then 10/30/09 happened. At homecoming that year, I met a stunningly gorgeous blonde freshman and we gelled really quickly. At last, everything was falling into place. My immaturity was still there, though, and I didn't act at all. Another friend who I'd known since 3rd grade was also my chemistry lab partner, and he started texting her in front of me in class. After a month of this, I have enough and decide to let her know how I feel about the whole situation and ask her out. Due to both bad planning and bad luck, I can't. I left the school after the basketball game that night seeing the girl of my dreams and someone who I thought was one of my best friends walk away, holding hands.

I get over that quicker than I expected, and I get ready to ask out the hotter girl from sophomore homecoming. It's all set and ready - my best friend (her cousin, let's call him W) is gonna help me ask her (S), with flowers and a sign. He says I should get a new shirt for it, one less nerdy. One Saturday, my folks surprise me with some nice, new clothes. I forgot about the whole ""new shirt"" thing, and my parents calmly laugh it off at dinner. The next day, my mom gets a hard line about it - you don't need to go to the mall. I never liked to tell my folks about my love life and this was definitely no exception, lest they tell my best friend's dad and she finds out. She never told me I couldn't, however, and on that Sunday I get a text from out of nowhere saying that he's in the driveway, which he was. My dad gives me money, and gives me implicit permission since mom was asleep, on the condition that I pay him back. I agree to, and leave. 30 minutes later, I get a text from him saying ""COME HOME NOW!!!!"" I'm told that I can't go to the thing next Friday where I was going to ask her, I couldn't have a date to prom, and I wasn't even going to prom. In my haste to get in the house from my friend's car, I forgot the bag with the shirt. This led my mom to believe I was out involved in things I shouldn't have been. My best friend's family is on my side, my mom is ready to kick me out of the house at 17, and my dad, ever the neutral pushover, says that I'm driving the two of them against each other. Great. Thursday, mom and I sat down and talked about it civilly for the first time. This is where it all comes out. She asks why I want a prom date so bad. The real reason is for redemption from the past two terrible years, but I simply tell her that I want to have a date and take this girl as a friend. She says that I can go to prom again and go with her, but she can't drive me and I can't ask the next night. Ok. At lunch the next day (Friday), W comes up to me, frantically saying that he just asked S how she would feel if someone asked her to prom the way I was planning. Her response: ""Oh my God, I would say yes no matter what!"" So, the guaranteed best moment of my life will not happen. I somewhat awkwardly ask her a few minutes later, she says she'll get back to me. I know she's gonna say no and she indeed did, via text, on Saturday. Danced with her three times at prom and it was the best dance ever, but it just wasn't the same.

Senior year, I was raring to go. Finally made the varsity lacrosse team, and was getting ready to apply for college. I was up for homecoming king, and the day before the dance, I caught the most popular guy in school and another somewhat popular kid snorting Ritalin in a bathroom. Long story short, I lost several friends and it undoubtedly cost me homecoming king. Still wish I would have done it differently. Nearly transferred that Monday, but was talked off the proverbial ledge by the blonde girl from earlier in the story. Fast forward to spring, where she and the guy from junior year are back talking again. I am at a loss at who to ask to prom, and my internship and the end of lacrosse season only complicate matters. I ask a girl on FB a few days too late, and she already has a date. Well, I get to deal with the stigma of having no prom date in four tries for the rest of my life. Fantastic. I show up to prom looking better than ever, and eventually the blonde girl shows up slightly drunk with her whole group. I run into her at this ""bar"" serving soda and whatnot. I talk to her a little bit, and offhandedly say that I feel like a loser at senior prom without a date. She put her drink down and went on and on about how awesome of a guy I am, how people at the school were ""gay"" and how I would find someone in college. The week building up to the dance, I made a conscious decision to change my approach for the night; instead of looking for a girl to dance with and get all romantic and whatnot, I was just gonna have a good time, be social, dance with as many girls as possible, and above all else, try to kiss a girl for the first time. I knew that this was the only chance I was ever going to have at kissing anyone before I walked across the stage in a few days, so I just asked for a kiss. I could have done it smoother, but I didn't know any better. She leaned up and kissed me for about two seconds. I really didn't believe it for a minute, and just said ""Wow. That was my first kiss."" She seemed genuinely surprised, which felt just awesome. The guy got really pissed, of course, so an hour after my first kiss I felt like shit. I walked out and to my dad's truck while a line of limos awaited the rich/attractive people. There was a fucking wild party that night, which of course I didn't hear about, wasn't invited to, and wouldn't have been welcomed at anyway.

___

That was high school. Basically a shitshow of beta-ness of the highest level. Sorry for the walls of text, but I'm tired and have to go back to sleep. Let me know how the story was and how it can be improved, and if you want college, I'll put that together later today."
1fkjuz,0,2013-06-03,An intern with a problem,DrNigg,AZURE,https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1fkjuz/an_intern_with_a_problem/,"At the moment I'm running an internship at a government agency which is thinking about putting their data for a project on Windows Azure.

The project is the following: in the area, there's a nature area which filters water in a natural way. In this area, there are 100's of sensors which detect increases and decreases in water volume, this allows you to calculate filtration rates. In this area, there are also information poles where people who visit the area can read realtime information (filtration rates, water volume etc).

The problem I'm having is in the amount of options that windows azure is able to deliver, and choosing the right ones. Not only that, but I seem to be unable to find a similar case online, so I have a hard time deciding what options to take (the agency itself isnt very clear in what they want, they just want a general idea of what it's gonna cost if they go through with it).

In short, I wil need the following options:

There is a database (oracle atm). They need to be able to update it automatically in a minute from data that's received from sensors in the area. You need to be able to see this data on information poles in the area. There is an external site (already online) which should be reachable by those information poles as well. There is a possibility that a phone app will be developed, this should be able to reach the databases as well.

Storage, Data transfer etc are clear, but what other options will I need? "

This august I will be arriving in Toronto and stay until February due to an internship. I am from Denmark so I have no idea about the rental market in Toronto but it strikes me as rather messy to get an overview of it.

I have been offered a furnished room in a house at Bartlett Avenue near a subway station. The house is in good condition. The price is $950 with WIFI included and washing and dryer machine in the house. My question is now, is that a fair price?

After my ex, Evan, broke up with me, I joined OKC when I was ready again and I met Jeremy.  

Jeremy lived in Austin, and I was in Houston. He was an arrogant ginger-bearded guy, but he was good to his core. Neither of us believed in long-distance, so we decided to be friends. We would talk for hours, up until 3am sometimes, just like I used to do in high school. I'd never been so intellectually challenged/stimulated in my life, and he said neither had he. I think in many ways, he's changed my life and the way I view/think of the world, and given me confidence in myself. I can only hope I've made some good impact in his life too. Anyway, after talking on the phone so frequently, I decide to visit him over spring break, we sleep together, and I go back home after a weekend of greatness. I start developing feelings for him, and it seems like he feels something, though not to the extent that I felt. 

I mentioned the possibility of doing an internship in Austin that would bring me there for the summer (May- September) but it's very hard to get. He wants me to get the internship, and he's supportive of my goals/dreams. I know it sounds stupid because we weren't in a relationship, but I fell in love with him. I told him that, and I wanted to know if he saw a future with me-- if I came to Austin, that'd be fun but would it mean anything to him, too? He insisted that he barely saw a future for himself, that when I return from studying abroad, I'll finish school in Houston, and there's no guarantee of where else life will take me. I've always wanted to be in Austin, and it's where I saw myself, so I couldn't understand this. He says that he sees us making memories together, but that our paths will eventually diverge again and we wouldn't be in the same place, and therefore he didn't believe that our story had a happy ending. 

For me, this was not good enough- I saw him as someone I'd be willing to stake a long-distance relationship with, and I thought he felt the same way too. I was confused and sad, and at some point he stopped calling me, which hurt a lot because it made it seem like I was being demanding by addressing my needs. My ex (Evan) and I had become friends again, and one weekend, Evan came over and we slept together. He made me feel wanted. The next day, Jeremy called and apologized for not calling, but said that he needed a friend-- his dad was in the hospital, and might die. 

I tried being there for Jeremy, but he only answered my calls when he felt like it. Meanwhile, Evan was doing his best to win me back, because his abrupt break-up was more about the fact that he had slipped into severe depression, and pushed me away. Now, he felt that he wanted/needed me back, and wanted to ""prove himself"" etc etc. It was very sweet, and I felt so alone otherwise. 

The next time I talk to Jeremy on the phone, I ask him where he stands in terms of our relationship. I probably shouldn't have given the shitty timing, but it was on my mind. He tells me he doesn't see a future with me, and that he's worried about his dad. I tell him I'm sorry, and I'm there for him if he needs anything, but that I decided to get back together with my ex (Evan) in the end. Jeremy is silent for a while, and I say that I'm here if he needs me. I decide that I don't want to be with anyone who makes me feel unwanted, and that's what Jeremy did for me. 

But I couldn't get over him. I tried being with Evan, but my heart had vacated his place and created room for Jeremy, and now there's not a whole lot of room for anything else. I ended things with Evan, and I got the internship that I told Jeremy about. They picked 14 of us, out of 140 applications. Jeremy still won't talk to me. I finally texted him goodbye (wishing him the best of luck with everything in the future) and deleted his number on my phone. The next day, I re-started this okcupid account. I've been on here for 3 days. I live approximately 3 mi. from him, and I doubt I'll ever see him again. It's the most devastating and gratifying relationship I've ever experienced, and I want to learn how to get over him. "

Need some advice.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fkcc7/m20_really_unsure_about_my_situation_this_summer/,"I have a bit of an interesting situation this summer. I [M20] currently just moved to a different state over a thousand miles from home for a fairly big-time summer internship. The company I work for has employed two other interns aside from myself, also from different parts of the country. So two weeks ago I show up for the first day of work and one of the interns just happens to be one of the prettiest, smartest girls I've ever met. After getting to know her better, I find out that we are living in the same apartment complex for the summer. I also find out a few surprising bits of info: 1) She is living with the other [M20] intern 2) She's 24 years old. One thing I do know is that she is strictly just friends with the other intern, but it kind of blew me away that she is 24, yet looks so much younger than that. Anyways, over the past few weeks, we interns have been hanging out a lot and exploring the big cities around us. This has only made me more attracted to this girl. The thing is, is that we have always hung out as a group and I have no idea if she would be down to go on an actual date. I feel like there could potentially be something between us. The other issue I am running into is the fact that I work with her. I know dating coworkers is not allowed in many workplaces, but if we are just summer interns, would that somehow be ok? Any advice you all could offer would be much appreciated. Should I just go for it, or should I enjoy the summer with this girl (as friends) and make memories instead of being caught up in worrying about a relationship?"

I'm fucking fed up.***

I'm 30. She's 26. We've been together for just over 1 year. Everything was fantastic until a few months ago. 

It was a whirlwind beginning. Sparks, lightning, all that jazz. We met at work, we started dating, I left for another opportunity, and we continued dating. I've never loved anyone like I have loved this woman. I had been in several multi year relationships, a ton of short term flings, and a few fwb's. In the first six months it was like no relationship I've ever had. Both our families love us, and think we should tie the knot. My work situation is great, she's a student with a good internship, and I've started an MBA program. I can't think of anything that is a problem besides this one issue.

The problem was that she has an ex of 5 years who will not go away. No marriage. No kids. They worked together, lived together, shared a house, finances, a boat, phones, a dog, basically everything. They knew each other for several years before they started dating. She told me at about 2 years in he started cheating on her, was mentally abusive, called her ugly, said she couldn't get anyone else, she was worthless, and all of these horrible things. I'm wondering why you would stay with someone for 3 years after this... but she said she just didn't think she could do better. She pulled the plug shortly after year 5 and left him. I met her a year after she left. She told me that she still talked to him sometimes because they shared some finances. I understood that for the first couple of months. At month 6, I was skeptical. At year 1, now I just don't fucking understand it.

Things were great for the first six months. Then work got busy for both of us and we couldn't see each other as much. I wanted more than she could give [as in I wanted a night or two a week for us,] and she started pulling away. I could tell in her actions, her demeanor, her declining tenderness towards me. 

Her phone was constantly going off. At 11pm, 12am, 1am, 2am, 3am. I've never ever snooped on anyone in my life, but after several months of this I had enough. 3 months ago her phone went off at about 5 am. She had gotten up to get in the shower, and I was just about to join her to get ready for the day. It went off and I couldn't help but look and see his fucking name. I checked the messages, and scrolling back I found that she called him baby, said she missed him, flirted with him constantly over a period of months, and sent him photos of her at work, school, in her car, and some of her in a fucking bathrobe and her underwear.

I flipped my fucking shit and went into the bathroom and asked her what the fuck was going on. She backpedaled, then got angry, then got defense, then started crying. We fought, and I left. We fought for several days after that. Her story was basically that they still had linked finances and she has to play a game with him to get her stuff back. This is after me saying multiple times that we should go and get everything from the house they had, that he still lives in, that she left almost 2 years ago. I say I can't be with someone, and I won't be with someone, that doesn't respect me. I told her I'm gone. She begs and begs and begs for me to give her another chance, that she will stop talking to him like that, but that she still has to talk to him until everything ends. I say it ends, or I am gone. She needs to get her fucking shit out of the house or this is over. It's fucking bullshit that they were broken up for a year, and we've been together almost a year, and she fucking goes behind my back like this. She agrees, and says she will stop, she will tell him to stop talking to her, and she will get the rest of her stuff.

This was about 3 months ago. Since then everything has been great. She's told me she got the rest of the stuff. She told me they have nothing else beside a boat that he's going to sell, and the dog that he has had for two years and is still keeping. No problems except for the fact that she still fucking talks to him. 

Cue tonight... I've been helping her out financially for the last month, as school ended, she quit her part time job, was working at her unpaid internship, and starts a new part time job at a very good firm in one month. I've been helping her out financially basically all fucking semester though. I have bought her groceries for months, and groceries and gas for the past month, and given her spending money. I took us on a week vacation after her semester ended. We were supposed to do something important last night, but we couldn't because her dad asked her to dinner and a show for a end of semester present. Ok, that's fine with me. Then she's acting weird all day. Then while I'm cooking dinner she says ""Can I tell you something without you getting mad?"" I'm thinking it's about her job maybe taking her away from our city... no. She says ""ex is coming by to drop off some stuff."" I'm furious. This shit was supposed to be over. I ask her when this is going to end. I do not want to be in a relationship with someone that continues to disrespect me like this. She gets quiet. Doesn't say anything. I tell her I'm going to get the stuff when he brings it and tell him to fuck off. She says I can't. I ask her when this is going to be over, and again say I will not be in a relationship with someone that won't commit fully, and respect my boundaries. She gets upset, thinks I keep throwing the texts in her face everytime he comes up. I say I'm not throwing them in her face, but that she has to realize how it looks to me when she won't cut contact. Then she left. 

I'm so done with this. Before I found the texts, I had talked to her dad and brother about proposing sometime in the next six months after she graduates [which I clearly not fucking do.] They love me. My family loves her. I looked at rings, but I didn't buy anything, which was good because I found out the text conversations 2 weeks later. I do not understand why the fuck someone who was removed from her life a year before I met her, is still around a year after.

***TL;DR: GF of one year has an ex from 2 years ago that she still talks to, still has financial obligations/shared assets with, and will not cut contact. I'm fucking fed up.***

As of now, we have not talked in several hours. He apparently came and dropped something off. I'm pretty much done with this. Does anyone see anything I don't? Does anyone have any advice for me?

Working the 4th of July, some gigs are paid, some are not. Depends on the size of the show and the operator. 

I have been doing this for over 20 years now and I love it. Now my grown sons all do it too and my oldest is getting his own license.

It's hard, dirty and hot work, but nothing beats sitting close to the firing area. 

Even if the gig you start out on isn't paid, it's hella fun to do and you get the best seat in the house. You are right near the firing range. They usually feed you for the day. All you need to do this job is to be over 18, safety gloves and glasses, a hard hat, a good attitude and willingness to learn. 

The company offers a learn to license program. Since every city and a lot of county areas, country clubs and such have their own big display show... the company is always looking for licensed operators and people willing to put the time in to get their license. They will help you to get your necessary internships and referrals.  

The shows are obviously all the hell over Southern California on the 4th. Many cities have multiple sites. Some areas fire on alternate dates. Once you have learned how, there are more opportunities to fire than you might think.

1fodss,56,2013-06-04,How many years should I wait for employment as a lawyer?,law_r,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1fodss/how_many_years_should_i_wait_for_employment_as_a/,"tl,dr: Lawyer since 2009, no full-time regular job since 2006, unable to get any interviews since 2010, no easy solution. Also, QQ. 

I worked for five years in a corporate setting, and topped out on promotion potential for people without an advanced degree. I enrolled in law school in 2006 thinking it would make me more marketable. I worked summers at a medium sized firm after my 1L and 2L years, and there was every indication they would welcome me back after graduation as a full time employee. 

I graduated law school and was sworn in as an attorney in 2009. I'd kept in touch with my would-be employer, and in October they kindly let me know the job they had for me was no longer available. I scrambled, I was lucky enough to get a paid internship working in a GC's office pushing paper. I did this for a year, until I was able to interview for the job I originally expected to have when I graduated from law school. 

My interview went fine, but not great. I learned that the employer was able to hire someone with 5 years of experience to the entry level position I interviewed for. The GC's office politely, but firmly, encouraged me to find work elsewhere about a month after I got my rejection letter from my original job prospect. 

Of course, I was crushed, but continued hustling and trying to find work. I opened a solo practice and took on cases in 2011 and 2012, while I continued to look for full time regular work. My case volume was low, but I did enough work to keep the lights on. I was just treading water, though, and it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. As such, I've been winding down my book of work while still looking for any full-time opportunity to work as an attorney. I recently wrapped up my last client matter, and am taking my shingle down. 

So far I've been unable to even score an interview anywhere since my interview in 2010. My contact at the old firm moved to a different state, and I can't get my foot back in the door.

I was in the top quarter of my class, although I went to a third tier school. I have good recommendations from respected people in my field, although they are from 2009. I was active in law school in groups and activities that supported my intended field. That is to say, I put my money where my mouth was. 

Despite being in solo-practice, I have a fraction of the experience of people who've been fully employed since 2009 or 2010. And every day I'm not working, I'm losing ground on my peers. 

I recently got a rejection letter for a job that was almost identical to the one I expected to have after law school. 

Again, I didn't even manage to get an interview. That was pretty much the last straw, as if I can't even get an interview for something to which I tailored my entire law school experience, I think it's a sign from God to move on. 

I have not explored contract positions, part time / limited term work, or volunteer work. I suppose those are the logical next steps, along with non-lawyer work. But at this point my confidence is basically shot, and I'm sure I'm starting to sound like a drunken guy hitting on a hot bartender to potential employers. In other words, the desperation is obvious at this point. 

I spent a lot of time being optimistic, and I kept my head down and trudged forward. I counseled my friends who were unemployed to do the same, much to their annoyance. But, now I'm ready to say it. Law school was a huge mistake. 

I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I know others have it the same or worse, and there isn't really anything special or unique about my version of the last four years. Just felt like sharing. "

I'm living up in Minnesota for the summer and I am looking for some friends to hang out with!

I'm a tall, thin guy with gorgeous eyes. I've got the ability to grow facial hair and if that hasn't melted your heart, then just you wait!

Here's some stuff about me: I like college football, baseball, barbeques, exploring, canoeing, Netflix, a cold beer, and science. I am an engineering student at a school in the Midwest home for the summer.

I'm pretty flexible when it comes to people I associate with. I get along with just about anyone and its something that I really like about myself. I can adapt to almost any social setting or group and I have a wide range of interests. This makes it easy to get along with (and I hate using stereotypical names but bear with me) grease monkeys, jocks, science geeks, pot heads, you name it.

I am very laid back, but extremely responsible. If I say I'm going to do something, you can be damn sure that its going to get done. I think honesty is the most important thing in a friendship. I think I'm a nice guy, pretty sarcastic at times, and an overall loveable guy. You can't offend me, its impossible. I expect you to be able to take a little teasing, I really get bothered when people are uptight.

I like confidence, intelligence, wittiness, and a generally positive outlook on life in a person. Do I expect a relationship to come from this? No, but I'm certainly open to one if it becomes something.

Look, long story short, a lot of my friends moved away for summer internships and I'm feeling pretty lonely and I want to get out and meet people. I work a lot, which makes it tough to find time to meet people. I'm not an introvert, but I'm also not an extreme extrovert either. I hate that awkward period of time when you meet someone and you are afraid to be yourself because you want to impress the other person, but I assure you, if you just act natural with me, I'll be able to get along with you just fine!

I'm down to text, provided we talk a little on here, swap pictures maybe. I'm a nice guy, what do you have to lose?

Hello my dear fatties.


I have been a reader here since pretty much day one, but I've stuck with posting TP bullshit or greentext from 4Chan, why? Because I am a dirty European peasant, I live in Denmark, I don’t regularly meet celestial bodies, oh sure, I’ve meet and are friends with overweight people, but none had exhibited any signs of the dreaded logic.
Problem is, I had met it, and I just didn’t know, my memory was suddenly jogged when another post talked about obese pets, and it hit me, I have had contact of the first degree!


This happened in 2012, I had just stopped my education because I wanted to pursue something that put me in contact with more people, and after 2 months of doing fuck all, I landed an internship at a pet store for 3 months, hoping I’d get a job there. 
At the time I was around 6’ feet and ~210 pounds (182 cm and 95 kg) I was big, but not all of it was fat, but I quickly learned that going from a very sedentary lifestyle to standing around 8 hours, lifting 40 pound bags of food all day took its toll, but I survived and eventually got employed in the stores web shop, mostly the same work, just harder and on a much stricter deadline.


Skip forward a month or so, another intern is brought on, she is only going to be here for 2 weeks, not sure why but whatever, she was going to work the storefront, and me in the back most of the time.

 
I’d like you all to welcome into your hearts, [Charon, standing at a small 5’5” and ~380 pounds (165 cm &amp; 172 kg)](http://www.mybodygallery.com/photos-29064-body-shape.htm?StartAt=0#.Ua4OibWnrG0), I have never met a more entitled, selfish and dumb person in my life.


I meet her when peoples running the front end show up for work at 10 AM, I greet her because, hell, I don’t hate fat people, and are immediately taken aback by how sweaty her hand was (it was February, still snow out), after the greet she gets shown to the break room and I return to my normal duties.


Flash forward an hour or so, a delivery of 3 pallets worth of food and assorted stuff comes in and needs to be unloaded, not my job anymore though, so I go about my business, 10 minutes goes by, and suddenly Charon comes waddling into our storage area where I work and whines:


Charon: ”I just can’t believe it, the boss told me two unload the 3 pallets quickly!”

Me:” Yeah? And? That is kind of your job here; didn't you get the job described to you?”

Charon:”What do you mean? We’re a pet store! I just want to play with and care for the animals!”

At this point I’m kind of just looking at her, waiting for a point that never came

Me:”Yes, and we get a ton of food every week that needs to be unloaded, how do you think this works?”

Charon:”But… I thought the delivery guys did that?!”

Me:” Yeah, you try and convince them they should do that.

I said it in as sarcastic a manner as possible, but sure enough, Charon thought she actually had an option here.
She waddles out, I return to my duties, and she comes back not 5 minutes later, red in the face, sweating profusely, and almost screams:

Charon:” WHY DID YOU TELL ME TO TELL THEM TO PUT IT AWAY?!”

Me:”I’m sorry, I thought my sarcasm was very clear, I didn’t think you’d actually go do that”

Charon:” WELL I DID! AND NOW I LOOK STUPID TO THE REST OF THE GIRLS!”

Me:”Well, such is life, now I got to get back to work, go do your job, we can’t have the pallets standing around forever.”


Charon makes a sound not unlike what you’d hear from a cow giving birth, and turns on her heels out into the store.

Half an hour later I take my first break, sitting around chatting with my colleagues in the break room, just relaxing as I had already eaten. In comes Charon.


Charon:” Zachel! Get out! I need to take my break now!”

Me:” Excuse me? I still got 20 minutes left”

Charon:” I know that! But I need food now!”

Me:” Well, wait until [Another female coworker] is done, you can’t leave the shop without at least 3 people on the floor, and I don’t count towards that.

Which is true, we had to have at least 3 people on the floor of the shop itself at all times, but the web shop while in the same building, was considered a shop of its own, and while I could help out, I wasn't employed as such in the physical shop.
Obviously displeased that she had to wait on her feeding frenzy she goes out again, and I ask my colleague how much work Charon had actually done yet, the answer came back as expected, she moved 4 bags, at 22 pounds each and I just sigh and go about my day.


When she finally got to take a break, she had, as expected, crossed the street over to McDicks, and had brought back 3 bags, I thought nothing of it, it was a regular occurrence that 1 person would take order from the rest of the front end and bring it back, I was wrong, dead wrong.


My work area was just outside the door to the break room. I can’t even describe the sounds that came from in there, had I not known better I’d have called someone to go catch the rapid beast that was now occupying the break room.
I checked it out after she left, she didn't even clean up after herself, if memory serves it was 5 cheeseburger wrappers, 3 big fries, 1 hamburger, the biggest possible soda, and 2 big macs and a Flurry.


I was dumbstruck, pretended I didn't know and did my job as a faithful employee, still switching between contemplating how you could possibly eat all that, and screaming “HOOOOOOOOOW” inside my head.


The day was rather uneventful after that, but I did see her when I was in the front end, snapshots includes:

*  Charon sitting on the floor, looking sad.

* Charon sitting on the floor looking mad.
 
* Charon sitting on the floor doing actual work.

* Charon shifting bags of food, huffing and puffing like she just ran 3 marathons with an angry tiger on her back.

* Charon getting angry at boss lady because she was expected to, you know, work.

* Charon contemplating how to get other people to do her work.


When my shift was finally over I went home, and the next day, Charon was a no show, I ask Boss lady if she called in sick.

BL:” Yeah, she complained about her knees, she said she’ll come in later if it gets better”

Me:” I find that hard to believe, but whatever.”

Turns out, she never did, or any other day for that matter, she kept calling in that her knees was acting up, that she could only come in if she could be behind the register, on a chair, which she couldn’t because chairs at the register was against company policy, and it would be against the law to put her there in the first place because she was an intern.
Never saw her again, oh happy days.


TL: DR Pluto’s minor moon joins me in the pet store for 1 day, throws several hissy fits, throws garbage all over break room, and then never comes in again.


Reading this back, I am happy I don’t have any other stories, I suck at this.

Two problems: one I have no idea how to take that export and have it overwrite that table safely. Also, as everything is dependent on it in our erp system, I am hesitant to just create another one. B. I am not sure that every applicable country will have a correctly entered anticedent. Wondering if anyone knows where I can pull a master list that is formatted well.

1fn25w,1,2013-06-04,"20 [M4F] Minnesota: I'm Minnesotan, isn't that neat?",[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1fn25w/20_m4f_minnesota_im_minnesotan_isnt_that_neat/,"Ok hello, thank you for clicking here! I promise to be as normal and honest as possible!

I'm living up in Minnesota for the summer and I am looking for some friends to hang out with!

I'm a tall, thin guy with gorgeous eyes. I've got the ability to grow facial hair and if that hasn't melted your heart, then just you wait!

Here's some stuff about me: I like college football, baseball, barbeques, exploring, canoeing, Netflix, a cold beer, and science. I am an engineering student at a school in the Midwest home for the summer. 

I'm pretty flexible when it comes to people I associate with. I get along with just about anyone and its something that I really like about myself. I can adapt to almost any social setting or group and I have a wide range of interests. This makes it easy to get along with (and I hate using stereotypical names but bear with me) grease monkeys, jocks, science geeks, pot heads, you name it.

I am very laid back, but extremely responsible. If I say I'm going to do something, you can be damn sure that its going to get done. I think honesty is the most important thing in a friendship. I think I'm a nice guy, pretty sarcastic at times, and an overall loveable guy. You can't offend me, its impossible. I expect you to be able to take a little teasing, I really get bothered when people are uptight.

I like confidence, intelligence, wittiness, and a generally positive outlook on life in a person. Do I expect a relationship to come from this? No, but I'm certainly open to one if it becomes something.

Look, long story short, a lot of my friends moved away for summer internships and I'm feeling pretty lonely and I want to get out and meet people. I work a lot, which makes it tough to find time to meet people. I'm not an introvert, but I'm also not an extreme extrovert either. I hate that awkward period of time when you meet someone and you are afraid to be yourself because you want to impress the other person, but I assure you, if you just act natural with me, I'll be able to get along with you just fine!

I'm down to text, provided we talk a little on here, swap pictures maybe. I'm a nice guy, what do you have to lose?"
1fmvml,179,2013-06-04,Beached Whales: Lost in Shanghai,ImDaChineze,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fmvml/beached_whales_lost_in_shanghai/,"Note of clarification: I am from the Hamazon, otherwise known as 'Muricah. I'm in SH for an internship, not a local.  
There are a few things I have to give as background for you to fully understand this situation.   
**First and foremost:** there are VERY few hamplanets in China as a whole. Every once in a while, you will see one or two HamMoons, but nowhere near the level of hamplanetry that the United States spawns. Call me racist, call me an asshole, whatever, the truth is that the only thing the U.S. leads the world in besides defense budget spending is its obesity rate (real talk, look it up.) Now, China is a fat kid’s heaven. Almost everything is fried, doused in oil, or otherwise complete composed of sugar. Even the “healthy” meals are heavily salted and/or include a side of enough rice big enough to feed a family.  
**Second (this is important for story development and shit):** cars are expensive as HELL in China. As in, 70%-80% markup from United States MSRP. On top of that, license plates are expensive as well, because municipalities release only a certain amount per period, so there’s huge bidding wars that make it so that a single license plate in Shanghai (where I’m at) will be 90,000 RMB (~$15,000 USD, 9.6k GBP, 11.2k Euros, etc.). As a result, people use alternative transportation. In Shanghai, this means busses, sketchy motorcycles, taxis, or the subway.  

**Third:** The Metro system in Shanghai is extremely good. It’s probably the best way to get around due to high traffic above ground. Combine that fact with the fact that Shanghai has a population of 23 million, and that means you got yourself one of the most crowded subway systems in the world even in off hours. Green text activate (shoutout to /u/Mad_X for teaching me how in my last story) Still getting used to it.  
&gt;Rush hour on Friday (Businesses usually start at 9:00 here)  

&gt;Be me (175 lbs (80kg), 6’0’’ (183cm))  

&gt;Not be one of the hundreds of others trying to fit into same car  
 
&gt;Getting personal space violated realllllllllllllllll hard  

&gt;12 stops in total, 4 more to go. Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.  

&gt;Intermittent foreigners here and there, mostly young and healthy, almost all with superiority complex because Chinese people treat them as if they shat platinum.  

&gt;Squished as shit, also kinda sweaty cause it's Shanghai weather  

&gt;Feelsbadman.jpg  

&gt;It's ok, arriving at People's Square, 80% of the people in the line 2 get off at that stop.  

&gt;Right on queue, mad exodus  

&gt;ohsweetjesus.swf  

&gt;Thud  

&gt;Thud  

&gt;Crowd parting like it was the Red Sea meeting Moses.  

&gt;Little babies crying, heads turning   

&gt;First minute of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vMiVgdMgC8) pretty accurate describes how it felt

&gt;Enter: Hamzilla with Wife and two kids.  

&gt;Hamzilla is wearing an American Flag sleeveless shirt, literally looks like the flag fully spread out. Budweiser Hat, and Sunglasses. Literally every stereotype in the world has been personified in this man.

&gt;Wife is surprisingly not morbidly overweight, just obese.

&gt;Girl is wearing Aeropostale size XXXXXXL. Boy wearing Nike shirt (Oh lawdy). 

&gt;Starting to empathize with that ugly assed gargoyle over at A&amp;F over wanting to put size restrictions on shirts to keep out unattractive people, but real talk, that dude is damn ugly, dahell is he going on about?  

&gt;All of them clutching 2 油条 (Deep fried breadsticks. The name literally translates to Oil strips in English) in one hand and cantaloupe sized Chinese-doughnuts in another. I had no idea that they made them in that size, because these things are filled with sickly-sweet red bean paste, deep fried, then coated with granulated sugar. A tiny one of these would be enough to give me a queasy feeling inside.  

&gt;Hamzilla and co. step into subway.  

&gt;What was once extremely crowded by 20-30 people squished together, now occupied by a single family (slightly spread out but still.....)  

Will now attempt to transcribe what they said, not 100% verbatim. The wife spoke with less of a southern accent than the husband, so I differentiated their voices by keeping the wife's speech normal. She still had the familiar drawl to it, but not Paula Deen level.  

&gt;""Deese Chai-knees suuuuureeeee know how to make food.""  

&gt;""They don't look like they eat any of it though, skin and bones they are"" (teehee)  

Now is a good time to mention that while I've met many an obnoxious hamzilla in the past, my policy with these people has been to stay out of their way and just observe. Think Star Trek Prime Directive (that new movie was really good, watch it if you haven't by the one. One of the only movies I've seen in a while that actually used 3D effectively).  

&gt;""I wonder where the gook back dere got that there pancake thing, I could use some green in my tummy""   (葱油饼 = fried bread with green onions, a shitton of oil, and a crapload of salt.)  Also, he literally said tummy.

&gt;""I don't know, ask somebody""  

&gt;""These people don't speak english, how'm I supposed t' cuh'munnicate? Ching Chong?""  

I should note that English is a required course in the present-day curriculum in China. It is the most commonly spoken language besides Chinese in its various forms, and a good portion of the population understood what these people were saying to a degree.

&gt;""How bout that one there?""  

Suddenly, I feel something grab my arm. It let go immediately, but there was grease prints left behind. (I'm not bullshitting, 油条 are literally that fucking oily, it's kinda nasty and I stay away from them T_T). I'm wearing a button-up shirt for work (internship), and my jimmies are rustled immediately. I turn around to see the guy standing there looking at me.  

&gt;""Axscuse meeeeeeeeee, doooooo youuuuuuuuuuuuuu knowwwwwwwwwww whereeeeeeeeeeee eyeeeeeeeeeeeeeee cannnnnnn finddddddddddddd pppannnnnncakuhhhhhhhhhhhh?"" He is using some sort of crude sign language to complement this. At this point I've realized that in the short time span they've had their conversation, every single one of them in the family has already finished the equivalent of a family's breakfast.  

I'm kinda shocked at this poin

&gt;""I don't know""  

&gt;""theeeee rounddddddd pancakeeeeeee thinggggggggg"" making what could either be his body shape, or a description of the food he's looking for with his sausagey-looking fingers.  
 
&gt;""I *don't* know...""  

&gt;He turns back to his wife.  

&gt;""I told you these people don't speak English... Why can't they learn it?""  

&gt;Be in China, expected to not be fluent in CHINese, but English. Is that fatlogic?  

&gt;""My English is fine, I just don't know where you can get it specifically, because it's almost everywhere on the streets. It's a really common food. I don't understand how you haven't noticed it, seeing how fixed on food you are.""  

&gt;I may have just killed a baby puppy by the looks all four of them were giving me. (I have a rather big mouth that gets me in trouble sometimes, I didn't mean it to come out like that.)  

&gt;""EXCUSE ME? DID YOU JUST INSULT ME AND MY FAMILY? WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO INSULT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THAT, YOU FATHATER""  

&gt;Everyone in the subway (it's usually loud with the buzz of chatter) has fallen silent at this point.  

&gt;""I apologize, I didn't meant for it to to come out as an insult."" (subconsciously I probably did, I'm an asshole sometimes.)

&gt;""YOU LIAR, ALL YOU CHAI-NEES ARE RACIST ASSHOLES, THATS WHY THE REST OF THE WORLD HATES YOU.""  

&gt;isthisreallife.jpg  

&gt;""-静安寺站到了... Ladies and Gentleman, we are now at Jing An Temple. Please exit the doors from the left, and ...""  

&gt;""Well, this is my stop, have a nice day, good luck finding your food.""  

&gt;Walk out of subway from other car door, as the 4 are blocking the entire section from exiting from their respective one.  

Well, that's about it, I just walked out the door and started heading towards the stairs (everyone bunches up together shoving eachother, so I wanted to get there first so I could avoid it.) Hamzilla shouts behind me ""Hey Buddy!"", I turn around, and he does that thing where he slams his left hand onto his right arm like that Rosie the Riveter ""We Can Do It"" pose which signifies ""Up your ass"" (hehehe we can do it up your ass, I'm immature). I walk away without answer. Kinda a boring story since I didn't want to embellish what they said with random stuff about 'Beetus and Hamroid problems because they never actually said anything about it, but probably one of the more interesting encounters I've had regarding hamplanets.

1fmt8f,2,2013-06-04,"I reported bullying, and now the victim hates me.",heroorvillain,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fmt8f/i_reported_bullying_and_now_the_victim_hates_me/,"There is this girl, and I used to go out on a few dates with her. I've never been too interested in romantic living, but I felt a special connection with her. She cut it off completely five months ago, and I was fine with that. We remained pretty good friends.   
She confessed to me last week that another ex was really jealous that I hung out with her and was the one to help organize an art show that had her as a ""headliner"" of sorts. I looked into it out of curiosity, and found a really bitter, kind of evil cat.   
I asked her what was his deal and she passively said that he was a shit talker and sometimes would follow her around campus to different halls while calling her names. I asked her to explain, and she got a bit sad.     
She told me that she was probably deserving of the treatment. I don't know about you guys, but this doesn't sound healthy to me. I remind her that this is harassment and nothing but bullying and she should do something about it.  
This past Friday, I learn that the bully, has not only been doing these things at school, but other places. And it has been going on a long time. I'm angry at this point, and I feel like I could beat the shit out of him. Except I can't. I'm on probation, and I'm in a few very structured internships that could be at-risk if an arrest shows up. Maybe this is me being a pussy, but I don't feel it would have even got the message across. 
This kid, he's a punk. If I or another male compatriot are around the victim, he wouldn't dream of coming near. It would obviously take little to rile this kid up. I find that he works in the same building as the victim, and I take to a bit of kinda suspect spying on her, and I see the behavior is way worse than I could have ever thought. The guy is straight up yelling at her. She's tearing up. This doesn't make me feel good, but I decide not to intervene and record it as evidence. I follow her throughout the day and he seems to appear at random.  
I meet her at a mess hall for a bit of homework help, and I explain to her that I know what is going on. She seems hesitant to report it, and I say that this is a big problem, and if she won't let someone know about this obvious maltreatment, then I will.   
She maintains that she doesn't want to do anything about it. I tell her I will. She tells me not to hurt him. She tells me again how she deserves it and that he is in the right. I don't know if this is because we come from two completely different places, but this just seems ludicrious to me. Where I'm from, if someone gives you shit for living life, you get away from it or find a way to stop them.   
I devise a plan. I'm going to walk up on the guy and intimidate him. He's a pretty small guy, and I'm pretty well self-disciplined, so I'm positive I can hold my punches until he does if it gets to that point. I approach him after work in the parking lot of a coffee shop that the victim works at part time. He knows she is inside, but didn't expect me to be there. He takes off once he sees me and I;m pretty positive that he knows.  
I get the help of a friend, and I cover all my bases. Are they dating? No. Are they romantically involved? No. Are they even friends? From out complied recon, we can gather that their is a lot of anger from him to her. He gets me in touch with another person that can back up what we have so far.  
I wish it could of ended there, but Saturday came and I heard from my new ally that they both had a final and during the intermissions, a mix of the shittalk-following and threatening gestures came up, and when confronted, again, dude dipped.  
I decided that the open gestures were enough so this morning, I tell the universities psych everything that I've told you and some sensitive information that I don't feel comfortable sharing here. She says she'll put everything into motion and he'll be taken care of.  
I trust that the worst will happen is maybe he gets a bit of university discipline and maybe a ticket.  
The end of my class schedule comes and here comes victim, and she tells me that I ""don't respect her space"". I'm confused. And I still am.  
She storms off and I am stuck trying to explain that I was trying to help her and that she was obviously unhappy with the behavior he had been been exhibiting effects not only her, but others, and that vigilantism has entered all the mind of my ""allies"", which is obviously right in my mind, but I can't be doing that. She ain't care and leaves.   
I get home and call her, and her phone is off, and her facebook is deleted. I go to her dorm and she won't open or really talk much. I stand outside of her door for around half an hour to be heard out, but the puts on music so I leave.   
I feel like the bad guy somehow. It's like she's upset that I got her bully taken away for a bit or something.  
If someone could offer a bit of help by looking at this from a purely objective standpoint, I would love it. This whole thing has me horribly confused and I'm doubting my value as a friend; Did I really hurt or help? What other modes of action could I have taken? Is it normal to feel like a dick?   
I just need communication from her, and I feel way too lost.   
I'm going to call her again and if she doesn't answer, then I can't do anything about it.  
I just want to talk about it.

Once feelings developed, a major sticking point to our officially becoming an item was my hesitance at her having a child, and what that would mean for me. 

I do not particularly like children. That is not to say that I despise them, as some do, but I don't really enjoy their company at all. I was the youngest in my family, and never grew up around younger siblings, and was initially quite awkward with her son at the beginning of the relationship. 

After several months of dating, my misgivings about the future of our relationship started to get at me. I started to resent my girlfriend, and to be honest I was never really able to tell whether it was because of my relationship with her or because I was scared, legitimately scared, of having to deal with a 5 year old on top of everything.

I had the opportunity to leave for an internship for a while, and during that time we broke up. For me, it was an opportunity to escape, which I had desperately wanted... I was anxious, ready to leave, glad to have the decision made for me to leave her because I had tried, and failed, multiple times to break up with her. Every time before that, we would inevitably end up back together, usually the supposed culprit (according to her) being me and my inability to communicate my doubts.

When I came back from the internship, we of course ended up back together, which is where we're at now. We love each other very much, but I'm sure that she's quite right when she jokes (?) that she loves me more than I love her. My two issues are 1.) I don't know if I love her enough to be committed to living with her and her son and 2.) I don't know if I'm ready to become a father. She says, perhaps correctly, that I don't HAVE to assume all of those responsibilities right away, but I already feel obligated to. I already feel like I'm parenting this child, and that I'm doing a poor job, and that he should be raised in a different way than he is but at the same time I'm not willing to assume that responsibility.

I feel like I have her heart in my hands. It wouldn't be the first time I've broken her heart. I also feel like I'm at a portentous moment with regards to the 5 year old, because I can either start behaving more like a father or continue to be the guy with whom he competes for his mother's attention.

On top of all of that, I just graduated and I feel like I have the whole world ahead of me... but her kid ties us to the city we live in, and I would really love to travel and work in other cities, countries, etc. Continuing this relationship would effectively shut off many opportunities for me, but ending it a.) has been tried unsuccessfully various times already and b.) would remove me from the girl I love, the only person, friends and lovers alike, with whom I've been emotionally connected for years.

I realize this is a mess of words and emotions... what I really want is advice from people who've been in these situations. Has anyone had serious doubts and overcome them for good? Or do they signal an eventual end to the relationship? What do you do about a child that's not yours, who needs his mothers attention, who needs a father figure, and how have you dealt with it?

I feel very alone at this moment in my life. I can honestly say that there's nobody I can talk to about this... not my girlfriend, for obvious reasons, not my friends, because they have no idea where I'm coming from and because my devotion to my gf has effectively alienated me from them, not my parents because they already (even though they are supportive) would rather I broke up with her.

**TL;DR: We're on the road to moving in together, me her and her 5 year old. I have my doubts about her alone (don't feel like myself in this relationship, feel belittled by her frequently, has been a very passive agressive relationship recently), doubts about becoming, in practice, a father, and doubts about giving up my future career and scholarly options to stay in the same place and set up shop here. Advice from those more experienced than I?**

Any advice would be greatly appreciated...

EDIT: A big issue is that I've tried breaking up with her before, and she's kind of convinced me (though not without my own weakness playing a part) to get back together, saying that the problem is my commitment issues and inability to communicate problems and general inexperience with relationships (this being my first real one). But I can't help but think that it's her own desperate attempt to keep hold of me, conscious or not, and that the real issue isn't just me but our relationship in general. And now, after having chosen to get back with her so many times, it's as if my current doubts are insignificant--even if I do take action, won't it just end up like it always does? With me running back to her?

Funny how when you write things down, it sounds so simple, and you can pick the problem right out and say ""Ha! There's your problem, you've got no spine!"" but in the moment it seems so complex and solutionless."
1fmaxu,1,2013-06-03,Don't know how I am going to make it through this week(day 2ish),pine-appletrees,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1fmaxu/dont_know_how_i_am_going_to_make_it_through_this/,"Alright leaves, here's my story: I quit smoking the middle of April to focus on finishing a very hard semester at school and getting a job, preferably an internship to get experience. Finals were damn stressful but my grades ended well. Job search was frustrating, probably applied to about 20-40 different places and had a variety of interviews. Just when i thought I had two solid part time jobs lined up, I got a call from a friend of my dads saying he wanted me as a summer intern. I accepted, even though neither of us had much clue of what I would be doing and this meant I would be moving back in with my parents for the summer due to the location. This was about two weeks ago, and since I had a few things to wrap up, we agreed I would start today(the 3rd)

The week before last, even though I had done so well in abstaining, I knew I was losing it. My anxiety was overwhelming at a few times where I couldn't do anything without attacking myself with depression, doubt, and other negative feelings that led to me smoking a few nights. It did make me feel happier, less anxious , and more motivated. I went back to abstaining and had a pretty great week. I figured at that rate I could still pass a drug test if i needed to. But at the end of last week I just kinda said fuck it. My roommate and best friend was turning 21. He's been dealing for a while and for financial reasons that era is coming to a close. Being his birthday, my last weekend with my friends for the summer, and really the last time trees will be available for the whole summer, I choose to enjoy myself and some trees. 

So back to today, my first day as an engineering intern. Within the first hour filling out paperwork, they told me I have to schedule a drug test. Well shit, at least I froze some of my clean urine and might have to cheat. Upon further reading my forms, turns out its a blood test. I want to put in everything I have to succeed at this internship but I may be in over my head.

TLDR:I have been doing better with my mj addiction/habit over the last few months. I used to smoke at least a few times a day and I was able to quit for over a month. But I had a few panic attack that led me to relapse and now I have a drug test. advice?"
1fr1xx,3,2013-06-05,[Request] A current (or former) Google Student Ambassador,aubinhick990,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/1fr1xx/request_a_current_or_former_google_student/,"Hey everyone! 

I'm currently interning at Red Hat and we have this silly project as interns to research and look at other companies in our area that have student Campus Ambassador Programs. My job is to be a researcher, and the company I chose to look into is Google (because I have an unhealthy obsession with Google as it is).

It's not anything that's super secret that I'm looking for, just a basic premise of how Google runs and maintains its campus ambassador program. Basically, Red Hat is looking to develop something similar that a lot of the larger companies implement (such as Google, IBM, Oracle, Amazon, etc.)

So, if anybody has been a student campus ambassador, I'd appreciate if we could get in touch and you could tell me about the experience, how it's run, company involvement, personal involvement, how you got involved, etc. I don't have any finite questions to ask at the moment, so hopefully we can interact in the comments or via PMs. 

I want to reiterate that I'm not looking for company secrets or anything that may be covered by an NDA or something of the sort. More general information about the actual program. When I'm looking online, I don't get much information, just the splash page that has a few paragraphs about the program, but not about which students participate, at which schools, what types of events are held, etc.

Thanks a lot!

tl;dr Working on a project and need someone who's related to the Google Student Ambassador program!"
1fqvvr,6,2013-06-05,Troubles between my dad and me.,[deleted],exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1fqvvr/troubles_between_my_dad_and_me/,"This is a long one folks. To start off I'm 21 living with my parents but will be moving out within the next month. Over spring break(march) I got my septum pierced, I've had my lip pierced for about two years now and it has never really posed a problem with my family.  The night before my graduation in May my dad blew up on me about my nose ring that it's ""ugly"" and it pisses him off every time he looks at me, I tried to just blow it off and say it's not a big deal, I can take it out whenever, I guess I can just flip it up when I'm around him, I was not happy with him either way though considering he threatened to take me off their insurance, cut me from their phone plan, and take away the car I drive.(I'd totally be willing to pay for these things, he just wants to pay for them but holds them over my head) The next morning I got this email(we argue in email cause we both have bad tempers) regarding my nose ring and somehow this ties into me being inactive.
""You and I Are quite a pair.  We are so much alike in so many ways.  We both think “Why can’t you just accept me” even though we are provocative to the edge of being offensive then we are either defensive, angry, or hurt when we provoke an undesired reaction.  Yes me too, most of my life.  I’m trying to save you some trouble.
 
I appreciate your willingness to modify it so I don’t see it.  I REALLY don’t want to argue with you and REALLY don’t want to upset you.  I do love you dearly, you are one of my best friends, and yes, duh, of course you’re my daughter.
 
I do want to help you to understand a perspective, from someone who loves you and who has a lot of years of experience with provoking people. 
 
You said that ‘if people judge me for it, I don’t need them’ or something along those lines.  That will be true right up until you realize that you DO need them, or even WANT them in your life, or again need something from them to help you move forward in life, maybe your career, maybe your education, maybe finances.  And they WILL judge you.  Just like we judge when, as I said someone wears their pants down, showing their undies, or if they have tattoos all over, or piercings all over, or fat girls wear mid-drifts and have a tramp stamp on their back.  I could walk around with my pecker hanging out and say ‘if they judge me, I don’t need them’.  Right up until they fire me, I go to jail, or are forbidden from living in certain areas.
 
My point is twofold crackmama,
 
1.       People do judge, we all really do, even though we try not to, or perhaps try not at least to judge them for WHY they make their choices.  But someone may judge you for that ring all by its itty bitty little self, and with that, not hire you, not allow you to baby sit their kids, or even be near their kids because in their eyes, you could potentially have a negative influence on them.  Do you wonder why *that family you used to babysit don’t have you sit for them anymore?  They haven’t said anything but it makes me wonder.  Are THEY the kind of people who you think ‘I don’t need them’?  I don’t JUDGE you for the ring because I know you pretty well, but I KNOW others do, and If you really think you don’t need them, you are likely to find out somewhere down the line, that you MISSED out on some things because people judged you, perhaps life changing experiences.  Short version, present your BEST self so you are not TEMPTING or PROVOKING people to judge you.  It’s like the ring is picking a fight, and you are poking at people to just see if they will or won’t judge you.   That’s really unfair to them.  It’s like wearing provocative clothes, or going to a strip bar  and expecting guys to NOT think you’re not only willing, you’re advertising that you are.  Then when you say no, you’re not interested, YOU are provoking frustration, that CAN lead to violence.  Male physiology is a VERY strong drive.

 

2.        I just don’t like it.  Sorry I’m not sorry.  It is to me like the pants pulled down or the mid-drift shirt. It sends a message I THINK different than who you are, and who you want to project yourself to be.  It make me uncomfortable that you CHOOSE to present yourself that way. You are a beautiful girl, you don’t need it.  And whether you believe it or not, you are sending a message of “Yes”.  I ask you to respect my wishes to please don’t present yourself that way. Respect YOURSELF more too.  YOU are better than that.  I just don’t understand why, after all we do for you, I ask you to count it up, that you argue with, or a frustrated by my asking you to do this.  It’s such a simple thing.  It’s NOT that I don’t accept you for who you are, it’s really that I ACCEPT you for YOU, as you are, not what you wear or how you accessorize yourself.  That ring is NOT the real you, it is a choice to send a provocative message, to poke at people.  I believe that for that motive, it is childish, and that is NOT who you are.  In many ways you are more mature than any of the three of you girls.  This is not one of those ways.

 

I ask you to do it for me, AND for you, I ask you to NOT send provocative messages, people will judge you, and you will very likely miss out on something important and potentially life changing because someone may look at that one thing alone and think they don’t want to approach you because they see trouble, they see a rebel.  I don’t think that’s REALLY the message you want to send, but you are.  Please don’t misunderstand my intent.  It’s more about saving you some trouble.  I know I can’t fully control you, nor by any means do I want to, I have a hard enough time controlling myself.  Please just don’t wear it out of respect for me, AND for yourself.  You’re better than this.  

My TBM Brother in-law helped me with my response(he kinda thinks my dad is an ass so he was more than willing to help!)

1:  People judge, but they need to judge righteously.  Just because people have the natural tendency to judge on superficial things, does not justify that action.  They also need to forgive, especially that person for the sins that they have not been offended with.  What about the woman who was convicted of adultery, and Jesus drew the line and asked her potential punishers to let he who was without sin may cast the first stone.  

2: Do you want to have an actual healthy relationship?  You show your love by serving and providing, often financially.  But as I continue to grow and establish myself as an individual, I will need that help less and less.  It does not feel like true Christlike love, of a father to daughter, when you attempt to control my actions through assisting me financially, which I would assume is a way that you attempt to show love.  What do you think our relationship will be like, when I can provide for myself, even if I struggle, and I refuse your assistance or service, because it would cost me my freedom to choose?  If you want to have a relationship with me in the future, you are going to need either to quit putting expectations and stipulations on the love and help you give me, or start working on showing love in other ways.   Is your love conditional on my actions and appearance?  Is God's love conditional on those same things for you? Even when you have in the past or presently make bad decisions or sin? Does he still not love unconditionally, even if mine or your actions don't make us fully worthy of all he has to give?

3:  No choice any woman or man (because men get raped and sexually abused too) can make, will ever compensate for a lack of self control on the part of the rapist.  Men and women both have strong sexual drives, they are both super physical and sexual beings, without any attempt of self control.  Same for anger, and any other destructive emotion or human habit.  Just because we have natural instincts, it doesn't mean we have an excuse for indulging in them.  This issue is one of choice.  It is not right to think we can control others and take away their ability to choose, or to think that we solely are responsible for other peoples actions.  I could be walking around completely topless and still not be asking for it.  I could be dressed in a burka and if someone chooses to rape me, they will still rape me.  Women and men never ask for it, no matter how old or young, or if they are flirty, or dressed immodestly.  No one is ever asking to be violated and abused.  Influencing someone is a lot different than making choices for them.  How does the church view that?  

Your angry outbursts and attempts to control through giving with expectations, are not right.  They are not good.  If you are worried, fearful, stressed out or hurt, I would love for you to communicate those things, not the crap that comes up from holding all those things in for months.  I got my piercing two months ago, and you chose to bring this up now, right before I graduate and a month before I move.  You are obviously worried about me, and love me, but the way you chose to express it sucks.  And I don't want any part of this pattern anymore.  It isn't you.  It's not the you that I know and love, or the best you that you can be.  

41 No apower or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the bpriesthood, only by cpersuasion, by dlong-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;

 42 By akindness, and pure bknowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the csoul without dhypocrisy, and without eguile—

 43 aReproving betimes with bsharpness, when cmoved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase ofdlove toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;  - Note that sharpness means precision and not an excuse to be a jerk. 

I love you Dad, but the way you show love, the way you do things, and honestly some of your views need to be re-evaluated. 

We took about a 3 week break from the emails after this, I thought it was all overwith, until yesterday he came into my room and handed me a ""for the strength of youth"" pamphlet,  my head started spinning with anger, I ripped the entire thing in half, left it on his desk along with a note telling him he has no right to be an asshole for my sins(not the best move but I was furious) I went to a friends and had this email awaiting me:
I thought I’d take a stab at helping you understand my thoughts and actions.  I’ll provide some answers to that below but I’ll start here.
 
Unconditional love:  I will always LOVE you unconditionally, but you are absolutely correct that there will be conditions or consequences tied to your behavior or choices.  I will not always have the opportunity to provide those consequences but they will be there none the less.  The financial consequences I bring to the table are often typical of the life choices we make.  Many, perhaps MOST of our choices can result in financial consequences.  My intent is to help you to understand that.  You will make choices of who your friends are, how you dress, how you work, and yes your tattoos and piercings.  Like it or not, they will have consequences.  You will find that you will very likely change your choices or behaviors to meet those consequences.  You may say not now, but when something REALLY important to you comes into play, you will very likely not wear the nose ring or will cover the tat, you will be on time, be more healthy (Not sick as often), restrict your responses and sarcasm, all because the prize, or consequence is of value to you.  It’s not about conditional LOVE, it’s about conditional consequences.  That is OFTEN, almost ALWAYS how life works.   I would bet that if there were an internship available for you but they required no piercings, you ‘d make the supreme sacrifice.  
 
I simply ask you, do you respect me, do you honor me enough to respect some simple desires, which are actually not just MY desires, but behaviors that I now through many years of experience, will provide you with more favorable consequences in life? 
 
Yes, Mom and I do provide for you, and I feel like you sometimes, perhaps often, take it for granted.  I understand it, but it still is hurtful.  The “Threat” of taking away the car, insurance, a home, food, help with school, dining out, travel, etc. is NOT about conditional LOVE, it’s about obedience to some extent, respect to some extent, a showing of appreciation, a showing of honor, yes even a showing of love FROM YOU.  It’s not about the money, or control, it’s about respect for your parents.  We have given you a GOOD life, let alone LIFE.  You will have PLENTY of opportunities to do whatever you want.  But purely out of respect, as long as we do help to provide for you, I’d say what we ask of you is VERY little in return. 
 
You will ALWAYS have a choice in life, and there will ALWAYS be consequences.  Is it really too much to ask that while you’re with us, you respect our wishes (Again VERY simple expectations) without arguing, or making me feel like I’m judging YOU, I’m NOT judging YOU, but I do and will let you know when I like and dislike something and ask you to not do it or to do it.

***
**/r/washingtondc: Realm of the Week for June 5, 2013**

**Date created: May 26, 2008** 

**Subscribers: 17,146**

**[stattit page](http://stattit.com/r/washingtondc/)**

**Moderators/meetup organizers interviewed: /u/dihydrogen_monoxide, /u/BluBomber88, /u/SnarkOff, Eric, Richard.**

***
**What do you know of /r/WashingtonDC's origins - who created it? How long before it was self-sustaining?**

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** It was selected by George Washington himself and structurally designed by Pierre Charles L'Enfant. Self-sustaining? We rely a lot on people that come from everywhere else in the country. And that, my friends, is the story of how Washington and L'Enfant invented reddit.

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** Like all great inventions of man, people came together, drank ridiculous amount of alcohol, and one way or another, someone decided that a group should be created so the dwellers of the interwebs could meet others of their kind in real life. The motion was passed with Yahs and clanks of beer and years later, a couple of people has become 2700+.

**How long have you been a mod (or organizer) at /r/WashingtonDC and how did you get the job?**

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** I've been a moderator for about a year, an organizer for about 3.

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** 1 year. Had to survive countless and painful tests such as the Paddling Of The Swollen Ass...with paddles. And apparently they liked me so much that I joined the elite.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** 2 years. I was living in Baltimore and commuting down to DC for reddit meetups and I guess this impressed the overlords. Also I was probably the only girl up for the challenge. 

**How does the mod (or organizer) team work together? Do you know each other in real life?**

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** The majority of us met through the meetup group, and thus we have met each other in real life.  We usually toss a few ideas around and see what the majority consensus is.

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** Through email and IRL. I knew one of the organizers through college and eventually, I met and became friends with the rest of the crowd.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** We know each other IRL but we met through r/dc, not organically through other means.

&gt;***Eric:*** E-mail each other. We awkwardly meetup sometimes by accident.

**Have you had any meetups recently? What kind of turnout do you get?**

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** The Passport DC Meetup (I hosted this one). At most we had about 40 people that showed up and it was a smashing success. But we generally try to shoot to do about 2-3 meetups a week.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** We do meetups on average twice a week. Attendance ranges anywhere from 10 people to 140 people.

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** Scavenger Hunt, Kubb, Volunteering, Board Games, Eastern Market, Humans vs Zombies, Capture the Flag.  We range between 10 to 100 depending on the scope of the meetup.

**How active are your IRC channel and Facebook group? Do they have any impact on the subreddit?**

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** Our IRC channel is fairly active (with a the same ~10 idlers at just about all hours).  The Facebook group is pretty active and often shares many of the events that we have in the Meetup group.

**Do political events in DC have any impact on the subreddit?**

&gt;***Eric:*** Sometimes - the tourist menace is more of an annual crisis.

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** Given that we're in Washington DC, they're usually the focus of our complaints.  ""Traffic, tourists, escalefters.""

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** Political events heavily affect the locality - traffic, things to do, sequester's implication for everyone's jobs, so that gets talked about. But there are very little instances where a thread on /r/washingtondc turns into a political rager a la any news site's comment section. We tend to meetup and drink to political events like they are sporting events (State of the Union, Election Night, GOP debates, etc). And then there was the whole ""Rally to Restore Sanity"" thing.

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** We pretty much made this past election as a reason to come together and party. Easily some the funniest time I've had since joining r/DC. Who knew politics could be entertaining.

**Is there anything about being a mod at /r/WashingtonDC that is especially rewarding or satisfying?**

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** Getting interviewed by NPR was pretty cool. Another one for me personally is meeting new people that after 2 years, I consider good friends and dare I say it, family.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** We got interviewed by NPR last summer for their intern blog. And we're currently auditioning to be part of a documentary about an upcoming street race. And we spend so much time and money at one particular bar that they give us free happy hours all the time.

&gt;***Eric:*** There were perks? The other guys have been holding out on me then...

**Any posts that stand out for you?**

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** I banned memes and generated a 300+ comment threads with other subreddits brigading.  I like the cultural events posts, they're really what this city is about.  You're in an international city, experience some international events yo. 

**Any personal recommendations for things to do in DC?**

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** We have a great visitor's guide (top comment and recommendatino is written by an EXPERT on DC facts and fiction).  For all tourists/newbies, we always recommend them to check out the post.  We've been building out the wiki, but as that's a big grind.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** My favorite place in the city is Eastern Market which is a giant outdoor/indoor market, and it's surrounded by interesting shopping- like a board game store and a vinegar store. Best on the weekends. In general, there's just lots of history everywhere around you (the hotel where they conspired to kill Lincoln is now a chinese joint called Wok N Roll). Running on the National Mall never gets old.

&gt;***Eric:*** I've heard the Segway tours were nice.

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** Besides the museums, checking out a Nats or Skins team since DC has winning sports teams again.

**What's the weather like today?**

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** Minus the rain, pretty nice spring weather.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** Miserable like Congress. Cold like Nancy Pelosi's heart.

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** Lightly cloudy, better than expected!

&gt;***Richard:*** It snowed in Mid March, enough said.

**Any plans for the future? Anything you'd like to say to your readers?**

&gt;***Eric:*** Always open for new ideas, if there's something you want to do or are interested, ask.

&gt;***BluBomber88:*** We always like get input from the people to see what they to see happen with the group. We're continually growing so we tried to mix things up to keep things interesting.

&gt;***SnarkOff:*** I was thinking about asking reddit to move in with me. Guess the cat's out of the bag.

&gt;***dihydrogen_monoxide:*** Perhaps look for larger sponsors so we could host bigger/better/harder/faster/stronger events.  Thanks for reading!  To the members of /r/WashingtonDC, you know where to reach me."

Him = 26
Met him over 2 years ago.

So I met ""D"" through mutual friends a couple years ago while working an internship. We would usually end up in similar groups, and ended up adding each other on facebook. Eventually, we started chatting more and more, since we had our workplaces in common.  He started to message me more and more as months went by.

D starts looking for a place to rent and goes to a viewing for a place that he didn't end up getting. He decides that the girl giving away the place ""N"" is cute, and decides to continue to message her even after she rejected his rental offer. They talked some more and hung out, and he asked to pay for her dinner at one point. She allowed him to ONCE, then told him that she wasn't interested in dating. Here we are, 8 months later, and he's still having hopes over this girl.  I hear about how depressed he is all day, and even after I give him tons of advice (eg. ""move on"", ""she's not good for you"", ""she's not into you"") etc, he never takes it. It's the same thing everyday. ""Should I call her?"" ""She called me. I feel like shit.""  It's getting on my nerves. It's also obvious now that he likes me and thinks he has a chance with me. I got a site visit of his new workplace and we decided to get dinner. He wanted to pay. He hardly said much during dinner, and hardly ate anything. We were sitting in a tight spot, and my legs are long, so it was hard to avoid kicking things accidentally. Later that night he messages me with ""I noticed some footsie going on at dinner ;)"" ...and that's when I started to feel really uncomfortable.

Concerns:
1) He has an iPhone as his primary phone. He's paying for this himself, it's not from work or anything.  Additionally, he knows that I have a BlackBerry, and he decided to go buy one without a data plan. This way he can contact me through BBM, if I'm not responding on Facebook.
2) He's put me on some sort of pedestal. His responses indicate that he's taking it personally that I'm applying at jobs other than the company he's at (which happens to be one of the best places to work for in my area). Unfortunately I'm not a software developer or engineer like him, so I don't have the luxury of choosing where I work like he does.
3) He messages me around 10 times a day. Almost every day. If I don't reply to them after around an hour, he sends an unrelated message about something that related to me, trying to get me to respond.  It's usually really emo-like stuff, like ""'Should I call N tonight?' 'I called her. I feel terrible now.' 'She's giving mixed signals, I don't know what to do' 'I'm feeling really depressed right now' 'how come I have no luck with girls"". I mean he's mentioning depressing things about his life constantly, and it's really draining me.
4) I have NEVER hit on him, never flaunted his looks, or hinted at anything (at least that I know of).  I strictly responded to him as a mutual friend until he was showing indications of being depressed.  I was trying to be nice and support him through it. In fact, when he first started messaging me all the time, I made it clear to him that I was still seeing my ex boyfriend, and that I've had dates with other people (I was recently single).
5) I've made it clear that a guy that doesn't exercise in anyway is a deal breaker as it's one of my favourite hobbies.
6) He had a huge crush on my friend 2 years ago (this is how we met). He still occasionally mentions her, and makes comments about her new 'weird' boyfriend. She told me that he did the same thing to her, and stopped once she made it official with her new boyfriend.

I can't help but feel sorry for him, as he's clearly lonely. He's never been mean to me or anyone that I know of. But the other part of me feels like he's being manipulative and trying to guilt trip me into talking to him.  It's really draining me as I have a busy life and other friends. I don't think he has any hobbies outside of work. He never exercises or has anything else to talk about.  I've tried not responding all the time but I know he has nothing to do and tracks my facebook posts all the time, so he knows I'm ""active"".  He still messages after, usually more and more depressing things. Advice?

Thanks! 

tl;dr One of my male friends does not stop messaging me, and it's draining me mentally."

I am in my second year of my MLIS program and planning for an internship for the fall. I had something set up, but it fell through. So now I'm trying to find a new internship opportunity. I know I want to stay within the library that I already work in, but the department I was most interested in working in (Rare and Manuscripts) has not responded to my requests to meet up.

I was thinking of contacting my second choice: one of the many research librarians. Unfortunately I'm hitting a wall when it comes to ideas for research projects in this specialty.

I feel as if a LibGuide (or several) would be an option, but I don't know if it would fill enough of the time necessary to complete the internship even when combined with a little observation (150 hours).

So my question is, did any of you work with research librarians for your internships? If so, what kind of projects did you do to show your progress? 

I would like to come up with some ideas before contacting a research librarian about the possibility of an internship with them.

I am fundraising for the 2013 Kentuckiana Heart Walk.  I became involved with the American Heart Association in 2011 as an intern.  From day one i was given so many resources to research and educate myself on the importance of living heart-healthy lives.  

SInce then my passion has only grown.  I realized that i have several family members and friends who have been personally touched by cardiovascular disease and stroke.  My grandmother has high blood pressure and has experienced several strokes.  My father had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago.  My soon to be father in law also had to have heart surgery.  It is all around us!

I have also seen firsthand the people - men, women and children - that have been helped by the research and education funded  by AHA.  When i attend Heart Walks throughout Kentucky I have the opportunity to meet the real people who have been effected by these diseases - small children who have had to have heart surgery within days of their birth all the way up to grown men and women who have had to make huge lifestyle changes following a cardiovascular event. 

I am asking anyone who is able to donate to my campaign.  I have a goal to reach $700 by September.  I think with reddit's help i might be able to surpass that goal.

Being a college student, these homeless people will approach me thinking I have money to give them.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, but most of the time I don't.  Although, one homeless man has taking a liking to me in particular.

The first time I met this man was at a pizza place by the school.  It was late, maybe 10 or 10:30 at night.  The homeless man came in and  sat at my table attempting to woo me for some cash.  I listened to his story about how he used to play basketball for the school and that he has hit a rough patch in his life (a.k.a typical made up ""feel bad for me give me money"" story).  I told him I had no money for him and I'm sorry about the situation he's in, and he left angry.  I got my pizza and went to my room.

A few weeks passed before I saw the man again.  It was around 2 p.m. on a Saturday and I had been walking around campus when he stopped me on the sidewalk.  He said he remembered me from the first encounter, and that he was still looking for some cash.  I told him no, and that I was in a hurry to meet someone.  I'm walking away and he shouts ""I know who you are Jms10391.""  I pause, turn around, and ask ""how do you know my name?"" He smiles and says ""I have my ways.""  I tell him to leave me alone, and don't follow me or I'll call the cops.  We went separate ways.  

Months go by with no contact with the homeless man.  I thought I was in the clear, but I was wrong.  During the week of finals, I was walking back to my room on campus and he crosses my path again.  I put on my ""don't mess with me face"" and plan to just walk past him.  He attempts to talk to me, and I shrug him off and continue walking.  When I get past him, he shouts ""I'll see you at the arena"".  At the time, I was doing an internship for a major sports team in the city.  I stop, turn around, and shout ""who the fuck are you?!"" He smiles, again, and says ""I have my ways.""  I didn't just accept this answer this time.  I reply ""seriously, how do you know all of this?""  He keeps that obnoxious hobo smirk on his face and he says ""I live on these streets, and I know everything on these streets.""  It was clear that he wanted to bully me into giving him money, and he stuck to his story about everything.  

At this point, I reported the man.  I gave the police a detailed description of the man that very night, and they looked for him.  I have yet to hear if he had been arrested or if he's still out there.  Somehow he found out where I worked and my name without me ever mentioning it to him.  I completed my internship and I have a new job somewhere else, but I still wonder if he's out there still waiting for me.

TLDR - Homeless man finds out my name and where I work with only seeing him a few times"

My boyfriend is currently doing an internship at the IISC, where he is provided an accomodation. I'll be visiting him from France for the month of July (yeay !) but sadly, the rules of the IISC are very strict and I won't be able to stay over at his room there. 
Therefore, we are looking for furnished accomodation for a couple and very close to the IISc : for instance Mathikere, New BEL Road, Malleshwaram, Yeshtwanthpur. Our budget is from 20,000 to 50,000 INR for the month (but rather on the cheap than the expensive side). 
A hotel room for a month wouldn't be very comfortable (nor affordable ?), plus we'd really like a small kitchen if possible so a studio/1 bhk flat would be ideal (but we'll settle if needed). Yet the few service apartment we've found are quite expensive, at least 2500/night (what kind of discount can we expect for a month, by the way ?).

We would really appreciate some advice on where to look (and what to expect) for a one-month and not-so-expensive rental, and of course any connexions with interested landlords and what not :)

Thank you very much !"
1fq3yq,5,2013-06-05,To take out out private student loan or not?,clo3o5,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fq3yq/to_take_out_out_private_student_loan_or_not/,"I'm 24 years old attending the University of Miami. I've been attending for free because I got a job there straight out of high school for the tuition remission benefits. However they've since screwed us over and changed the benefits to only 15 credits per calendar year ( 2 classes in spring, 2 in fall &amp; 1 in Summer). I've reached the point where I have about 36 credits left and I can finish school by next summer if I go full for the upcoming fall &amp; sprig semester. I've also had to give up internship opportunities (including one this summer at National Geographic) because of my job.

However to attend fulltime and I will not be able to work full time and will lose my tuition remission benefits basically requiring me to pay the full 43K tuition with about half coming in from private loans. 

My other option is to remain on my job and attend school for free but it will take me at least another 2 years to graduate. My problem is that my job doesn't pay me enough right now to maintain the cost of living in Miami and there is no real opportunity for growth. I feel like I am stuck in life right now waiting to start my life while all my friends and everyone around me is already completing their masters. 



I am trying to figure out if I can take a leave of absence for the Fall semester and keep the benefits then just quit for the spring essentially cutting the loan amount in half.

I really don't know what to do. I want to finish school already but everyone regrets student debts. Is it worth sacrificing 2 more years not making good money to get a free degree at 26-27 years old or should I take out the loans and finish school already?

Any advice or personal experiences would be helpful.

I've read you try to internship after junior year, going into senior year.  This means you internship full-time for a year, and are doing schooling part time I take it.  Does that leave you to go back to school full time to complete the 150 units while working full-time? When are you able to study for the CPA exam then?-- Once you begin working?

My idea of what I should do as a transfer student starting in the fall is:

School full-time Fall 13 and Spring 14
Internship for a full year starting beginning Summer 14 (Ending beginning of Summer 15)
School full time Fall 15 and Spring 16
Finish last few classes for 150 units over Summer 16

1fp7ll,0,2013-06-04,I use my job as a measure of my self worth.,tilleyc,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fp7ll/i_use_my_job_as_a_measure_of_my_self_worth/,"TL;DR I work a lot and I'm bad with girls.

So I 26M, Scorpio (If you put any stock in that sort of thing) was one of those kids who always used their report card in school as a measure of their self esteem.  Both of my parents were educators and it was drilled into my younger sister and I about how important it was that we worked hard to succeed in school.  When I did well I felt really good about myself, and when I did poor I thought pretty poorly of myself and should some act of penance for falling short of where I thought my grades were expected to be.  

When I graduated college four years ago, when the recession hit, I took an internship with a local video production company during the nights and weekends and worked full time job at a warehouse to start paying off my student loans.  One of my coworkers found out I was a virgin (and still am) and gave a me a pretty hard time about until I left that job.  The teasing made me feel like my life was miles behind everyone else's and I need to catch up, fast.  I was working 60 hours a week and didn't have much time to really get out there and meet people.  Joined up on OKCupid and it was like opening the floodgate of dorky, overworked grad students.  Through a lot of trial and error, I hit a stride and had a new first date almost every week for a good while.  

Wound up dating this awesome girl who shared my love of kaiju monsters and bad movies.  The first time she invited me over, we had a beers and watched a low budget horror movie she had found.  We cuddled and kissed for a while and I felt this feeling of warmth in my chest.  The day after she found out that the budget for her degree program was being cut and had to transfer to a different school on the other side of the country and broke things off.  Her education was more important and I focused on making my work my top priority.

I took a job with a local television station as one of the video guys for the morning news cast.  The company I interned for wound up going under, and the flood of dates I had from the Internet turned into a drought.  Wound up reading up ""Game"" and all that to try and figure out why I was having a hard time dating.  A lot of the advice is, at best, erroneous and the rest can be summed up with ""Just ask the girl out"".  However after plowing through a few books I felt like there was this complicated song and dace that I had to go through and if I misstep or wasn't fit/confident/wealthy/successful enough, then I was just SOL.

For a while I just gave up on dating and threw myself into work.  Took a job as a radio producer for a few local stations and did a lot of freelance video editing work.  Even though I was usually pulling 60 or so hours a week, all of my jobs were either part time or I worked from project to project, and I honestly felt like just being some schmuck who was paid ten something an hour wasn't that great of a catch.  

A few months ago I took a job as the media director with a small marking company I had done some freelance work for, and felt like I was hot shit and I could really put some effort back into dating.  I had an office, a great salary, and I got to travel around the country working of different projects for the company.  Wound up meeting a vet student at a local art fair and hit things off pretty well, but a month later she had to move to another state to take a residency and we agreed it was just better to just end things.  

Last month the company I worked for had a budget cut and I was laid off.  Thankfully I still had my radio job (I got pretty used to working at least two jobs and just never left it) and through a a few emails, got a job back at the TV station I used to work for while I look for another job.  On top of that I just started doing freelance projects for the company I used to work for.  

In my head I know that I'm extremely lucky to have bounced back so quickly and that a lot of people would kill to have my kind of luck, but in my heart I just feel lonely.  I've never had much time to hang out with my friends and when I do, they're either busy with their work/girlfriends/etc.  Truth be told, I've never had a real girlfriend and I know that the only person to blame for that is myself. 

I know that sometimes that things just don't work out and that some people just wind up alone either through their own hand or circumstance, and that I won't really know I was one of those people until I die. I've seen how happy my parents a little sister are in their marriages and I want to experience that for myself too.  I want to feel that warmth in my chest again and have someone and somewhere I can let my guard down with.  But, I know that I have to first be happy with myself and with how tired and lonely I've been feeling AND my work situation, I know that I have to put finding a relationship on hold for now.

So I guess what I'm wanting to know is: What course did you take in computer science? How was your experience at OSU? How common are internships at big companies like Google? Those who may of graduated, where are you now? 

I'm also interested in what companies often hire OSU CS students. For those who aren't interested in making video games, such as myself, most have goals of making it to Google or Facebook or whatnot. Not everyone for sure, but that seems like the general census of most CS majors at my university.

We dated for about 11 months before he ended it. I was on my way there as well, things weren't great. He was too busy with graduating, end of the year project, finishing his commitments at his university, stressed about finding a job. We had talked about it before and I told him I would stand by him through the stress, because I wanted to be with him.

At this point we were hardly never having sex (he was never in the mood), only hanging out with other people, everything felt forced.

Two weeks before his graduation and birthday he came over and dumped me. He isn't the kind of guy to cry, but when he got to my apartment he already had puffy eyes before he proceeded to sit on my sofa and cry for another few hours.

He told me he needed to figure himself out, that he was young,  immature, and selfish while I was none of those things. (I'm 10 months older than him so I already have a job, my own place, and so on.) He cited things like having to move into his mom's house, how he doesn't know how to cook.

But he also said that I was the best thing that ever happened to him. How I was perfect, I didn't do anything wrong, and that I was still one of the most important people in his life. He said he wanted to be on a break, but he didn't feel that was fair to me, so if I found someone who treated me better he would understand, but he hoped we would work out someday.

After he left I cried and got wasted, figured it was time to move on and not look back. Until he texted me. Then he started texting/calling/emailing all the time—more than when we were together. We had already bought expensive (for us) tickets for a show that was happening a couple weeks after we broke up, so we decided to still go. That has been one of the nest nights of my life so far, and yeah...I'm weak, we hooked up and he stayed the night. 

Things kept going on like this until finally after one of our meetups I asked him to talk to me in the car and told him I couldn't do this. I cried my eyes out telling him he was there more for me now than when we had been technically together, that I wanted to be with him but if he didn't feel the same I needed NC to move on. He said he had to work on himself before he could work on someone else, but when I asked if we were done he said ""I don't know, I can't say we are because I could change my mind on Friday or in two weeks or in three years. I don't know.""

A week later he starts talking to me, and I am too weak to resist. We also have nearly all the same friends, so us not talking was affecting everyone we knew. 

Other things to note: While we were still dating I got him a summer internship in my office. I know, I know, but I already did it. So he's here now. A lot.

His family was starting to pressure him about marrying me, but neither of us are ready for that.

His friends/family keep pestering him about me, without me doing anything, because they say he is a much better person with me. Lame, I know.

He still texts me pretty much every day and we have met up to hang out a few times.

I miss him so much and I can't stop thinking about him. How am I supposed to move on when we work in the same place/have the same friends/he still wants to stay in touch with me? And what if I don't want to move on, do I have any chance of getting him back? He said yesterday again that the reason he broke it off was because he needed to figure some things out about himself and he still does.

**tl;dr: ex says he can't date anyone right now because he needs to figure things out about himself, still wants me in his life, do I have any chance of getting him back?**"

Nope.... never mind,mindfood84,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1fspwf/call_911_nope_never_mind/,"I've worked in retail loss prevention nearly my entire adult life.  When asked to tell a tale from my experiences, I usually share this one.

In the summer of 2006 I was working at a big box retailer as an undercover associate that catches shoplifters.  I was fortunate that one of my best friends, let's call him 'Davis' had gotten me into the job after I completed my management internship, which I hated.  I show up to work a closing shift and Davis had already been there for a couple of hours working a mid.

Davis called me and asked me if I had arrived yet and that he was on a follow that was going to turn into an arrest.  This crackhead of a female had concealed handfuls of clothes and DVD's into a tote bag and was heading towards the exit on the side of the store where we had an oil change and tire service shop.  He tells me I've got about thirty seconds before she gets out the door.  I sprint to the back of the store from our office and get there as he's making contact with her right outside the exit doors going into the parking lot.  She starts screaming and resisting immediately so Davis grabs her midsection and I put her left arm into a hold and we start bringing her toward the ground (was frowned upon but our boss was all for that sort of thing).  She's still screaming and making threats after about fifteen more seconds of trying to control her.  Davis moves to get her other arm so we can put her in a full arm bar and walk her back to our office from the back of the store.  

So she's on her knees in an arm bar and she suddenly stops screaming and her head drops down.  I hear ""ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh...."" and she starts seizing.  I looked at Davis and said ""We've got a problem."" and screamed for one of the tire service guys to call 911 because I think this chick is having a heart attack or a seizure from the altercation.  I'm thinking about how I'm going to lose my job and face criminal charges because this crackhead died while I was holding her on the ground.  She stops seizing and looks up.  I say to her ""Ma'am, are you okay.""  She says in the calmest voice ever ""I shit myself.""  **God. Damnit.**

So she's so embarrassed that she shit herself that she stops resisting.  We stand her up to walk her back to the front of the store and what looks like large rabbit pellets are falling out of the bottom of her shorts, which barely came up to the bottom of her ass.  She clearly wasn't wearing underwear and her shorts were this super thin sweatpant material that was sagging from the mass dumped into them.  We walked her back to the booking room and she's dropping these rabbit pellets all the way there.

The total for the merchandise was upwards of $400, which is usually a state charge where we were and required a visit to central booking.  PD gets there and cuts her a municipal for retail theft and tells her to get lost because they don't want to deal with her shitty self.

**TL;DR - Crackhead thief has seizure while resisting arrest, turns out she's shitting herself and then leaves a trail of poop throughout the store.**

1fsocs,6,2013-06-06,Very worried about my (M21) friend (M22). I want to try to help him.,Friendinneed44,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fsocs/very_worried_about_my_m21_friend_m22_i_want_to/,"
For the last 5 or 6 months I have been spending a lot of time with my, now, closest friend. We met just after I started college. 

About two months ago, he expressed to our friend group that he has been dealing with depression.

He moved to my area just before he started high school. Before then, he lived in two other states. Essentially, he had a good home life, but was forced to move a lot. This seems to be an underlying problem.

From what he has told me, a big factor in his condition is never having had any romantic life. According to him, no one has ever liked him. Obviously, this isn't true, but no one has expressed their feelings towards him. He's a very personable, funny, and endearing human being. Loads of individuals less attractive than him have gotten girlfriends. This has aided in crippling his self esteem.

It was about the time he revealed his depression, that he also made us aware that at least once in his life he has considered suicide.

Soon after, I noticed that he started drinking alone. It started very infrequently and I tried to be there with him whenever possible. Unfortunately, I am away in an internship now. We text daily. The last two nights he has gotten drunk alone at his apartment.

I'm worried, because of his potential path to alcoholism. More importantly, I'm worried he'll move to taking his own life.

All I know to do, is to attempt to introduce him to the free campus counseling. However, I've no idea how to go about that. I've told him I'll be there for him to talk to, whenever he needs it.

What else should I do?

tl;dr: friend is depressed, drinking alone, and in the past had thought about suicide.

1frz4w,3,2013-06-06,[Critique] Room 16 (ex-post /r/nosleep),littletoasterwhocan,WritersOfHorror,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1frz4w/critique_room_16_expost_rnosleep/,"Every room was 16.

That was the dream she woke up to on her last night at home. Every single room was 16. She had absolutely no idea what that meant, but it had still scared the hell out of her. 

Layla left the next day for New York. She was going to be an actor. She had an internship and everything. It payed nothing and she would have to work another job and live in some shit-hole motel, but that was fine with her. What was important was that she was going.

The drive from Normal, IL to New York was not a pleasant one. She had driven 7 consecutive hours, and after an hour rest, her sister drove another seven hours. Layla was dropped off at the cheapest motel in the least dangerous neighborhood they could find.

I never heard the conversation, but I'm sure it went something like this: 

Sister – ""Are you sure you'll be ok?""

Layla – ""Stop worrying! I'll call home every day!""

Sister – ""Mom will be worried sick.""

Layla – ""I'm 18. She can't control me anymore.""

Sister – ""Just be careful, okay?

I'm sure this was followed by a tearful goodbye as Layla's sister drove off into the night. I'm sure Layla doubted herself as she walked to the rundown motel. I am most definitely sure she was caught off guard by the kindly old man behind the counter of the motel. 

This conversation, I remember word for word.

""Looking for a place to spend the night?"" the cheery old man said, his blue eyes alight.

""A little more than a night, thank you,"" she replied, relieved to find such a slender old man in place of a fat, greedy crook. 

""Here's your key. Don't go in room 16,"" the old man said in a matter-of-fact way.

Layla was caught off guard. Her dream echoed in her mind, but her longing for sleep made her resist the urge to ask why. It was probably just a coincidence. Someone probably just wanted privacy, or the room was under repair, or that's where this psycho keeps the bodies.

She erased the last thought from her brain and went to her room, 19, and collapsed on the bed. She had no dreams of room 16.

The next days she spent looking for a part-time-job to pay for her palace. Her sister, I assume, was paying for the first few days.

She could not afford an apartment, but her laptop was a necessity. I cannot say that I don't sympathize.

She only left the motel for fast food. It was all she could afford. Her conversation with the old man was the same every time she walked back in the motel.

Old man – ""Nice day?""

Layla – ""Could be better.""

Old man – ""Well, have a good one.
                   
              Don't go in room 16.""

By the third day of only leaving her room for fast food, Layla found a job as a waitress. How stereotypical. The actress-waitress combo. She left for her first day and returned exhausted. Her conversations with the old man went as usual. 

Her internship started the next day and her exhaustion must have doubled or tripled. I'd like to imagine she began to give up hope, but knowing Layla, she probably thought it would all work out in the end. Always so hopeful and optimistic.

I'll take a guess and say that's when the dreams started. Every night was the same. It was the motel she was staying in. Every room was 16. Cold sweat and panic became her morning routine. 

She began to keep a diary to, in her words, "" to calm [her]self down."" I have absolutely no idea how reliving a chaotic and exhausting day calms someone down, but to each their own.

The conversations with the old man were the same now, and she had grown too accustomed to them by now to question about the infamous room 16. There were other occupants in the motel, and they all got the same treatment. She, however, was the only regular. No one, that she saw, ever entered or left room 16. 

That she saw.

She could hear the old man's voice in the dreams now. Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16. Over and over again until it drove her from fear to anger, in her dream-state. 

In her dream, she finally put her hand on the knob. It melted to her skin. It sucked her in, absorbing her body in agonizing increments as the old man's voice mockingly repeated, ""Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16."" 

She snapped.

""What's in there anyway?"" Layla questioned the kindly old man.

""Well..I–"" The old man's stutter indicated he clearly was not going to answer. 

She ran past him, straight to room 16. She was about to try the knob, but must have recalled something that resembled her manners and pounded loudly on the door. 

There was no answer.

""Get away from there!"" The old man was in a panic. He was not angry. I don't think he's capable of anger. 

Layla remembered herself. ""Sorry. I...I was just curious.""

""It's–It's all right,"" he said. ""Just take my word on it. There is nothing in there for you.""

Nothing. Nothing at all.

That night, she crept through the silent hallway of rooms to the number 16. The old man was asleep, at least she thought, and no one was there to stop her from opening that door. Her hand turned around 16 and she triumphantly discovered it was unlocked. The doorknob was cold. Cold and grey. It was the kind of unforgiving cold that only a winter day without snow could possess. It was a deep grey like the sky on those unforgivable winter days and no reflection of her face shown off it, as it did with the doorknob to her own room. It creaked impossibly loud as she turned it. She opened the door. She was speechless. What was held inside room 16 was not possible. It was unbelievable. She saw–

She saw–

Well, I don't know that yet. That last paragraph, that's just how I imagine it happening. My name is– Well, I don't think you need to know that. I'm just a story to you. But I'm real. I type this because I am excited to find out what I will become. The kind of excited where you cannot keep your glee in and must share it. The kind that makes you giddy with anticipation. 

But I am patient. Paying the old man to tell no one of my existence in room 16 was easy. He added the ""[d]on't go in room 16"" thing himself. I thought it was stupid at first, but it's grown on me. I like the old man. He's kind, compliant, and most importantly, he doesn't ask questions. 

It didn't have to be the actor/waitress three doors down. It could have been anyone. But she was the only regular in the shit-hole. I've never laid eyes on her, but I'm sure she's beautiful. Her diary was a great read. 

She'll decide what I become, within reason, I've decided. If she writes that I'm a serial killer, I'm a serial killer. If she says I'm a kindly young man with a handsome face and a tragic past, I'll be that. If I'm empty, I'll pack up and leave. The gamble is such fun. Her stories of what I am get more fantastic and horrible with each new entry into the little black diary of hers. I will not disappoint her.

I am insane. I know that. But sanity is not only relative, but also overrated. And I am more than just insane.

I am room 16. 

She will open me soon."

1frudk,2,2013-06-06,I [21f] want my LD bf [21M] to spend more time with me since he has no job or classes this summer.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1frudk/i_21f_want_my_ld_bf_21m_to_spend_more_time_with/,"We have been dating for three years. We are long distance during the school year and only get to see each other for a weekend or two every month. We usually spend the summers close by each other, since our families live near each other. My boyfriend lives with his parents year round and commutes to college. We usually see each other every evening and night during the summer and winter. We cook dinner together and then just hang out most nights.

I am at my university this summer because I am doing research in a laboratory (so that I will be able to get into graduate school), so we are long distance at the moment. My boyfriend does not have a job, an internship, nor school to attend this summer. He is just playing video games, basketball, and going to the gym. 

I have been living alone in the apartment for the last month because my roommates are away for the summer. 99% of my friends are either gone or taking classes and working and are therefore too busy to hang out with me. I am incredibly lonely here since my job only lasts about 1.5 hours per day, then I am left to try to find something to occupy my time with. I asked my boyfriend to come stay with me more often (longer than three days at a time every now and then) and he said ""it's not that i don't like staying with you, i just need my space"". I'm pretty crushed because I am always wanting to stay with him at his parents' house whenever I am free of work. He only has free time to do whatever he wants, and yet he decides he'd rather stay 100miles away from me and bum around. 

My friends that have been dating for this long are pretty much all living together, practically living together, engaged, or planning on getting engaged. I want to at least pretend that my boyfriend is my live-in partner for some time this summer. There are 2.5 more months before classes start. I feel like this relationship is not progressing. My boyfriend is not interested in being around me for more than three days at a time. 

I told him that it really hurt when he said he likes having his space and doesn't want to spend so much time with me, since he doesn't have any responsibilities. I told him that I at least wanted to make a schedule of when he would be down here, since I love having something to look forward to, and he was upset that I was acting controlling of his life. 

I'm just wandering if I should press this issue, since I am usually the one who caves and lets it go. Things are usually okay when we just go with the flow and end up deciding when we will see each other a day or two in advance. I'm not being too controlling or asking too much of him, am I? I'm guessing he's just going to miss being around his friends and the people he tends to play basketball with. He really likes his local gym, too. Am I being selfish for wanting to be put above those things?

TL;DR: Long-distance boyfriend of three years has no job, internship, or classes this summer. He is just hanging out and having a good time.  I'm working in a lab (for 1.5 hours a day) at university and basically have no friends here. I want SO to come stay with me for more than a few days at a time, possibly 1-2 weeks at a time. SO says he needs his space and doesn't want to be here with me that often. I'm lonely and crushed. "

Maybe once I tell someone, even anonymous strangers on the internet, I'll be more inclined to help myself.

Accidentally cut myself on the side of my thumb really bad while fixing a computer for someone last night (really my only marketable skill) and it really fucking hurts. It still keeps opening itself up and bleeding again as I type this an an assignment due last Monday.

Got really sunburned today because I figured ""Well, shit I'm whiter than sour cream.  If I go work without sunscreen today I might not look like someone who hasn't left their bed in 5 years.""  I know that was stupid.  I knew it was stupid while I was doing it.  Now half of me is red and painful and the other half is untouched and it just adds irritating physical pain to the whole mix.

The crux of the issue lies with my inability to pull myself up by the balls and do what I want.  Let's have some backstory.  I went to a laughably small private school from 4th-8th grade where me and pretty much 2 others were the smartest people in our grade.  I've always had sheer ""intelligence"" working for me since I've been a bank of useless knowledge my whole life.  For some reason people are envious of this.  I went through this middle school in a class of basically 16 kids total.  I lived a half an hour away from the school so there were only a few friends (all male) that I'd ever really have out of school interaction with.  This was fine, or so I thought until I got to high school.  I realize that since I was never interested in any of the girls in my class I never tried anything, did anything, or even entertained the idea of dating any of them.  None of us did.  I never developed any ""game.""  This, combined with always being a awkward (but not overly so, still greatly accepted by others) overweight kid (In all realism, I look decent.  Definitely above average Walmart level of physical appearance, I just rarely let myself believe it) for pretty much my entire life has really set me back.

Fast forward to a public high school.  My freshman year I still had no game.  I was pretty much in the top 5 scoring kids in my grade.  My weighted rank was 9, but that's because others were in Academic Challenge programs that I was never really offered/aware of since I wasn't in the school district for the past 4 years.  I was pretty much an academic boss.  I felt accepted and encouraged by teachers and students.  I was in a new kind of program for the state that pretty much had all schooling done in a project based setting in groups.  Since I was still a pushover sellout pussy, I did the work for pretty much the entire group with every project.  Now, the teachers understood and my grade reflected it, so I was really only pissed at the freeloaders.  I still realize how much I enjoyed the ""spotlight.""  I, along with 2 other students, were paraded to show the success of the program.  Everyone knew that was bullshit, but I enjoyed the attention.  I soon settled into what could be called ""fame.""  Of course I was just being used, but I didn't mind much.  That freshman year molded me into a 'yes man.'  Since I was receiving attention from other people I still never devoted any time to the pursuit of any semblance of a girlfriend.  As I type this I realize I'm basically an introvert that loves being the center of attention, and I kind of feel shitty for that.

This 'yes man' attitude has taken me places, don't get me wrong.  I am a member of a few school clubs but those don't really matter.  I'm not cut out for sports because of my build and I'm not really interested in them anyway, which I've caught some flak for.  How dare a dude not care about sports!  But whatever.  The big things I've been a part of include speaking in front of 400+ people at a college at a presentation about education, being a part of the planning for that presentation, and being invited to speak at an even bigger presentation of the same topic but it got cancelled due to bad weather.  There are like 3 other things of the same magnitude I've done but my head's a bit foggy right now and I can't remember them.

Lots of people have expressed to me how envious they are of my abilities.  I get it that lots of people hate public speaking and that it comes naturally to me.  But I hate it.  After all of this, all the time, all the effort, all the free publicity to the groups I represent, all I got was a few Subway sandwiches and $25.  My parents tell me that it's okay, since I'm getting exposure and a lot of people know about me and respect me.  I'd love to pay a car payment with respect, though.

Now I've been suckered into an internship (read: free labor) position with some guys that run a web show.  I like working with them.  I like doing the work I do with them.  It's the 'yes man' attitude that got me there.  It might turn into real employment at some point and I hope it does.

This shit is what happens when you don't have the fucking balls to say 'no' to people.

Now I switched programs at the school and am in a very high level set of courses with about 20 other people.  Since I'm a sophomore, I'll be with these people for the next two years.  This year I realize how pathetic I ultimately am.  I've gotten to know my peers.  They're good people.  We enjoy each other's company.  We're all a little quirky.  I'm still in the top 3-5 in the class, but that's slipping as the year ends too.  I'm tired of work (but it's the same 'yes man' attitude that got me into the most work in any program in the district (and maybe state too.)

Now, for the past month or two this girl and I have been mutually attracted to each other.  Everyone fucking knows.  If asked straight up I wouldn't deny it, although she might.  Earlier in the year I said to myself ""Yeah, I'll ask her out before the end of the year.""  Well, the end of the year is practically here.  I've given no more thought to the matter, really.  What seems simple to most is completely foreign to me.  Kind of the opposite of public speaking, technology work, and all that shit.  One of my friends asked me today ""So when are you going to ask xxx out?"" and I kind of shrugged it off and said ""I dunno, sometime.""  I know right here and right now that's a lie.  It's pretty much been decided by the whole class that we might as well be dating, fucking, and all that.  I'd like this.  I'm 99% sure she would as well.  

But I realized today that when he asked me this question is that...  I really can't just go up and do...  Whatever I need to do.  For the last 3 weeks I've been feeling lonely as shit while knowing it's nobody's fault but my own, there's no ""nice guys finish last"" or ""friendzone"" bullshit right here, I'm just a straight up pussy who can't take the initiative to put things in motion to get what I want.  The worst part is that I KNOW, FUCKING 100% KNOW that she would accept and we would actually have something.  Maybe then I wouldn't stay the stupid virgin loser that I am.  I just....  Don't know how to kick myself in the ass to go say ""Hey xxx, let's go see a movie"" or ""You free this weekend, there's an airshow at the beach and I'd love to take you.""  I don't know what causes me to feel this way.  It could be any combination of physical attractiveness (she definitely is better looking than me), my shitty 5.5"" dick, a fear of a nearly impossible rejection, I have no idea.  I have no problem talking to her, or ANYONE, and can carry on a conversation about tons of topics.  I just can't do this which is what really counts.  I think the worst part is that I'll even drive her home if she misses the bus or some shit and still can't bring myself to initiate anything further.  Actually, never mind.  It's the fact that some of my friends think that I'm asexual and I'm pretty sure my parents think I'm gay.  Obviously nothing's wrong with being gay, but clearly I've never brought home a potential mate to convince them otherwise.  That probably is what makes me feel the most shitty.

I'm ending my sophomore year in a week...  I'm ending it a lonely virgin kissless loser.  The people who envy me have no idea how much I'd love to be them.  They're going to be the ones who win at life, not me who will die lonely and working for free.

Wow, that was a lot longer than it should have been, but I guess I feel a little better.  If you made it all the way down here you have a better attention span than I.

TL;DR:  I sit here with a cut thumb, bad sunburn, unfinished overdue essay, loneliness, an inability to say no to people who want me to do things, and an even worse inability to initiate a relationship with anyone, even when it's basically guaranteed."
1frdw5,4,2013-06-05,Player Development,chl_tkfkd,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1frdw5/player_development/,"I'm currently an intern in the Player Development department at the PGA of America Headquarters. It's a pretty exciting time with programs such as Golf Get Ready and Junior PGA Leagues finally taking foot in the golf industry. However, the numbers are way lower than forecasted 

Here's a brief overview of our situation: the PGA of America recognized that something had to be done about the dropping number of golfers (new and retained) partly due to the economy, but mostly due to the more bottom-lined oriented path the industry had started to take. So our beloved COO, Darrell Crall, spearheaded a much needed golf ""revolution"" by the name of Golf 2.0 about two years ago. With this revolution came along 4 programs including the two I mentioned above, Tee-It-Forward, and PGA Sports Academy all aimed to promote the growth of the game of golf. 

I can bet money that almost none of the you guys have heard or know much about these programs. And this is where our problem is. 

And I thought who better to bring this up with than the most golf-crazed people on the internet?

The PGA spends millions of dollars and man-hours trying to advertise and reach out to golf courses to let them know about these programs. They're completely free (hell, we even paid some facilities to run these them), have potential to generate significant revenue for head pros, and they're actually FUN. (I won't go into detail about how each program works, but you can check them out here if you want  http://www.playgolfamerica.com/). 

Almost two years worth of data show that our efforts haven't produced as much fruit as we had hoped. We've sat around and brainstormed for hours, but can't seem to reach an ""ah-ha"" conclusion. So I am here to ask you guys what motivates (or motivated) you to pick up your club? Do you agree or disagree with anything I've said attaining to the golf industry as a whole? Where and how do you think we should market these products so that PGA members (and first time golfers) could actually SEE how fricken awesome they really are?

1frd5c,1,2013-06-05,HELP - My metabolism is dead! What can I do!?!,[deleted],keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1frd5c/help_my_metabolism_is_dead_what_can_i_do/,"Okay guys! Let me start off by saying I love keto and I wish I could still do it but I just can't do it anymore. I am off and on my diet because I am a pharmacy student/I work part time as well as intern and maintain my social life on top of everything. I try to eat low-carb to keep my weight low but I'm always falling off the wagon with everything going on around me. I'm a stress eater and i also give into my friends with social gatherings going on every week. 

Let me give you some background - ill make it short.
I am 5'1 and currently 161 lbs.
In high school I was over 200 pounds and I lost my initial weight on the HCG diet when it first came out. It was great. I was down to 142 lbs (my lowest weight) and crept back up to 150 or so. I tried keto when I found it on here and ever since then my weight has been up an down (between 142-155). This last semester of school has brought me back up to  my highest weight ever since I lost weight! I'm a short girl so I feel horrible and I can't even fit into any of my clothes comfortably.

Even though I love keto, I have realized it has never brought me past my 142 to get to my unknown goal - :(. Also, every time I fall off the wagon I simply gain all the weight back in a matter of a day or two. I can't do it anymore.... please help me.

I do want to start doing insanity again, however I know that I need a diet to go along with it. My metabolism is so bad that every carb I eat results in a pound added to my body. I don't know what to eat or  how to improve my metabolism. I just want to eat normal foods. I was really looking forward to going back to school looking healthy. Any suggestions?"

I'm halfway through my joint Bachelor of Business Administration/Computer Science degree and, being the planner that I am, I'm exploring future career/school paths. Thanks to a co-op (kind of like internships) program, I'll be graduating virtually debt-free and with a just-about guaranteed job. One of my options is getting an MBA, but I don't know how useful it would be content-wise considering I'll already have the BBA, and I don't know if having the piece of paper will be worth the extra money/time for my potential employers.

This is thinking years into the future, so I'm not making any decisions yet - just wondering how much time I should put into considering this option. Thanks!"
1frbc9,1,2013-06-05,I got dehydrated.,[deleted],C25K,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/1frbc9/i_got_dehydrated/,"First, a little background about me. I got a job this summer as an intern so I've been drinking a lot of coffee to help wake me up. On top of that, I'd drink about 3 cans of soda and took a caffeine pill each day. I was on my off day after finishing W7D1 and I have never failed a day and it has been relatively easy. My allergies started to act up and my eyes were really swollen, I was also really tired. I went to the clinic and the doctor begun to treat it as a bad allergic reaction and gave me medicine and sent me home. Later that night, I begun to have chest pain so I immediately went to the ER. They ran a few tests and determined that I was dehydrated. My body was in the process of shutting down. I didn't think that was possible but the doctor said due to my training and a combination of a large amount of caffeine, my body didn't have enough water.

So a word of advice to all new runners, be sure to drink plenty of water! I also plan on running after this weekend, once my body has fully recover."

Disclaimer: this post will probably sound really immature to many because our physical relationship doesn't go past kissing and necking sometimes.  If you think this is lame kid stuff, that's fine, but it's not to me and I am in desperate need of advice.

That being said, in the past me and my bf have always been very physically attracted to each other.  There's been multiple times that things have gotten too intense and we could have slipped up, but luckily we both have pretty good self control.  

So, in the first few months of our relationship, we'd makeout at least once a week if not more, couldn't keep our hands off of each other.  My boyfriend is a lot more of a touchy person than am I, especially at first, but I've become more touchy the longer we've dated.  Lots of hugs, kisses, normal boyfriend/girlfriend stuff.  Then we had some rockier times around December and January and were physical on and off.  Since then it's been relatively consistant (sometimes we'd go in waves of getting really physical every day of the week and then no making out for a couple).  Anyways, this summer I went away for a couple weeks and my bf was being cute and touchy with me before I left, but we didn't makeout before I left, which I thought was kinda weird.  And then when I got back we kinda did, but nothing close to what my expectations were.  

Now we've had about a month together since I got back and we're both about to leave for internships, and we haven't madeout at all.  Like nothing, except for one time and I had to initiate it 100% and he didn't seem super into it.  This whole week up until I'm leaving I've been getting home like 15 minutes after midnight and even though he keeps up the compliments and cute texts - still no sexytimes.  Not even an inkling.

I'm fully aware that I have a very active sex drive and I can't expect someone to keep up at my exact....pace?  But it's gotten to the point where I think it's weird and it's messing with my self-esteem (something I've never had a problem with before).  There was probably a month or so where I was thinking about being with him all the time, hoping he'd start something with me but now, I've like lost all hope and don't even think about it anymore.  

I've brought this issue to the table once before and he was just like, ""I tell you you're cute all the time, I'm always pulling you closer, I don't know why you're feeling this way at all.""  So I feel like if I bring it up he'll dismiss my feelings.

I don't know if this is happening because 

*  our relationship has plateaued and he's over it
*  instead of getting more attached he's detaching himself from me because I'm leaving
*  this is what happens when you've dated someone for more than 3 months (this is my first 3+ month relationship)
*  he's depressed (he's tired all the time and is having to deal with a lot of adult decisions right now, he's got anxiety and ADD so I know it's a lot for him to handle)

I seriously need help.  I don't know what to do, I'm a pretty low-maintenance gf, I've got my shit together, and I take care of myself physically.  I'm an independent girl who don't need no man *but also* I love him and don't want to just chuck the relationship out the window or *more likely with our situation* say we'll date long distance and then promptly watch the relationship vanish into thin air.  

*TL;DR*: Boyfriend of 10 months seems physically uninterested in me before a long separation. "
1fvsr3,16,2013-06-07,Disagreement between two pharmacy employees on how to fill this script - what would you do?,[deleted],pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/1fvsr3/disagreement_between_two_pharmacy_employees_on/,"I am an intern (and a technician, I was a tech before getting my intern license and my registration is still current) who ran into this prescription the other day.

The doctor wrote for 240ml of a liquid with the directions to take 30 ml daily with no end date and no refills.

We only have the 473ml bottle size and don't break them up, so I added a stop duration of 8 days to the directions so the patient would know to stop.

The other technician who saw me filling it told me that I should take the 8 days off and not specify anything because we don't know how long the doctor wanted them to use it for. I argue that by putting a specific quantity and directions, that he is specifying (much like 20 pills, bid, clearly that is 10 days without having to say so).

Anyway, the pharmacist wasn't really picking a side and let me keep my 8 days on there, but the technician refused to see that we were inadvertently doubling the duration by not informing the patient.

What do you think about this situation?"

I recently took a big step in my life with my single parent mother and moved from Georgia to Florida, to find a new life for us due to some hardships we faced in Georgia that i'm not going to go into full detail here because it will be too long here. So I basically have started my whole life over from scratch since I have never really lived anywhere else, but I did not leave much behind, cause I only had one real friend in Georgia, that I still keep in touch with anyways. A major factor being that my whole high school years, have been online schooling, due to medical problems that started to come up right when I hit puberty (great timing right?). So it does not really help that i'm not in a place where I have not been able to meet any kids my age. I have tried all kinds of things to get out there and involved and meet other kids, all with honestly no success whatsoever due to varied reasons. The only friends I have been talking to are either online, or keeping in touch with that one friend from Georgia on the phone. Other than that, I am feel extremely isolated honestly, and it only makes it harder that my mother has to work her ass off just to keep us afloat, and I have been even trying to do something part time, volunteer, intern even, anything really. I even tried seeing if any of my online friends lived in my area, but the only ones that lived even close, lived way WAAAAY south Florida while I live in the more northern area. It's now summer and it has just gotten to the point where I feel like i'm waking up doing the same thing everyday, even when I try to change things up in my daily routine. 

What I'm trying to say is I guess i'm looking for maybe some new online friends that I can hang out with, and If at all possible, maybe start meeting up IRL and stuff like that because my online friends can get as close to like brother to me but, I just need a friend I can vent, hang out and talk to face to face, even though I have been through all this I still like to be optimistic, even though I can be cynical at times. 

I guess this is where I list a bit about me so...

- I'm a big movie buff and I love the art of film, I wish to get into it someday

- I'm a Pokemon nut and I just recently got back into it, i'm also into playing other video games as well, though I have fallen out of gaming recently

- I love the shit out of Doctor Who (though i'm still in the 10th series)

- Music is a big part of my life and I usually always am listening to something, some favorite artist include Pink Floyd, Green Jelly, Queen, Daft Punk, Wavves, Biggie Smalls, Lupe Fiasco, Madeon, Frank Zappa, and etc

- Personality wise i'm pretty open minded, optimistic, brtually honest at points, I love to listen to others so I would no mind if anyone vented to me

- I like to talk about really serious things as well such as Religion or Politics (I'm Agnostic and Independent BTW)

- Other hobbies of mine are reading, experimenting in making song mashups, Walking on the Beach, swimming

- I also love watching Basketball (Big Miami Heat Fan)

Well I have pretty much written my life story here lol, sorry if it was long but I really needed to reach out for someone and just vent a little. I don't have any preference to gender here, though I would like the age to be at least a little around mine, ESPECIALLY if we are gonna meet and hang out later on. Thank you for reading this :)

I'm currently a rising Sophomore (going to be Junior) at a state school majoring in software engineering. I'm working an internship this summer and will be making about $5000 after tax over the summer, food and housing is paid. I've got scholarships covering tuition, and family college fund covering housing and books - so my overall expenses in college are basically food, alcohol, and gas. 

I've got about $1,100 in a CD rocking like a .65% rate (it's gained 10% over like 12 years now?) and I was wondering if it's a logical investment to pull that out and invest in myself - getting a mac to self-teach iOS development. Mobile development is what I want to do post-graduation. Should I just go for a Mac now and teach it to myself or wait til I actually have a career and I'm out of college to do it?

I've had some poor foresight with technology purchases (deciding that extra $20 wasn't worth it for 720p -&gt; 1080p) so I'm just looking for advice. Is there something better I could invest it in now for retirement's sake down the line that would make more sense? "

**Mighty Avengers**

* Starting in September, it's Mighty Avengers, by Al Ewing and Greg Land, featuring the likes of Luke Cage, Spider-Man, She-Hulk, White Tiger, Blue Marvel, Power Man...and more!

* ""Mighty Avengers is launching in the midst of Infinity. It's a pretty key component. The gist of the opening story is that the Avengers are off in space dealing with the Builders and in their absence, Thanos comes to Earth. A number of other characters rise up and join together to oppose to what's going on, arraying themselves around Luke Cage. 'If the Avengers aren't here, we're the Avengers.'"" - Tom Brevoort


* You won't need to read *Infinity* to understand *Mighty Avengers*

*  The Falcon and a new Ronin will also be part of the book.

*  ""Greg Land has never done an Avengers ongoing series. He was looking for a new challenge and has a really exciting, really polisher super hero art style. His characters all have weight and presence. He can do action and storytelling. Al is writing this book classic Marvel style, plot-art-script, so Greg is getting to flex some storytelling muscles."" - Tom Brevoort

* ""I take these characters' fan followings very seriously. I've never been a big fan of A-list, B-list, C-list. You never tell a firefighter he's a C-list firefighter. I hadn't heard of the Blue Marvel before this assignment and I've kind of fallen in love with him. He's powerful, but also multi-faceted. He's almost the opposite of the Sentry. He thinks and cares very deeply about everything he does."" - Al Ewing

* Greg Land will be back briefly on *Iron Man* - more news regarding that soon.

* ""The racial diversity of the line-up is no accident, really. I've always responded to people asking why we don't have a black Avengers or Latino Avengers that it feels artificial. But, the reality is that people who want to see characters in comics representing them have a point. We first started conceptualizing this book in February around Black History Month and the anniversary of the death of my friend Dwayne McDuffie. So I set out not to do 'Black Avengers' but more Dwayne McDuffie Avengers. I wanted to have a minimum of non-white characters but not have that necessarily be the point, then a lot of the characters who fit into what we wanted to do ended up being minorities. It's not a 'solution' to lack of diversity elsewhere, but it's something we considered."" - Tom Brevoort

* ""This is a team that initially comes together out of necessity because the world is in jeopardy and the guys who would usually step up to the plate are otherwise occupied. Thereafter, personalities gel and a framework begins to evolve that defines the goals of the team, their vision, their work. The cast will evolve beyond these nine characters."" - Tom Brevoort

* ""It's a classic free form Avengers team like you would have seen in the 70's or 80's."" - Tom Brevoort

* ""I've never worked the Marvel Method before, and it turns out I love it. There's a lot of dialogue, but I want to give Greg the freedom to interpret the plot how he will. Every time I get a new page I get quite excited. It's a lot of fun to write. I think it's page 2 of issue #1 with the Plunderer where I wrote a bit of a rant for him. It's going to be one of my top 10 all-time rants."" - Al Ewing

* ""I like mixing comedy and drama. You can't have all grim and serious all the time, you need to have some humor beats to lighten the mood. Similarly, you need some dramatic beats to comedy to give it weight and purpose and sell the emotions."" - Al Ewing

* ""There will almost certainly be some sort of terrifying hidden mountain in this book. Possibly an orbiting boardroom? I'm making it up a bit on the fly. They will be going outside New York. I'm thinking of who they will be fighting. And with the Blue Marvel around, we will see the bottom of the ocean's deepest trench occasionally."" - Al Ewing

**Luke Cage**

* ""With Luke having a kid now and having quit the Avengers before, he's no longer the first one in the line of fire always, but he is taking a strong role guiding the team."" - Al Ewing

**Power Man**

*  ""Power Man does not respond well to authority. At all."" - Al Ewing

* ""Power Man's power set is actually a lot like Iron Fist's, so there's that with him and Luke. Their dynamic is not the teacher-student relationship Victor has with Danny Rand. It's more boss and intern. It's like when you're running a business and there's a spot for your friend's kid who you don't really like. There's a pretty massive argument between them right in the first issue."" - Al Ewing


**Monica Rambeu/Spectrum**

* ""Monica Rambeau will be on the team. She's the field leader. New costume, new name, kind of rejoining and rebranding herself. She'll be called Spectrum."" - Al Ewing

*  ""Thinking about how Blue Marvel and Spectrum may come together is interesting. They are both energy based in a way. I've been thinking about how they'd interact. Not to start any shipping on Tumblr..."" - Al Ewing

**Blue Marvel**

*  ""Blue Marvel has a military background. He's used to following authority figures, but also to speaking his mind if he has something to say."" - Al Ewing

* The Blue Marvel limited series is [available on Marvel Unlimited](https://marvel.com/comics/series/6079/adam_legend_of_the_blue_marvel_2008)

**Spider-Man**

* ""Spider-Man is not going to miss a horrible thing happening in the middle of New York, but once it passes, he somewhat takes on the attitude of 'who are you people and how DARE you try to protect MY streets?' People are not happy he's there, he's kind of crashing the party."" - Al Ewing

**She-Hulk**

* ""Luke brings in She-Hulk as much for her legal knowledge as her powers. What he's planning will involve not necessarily being connected to S.H.I.E.L.D. or the main Avengers. They're the Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope of the Avengers."" - Al Ewing

**Ronin**

* ""When we first see Ronin, he will have an entirely different identity."" - Tom Brevoort

* ""Ronin is the character find of 2013. We batted around some ideas for him with putting on the Ronin suit. We'll find out in issue #1 why we can't know who he is. I feel like even revealing his gender I've said too much. This is the man who will be Ronin. His mystery will be explored in the first year."" - Al Ewing

**Falcon**

* ""There is a feeling, perhaps justified perhaps not, from some characters that Captain America has sent Falcon to keep an eye on them. There is some friction."" - Tom Brevoort

**Iron Fist**

* ""You won't see Iron Fist right away. Luke is actually married to somebody else now, so for good or ill he will sometimes get involved with things Danny is not. I think it's inevitable he will show up though."" - Tom Brevoort

* ""Iron Fist will be on the phone."" - Al Ewing

**Wolverine**

* ""Wolverine was almost in the book. There was no room for Wolverine. No room in his schedule, no room in my schedule."" - Al Ewing

**Jessica Jones**

* ""She'll definitely be showing up. She might even get some hits in. She's not totally happy Luke is back with an Avengers team, but she also fell in love with a man who had dreams and this is one of them. He's trying to compromise between his dreams of what super heroics should be and the family that he has built. The short answer is: they love each other."" - Al Ewing

**Villains**

*  ""We'll be getting Thanos lieutenants, some other new villains, an old villain with a connection to White Tiger and more. Plunderer is not the toughest threat they will face as a team."" - Al Ewing

My grandma is pretty much my favorite person in the world. She is about 4'10'', under 100 lbs, in her 70s, just got her knee replaced a few months ago, and just over all the coolest grandma ever.

&gt;Be me, slight college chub but working that off every day, getting back to high school weight 

&gt;Staying at grandparents house before summer internship

&gt;Grandma wants to get out of the house

&gt;She loves walking around Walmart, dat people watching

&gt;Grandma has a handicap pass on her car

&gt;Does she use it?

&gt;Nope, its for old people, grandma ain't old

&gt;Walk from back of parking lot to entrance

&gt;Grandma grabs cart to help her walk around the store easier

&gt;Enter the land of the fat neanderthals

&gt;Spend about 30 min walking around, looking at stuff, grandma looks a little tired

&gt;Offer to buy her a snack before we head home

&gt;Grandma normally eats healthy, today she wants Reese's though

&gt;Sure Grandma

&gt;Buy normal pack, walking out the door

&gt;In front of us there are 2 HUGE women on fat-mobiles (Grandma's word choice not mine), lets call them Best Fatties Forever or BFFs for short

&gt;Both around 5'3'' maybe 300 lbs

&gt;Living in Florida, gotta wear tanktops

&gt;So much back-fat

&gt;BFFs get to their car (handicapped spot of course)

&gt;Realize they have to put groceries in car themselves

&gt;nope.jpg 

&gt;See me

&gt;Shit they see me

&gt;Oh darlin will you help two old ladies with their groceries

&gt;They are in their 30's; max

&gt;Gotta get grandma out of this heat

&gt;Grandma won't hear of it, of course WE will

&gt;Try to stop grandma, try to load groceries into car so fast grandma doesn't have time to help

&gt;Grandma working like a champ

&gt;Fatties sittin on their Fat-Mobiles, just sitting

&gt;Finishing up

&gt;BFF #1 spots Reese's in grandma's purse

&gt;Shit

&gt;BFF #1 to BFF #2 ""All this time in the sun is really taking a tole on my blood pressure, I think I need some sugar fast or I might faint""

&gt;Don't fall for it Grandma, DON'T FALL FOR IT

&gt;Grandma instantly takes Reese's out of purse, hands them over

&gt;Fatties get in car, not so much as a thank you

&gt;Leave them Fat-Mobiles right by spot

&gt;Bump into them as they back out

&gt;Grandma wants to take them back to the store

&gt;Hell no Grandma we are going home

&gt;Finally get to car

&gt;Offer to buy grandma a milk shake or something on the way home

&gt;Grandma ain't hearing of it

&gt;Sweet old Grandma says she doesn't want to be a Fat Fuck like that (Again, her words)

&gt;Drive Grandma home

&gt;Love my Grandma

tl;dr Two fatties use college student to unload their groceries, then steal Grandma's Reese's. Grandma is sweet to their face but loathes them too.

Also, showed Grandma this sub, according to her now ""everything on the page is purple, how do I get more blue?""

1ftz7r,3,2013-06-06,[24m];[25f] Struggling to survive; Making leaps and bounds in career. Money becoming a huge issue.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ftz7r/24m25f_struggling_to_survive_making_leaps_and/,"I have always heard people say money isn't worth fighting over, that really just makes me want to punch them in the face. It is easy for people to say 'Its not worth it just for money"" when they aren't broke as shit.

Here is my story, I am 24, I graduated from film school two years ago and I have been an unpaid intern since then. The only thing keeping me afloat is a bit of family money and a part time job. 

Here is my girlfriend's story, She is 25 (really just 6 months older than me)  she graduated two years ago, was handed a sweet job from her family and is now a coordinator at a corporation making over 40k a year.

We have been dating for 5 years this month. Three of those years have been long distance. An 18 hour drive away, the distance wasn't easy but we survived it, mostly because I had a week break from school every two months and drove up to see her 4 times a year. She moved down here for me, but her extended family lives here too. To me, they really just feel like a safety blanket. 

We are madly in love, things really are great and have been since she came down, but lately things have started to suck and frankly i'm starting to want to give things a break. It is like one of those situations where that one thing pisses you off and it brings all things crashing down. 

We started fighting about the money and it has really just made me sick of being in a relationship, all I want to do is focus and get my career on track so that I can actually make money, all she wants to do is do things on the weekend. EVERYTHING we do costs money, I never have money and so, she pays, which was fine we even called her my 'sugarmama'. 

Suddenly she has been very uptight and immediately gets edgy when I bring up money. Even if it is just me bitching about being in debt (Fucking student loans) or saying 'lets just stay in for dinner' it always becomes an argue point. 

The brass tacks of the situation are, that we are planning on moving in together in August, I don't think it is a good idea lately...I mean living together will only put our finances under a microscope. She is saving her money and I am living from paycheck to paycheck.

We talk about marriage a lot and I know she is getting pressured to be married more and more. Her hopes in the next year are to buy a place, without a miracle I won't be able to go in on it with her. 

We have been together too long to give up but I fear that It may be inevitable due to my career status and the difficulty of my industry. 

What do I do? I've tried talking to her but she just gets flustered

TL;DR

After 2 years of dating in the same city (3 long distance) My girlfriend and I are planning on moving in together. She is making leaps and bounds in her career and saving money while I am struggling to stay afloat and even pondering moving cities. Lately we have been fighting over money and it is making me weary.

 Her plans in the next two years are to be married and owning an apartment or home, I cannot make any plans since I am constantly at the mercy of my lack of work. We have been together too long to give up but I fear that It may be inevitable due to my career status and the difficulty of my industry.

1fya9y,4,2013-06-08,Can we talk about drones for a second?,[deleted],Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1fya9y/can_we_talk_about_drones_for_a_second/,"So a few days ago, there was a link in worldpolitics posted about how Pakistan's new president doesn't want any more drone strikes, and vowed in his election to end them in the country.

In the comments, the reddit hive mind, which for the most part prides itself on being so ""progressive"" and forward thinking, was blasting Pakistan, saying drone strikes were fine, that the death of Paksitani civilians are justifiable collateral damage. 

I've written academically about drones and professionally before for internships, and drones I think are one of the biggest current issues that Americans are not invested in nearly enough. Not only is it seen as perfectly legitimate that at any time, anywhere, the US government can kill a ""suspected"" terrorist with no due process or any real repercussions took the kidnappings and renditions of Bush to an entirely new level. It is an understatement for me to say that is incredibly worrisome.

Other issues here that are terrifying for me include: the precedent set by the US that killing extrajudicially anyone anywhere in the world is okay as long as it is in the interest of national security will be devastating I think when China or Russia for example get drones, the civilian deaths of course, tossing aside the concept of sovereignty, and the fact that we are further killing our reputation in the Middle East and the muslim world when past political actions like US bases on holy lands in Saudi Arabia served as inspiration for Al Qaeda's anti-american ideology in the first place.

So thoughts? rebuttals? what do y'all think of drones?"
1fxqpr,2,2013-06-08,Question regarding sudden change in rate of weight loss.,Wolfman87,bodybuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1fxqpr/question_regarding_sudden_change_in_rate_of/,"Ok, so I began cutting in January after admittedly bulking a bit too long and putting on more fat than I intended. I hit my bulk goal of 200lb before beginning to cut. I have been slowly tapering off my calories, from 2000cal/day in January to 1700cal/day now. Today I weighed in at 165.9lb. The problem is that I am trying to maintain as much of my muscle as I can while cutting and so I've been losing roughly one pound a week, maybe a bit more, but I have been very careful not to lose 2lb per week because I've heard that's the point at which you'll begin losing muscle beyond what is unavoidable. One week ago I weighed 168.8lb which means I've lost damn near 3lb and the caliper test puts me at 11.23% body fat from 11.48% five days ago, (I know that it might mean nothing because the accuracy of those things isn't perfect). Either way I'm wondering why I'm suddenly losing weight so fast.

Here are some things that have changed in the past 2 weeks:

* I have started an internship and I wake up at 6am instead of my normal 9 or 10am.
* I am no longer getting a huge amount of sleep every night, 6 or 7 hours maybe.

My work out hasn't changed much but what should I do? Is it an ok level of weight loss? Am I correct to assume I'm needlessly losing muscle this way? Should I cut cardio? Increase my calories?"

A good portion of the Reddit community subscribes to /r/atheism (Not taking in account for bots or corporate accounts). This being so, a lot of the content is able to be uploaded to the point where many can see it. Why I am conflicted is because I feel it is a good thing that we are able to show people why/ how religion can be satirized, but I also feel that it is sort of a guerrilla tactic when it comes to promotion. I also feel it does not represent rational thinking well and, intern, could further a negative dogma towards the atheist community. 

Perhaps I am look to much into this.

1fwsh1,4,2013-06-08,"I(19F) can't stop being mean and bitter, not sure if I should call for a break with him(21M)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fwsh1/i19f_cant_stop_being_mean_and_bitter_not_sure_if/,"I (19F) currently go to college, now a junior.. My boyfriend (21M), senior, also goes to the same college as me, and we've been dating for a year and a half. He is originally from a place that's way far away from the college. The only financially reasonable way for me to visit him would be by plane. I am not very well-off, so while I did make a visit to his home after the school year ended, I almost did not due to finances. I took on a second job to see him and his family.


His family is extremely nice. His mother is really sweet, but a helicopter parent to the extreme. My BF is the oldest of 3 children, and for the week and a half she was there since she is a stay at home mom she would pick up after them, constantly remind them about homework, police the TV, they can't curse, mildly religious overtones, etc. However, they are really nice, and their family life is seriously leave it to beaver-esque. They play boardgames and shit and have ""family nights"". Which is both endearing and kind of weird. 


My home life is kind of loose butthole, so I really tried hard to make sure I got a job on campus this summer, which would pay for on-campus housing. I worked hard, I utilized all of the connections I had, sent my resume everywhere and anywhere that would take me, etc. I started on this months before summer even came. I thought it would be really lovely that my boyfriend of a year and a half could stay the summer also. We've already done the long distance thing last year, and it was truly terrible and for about three or four months after we got back our relationship was very rocky. He already has an on-campus job that would have hired him for the summer and paid for the entirety of his housing. So he had no work to do to stay on campus, for free, for the summer. He literally only had to tell his boss that he would work here. He agreed with me and seemed eager to stay, especially since the majority of his friends were also staying for the summer and during the summer it's very much a go to work, party all night atmosphere.


Here's the thing- as a 21 year old, my boyfriend's mommy still holds the reins. His father pays for his college tuition through the GI bill and his mother wants him to crawl back home to the uterus more times than not. She is truly a nice lady but she is a helicopter parent to the extreme- my boyfriend still gets mandatory hour-long phone calls every week, has to report when finals are done so he can fly back home, etc. I can't understand this at all. My mother, who I adore, treats me as an adult. She was sad I decided to stay on campus, but understood my decision and respected it as an adult starting my own life. My boyfriend's decision, however, was treated by his parents as that he hated his family, never wanted to see them again, this was his last summer and he should spend it with family (which, I argued the opposite, saying it was his last college summer and he had spent considerably more time under his mother's thumb than the few years college offers) and there were (apparently) veiled threats about taking away financial support.


The kicker is earlier during the year, my boyfriend had (drunkenly) said that he was going to be able to stay. I was so happy I actually cried. I love him to death. He's my best friend. And then he told me to the contrary- he couldn't get an internship, and he could work a dinky job back home too, so his mother demanded he come home for the summer.


I have been extremely hurt by this. I feel like he did not try hard enough. Some internships he never called back. He is behind a semester due to changing majors but honestly, at a school that's hard to get a job at, I've managed to get two at once during the school year and chosen as the summer hire out of 30 candidates. Why hasn't he done this earlier? Why hadn't he planned it out? I also feel like he didn't talk with his parents about why he wanted to stay during the summer. His mother is sweet and while protective, I don't think she's illogical, and they have threatened his financial support before due to grades and did not take it away then. My boyfriend has given me vague answers on that front when asked, which makes me think.. he would rather be at home. And I would have rather him told me that from the start instead of letting me believe he would be staying. 


Compared to last year, I have been much more upset about him not being here, and also much more bitter. Some days I wake up and I hate him. I see his texts, answer them with short answers, and try not to think of him because the thought of him being away, and all of the ruined potential- his last summer, wasted, when I am not overly burdened by school stress, when we can go to museums and parks and enjoy the warm weather- makes me angry and upset. His friends are my friends and I see them often, and they always ask- ""when is he coming back? June? July? Where is he?""- and I have to answer, all of the time, ""Sorry, I don't know."" It bothers me he has NO SAY amongst his parents and he's still treated as a child, who can't make his own decisions and who is guilted into things. He is popular and ALL of his friends are here for the last summer so I can barely go anywhere without getting questioned where my boyfriend is. It's gotten to the point where I tell people, ""I don't know, ask his mommy."" It's frustrating. I pester him with texts frequently about if he can manage to come here any earlier- I have my own room on campus- and his only answer was ""at least a week early!"" which means only a week early, tops, if mommy will abide. He has talked about after school, that we will live together, and I can't deal with this- god forbid we one day have a baby, and his mother demands we visit when it's still an infant or that my boyfriend will be family excommunicated, I will not be dragged across the way just because someone doesn't know how to stand up to others.


I know I am mean to him sometimes. My emotions make me lash out. I feel abandoned, and though he seems upset that I am upset, I don't think he realizes how devastated I am that he could not stand up to his parents, or tell me the truth of what he wanted. I am recognizing that my behavior towards him is often mean or petty, but I can't stop it. I frequently bring up the fact that he's not here, he should be here, and update him on what he's missing out on. Over skype he tells me it is only four months- and I KNOW, I know it's only 4 months, but it's time that is entirely different than school time, and I wanted to experience that with him. He talks about seeing a future with me, and the only future I can see with him is with his mother's shadow. I don't know if I should call a break over the summer. Not because I don't love him-because I do- but because I lash out at him, and maybe if we don't talk much, if we stay distant over the summer, I won't think of him much and won't feel that crushing sadness and loneliness, and I won't drive him away by being a cunt. Even though I know it's illogical and irrational, I cry myself to sleep every night, and I feel so abandoned. Other days I just miss him dearly. Either way I am constantly having negative emotions towards my BF.


tl;dr: bf(21) told me he would stay at college over summer; overbearing mom said ""LOL NOPE"", bf barely fought it and did not secure internship despite me working ass off to stay. I feel bitter, bitchy, abandoned, and generally upset every night. I am mean to him sometimes. Summer Break time?"
1fwfkx,5,2013-06-07,Another Easterner looking to work in the oilfields. Tips and help would be very much appreciated!,Globe90Squatter,fortmac,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortmac/comments/1fwfkx/another_easterner_looking_to_work_in_the/,"Hey /r/fortmac 

After graduating from University with very unemployable liberal arts degrees, I've decided to try the oilfields. I've done some deep preliminary research, but I still have questions for anyone who has worked in the oilfields.


1. I've never worked manual labour, but I have experience really roughing it out on my last year long travel (sleeping in tents, at bus terminals, lugging a backpack around half of Africa). Would the lack of manual labour hinder my chances? I am very in shape and I work out often. I'm sure I can pass the physical test no problem.


2. I only have work experience in very ""cushy"" jobs. Office, retail, tour guiding, marketing internships. I also have a double major degree from a very reputable university. Will this come across negatively with the recruiters? I'm afraid I'll seem like some liberal Ontario yuppie who wont be committed to the physical demands of the job.


3. I can get my H2S ticket here in Ontario and I already have my first aid cpr c ticket. With these two under my belt, will that put me in a favorable position?


4. I've heard that you need an Alberta address. I was hoping to just fly down to Nisku and start handing out resumes. What if I dont have an Alberta address? Should I just put a friend's down who lives in Edmonton?


5. I'm really hoping to get hired within a week of applying so that I dont kill all of my savings on hotels and transportation. Does this seem possible that I'll get hired that soon? I've heard stories about people getting work the very next day.


6. Since I'm from Ontario, I won't have a vehicle in Alberta, nor an Alberta drivers license. Will this be a problem?


7. When are the best times to apply? When do they need labour the most? Is the demand for labour as much as I've been hearing?


8. Finally, I'd hate to just ask, but does anyone work at an oilfield right now and can offer me a recommendation or a lead into a job? I'd be hugely indebted to them.
Thanks, /r/fortmac"

I'm 19 years old and I'm itching for a dog. Two dogs. Two puppies (sisters, even!) from a responsible, good breeder, so I can train them and raise them as my own and so we can share our lives.

Why I shouldn't: http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/13_1/features/Problems-Adopting-Two-Puppies-At-Once_16190-1.html?pg=1

It's four times the work. And, to start things off, it's A LOT of work to train just ONE puppy! Vet costs will skyrocket. I will have to buy twice as much feed, two crates, two of everything. I will have to train both dogs separately, which will mean delaying the time a dog can be ""fully trained"" because I'll have to split my time in two to make sure both pups will be on the same page. Two walks, double the poo, double the headache of whining and yipping at night. My free time will be non existent. I'm a college student-- don't I WANT free time? Do I have the patience for this, really? The money? Littermates will bond with each other, not with their owner. The separation will be unbearable between them. If both dogs aren't trained properly, it will be cruel for them. I don't want to be anything even resembling a cruel owner. Still, frustrations will happen! What will I do when I come home after a long day of projects to find that the puppies (and I don't even know which one) had an accident on the carpet, started to wrestle with her sister, and smeared puppy poo all over my final exam? Will I honestly have the time to devote to both my school work and two dogs, who are known to be very energetic as puppies? So they don't fall into the habit of relying on each other for comfort, I'll have to exercise both separately. That means a one hour walk will turn into two hour walks. That's an entire evening gone, whereas with one dog, I would have had time to relax for myself after training and play time with puppy.

Why I think I should: I'm a college student. After school work, I HAVE the time to work with them. Morning, afternoon, evening- I can schedule classes to allow me even the shortest breaks in between so my pups won't have to hold their pee in for ungodly amounts of hours (as if they could!). I've had dogs before and have been without one for three years now- since then, I've worked summers and have almost literally set aside all the money for a ""pup fund"". I've researched the breed I want and I can afford it. I've researched health issues and have spoken to breeders. I'm an outdoor person, but still a homebody. In the last stretch of my junior/senior years, I could dedicate myself not only to school projects but to my dogs as well. And only those two things. When I graduate, if all goes well, I'd have 1 1/2-2 year old, well trained, adult dogs. 

What I'm doing: I'm waiting two years. Very possibly longer if I'm not 100% convinced by then, or else I just won't go through with this plan of mine I have right now. I'm waiting to see if the novelty of the idea wears off. I'm waiting to see how many emotional/physical/lifestyle changes I go through. (But you're a kid, you say, of course you'll go through many of them!) I think I've read this subreddit and others, and other information sources enough to GET IT. To know that having another animal is caring for a life. I'm trying to find breeders (but why not adopt? because I want a dog who's characteristics will fit what I foresee my life becoming). I'm trying to weigh the costs, the sacrifices. Would having to find buildings which allow pets after graduation be worth it if I'm trying to get the job asap? What will my internships be? The dogs I want are Velcro dogs. I cannot leave them alone for more than eight hours a day as adults. I will not leave them alone longer than abso-fucking-lutely necessary as they are puppies. 

It's a VERY big deal.

I've looked through this sub and, like in the Whole Dog Journal article, I've seen how much of a ""bad idea"" it is. I still want to do it. I still think I can do it, and not disappoint the dogs or myself. I guess this post is to see some opinions on this (which will be ""don't do it"") and to also start the countdown on the calendar, I guess. I wonder if anybody has experience with taking in two dogs and training them together. Any success stories? Any warnings? Thanks for taking the time to read this, you guys."
1fz9tr,58,2013-06-09,LFTC Party Recap,jackbowen,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/1fz9tr/lftc_party_recap/,"So I stayed up all goddamn night. LFTC is still on, because no one knew how to shut it off after Ant went to bed. I will do my best to recap everything. 

Started with Karaoke, Danny... Melissa Stetten's Mom (yet to be 100% confirmed but that was what people were saying) Anthony, Carlton (black guy, he'll come up later) and Big A took turns singing songs. 

Then Ant went into the studio with a blonde girl, dont know the names of these people, this is just a vague outline. Anthony's total camera time was about 7 minutes. Jimmy left before the camera turned on (got a flat tire on the way home) as did Erock. Roland stuck around, saw him pass by the camera but that was it... he left shortly after the karaoke started. 

As ant was in the studio behind the desk, he got a call from the police... noise complaint from a neighbor. This is the last we see of Ant. Somewhere before he left to talk to the police, Danny stepped in.

Danny was verbally raped by almost every caller for about two hours. He did not take it well. Everyone took turns calling in, one after the other... making fun of him and the sad part was his girlfriend was sitting right next to him. He became defensive, an asshole to every caller and just an overall douchebag. His opening line the last hour is ""well, what do you do for work,"" followed by ""I work at rockstar"" ""I didn't want to work at O and A anymore..."" and he and Opie got into an argument supposedly at Patrice's memorial. From the little he said it had something to do with him feeling that Opie didn't have his back, I could be wrong here but thats what I think he alluded to. Overall he came across like a whining little girl, and made an ass of himself in front of his girlfriend and they both stormed off.

Then Wendy comes in, redhead @wendyJlake and Big A. She was drunk, and playful. Everyone took turns calling in and trying to get her to do stuff. We saw her ass... 


exhibit a: http://i.imgur.com/usrhWq9.png

I realize that isnt Big A, I think his name was Fred. Who these people are I really don't know. Big A slapped her ass, I think a gif of that was already posted in this subreddit. I asked her if she squirted, the answer was sometimes. I also asked if Jimmy would like her vagina... is it meaty, unfortunately the answer was no. We also found out such things as, she's not into bukkake's, she likes it doggy style, she is shaved, the curtains match the carpet... although its shaved. No anal. She wasn't wearing any panties... then she had to pee. I happened to be on the phone with her at the time, and told her just to pee in a cup... no go. Let me back up a bit, about ten minutes before this, Carlton... the black guy from karaoke weaseled his way into the studio and put his fingers in her. Then he disappeared. Wendy said that Carlton was eating her out, but since we didnt see him go down there, and the desk was in front I though she was full of shit. (She started to get cunty and less playful as time went on) Well she got up to pee... and then Carlton popped his black head up, whiped his mouth and sat down. 

I don't know how happy Anthony will be that there was interracial shannanigans going on in his studio... and on his chairs (you know how he gets with boogers let alone pussy juice) So as of right now Ant doesnt know this I don't think. Kinda funny. 

Anyways, so Carlton got up sat down with Fred and talked for a couple hours taking calls. Carlton didn't know how to talk into a mic so you could barely hear him.   Pretty boring... got to be around 4-5 am then these two other guys, I think they were interns or I dont even really know jumped in and took more calls (they took calls all night) So these two guys, one looked like a limp dick baldy pederast, which he was reminded by many callers, and the other had a sleeveless grey tshirt... he was a nice guy. 

Then around shit, like 7 AM this guy named Joe stumbled in from the pool, I guess he had passed out there. He had a ""puke bucket"" in his car just for the occasion, and used that before walking into the studio. His nose was very runny, he explicitly said it was not from cocaine. He plugged the site @devincomedy but we called him Joe, so I really don't know whats going on there. He kind of livened things up a bit, took some calls... gave advice on stand up.. all the while looking like he was going to puke at any second. 

It ended with Joe and the sleeveless grey shirt guy not knowing how to turn off the tricaster, so as I sit right now 8am central time, the feed is still running. I'm guessing sooner or later Ant will stumble down and turn it off, im leaving it on just in case. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post, it was a weird night at the compound... and was fun to watch the debauchery live all night. I don't know if he will keep the video up, because most of it was just kinda bullshit, with a few highlights, so it may be ""The Show That Never Happened II""

Also there's a rumor that Pat from Moonachie's girlfriend freaked the fuck out on the karaoke stage, and Anthony has a five minute video of it. I don't know the details of it, but something tells me it will be brought up on Monday.

**TL;DR weird night at the compound, saw anthony for about 5 minutes, the show is still going now at 8am as I type this, I believe it started around 10 last night, don't now when it will be shut off**"
1fz36s,4,2013-06-09,A different dimension to my pain,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fz36s/a_different_dimension_to_my_pain/,"Hi Reddit. I’m in need of some support, and I don’t really have anybody to turn to that understands where I’m coming from. If you have a minute, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. After I graduated high school I tried to go to college, but wasn’t able to make it through a single semester because of my issues. For over ten years I fought to hold jobs, but they never lasted long. I struggled in every way, but I kept struggling, trying to find something that I could handle long term. In order to try to find a field that I could handle, I attempted college, and failed, more than once during this period.

My doctor had suggested medication for years to treat my depression. I had heard nothing but horror stories, so I was very reluctant to try them. After a particularly bad few months, I was at a very low point, and with nothing to lose I decided to give medication a try.

I went through about ten medications, each one with its own set of horrible side effects. Most of them seemed to make me angry, irritated, even violent, which are all so very far out of my normal demeanor. When you are on the medications it is hard to see what they are doing to you, but my family could certainly see, and so when things got bad they would be able to talk me into going back to the doctor for a new drug.

Beyond these bouts of side effects (or affects as I see them), I actually started doing better with my depression and anxiety, so much so that I was able to go back to college. Things were really going well until one day when I had a particularly bad episode of side effects, lost my mind, and ended up getting arrested. No violence, no one was hurt, and I immediately stopped taking all medication and refuse to take any ever again. I ended up with a misdemeanor on my permanent record.

I am getting close to finishing college, but I need an internship to actually graduate. I have about a year left. I recently applied for an internship but was denied because of my record. This has really put me in a really bad place.
I’ve read that some of these medications can actually permanently modify your brain chemistry. I’m not sure how true that is, but I certainly feel that I am not the same as I was before. I would describe this particular low point as cold. I have a cold rationale, a dark logic that is eating away at my mind.

Before when I would find myself in a dark place, it was different. I just felt overwhelmed, hopeless, all the things that I’m sure many of you have experienced with depression. Now I have some of these feelings, but I find myself logically weighing in my mind whether I should go on at all. Not just whether I should stay in college, but whether I should just end the struggle altogether.

I can’t sleep or concentrate on anything that I would normally be able to do to try to take my mind off of things. I am consumed by this battle of dark logic and reason. And sticking around is on the losing side of the battle.

I have a great family, and they do their best to support me, but saying it will all be okay just isn’t enough. I am a burden in many ways, and the cold hard truth is they would be better off without me. I’ve had those realizations weigh on me before, but now they are just so adamant and matter-of-fact. It’s not emotional like I have experienced in the past. In the past I would get emotional, but then I could calm down, eventually, and be okay.

I don’t know what to do. That tiny part of me that is writing this is losing the battle. I have never done well with therapy or therapists, and my doctor just wants to medicate me, which I will never succumb to again.

So what do I do? I feel that I need something concrete to work with here. Going to a therapist and being asked how I feel isn’t going to help me. Medication has only hurt me. What other options are there? How do I pull myself out of this? Where do I turn? Any thoughts, suggestions, personal experiences, anything, would be great. If you read this entire novella I’m truly impressed."

(story in comments)",Sashi-Mee,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1g2rxv/women_of_reddit_how_do_you_feel_about_your_thighs/,"
Hello there ! :)

So here's the story : Years ago, I befriended a girl when I was in internship [...] and few weeks ago we started talking again, and we've been through a lot since then, but to sum up to the point here, I traveled the world to break free from my boundaries and she got trapped in her own complexes. I'm not sure if this word can be used this way in english, but what I mean is that she doesn't like her thighs, ass, and the thought of it being visible disturbs her from enjoying a (great) massage, or making love in daylight...

I'd love to hear about your woman opinions so I can support her better, reinsure her with a variety of woman opinions and tips so she can be herself without hiding under the pillow, because she looks like Kristen Stewart in ""On the road"" so this is absurd, and damn, she's gorgeous and she's got the most ~~sexiest~~ ~~bounciest~~ ~~slappable~~ fine ~~booty~~ body i've ever had my hands on. 

I understand that everybody has to get comfortable with it's body, I've been through it myslef, but not as a girl (physically and mentally), so **I'd love to hear your stories and techniques to get your thighs in a shape you appreciate.**

All I want is to make her feel good. There's a lot I can do, but as a visual artist I know there's a lot of **perfect ~~booties~~ bodies slapped in our face** by medias and that could shift our perception of ourselves / tend to leave forever unsatisfied with our self-image, and I'd like to know what girls do think about it, and how did you managed to be at peace /feel comfident with your appearance.

**About the orgasm thing**, she shivered and giggled at her 3rd orgasm, a few minutes after coïtus, and she felt concerned about not feeling the tip of her hands... I told her that's fine, that it makes me feel like a god of sex and she shouldn't be worried about anything, but i'd like to hear your stories / be sure I'm not doing something wrong.
 
I got to run, but thanks for your inputs and sorry for the length! :)

1g2n6r,10,2013-06-10,What would you do? Girlfriend [20/F] is spending another weekend with guy [21/M] from her past... I'm [25/M].,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g2n6r/what_would_you_do_girlfriend_20f_is_spending/,"**THE STORY:** My girlfriend earned an internship in Florida for the summer. This internship is 900 miles away from our town, and she's been there since May. After having a strong relationship for nearly two years, she spent most of this past Sunday alone with a guy (he's single and will now be referred to as SHITHEAD). SHITHEAD is an old high school fling of hers from our town. SHITHEAD landed an internship 2 hours away from her by coincidence. SHITHEAD tweeted at my girlfriend Friday to exchange cell numbers and hang out this weekend. She promptly replied and agreed via Twitter. Since my gf and SHITHEAD are not friends by any definition, we then promptly had a huge fight about the tweets. Not meeting up with SHITHEAD was not an option for her apparently. After said fight, we made up, we apologized, and I trustingly agreed they could hang out this weekend. I don't want to be the over-possessive boyfriend. They drank beer/talked on the beach, played in the ocean, and spent time at her apartment in that order by her own admission. That all occurred before her roommates got back from work at 4:30PM. After 4:30PM, my girlfriend, SHITHEAD, and a roommate went out to dinner, played mini-golf, and chilled at the apartment again for a drink or two before SHITHEAD left for his place. SHITHEAD and my girlfriend have plans to hang out alone and then with her roommates AGAIN this coming Friday. On top of that, SHITHEAD is spending the night this time so I'm a little suspicious. I'm distressed because I love her and care about her, but I would tell any other guy in my position it sounds like she's cheating.

**THE GOOD NEWS** is she swears nothing physical happened between her and SHITHEAD. She swears she loves me and would never do anything to betray my trust. She's never made me suspicious prior. She gladly answers all questions about their day together.

**THE BAD NEWS** is girls don't USUALLY spend multiple weekends alone with guys they have no interest in fucking, she LOVES daily sex, and we've been separated by 900 miles for four weeks now. SHITHEAD has no friends at his internship and is very likely sex-starved as well. My gf historically texts me a lot and replies quickly when she's bored or not having a good time somewhere... She was NOT generous with her texts or replies despite KNOWING I didn't like their platonic play-date when their only history is non-platonic.

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend of nearly two years is beginning to have platonic ""play-dates"" with a guy she briefly dated in high school. This is happening at her internship in Florida 900 miles away from our town. We love each other, and she swears nothing is going on. On the other hand, I'm suspicious because they have no history of friendship, and she's not backing down from meeting up with him.

**EDIT:** I broke up with her the night of finding the tweets AND our big fight. She said the ugliest, most insulting things I've ever heard come out of her mouth. She called and cried leaving voice messages all night saying she was sorry. I called her back and patched things up the next morning. I began to have hope I was wrong and that she and SHITHEAD had innocent intentions. They still met up the next day. Obviously, I'm skeptical.

**EDIT2:** Thanks for all the advice and different perspectives. It's a tough situation for me, and I genuinely need feedback.

**THE CALL:** We talked last night, and I can proudly say I never raised my voice once or got confrontational. I cannot say the same for her. I just calmly offered a bunch of the key CONS from the comments and my post. She never offered a good explanation to any of them. She did threaten to delete his number and tell him to not come. I said, well, that's great. Sounds good to me, but she didn't and you could hear how much she didn't want to tell him to not come in her voice. Just yesterday she said most guys wouldn't tolerate it so I was confused why my calmness was being met with hostility the whole time. She even told one lie that I was easily able to explain as a lie immediately. She said they were friends and close. I explained how they hardly chat on social media and never see each other at parties in our town like she claimed. So she just got irritated and changed her story to they're not close. I asked about her plan to see her sister in Georgia this weekend. She's changed it to stay at her apartment for the little party with her roommates and SHITHEAD. I told her that's all the information I needed, and if she has a private play-date with SHITHEAD before her roommates get back again we're over. We hung up with just saying goodnight in a pretty deadpan manner. She then sent me five long texts how I'm wrong and insecure and driving her away. I deleted all them and just called back and said what's up with all the texts? I thought we were done talking. She said did you read them? I said I deleted them and that whenever my girlfriend has a guy-friend situation like this that stinks from top to bottom... I'm going to ask question and more questions until I'm satisfied. I said goodnight and hung up. So I'm pretty sure we're over. She's only happy if I don't ask questions and SHITHEAD is seeing her this weekend. Plus, she's contradicting SO MANY things that she's said over the last few days about their relationship and her understanding or her not understanding my point of view. So I'm going to plan something with friends and single girls that would have caused her to go ape-shit back home. If she's calm about it, I'm breaking up with her. If she goes ape-shit like she would have here at home, I'm going to give the ultimatum we both cancel all plans to hang out with single people willing to fuck us or we break up. Feedback is welcomed :)"
1g1udp,12,2013-06-10,[semi-FR/semi-PSA] Conversation Threading/Statements rather than Questions,Tenley,highseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/highseddit/comments/1g1udp/semifrsemipsa_conversation_threadingstatements/,"I spent the last two days around a natural, and I really picked up some good stuff from him. The best of which was an example (and a competitor) in conversation threading. Because I am not an expert on this topic, I am not calling it an article, but I wanted to announce this VERY important topic.

**Why?**

Imagine you are a girl. A guy walks up to you and starts hitting you with question after question like you're on a job interview. Creepy, right? Also, you aren't learning anything about the guy, so you are not engaged in his passions or life story at all. This is why guys at a stereotypical nightclub/bar always fail with the ""So where do you work, do you come here often"" kind of questions. Rather, the bulk of what you say should be in statements.

**Statements?**

Yes.

Real statements are engaging. Imagine that you're talking to a target about Jay-Z. She gives her opinion on Jay-Z. You could respond with a question, and another question, and another question, and probably burn out unless she really wants you. You could respond with a boring affirmation, ""Yeah, Jay-Z is cool,"". Or you can become the player you were meant to be and show your sexy, cultured, opinionated side (you can swap this out with teasing or anything: just take a stance, be interesting), ""Jay-Z is alright. I like rap as a whole but I don't like a lot of the illuminati stuff he throws in, like in the song ""Run This Town""."" 

Unless the person is a bad conversationalist, that statement can spark a discussion. Guys and girls both appreciate statements. They're dominant (you stand on your own ground and opinions) and engaging.

**Conversation Threading**

If you are unsure what to talk about, you only need a soundbite from someone else to find a topic. Let's say you're talking to a girl and she says,

""*Last year* I *traveled* to *Italy* because I really like the *cuisine* there.""

Just within ONE sentence you have four different spin off topics (all italicized). You can respond:

Last year: ""That's a cool thing to do for last year. I was too busy working an internship for my town's mayor candidate. Guess why he won. ;) ""

Travel: ""Oh god, I love traveling. I have never really left the country, but when I get to travel to new places, or even near places that I never go to like New York, I just can't get enough.""

Italy:  ""Awesome that you've been to Europe! I'm actually about to leave for Austria, Germany, and Switzerland in 10 days! It's going to be my first time out of the country too.""

Cuisine: I'll leave you to make your own sentence for this and post it as a response for practice.

**But I'm boring!**

It's okay if you're boring, but you need to commit to change it. Don't stop your PUA exercises either. Do both. For example, I will be partying it up with friends tonight. They're all dudes. Is that bad? No! I get funny stories. Get hobbies, get friends, get exciting plans. Watch the movie ""Yesman"" to understand the value in accepting invitations (provided they aren't ridiculously stupid like dousing yourself in gasoline and lighting yourself on fire). Stop playing video games. I'm 3-4 weeks clean after being an AVID PC gamer 3-4 years ago. I typically relapse every other week, but I've been good so far. Too poor to go out? Start looking for a job like the world depends on it or find some way to make money. Not physically fit? Do both at the same time. Can't go anywhere because you can't drive/parents won't drive you? Do interesting stuff at home, e.g., reading. I've always seen girls and cool people in general being way more receptive to the stuff you find in books than in games, and blowing people's heads off may be fun - but it doesn't provide the same perspective on people that books do.

*Stop making excuses. This is your life, and it is ending one second at a time. You have the power right now to shift direction.*

**Real world application**

I assure you, this works. When I ask people questions, the conversation often drops as soon as they answer. This is why talking to your Aunt Bettie who flew in for your graduation party always seems so awkward. She just asks questions, but doesn't really engage you in a true discussion, where as a friend trades ideas and thoughts through statements with you. ""Statements are the medium of the intimate.""

Another note, sometimes, you have to just keep on talking. In pimping they call this the Million Dollar Mouth Piece, because you can't shut up. If someone isn't responding, that doesn't mean they don't like you (or maybe they do, we will never know, who cares). This just means you need to talk more to engage them, and probably throw in a little kino.

[25/m],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g1skw/gf_22f_wants_to_focus_on_herself_and_not_see_each/,"I'm 25, she's 22. We know each other since January 2013 and we are together since March. Shes in her last year of studies, she got frustrated because she didn't find any internship for the summer and she's having a hard time finding out what she wants to do, or finding a job she may want.

Yesterday she got rejection email from on company and we talked over the phone later. I tried to cheer her up, tell her eventually she'll find it, also I got into 'Mr. Fix' mode at some point. I guess she got even more frustrated and hanged up.

So I sent her a message ''Sometimes you just have to be patient, finding something worth your time takes a while. I know you feel bad, I wish I could cheer you up. Keep looking, eventually you'll find a job or internship you want. Good night.'

and she replied: 'I think I should focus more on myself until then lets not see each other in the meantime. Good night.'

I didn't respond anything to her message. What should I do, how should I go about that? Any thoughts?"
1g1q06,353,2013-06-10,June 14th Sale and a note - Presented by OMA,OneManArmy77,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g1q06/june_14th_sale_and_a_note_presented_by_oma/,"Superb Villain Veigar 487 RP
Marble Malphite 260 RP
Monarch Kog'maw 260 RP
Nami 487 RP
Renekton 440 RP
Nidalee 395 RP

*a shrill laugh breaks the pristine silence you were enjoying*

Heeheeheeheeheeheehee! I, the magnificent **Superb Villain Veigar**, have got it all figured out now! Nothing can stop me now! I’ve come up with a foolproof plan to steal the great treasure of the destroyed void castle! For centuries, stone guardians have protected the treasure, but I have a secret recipe to steal away this magnificent prize. Come with me if you dare, and discover what devious plan I have concocted. If you want in on this profitable venture, I require a one time monetary transaction of **487 RP** from you.

So you want in eh? Well the stone guardians are led by a strong and staunch defender: **Marble Malphite**. He normally would prove to be no easy task, but my special potion should take care of him in a jiffy. You see, I have created a special potion that will corrode his marble exterior, making him quite susceptible to my spells. You can escort his remains out of the castle for a measly **260 RP**.

Next, we have to tackle the watchful eyes of the castle’s defenses. I can deal with most of them, but **Monarch Kog’Maw** is no push over. My devious plan, however will prove no match for him. In my bag of tricks, I have an Everlasting Jawbreaker, courtesy of an acquaintance of mine. He can try to devour it all he likes, but I would bet that you would sooner capture him for **260 RP** than him finish that evil treat.

Now, that should get us access to the treasure without problem. Unfortunately though, I only could bring one teleport scroll, thus leaving us with only one entrance out of the castle. Getting access to the front gate is problematic, as now that the guards have been disposed of, there is no one to man the cranks. My plan is to get out through the sewer, and since I have done all the work, you have the honor of carrying me! Can’t swim? Don’t worry, I have paid **Nami**,an acquaintance of mine, to lend you her powers. You can ask for them later with a tribute of **487 RP**. 

By now, the castle has sent their reinforcements to ensure our destruction. Unfortunately for them, I never attempt a job without some muscle. My good friend **Renekton** should do away with them without too many problems. Their stone may be strong, but I’m placing my bets on the crocodile with a vengeance. Watch him cleave your enemies in two for a small fee of **440 RP**.

What’s this? It seems they sent more reinforcements than I guessed. I can see that they have hired mercenaries to take us down. Quick, head down!

*a spear just whizzes by your head, shaving off a couple hairs*

It looks like they sent **Nidalee** to hunt us down. Don’t fear old chap, I have just the thing. My wool yarn trap should take care of her without a hitch. Once I deal with her, we are out of this mess! Oh, what’s that? I guess you can buy another trap off me later for **395 RP** to ensnare her again, should you feel the need.

And just like that, the treasure is ours! Great Success! I have hired many people to help me with this job, and this glorious pie will be split many ways. If you want to claim your slice of the reward, contact me by **June 14^th** and you shall have your just desserts. 

Note: I am loathe to inform you all that this could be my last story sale for awhile. As I have received my own treasure in the form of an internship, I will have trouble accessing internet during the time when these sales hit the subreddit. I will still try to be there to write these, but this is just a heads up, and a chance for other good writers to show their skills. Even though I am leaving, I leave you in the competent hands of many good writers just like me. In addition, I am currently working on writing some longer stories and there is a distinct possibility of some artwork being included. I hope you all have enjoyed my stories as much as I have writing them. Thank you for reading, and stay tuned!


EDIT: it has been brought to my attention by a friend, that i should start a blog or something. in fact, hes been hounding me to do it and took the liberty of creating me an account.

1g1oir,467,2013-06-10,Today my best friend and drug partner is moving. (Venting),[deleted],Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1g1oir/today_my_best_friend_and_drug_partner_is_moving/,"Sorry for the wall of text, I'm not expecting anyone to read it. I just don't really know what to do, so I decided to write out our latest experiences right before she left (an idea I had on acid).


She had such a positive and cheery attitude, the epitome of good vibes. I introduced her to marijuana for her first drug ever and she loved it. She was also extremely happy that her first time was with me because we've really been through a lot. We started smoking pretty casually together. One of the best things about her was how she didn't let marijuana use effect her family or academic priorities. Mostly everyone on this sub can say the same, but still...I admire that quality in everyone.


So I find out she's moving in 2 weeks. I'm completely devastated, but I decided to just forget about it and show her the time of her life before she leaves. She invited me over to her house, however she was ready to try something different...**acid.**


I questioned if she was ready for it, but decided just to give her one tab since we were in a great setting. She took the tab and I took 5, and her and I had a fucking BLAST. We smoked weed the entire time and even had multiple beers. Maybe this was a little much for a first-timer with psychedelics, but she was having the time of her life. However, near the end of the trip, she had an anxiety attack so I held her close to me and calmed her down. I told her she was safe with me and I wouldn't let anything happen to her, how she wasn't going to die, typical bad trip dialect. We laid there for about an hour together, just enjoying eachother's company. She told me how safe she feels with me because she really trusts that I know what I'm doing. Eventually, somewhere throughout the night, we ended up having sex for the first time. Honestly, sex on 5 tabs was the most amazing experience of my life. It was like the joining together of two friends who were meant to be. We spent the rest of the night cuddling and talking about life.


After that night, our friendship really changed...we realized that we probably would've been great in a relationship. Unfortunately, she was still moving so nothing could really happen. That is the tragedy in this post I am writing. However, we ignored the inevitable future at the moment. She liked acid, but I had a feeling she'd like a certain substance that we all are familiar with even more...**MDMA.**


So I got my hands on the purest MDMA I could find from the SR. I wasn't going to trust street MDMA, not with her precious life. So I got two 120mg pills and we took them (it was my first time as well). We went to my backyard and smoked two bowls while waiting for it to come up. We didn't realize it hit us until we realized that we literally couldn't keep our hands off eachother. We walked to the nearest coffee shop and ordered some drinks. We sat there just talking for an hour and a half. About life, our futures, how much we loved eachother, typical MDMA conversations. The next 30 minutes we went underneath a gazebo and just held each other happily. Her and I agreed that the moment was the most at peace and happy we've ever been in our lives. 


Next, we spent the comedown in a nice hot tub, kissing and laughing the whole time. Despite what I've read, we both had such an easy comedown, like we never felt like shit once. The next day, we even felt slightly better and refreshed. We yearned to repeat the experience, but she didn't have enough time left...


For our last weekend together, we decided it tip it off with some more acid. I had really powerful blotters though, so I made sure she was prepared. We each took one and went to the movie theater. We wanted to see The Purge, but the drugs took hold really quick and we somehow ended up in The Internship. This is when I realized how powerful these tabs were. I was losing my grasp on reality as Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn made less and less sense. I looked at her and saw the fear in her face and noticed how jittery she was. Oh my god, I could feel the terror just by looking at her. She was going through the exact same thing. I quickly tried to decide what to do, thinking about all I've read from you guys and Erowid. Then it came to me: change the setting.


I told her to get up and she followed me outside of the theater. I noticed that this calmed her down incredibly quick. We sat there talking about the movie, and sure enough, the same thing that was happening to me was happening to her. She experienced her first ego death. I apologized for exposing her to something that intense, but she really didn't mind and said something like it makes her stronger. I laughed at that, how even in the deepest, darkest depths of a bad trip, she was able to find positive light in it even as such a new user.


Our final day together was rough. I helped her pack all of her things into a moving truck, there was a melancholic silence most of the time. Like we both knew this thing between us was about to end forever. Eventually, everything was packed up and her house was completely empty. We went out to eat at a really nice restaurant (seafood, her favorite). We shared a huge lobster and we couldn't even finish it together.


For our last hour together, we sat in her room on a makeshift bed. We held each other, knowing that it was about to come to an end. She burst into tears and I'm not gonna lie, Reddit, I started crying my eyes out with her. I am not ashamed, it was one of the roughest things I've been through. For a full hour, we cried. Saying how much we're gonna miss each other, how we love each other, and how we have to stay in touch after she moves. Eventually, it was time to go. I had my father pick me up because I didn't have my license on me. We stood in the doorway of her house for another few minutes, just hugging each other and crying. I couldn't believe that something so perfect was just about to end so abruptly...I looked at her tear-filled face and kissed her one last time...then walked away to my dad's car.


I held back all my tears for my dad. I wasn't going to let him see me like that...but I seriously couldn't help it. He asked if I was doing okay and I just started crying again. It was so fucking embarassing, but he seriously understood. He's a good father and he knows how to cheer me up. I got home and got in bed and pretty much cried myself to sleep.


The point of this post isn't to run to you guys because I'm upset. Part of the reason I wrote this is because I feel like I need to put this in writing somewhere because we had such beautiful time in our years spent together. The main reason, however, is to show you to appreciate the people you have in your life. Appreciate those who you can talk to for hours on end, those who take part in expanding their minds, and those who you consider your friends. Treasure them, show them how much you mean to them...because you really don't know how much you'll miss them until you never get to see them again.


Thanks for reading, Reddit. I know you guys probably don't care, but I didn't know where else to post this. I'm gonna seriously miss her and the impact she had on my life, but more than anything, I'm glad that her path crossed mine. Because in her years with me, she truly changed my life for the better.

**tl;dr: Keep your friends close because you don't know how much you're going to miss them until they're gone.**


EDIT: Thank you for the kind words, everybody. You all have really helped me get through this. This is my favorite community on Reddit because you're all so kind. I was raised to believe that drugs are bad and will ruin your life, but you are all such kind and loving individuals. Once again, thank you.


EDIT 2: I showed her this post and she made an account just to comment. [For those interested, here it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1g1oir/today_my_best_friend_and_drug_partner_is_moving/cagcfr4)


FINAL EDIT: I fucking love you guys. Thank you so much for everything, this is a beautiful community. You all have made this so much easier on her and I, just reading your replies."

I am a 20yr old female. Eric, is a 22yr old male friend and our relationship was always friendly but nothing too close because he was a year or two ahead. Enthusiastic hi's in the halls, and saw him at occasional parties but it was nothing beyond that. He's a very friendly, sociable, outgoing guy. Near the end of the quarter, my relationship with my (now ex) boyfriend was coming to an emotionally rocky end. I saw Eric at an end of the semester party (April) and we ended up talking for an extended period of time about my relationship (and his, he had gotten out of a long term on/off relationship in Jan) and one of my current ""problems"" (the dangers of hooking up with one of my best friends). Within this conversation he expressed interest in one of my good friends. We ended up going to his house after that night and talked over beer and hookah. He offered his air mattress and that was that.

This summer, half my week is in the area we're both in because I work at school and the other half (usually the weekend) is at home (about an hour away). From that time (April) to ~2 weeks ago, we've been hanging out a few times and generally got closer this summer. He even tried helping me getting an internship at his work (a very respectable one but didn't work out cause my schedule). He would sometimes randomly drunk text me with his equally outgoing buddies. I always thought he was interested in my close friends because he was always asking me about them etc. We both would hit each other up from time to time to hangout, but most of the time it's been unsuccessful because he'd hit me up near the weekends when I'm usually at home. In total I think we had about 4 of these hangouts (with some beer and hookah) in 2 months. Some of them were with friends and some of them were just us two. I hadn't slept over ever since the first time. He has a close friend near where I live and visited him on a weekend where I wasn't home and asked me to hangout (lol timing.).

2 weeks ago, things took an unexpected turn. He had a memorial day bbq/party at his place and invited me to come over. I was already going to hangout with another friend back home but I was debating whether or not I should go. I told him I was considering it and gave him an excuse and thought that was that. But as the night went on he kept texting me updates about the party (basically trying to get me to go). It was tempting (also kinda weird), but by that time I was stoned and too lazy and I didn't text him back. He later texted that he was going to a bar with the people that were left. A few hours after that, he texts me ""hey do you still want to come over? it's just me at my place"". This was a surprise to me because I had no idea he had that kind of interest in me. I brushed it off knowing he was probably just really drunk.

**THE HOOKUP:**

Fast forward to last week. He texted me to hangout and it was perfect cause I had just gotten off work and didn't want to go home just yet. Went over, and later decided to get some vodka. We're just talking and watching tv, and getting pretty drunk. He started to get touchy (playing with my glasses and necklace, touching my face and hands), and I knew what he was trying to do but tried to sort of ignore it (for reasons I will explain later). As the night went on, we got pretty drunk and he was just ended up blatantly hitting on me. I still really tried to ignore it.

An hour later after listening to music and talking about going clubbing the same week and making weekend plans, he asked me if I would be mad if he were to kiss me. We started to indirectly discuss the topic. I was ignoring the signs because even though I wouldn't mind, I didn't want to jeopardize our friendship because I really valued it because he's so outgoing and fun. I also told him I feel like it might be too early to be hooking up with anyone cause I had just broken up with my ex and that I didn't want to seem ""easy"". He basically ended up saying that he just got out of a relationship himself too, he reminded me that he wasn't the type to fuck a bunch of girls every weekend (that was his friends), and last but not least that if I were easy he'd probably would have fucked me months ago (lolwat). He also said that our friendship wouldn't change, we would brush it off and forget about it and that would be that. In the end, I said fuck it (literally), pulled him in and kissed him. We made out (he kept saying I was a good kisser), and fucked (it was nice), and cuddled at the end (which he instigated). Everything was good. When I woke up, he was on the other end of the bed, and his phone was ringing. He ended up being called into work on his day off. I left his place with a hug and everything seemed fine.

I knew communication wasn't really supposed to happen too soon, so I gave it a day. But I wanted to know if the plans we made while drunk were still valid because I couldn't make it so I texted him saying that I had to be at home for the weekend and was wondering if he was going to end up visiting his friend. It said he read it but I got no reply. I thought maybe it was just too early...but now a week later...I'm just confused and sad. There's no interaction between me and him now. We used to like each other's instagram/facebook stuff, and now I feel like I have to make a conscious effort to avoid him on social media. I'm sad that what I feared the most happened! Did I intimidate him? Did that one text I sent him scare him off? Is it too early to tell? Am I overthinking it? Are there any solutions? What do you guys think? WHAT CAN IT POSSIBLY BE!! If anyone can forget about a hookup when necessary, it's me. So what's going on! :( Sorry it's such a long post, I thought I needed to give some backstory to explain our friendship. I tried giving the key points of it, I left out a lot of the details. I want our friendship back! :( Or some kind of closure! Anyone else go through something like this?

Thank you to whoever got this far! Sorry it's so long.

TL;DR Had this acquaintance that turned into a friend that I valued very much but we ended up getting drunk and hooking up because he assured me our friendship will stay the same but it's been a week and I feel like I have to avoid him like the plague because I don't want to look like some crazy ho. I want to know how to fix this or how to talk to him or at least how long I have to ""wait"". :("

1g17d2,1,2013-06-10,My gf [21] of 2.5 years just broke up with me [20],MrDrProfesorPatrick,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g17d2/my_gf_21_of_25_years_just_broke_up_with_me_20/,"I met my girlfriend our freshmen year of college on the first day of classes in band. We hit it off, enjoying the company of a new friend in a large, very foreign university (I was from out of state, and most of her friends did not go on to college, so we had almost no friends in the area). A couple months later we began dating, which was my first relationship ever.

Due to my lack of experience, I have made some classic blunders throughout our years together. We had our good times, and we had some bad times as well. I was used to living at home with my parents as two of my best friends, while she came from a home where her parents were off at work during the afternoons, so she came home from school and basically lived by herself from 4th grade onwards. So our biggest issues always stemmed from my lack of independence.

I always knew that she got annoyed at most of my jokes (I tell lots of crummy/corny jokes and laugh at immature things a lot), but she never got too upset by those. But she did get really angry when I was unable to hang out with her and her friends from home. 

She comes from a very rural town, with most of her friends working on farms or in other blue-collar lines of work. Whereas I come from a white-collar family that sent me to private school for 4th -12th grade. So we had very different backgrounds, and different tastes in activities and lifestyles. Anyways, it was really hard for me to find common ground with her friends, especially the guys (its a lot harder for me to fit in with guys than girls for reasons I cannot explain). And since most of her friends are guys, she sees me as unable to talk to her friends at all.

Anyways, I thought we were doing ok together despite our differences. A month ago, I even drove across the country (4 days of driving) with her to get her to her summer internship. We had a great time, and saw many cool places and enjoyed our time together on our first college road trip.

A week ago she got upset with me because I didn't always remember to check my phone for messages from her. I felt guilty because she is on the other side of the country from all of her friends, and I should have been more communicative with her to comfort her being alone out there. I promised to text more, and did improve my response time.

However, after a couple of days I had one of those really grey days, where everything just seemed impossible and I felt like I was going to lose at life. I told her I felt like we weren't as close as we were a month ago, and she told me we aren't. (She has been in at least 5 real relationships during high school, but never anything longer than a year) I told her that it sometimes seems like I love her more than she loves me. She agrees with me, and asks me if I am trying to break up with her. I tell her no. A lot more words along these lines pass back and forth, but I firmly say I am not asking for a breakup. 

Today, I apologized for that night. I told her that looking back on it, I had realized that I was basically trying to get her to prove that she loved me. I had been in a kind of stupor, like I had been drunk or something (except it was depression). She then says that she has been talking with one of our mutual friends, and she found out that she could not think of a single positive thing about me. Even though she tells me that I put a lot more effort and care into our relationship, she cannot think of the positive aspects about me, she can only see all of the negative things. 

She tells me that she has been thinking about breaking up for a long time now, and that she thinks we are too different to work. She can't see herself marrying me, and that she thinks our relationship is too lopsided to work. We talked for a little while, while I tried to make sure she was positive this is what she wants (the talking was very spread out though, we both were crying for the entire two hour conversation).

She says this is what she wants, so we are done. We were in love, and I still love her. We both told each other that we grew a lot and are different and better people because of each other. But we shall be different on our own paths.

This is my story. I just wanted to share, I don't know if made me feel any better, but maybe it will.

I know that this is probably for the best, and it is important for someone like me to experience the pain of a break up to mature. 

The biggest immediate problem I see is that 95% of my friends are in band, and my ex (wow that feels weird calling her that) was in my section. I don't know yet how I will feel seeing her when classes start again, but I am afraid that I will not be able to do band because of the emotional upheaval it will cause me. But band is where I have all of my fun in college. It's where I hang out with my friends, and where all of my favorite memories are from (in college). If I quit band, I will have nothing and nobody left to be with. My ex was my best friend. I will be so utterly alone..."

I was living in his apartment at the time and he asked me to move out. I lost a lot when I left - boyfriend/best friend, job, internship that was starting soon, rape crisis center training that was starting soon, feeling of security and being loved, having somebody there to talk to, having somebody to care for.

I'm having a really rough time.  Family is scared that I will hurt myself.  Sometimes I think about doing it. A few nights ago I hurt my hand when I was drunk and its scarring now.  I don't want to go to therapy. I went to a lady a few days ago and she was okay.  She knew me in high school.  She thinks I'm manic depressive.  Definitely was the boost to my self esteem that I was needing (read as sarcasm).

I'm going back to school in the fall where I just graduated.  About an hour from him.  I want to get back together with him, but I don't know if he really wants me or loves me anymore.  He says that he's an idiot, and made a mistake, and wants me to move back in with him for the summer.

I'm excited for school in the fall, I think.  I feel useless being unemployed and having nothing to do.  The people who live in this town (I'm living with my parents now) are people that got ""stuck"" here - no education, have children, etc.  I'm terrified of becoming them. Furthermore, they use a lot of drugs. I'm over that scene.

I don't feel right. I take lots of walks at night to relieve my anxiety.  I've chewed holes in my mouth that are bloody during the day.  My smoking habit has gotten worse, I drink every night, and I've been taking some xanax to help calm me. Nothing is working.

I want him back. I want my life back.  I want my sanity back and my peace back.  I'm furious and depressed and feel panicky all day long.  

I could vent more, but that was already a wall of text.  I want to talk to somebody, but I don't know who.  Have been calling the anxiety and suicide hotlines to talk to people, but they're no help. Say the same nice things over and over ""It will all work out!"" ""you're a smart girl, I bet you're pretty too!"" ""You'll find someone new!"" ""You'll be able to get a job!""

I want to end this. I want to leave all of this. I want to go back."
1g0ytz,1,2013-06-10,"[UPDATE] My (F23) boyfriend (M25), who I'm not sure about, is moving to my city and planning on living with me. We're going apartment hunting for the next 2 weeks - how do I say what I truly feel?",throw-away-777,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g0ytz/update_my_f23_boyfriend_m25_who_im_not_sure_about/,"[Original Post - posted in /r/relationships](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1fsyqg/my_f23_boyfriend_m25_who_im_not_sure_about_is/)

So, my (f23) boyfriend (m25) of 3.5 years was coming to visit me for 2 weeks to do a rotation for his internship. He is done with grad school in July and the plan was always for him to move to my city at that time, so we were also going to use these 2 weeks to find apartments together.

I knew before him coming that I wanted to break up. I actually broke up with him for like 1 day about a week or so ago, but then took it back in a moment of panic/weakness/regret/guilt. You can read more about that in the original post. The first few hours of him visiting were incredibly awkward - lots of small talk, weirdness, etc, and absolutely no feelings from my end. So I knew that I needed to do this. I just didn't know when to do so. Finally around midnight of the first night, we just have the talk... and I tell him, I don't want to move in together. I said, my decision is that I do not want to be in a relationship anymore, but it's your decision how you want this to all play out. I personally want us to make the most of these next two weeks because you are my best friend, etc. Lots of crying, lots of talking about good times, bad times, things we don't like about eachother, things we wish were different, things we would never take back or regret, etc. We hugged eachother and it was actually extremely non-dramatic. No one made any painful digs at each other. No one said anything they would regret. He agreed with everything I said about our relationship and although it was in no way mutual, we are working together to figure out what our lives after this are going to look like. 

This is his 2nd night staying here and things are alright. Every couple of hours or so, we cry and talk, but overall I think everything is going to be okay. I can see us being genuine friends for the rest of our lives, at least once time has healed us both. I know it is going to take some time to allow the emotions to subside before we can see/talk to each other after he leaves but it's something both of us want to do. 

My question is, what should we do after he leaves? Ultimately we want to remain in contact, make visits, phone calls, etc, as best friends but we know that we can't do that until the love emotions have gone away. I understand a lot of people recommend no contact but it's hard because neither one of us has a whole lot of support and we're both in cities far from home and not sure of where life is going to take us. I do not want us to get back together, and I never want to send mixed signals, but I care deeply about him and I want to support him and help him and all that good stuff. I'm not sure what we should do that will allow us to be genuine friends down the road. Any advice?

TL;DR: Broke up with boyfriend of 3.5 years because I am no longer physically/sexually attracted to him and because I want to discover myself and live freely for a while. He took it well and we are spending the next 2 weeks together doing friend things and talking things through. Wondering about how we should behave after he leaves if, ultimately, we want to be lifelong friends?"
1g0oam,6,2013-06-09,My [19/F] boyfriend [20/M] is acting like our relationship is doomed--is he right? How can I convince him otherwise? (cross-post),[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g0oam/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_is_acting_like_our/,"I wasn't sure if this belonged here or in r/relationship_advice but...

My boyfriend (20M) and I (19F) have been dating for over two years. Our first year together he went off to college 450 miles away while I was still in high school. Although the distance seemed intimidating, it wasn't that bad considering I was making multiple college trips to his area and we were able to see each other several times. I think the longest we went without seeing each other was maybe two or three months.

My freshman year in college I decided to go to a school about 100 miles away from him. We saw each other about every other week (or so it seemed...the distance was practically painless now).

Come this summer, he decided to take up an internship near his college town while I am at home. Again, we are 450 miles apart and he works a full-time job 5x/week. Although I haven't seen him since he's moved, we've been maintaining regular conversation (text, phone calls, Skype); however, I have decided to transfer schools and will now be 750 miles away from him (10.5 hour drive). Our breaks don't really match up, and it seems like the next time I will see him (after this upcoming visit) will not be for around another five months...he expects to continue his internship at his same location next summer, but I am unsure as to where I will be during summertime.

While we've had the ""do we still want to do this"" talk once before and we both agreed we do, he proposed another ""serious talk"" today. A few nights ago he told me ""I can't say I'm excited or even very optimistic about it [our renewed LDR]"" and ""I want to be with you but the distance makes it so much harder than just 'wanting to be with you.'""
Not more than an hour ago we had about an hour-lonng Skype call where many tears were shed. He basically thinks that our relationship is doomed and will only get worse from here on out. Although he insists he still cares about me and doesn't want for us to break up, he believes our break-up is inevitable. He said that he doesn't believe he has been a good enough boyfriend because of the strain the distance has put on our relationship. He feels like he has had a relationship with his phone and computer, and not me the person (which I disagree with). He said ""no matter how good two people are as a couple it doesn't matter if they can't see each other."" Not only does he think it necessary that we break up, but, once/if we do, he doesn't think he will be able to talk to me/see me anymore because it would be just be a painful reminder and temptation. I am heartbroken, slightly confused, and in disagreement with him--I believe that we could make it work, even though it would be extremely difficult. I want to stay with him so badly and can see us having a successful future together, it's just a matter of making it through these last years of college together. He obviously seems less optimistic than I do, but does our break-up really seem necessary and unavoidable? My boyfriend is normally very logical and rational, so I'm afraid that he might actually be right, but I just can't see this being the only option.

Oh, and did I mention I am planning on visiting him in two weeks? He still wants me to come and for it to be our ""goodbye""...

**TL;DR: Boyfriend and I have worked the LDR before, but he feels our relationship is slowly falling apart because of it. He thinks that breaking up is our only option, despite his feelings for me, but I still strongly believe we could make it work.**"
1g0l8x,5,2013-06-09,Me[23M] in a LDR with my girlfriend [23F]. We've been together 9 months and she's showing signs of helplessness.,pylon567,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g0l8x/me23m_in_a_ldr_with_my_girlfriend_23f_weve_been/,"I'll try to be as informative as I can. *Please ask if there's anymore information that will be of help.*

Both me and my girlfriend met last mid-August and everything has been fine. We've rarely argued, get along very well, and enjoy each other's company. 

Over the past months and throughout our relationship, she has times where she is depressed and nothing I seem to do will help. Any suggestion I make is shot down and I feel like she is wanting to wallow in bad moods even though I am there to help. Very small things can put her over the edge if she's not having a good day.  We've talked about it when she is feeling better and she noticed it and has tried to work on it more. 

Personally, I don't find them out of the ordinary since everyone has their moments and no one is perfect. She also has the stresses of civil engineering grad school and I *know* that can be a daunting thing to deal with. 

My issue that I want to seek advice for today is the idea of being in a LDR. We both really care for each other and are willing to try and make it work. Currently, I am finishing up a summer course in State College, PA and will earn my degree at the end of July. Right now, she is in Baltimore working in an internship that has extended a job offer once she is done at the end of December. 

With the little amount of money I still have, I worked it out to come visit her not this weekend, but the one before. It was very good and we enjoyed each other's company like usual. We plan on trying to visit a bit more if it is permitting. 

Now for my dilemma. She has always wanted/needed to cuddle when she is depressed, which I understand. She also doesn't have many hobbies outside of relaxing with her cat or watching the occasional TV series. Most of the time she doesn't carry her attention long enough to be genuinely interested in something for very long and can become bored easily. I have made it clear before we had some minor distance between us that she can't always depend on cuddling me to be the #1 thing to cheer her up because sometimes I may not be there. 

I've suggested taking up a hobby, but nothing I've said has helped and because I'm not there, she'll get bored *very* easily. Although, there are times where she is completely fine and we're talking via Skype, phone, and texting. 

I'd like to know your opinions on what I can do? I feel at a lost because I've never really met a person that has very little interest in hobbies or attempting to try them. There has been some resentment when I'm indulging on my hobbies like sports, video games, books, etc that I'm not spending much time with her. It's very tough on me because I feel anything I even say isn't going to help and it's incredibly frustrating when I'm there and she doesn't want to do anything. 

**TL:DR: Girlfriend of ~9 months is dealing with depression and boredom. I don't know what to do when suggestions are shot down and temporary distance between us.**"

He says he's been depressed his whole life, and doesn't know what happiness actually feels like. He has OCD as well, and his hands are always chapped from washing. He's told me about some of the intrusive thoughts he's had.  

My boyfriend and I try to take him out, distract him, and help in some little way, but we're both busy and summer is here so we won't be able to.  

I'm worried because the last two summers have been terrible for him, taking any progress he's made and throwing deep into his depression. He stays busy, with jobs and internships, but last summer he almost committed suicide, he only didn't because he called his parents and couldn't go through with it, knowing how hurt they'd be.  

He has trouble sleeping at night, and I think has medication for it. I know he has at least one thing he is on, but he hates the idea of being reliant on drugs and won't talk about them.  

Whenever we talk about his problems, I see opportunity and new things to try, but he only says he's tired of trying and doesn't think anything will help.  

He goes to a therapist I think weekly, but it's not his first therapist and I don't think it's ever helped much. I got the feeling he doesn't tell the therapist quite everything, and his parents even less.  

I don't know what I can do to help, if anything. It's been going on for so long, an he's just getting worse, but I feel like he's using all the resources I can think of already. If anyone has any ideas, it would be greatly appreciated. We're about to be on summer break, and with how close he's gotten to killing himself the last two summers, I'm really worried and apprehensive

My girlfriend is working at a sleep away summer camp 2 hours away from me for the summer as we are home from college. She is going to be very busy working there and chances are I'll only see her 3ish times for the next 3 months. She also does not have many opportunities to talk on the phone or text. She is having a great time there and has made awesome friends, I'm really happy for her. My issue is, she seems very focused on her time there, spending time with her new friends and doesn't express excitement to wanting to make plans on her own with me on her days off.  I just can't help but to feel left out and not very loved lately by her. I want her attention.

I'm not worried about her feelings for me, I know she's very in love with me, I know she is just making the best of her time while there and is enjoying her self with new friends. I just need advice on how to get her attention and make her WANT me, and make her feel like she's missing out on time with me. 

I've already begun picking up a few hobbies like running/working out everyday, learning iphone development, hiking/camping with friends every week, and I also work 40 hours a week at my internship. When we do talk I've been trying to express excitement about all the fun I'm having and how excited I am that I'm exercising again, she seemed happy for me, but that didn't really bring out the chase on her end. 

I'm trying to not be clingy by missing her too much and I'm trying to not seem desperate for her attention. I'm trying to keep myself busy and still enjoy my time by myself and with friends.  I just can't help but to think about her all the time and miss her attention. 

Any advice?"
1g5qa9,4,2013-06-11,I have terrible separation anxiety.,[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/1g5qa9/i_have_terrible_separation_anxiety/,"I (20/f) am currently going to college six hours away from home, where he (my boyfriend) is. I never realized that this was a problem, I just thought I missed him a lot, but my heart feels way too heavy from missing him.

It's not so terrible that I'm dysfunctional, but it's absolutely distracting me from my school work that I'm doing right now.

I'm not obsessed with him, and I wouldn't say I'm in love with him just yet (though I'm absolutely falling for him, pretty hard). We've only been dating for three weeks, for fucks sake. I don't want to feel this terrible when I'm away from him.

Is separation anxiety like this normal?

Is there anything to be done about it?

Should I tell him, or keep it to myself? It's a little embarrassing, and while I don't want to hide it from him I don't want to make it his problem.

I currently don't have a therapist or any professional help available to me (and won't for about three months).

Edit: Oh, I should probably tell you all that my separation anxiety pretty much destroyed my last relationship. I never really identified it and just saw it as normal, hence didn't control it. During the last bit of my previous relationship, my ex told me he was going to consider an internship that would keep him away from me for months, and I had the nerve to get angry at him. Yes, I am embarrassed with my behavior, I do see how it's very very wrong. I can control my actions now, but I just wish I knew how to control what I feel."

Reading through some of the problems people talk about in this subreddit, my problem sounds like barely a problem at all but I think just having an ear would be helpful.
So to begin, I’m a University student working towards a degree in Computer Science. I’m currently working at a tech company as an intern and will be finishing up at the end of August at which point I’ll begin my 4th and final year. At the same time I’m taking summer school because I had a rough start during my first year and need to make up a couple courses. Here’s where my problems begin. The company I work at is monotonous and boring, I am the first in line for tech support and every day I deal with people who have never touched a computer and even when that’s not the case the work is still something that’s frustrating. We recently went through layoffs, it was my first time going through such a thing and even though I wasn’t cut, I found myself effected. I feel so toxic. Every time I get work I find my blood boiling because the company is going nowhere, all the other employees have verbally trashed the company and because what I’m doing is not relevant to my degree.

I also mentioned summer school. My program requires I take an abstract math course, something I have always been extremely weak at. I started off alright but slipped up and now I’m in a constant state of mental hopelessness because failing the course means I get a fail on my transcript, I wasted hundreds of dollars, I wasted time, and I will have to waste more money and time to retake the course in the upcoming semester. I also keep on beating myself up because I didn’t have the foresight to take easier electives over the summer when I knew I would be working.

I know I sound silly, whiny and ungrateful. I’m complaining about paid work being boring and school being hard. I know it’s my fault that I accepted an internship for a crappy position and was stupid enough to take a tough course while having a limited amount of free time but right now I’m in a mental gutter where sometimes I'll put my face into my hands and cry on my commute home. 

Thank you for reading, I appreciate it."

1g3n50,0,2013-06-11,The purpose of the Irish American Left,[deleted],irishamericanleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishamericanleft/comments/1g3n50/the_purpose_of_the_irish_american_left/,"The Irish American Left is not a place to idly post news articles and other mere factoids.

This subreddit is meant for action.

And action we will take.

The first order of business is to recruit.

We need the following:

1. A Lead Member for Each of the Fifty States

1. Programmers

1. Web Designers

1. Political Strategists

1. Communications Experts

1. Field Organizers

1. Candidates

1. Fundraisers

The first step in creating a true Irish-American left movement is to establish a lead member in each of the fifty states.  Lead members will be responsible for the following:

1. Posting a state thread here complete with links to maps of state districts for both state and federal house and senate districts

1. Recruiting members and candidates in each of the aforementioned districts whether in person or online

1. Keeping track of which districts have Irish-American left candidates running in them, and keeping track of the candidates themselves

1. Maintaining the primary lines of communication with the national group for their state

1. Communicating the wants and needs of their state's constituants

1. Assisting with the recruitment of field organizers

1. Working with communications experts and political strategists to shape the message for each particular state

1. Being the face of the organization in each relevant state

The second step in creating a true Irish-American Left movement is to establish a team of programmers.  Programmers will be responsible for the following:

1. Establishing group databases

2. Establishing voter databases based on dumped voter record info

3. Working with Political Strategists to code voter databases for each type of race, be it state or federal house or senate district, or statewide

4. Establish working databases and easy user interfaces to give the movement the power of knowledge sufficient to win political races

5. Perform any other duties as required if the programmers concur.

The third step in creating a true Irish-American left movement is to establish a team of web designers.  Web designers will be responsible for the following:

1. Selecting a domain name in consultation with communications experts to be purchased by the national team

1. Designing a website to be functional for the general public 

1. Work with state lead members, political strategists, and communications experts to design state-specific websites and websites for each race

The fourth step in creating a true Irish-American left movement is to bring on board political strategists.  Political strategists should have some upper level campaign experience and will be responsible for the following:

1. Working with other team members to establish the capability of conducting district-specific polls in any state in the union

1. Working with hired consultants and other PhDs in performing political polls and developing strategy

1. Working with communications consultants and PhDs to draft speeches, messages, and advertising that will be effective by conforming with message polling

1. Becoming part of the national group and being assigned states to assist and track in their political process

The fifth step in creating a true Irish-American left movement is to establish a team of communications experts. Communications experts will be responsible for the following:

1. Working with the national team and consultants to craft messages that ring true with the American people

1. Working with political strategists to draft speeches, messages, and advertising that will be effective by conforming with message polling

1. Becoming part of the national group and being assigned states to assist and provide messaging expertise in their political process

1. Communicating directly with the media when necessary

The sixth step in creating a true Irish-American left movement is to establish a lead field worker in each of the fifty states. Lead field workers will be responsible for the following:

1. Recruiting new members and interns into the organization, whether physically or virtually

1. Understanding the unique nuances of the neighborhoods to which they are assigned and communicating these to political strategists

1. Developing the GOTV effort for each and every district in which we have a member running

1. Working with web designers, political strategists, and communications experts to design regional-specific media

The seventh step in creating a true Irish-American left movement is to establish a candidates in each of the fifty states. Candidates will be responsible for the following:

1. Looking at the list of open positions developed by the state lead members and programmers and identifying the position they wish to run for

1. Asking the national group for an endorsement

1. Maintaining the message of an Irish American left that seeks to rebuild the middle class

1. Identify local fundraisers and introduce them to political strategists

1. Refuse to take any political donations from Wall Street

1. Work with field organizers, lead state members, political strategist, and communications experts to make sure candidates are victorious

This will not be easy.

But nothing the Irish-American left has ever done has been easy.

We thrive on hard work.

And we will establish this.

Generations be damned.

They don't matter.

**The middle class in America will not fall on our watch!**

We will take political action.

We will not be conspicuous.

We will not have a lot of money.

But we will have smarts.

And we will prevail.

1g3mxf,32,2013-06-11,Figured this was the best place to put this: My Story,obi_wan_knobie,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1g3mxf/figured_this_was_the_best_place_to_put_this_my/,"I would like to preface this by saying: this may or may not sound good, but I don't give much of a shit. This is my story, and that's what matters to me. Also, keep in mind that through all of this I rode my bike to work... a good solid 30 minuets of hard riding, because I didn't have a car.


I'm young, very young. I recently graduated high school. But I've had a love for cooking for years. I think I finally figured out where I got the bug. I went out with my father for dinner about a week and a half ago to Carabas (yeah yeah, I know, not great, but my father decided it was the best place that wasn't a 45 minuet drive away), and was sitting at the bar in front of the open kitchen there. It's the same seat I've sat in umpteen times. I'm watching the cooks doing the same thing I've come to love, and remember seeing them when I was 5-6 years old doing it. I believe it was there that I first thought ""That's so cool! I want to do that some day!"" The thought was then misplaced, and filled in by the usual boyhood dreams (army man, cop, firefighter, tractor driver), until my eventual stepmother moved in with my father. She cooked at home, and got me and my younger sister involved. From there it blossomed, as my taste buds grew up and I tried new foods. I started watching some t.v. cooking/food shows (only Good Eats and No Reservation), and reading culinary related books (guess who wrote them). Eventually, as I came upon reading The Nasty Bits, the thought was brought back to mind. As Anthony Bourdain talks about the post-work activities, and the bond, that permeate the field I realized that it was something I really wanted to do, at least conceptually. I had been cooking at home on off occasions for years, and anyone that ate anything I made loved it. So I figured I had some skill. But how to break into the industry? Low and behold, my school required a 3 day internship in the junior year. 

About 3 months before I have to actually go to it I'm already setting it up. I first walk into a local gastropub in Winter Park, get a card, shoot off an email, and still to this day I haven't gotten one back. Next place I go it one of the best establishments in town, on there corner of Park Ave. and New England. The bar is open, but they don't start the dinner service for another hour. I ask one of the girls standing behind the podium if I could speak with the manager. The manager come sour 5 minuets later and asks what's going on, and I tell him about the internship and how I'd like to spend those three days working there. He says that sounds more like a deal for the Chef de Cuisine, and that he'll send him right out. I'm standing there waiting (for only about 2 minuets) thinking it'll be some mid 30-something, clean cut, clean white coated guy who will take one look at me and say ""get lost."" As I'm musing I hear ""you must be the guy"" from my right. I turn and look and he's 6' 4"", bearded, with a pony tail, and spots all over his coat.

 I reply ""yes, sir. I am"" 
""Well, go on then, give me your story."" 
""well sir.."" 
""Chef.""
 ""well chef, my school requires me to do a 3 day internship, and I was wondering if I could somehow do it here. I know I'll probably just be doing dishes or something, but I want to see what it's like to work in real kitchen."" 
""What days?""
 ""march 13th through the 15th."" 
""Do you have a chef's jacket?"" 
""no, but I can get one."" 
""Okay, here's my card. My name is Derek. Get the Jacket, bring a chef's knife, and give me a call. My cell number is on the card."" 
""yes chef."" 

I leave, elated, and not knowing in the slightest what I'm in for. The months pass, I get my jacket, I get my mother's knife sharpened, and I get my biked fixed up so I can ride to work. I pop by the restaurant a few times for dinner and send Derek several texts to get info on what to do for the internship. 
Before I know it the day is upon me. I was told be in by noon. It's 11:15 and I walk through the back door into the kitchen, there's some guy there cleaning and I stand there waiting...and waiting.... and waiting.... eat about 11:30 Derek appears, shows me around, and sets me on my first job. Pizza sauce. From the moment on I barely stopped until 5 that afternoon for family meal. I stayed that night until 10:30 and rode my bike home. The next two days were about the same. However, on that final Friday Derek is talking bout the art festival the next day, and I j ump on the opportunity. I tell him that if he needs me I can come in. After a little back and forth I convince him. He says ""lunch starts at 11."" 
""I'll be in by 10:15."" 

9:55 that next morning I walk in and encounter two guys in the kitchen that I haven't met yet (due to their schedules), and introduce myself. That day I'm there until 1 the next morning. I ride home with my prizes, two cans of PBR and a couple of cigs, and drink and smoke my way home on my bike. 

A week or two goes by and I text Derek and let him know I can come in on my spring break. I intern all of my spring break (save the last weekend which was Easter, which I celebrate even though I'm not religious... more of a family thing than religious). I come back in two or three more times on long weekends.

 May, and my birthday, roll around. Derek and his fiancé come by my birthday dinner and I'm given the good news that they created a position just for me for the summer (prep cook... they didn't have one before). I'm elated and decide to spend some serous money on some serious steel for work (a Mac... which I love and recommend to everyone now). I work my summer, two days on the clock and at least one more off of it. It's hard, dirty, and not always the nicest environment. But I tough it out, dealing with an asshole sous chef and an executive chef that can be even worse. But through all of it I still would wake up on days that I got to go in and was happy and proud of what I had. Eventually summer came to a close and it was back to school for my senior year. I didn't have as much time to work. But I still kept in touch with all the guys, and on breaks I'd go in.

Through the whole thing I was unsure of myself and if I was worthy enough of being proud. I was slow, I had no idea what I doing, and I felt like I hindered more than helped. But not too long ago one of my friends from the place gave me a great compliment on another guys Facebook status that I too commented on. I had commented that even though I was young I still shared their passion, even through all the shit they gave me and all the hard times. My friend replied with:

&gt;Jordan...it's part of the industry. we need to weed out the weak links and unsaturate our beautiful profession from all the bullshit artists and wannabes. And bring it back to the misfits the ones that belong in a world of hurt... Those that bleed and smile about it...the ones that give up everything in the name of love...and since people can't handle that devotion we chefs live alone and love what we do....chef life...chef love...chef.


That, to me, said that they believed in me because I kept coming back. 

I'm now headed off to college to get a degree in business before I go to culinary school. People have told me that I won't be making that much. I know, but after being in that heat, that little slice of Hell, I don't want to do anything else. I love it. It's a rush like nothing else. It not going to be easy, and it won't always be fun. But those times when it is, and the satisfaction I'll get from serving people good food will make up for the crap. I just wanted to share this with r/kitchenconfidential, and see what you guys think.


P.S. Later in my college career I'll be picking up a job in a kitchen somewhere in town.

And if so, where should I look to find such people I can trust?

I started hanging out with this girl midway through last summer who I met through playing pickup soccer in town. We started talking and I ended up taking her out to lunch for our first date. It went okay, but I was incredibly nervous the entire time. This girl is an hb9/hb10, no lie, and that was my first real date I'd ever been on. I didn't do anything stupid, it wasn't really awkward at all, I just didn't really feel it was a *great* date. But overall I was very proud of myself. Anyway I couldn't nut up to taking her out a second time after she had to cancel on me the first time we were supposed to go on a second date. Needless to say, summer ended and we departed to our separate schools.

I told myself I was done with her, just so I didn't cripple myself by getting stuck on this girl. But, come this summer, I started organizing pickup soccer games 3-4 times a week, and she attends nearly all of them. We also have been hanging out at social gatherings with our friends way more often this summer too, but I never felt comfortable escalating there due to the presence of all of our friends (And I know quite a few of my friends are also very attracted to her). So I started texting her again a few weeks ago, and last night during the USMNT game I set up a date to go see The Internship at 10 tonight. She's a bit shyer than I am, and I've never really felt comfortable escalating with any girl, but it's proving to be 10x harder with this one.

I want to fucking kiss this girl tonight. I really fucking do. But I really only just came out of my shell last summer for the first time in my life, and I'm way behind on numerous social aspects of life. I've adapted fairly well, and have begun to build up my confidence, but this is something I know is going to be really hard for me to do.

So please, if anyone has any advice or tips for me tonight, fire off in the comments. I really want to make this girl mine, but it's quite a big first step for me. I'm hoping that putting my feelings down in text will help to squelch a lot of these nerves and will get me in the proper mindset."
1g70cu,3,2013-06-12,Signs [Pt. 2/2],zanatas,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g70cu/signs_pt_22/,"[Part 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1fzll2/signs_pt_12/]

A month before

- You're not coming here. I'm sure of that.
- But what do you mean? I'm starting to set things up, It's a promise.
- I saw it on the tarot. The cards told me you weren't coming.
- What? Girl, you are crazy. I'm telling you, I WILL make this trip happen.
- But I still believe in the cards… they were never wrong.
- Yeah, yeah, like you are a professional at this…


And with every strong sting, a different random memory came to his mind. His forearm had almost nothing but flesh showing. He shouldn't touch that part again; it must be hurt really badly for making him pass out just with the pain. Actually it looked like it had a pretty bad infection. Maybe he had been there longer than he thought.

After untying himself with that plan, he'd never think that God had forsaken him anymore. It was truly a miracle. But now it was time to look for an exit. At least his hands were almost not hurt, and he could feel the cold stone wall with them. He started to tap the stones to see if there were any loose ones.
No success.	

-FUCK!

“FUCK! I’ve been here doing this for hours, and I didn’t find one single stone that was moving… and I feel more and more tired… even though it’s so cold in here in can feel the sweat running on my back.”

His eyelids started to shut… he wandered what time it was, what DAY it was even. 

“And all of this because of a girl. It’s always about one, isn't it? She just HAD to live in the same town as this mysterious FREAK wanted to meet us in… and I just HAD to adjust my schedule to stop by there and meet her… if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't need more money, and I wouldn't even consider this shit…”

The memories of the few hours that he could remember before waking up on that damn cell came to his mind… his red light key chain… that was probably still laying in he same place it was before.

His memory wasn’t so good with appointments, but it was incredible with images. He could close his eyes and remember the exact scene that he was quietly enjoying before having the stupid idea of calling the number. His key chain, right over his book about neural nets… Tired and kind of drunk, still maybe because of the drugged water, his stream of consciousness started to follow an unexpected path.
	
""Key chain… neural nets… math… God, my head sucks so much for math, but still it’s damn interesting… predicting nature’s forms… shit, I couldn't predict THIS. I should have known that something wrong would go on… but not THIS wrong… predict THAT, fibonacci!”

His eyes, almost shut, started to fix his sight on a point on the opposite wall. And as they were blurring up, he started to see the completely unexpected: numbers carved on the stones. 

""What?!""

He was so worried about getting a stone that moved that he didn't even notice how they looked. After a sudden flash of his consciousness with the surprise, he was once again fully alert. As he looked at the numbers closely, he realized small rocks with even smaller numbers surrounding them. The rocks with big numbers formed a square that went from the ground to the height of his waist. Numbered from 0 to 8, had the small stones filling the space between four of them. These small rocks had the numbers 11, 12, 13, 21 and 24 on them. 

Having just remembered about the Fibonacci, he thought that it was too convenient to be true.

“Okay, I know God tried to help me today, but he wouldn’t help me THAT much, would he? But what the hell, here goes nothing.”

After gathering all the strength he had left, he pushed the rock. He was seconds away from giving up, but then… then 0-rock moved. Then the 1. Then he tried to push it again, and it worked. As he continued, his heart was pounding harder and harder. The sweat running on his back didn't stop for a second.

When he was done, he heard a click.  A boulder just popped out of it’s place, right behind him. It was very small, but he could feel that some light was coming out of it. Maybe if he could just fit his arm through…
As he slipped his arm inside the hole, he felt the most humongous pain he had ever felt, as the rocks rubbed on his wounds. Almost fainting, he carried on, until his arm found the end of the hole. He felt a switch and flicked it.
He must have been in the darkened room for so long that his eyes couldn't take any light at all. The small lightbulb that he had lit blinded him. And with the scare, he pulled his arm out quickly enough to make the stones rag what was left of his skin off. 


5 days before

The last thing his blurred sight could see after taking the drugged water was one of his friends, laying underneath the limo's seat. His eyes had a horrid stare, one he had only seen once in his life, many ears ago.


- DEAD!
	
He yelled as he woke up from the thick torpor he had entered because of the pain.  He swore that he would do anything for something like that to never happen again.

“So that's it… one of them is dead! I must have erased that memory completely because of the shock!”

It took him a while to realize that the room he was in was mildly lit now, but still that didn't calm his despair. Nothing would. He was trapped, and his friend was dead. As he thought of that, he remembered about the other one. Where would he be? Was he ok?
The sweat was unbearable now. He was colder and colder, but the sweat was still running. For the first time, he thought that wasn't very usual.
As he felt the horrid cut and the warm flesh exposed through a slash on the thick layer of skin on his back, he screamed. But not as loud as he did when he felt parts of his vertebrae exposed. Shocks and small points of numbness being created all over his body as he slipped his fingers through them.

He screamed and screamed. A ghastly howl crossed and reverberated throughout the silent room. 



Hours later.

He was seated and couldn’t move. The low-pitched voice of the man on his ear woke him up.

- So then, you almost found out how to get out of the room huh, kiddo? You got lucky. Most people never figured out how to do that. But your arm got hurt pretty badly. And we got a little heavy-handed with that cut on your back huh? But hey, it’s all about the visual fun! Recording this one would have been a blast!

Adrenaline never rushed so strongly on his veins. All the strength he could gather was used for just a whisper

- But… why did you… do… this? 

The man with the low-pitched voice laughed loud.

- Hey kiddo… this is the moment of truth. You’re gonna die either way. So you can pick. Do you want to know why, or do you want to just die? But before you state your answer, remember: knowledge is painful!

He didn’t give a damn about pain anymore. After all he had gone through, it meant almost nothing now. But dying like that and not knowing why, he could never find peace that way. Once again, he gathered all his strength and said

- The… truth…

- Well… it was YOUR choice, remember that!

The small amount of blood he still had started to pour from his mouth as the cold blade entered his stomach. When he thought  that adrenaline would make him go into shock and not feel anything, he was horribly wrong. He remembered the pain he felt as he got his skinless forearm rubbed on the rough surface on the rock, how horrible it was then and how he wished to feel that instead of the butcher knife dilacerating his intestines and muscles. With absolutely no strength for screaming but still, feeling the intense pain, he could only hear a familiar voice.

- The truth is I'm not a liar… my mother DID dream I was going to die. Just the night before I killed her!

He couldn't believe it. His own friend! That made absolutely no sense at all! Why would he deceive everyone just to play this kind of sick game?! 
The knife had gone all the way up till it reached his ribcage. The pain didn't stop at all, it just increased. All of the sudden, he felt that he could start moving again. As his friend moved the blade up and down, making the pain more and more horrid, he gathered his energy to move his arm. When he felt he could, with a quick move he grabbed the knife from his friend’s hand and pierced it right through his chest. The friend fell to the ground.
But then again a surprise came: even impaled with a butchers knife, bleeding on the ground, his friend started laughing. His laugh became louder and louder, until it was deafening.
He could feel that those were his last moments. And he realized what they say is true: he started to see all his life passing in front of him.

All the times his father beat him up as a kid, stating that his mom had died because of him. All the guilt he had always felt for the dream she had, before giving birth to him, that his father told him about: the dream where he died. His father always said it should have been him instead of her. 
Then he remembered the time he told him that he should die a slow and painful death, while beating him with a piece of wood, which had a huge metal nail that barely pierced his frontal lobe.
The time he was sent to the foster home, where they would put him on the solitaire when he stole money from another intern. All of these horrid memories he thought he'd have forgotten. 
His memory rushed right to his recent present, when he got dumped by the girl he loved and just lost it. His copy of ""1984"" by George Orwell that just helped his paranoia, which in the cover had a picture of eyes he could swear that were from a dead man.
The money his aunt had sent him along with an invitation for him to move to her house, on another state. In the invitation letter, she said that she could give him some more money for him to live on a better place.

The memories stopped flashing for a quick moment, as he looked down, with his head and ears almost exploding because of the horrid laugh of his friend, and he saw his stomach cut open and a butcher’s knife pierced through his heart.

He remembered then the countless hours he spent sculpting numbers on his wall, and painting like rocks, all the modifications he did in his basement, how he spent all his money on it. The countless cameras he had installed. The fixation he had with the fibonacci sequence - as if he could find a meaning to his life inside some mathematical sequence.

Then it all made sense. The huge cuts he did on his own back. The way he had tied himself down loosely, in a way that he would hurt himself if he just pulled the ropes, but could easily free his hands if he did it slowly. He understood how “God made him see the fibonacci on the wall”: it was just a memory from one of his personalities that turned subconscious. God didn't give him signs that he shouldn't go on his trip: the last sane parts of his mind gave him signs that he shouldn't do what he was planning to do all along!
There were no friends, they were his alternate personalities, his paranoias, figures of his id an ego who fought with each other to convince him of following his sick plan or not. The plan to punish himself for thinking about stealing his aunt's money. For killing his mother.
	
As he gave his last breath, and all faded away, he felt the despair of forsaking God, for He had not stopped him, and had not sent him any signs.
His last thoughts were

“There is no God… it was just my sick mind trying to stop itself…” 









After the man was finally dead, the Devil stopped whispering in his ears and left, laughing.

He was obsessed with Videogames, mostly WOW and other online games.
He often smelled like rotten milk and grease. No one knew why, as he would often come in with wet hair
He also sported a mild mental illness of some sort.
He wasn't a bad person and was genuinly nice, but he was.... *Weird*

I'm possibly interning there starting in 2 weeks so I want to know the places to check out if I do get this internship. Hotels can get expensive so I was just wondering if there was a place that offered temporary summer housing.

Thanks everyone!"
1g6ll8,2,2013-06-12,"I am a woman trying to get an Internship in the truck driving industry, and I'm starting to feel pretty low right now.",amazonallie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g6ll8/i_am_a_woman_trying_to_get_an_internship_in_the/,"So.. I have done my best in life.  I graduated top of my class from an Academic Prep boarding school.  I graduated on the Dean's list with 2 degrees.  I am working on my Masters Degree.

I was injured 6 years ago, and my former profession (teacher) is not possible any longer due to my injury.  I slipped on ice, and long story short, it took 5 years and 4 surgeries to put my foot back together, and now I can't stand for any great length of time. 

I tried to go back to the industry that I first started in, gaming.  However, the only job I could do was working in surveillance, and needless to say, the boys didn't take too kindly to a woman working there, let alone a woman with more gaming experience than most of them (my region had only legalized gaming 2 years before, and most started there with no previous gaming experience, I had been a dealer in another part of the country for 3 years).  I put up with it for 6 months, but when my boss left to return to Macau, he gave me the option to be laid off because he knew the guys were going to go back to the way they were, and it would drive me nuts.

After this experience, I decided I wanted to drive transports.  Note, when I'm upset, I drive.  I spent a couple of summers working my way across Canada just to be on the road.  I even drove the Alaska Highway because I wanted the challenge when I was 21.  Plus, the relative independence would allow me to be the super anal person I am when it comes to paperwork and following procedure without annoying those around me who prefer to take a less formal approach to policies and procedures.  And... face it, being injured for 5 years made me a little restless to say the least. 

So, divorced, single me, with no children.. at the age of 39, went to school and learned how to drive a transport.  I now have my license, and the last piece of the puzzle is to complete my internship.  Cake you say... well... no.

I am in New Brunswick, Canada, a less than populous region.  As it stands, only 3.9% of professional drivers are female.  Problem.. a lack of female coaches and trainers in the industry in my region.

I have called no less than 95% of the companies within a 6 hour drive of my home, and only 1 has a female trainer.  And she is on medical leave for another month or so, and then, it may be longer.

I have no problem having a male coach.  After all, this is a professional relationship and I have no interest in dating my coach.  I want to learn the ropes, and move on to my own career.  I don't want to team drive with anyone but my chihuahua.  I was married, and right now, my life is about me.  Selfish, yes, but I need to be resettled into a career and be able to sustain myself financially before I settle down with anyone.  

The reason the companies have given me as to why their coaches won't take on female students..... their WIVES!  I was like, are you kidding me???  First of all, I want to learn to drive in the real world, outside of the sterile environment of a training truck.  I am not looking to get laid.  If I were, I think I would have spent the $10,100 I spent on the course on other things to make that happen.  

Secondly, if you have that little trust in your spouse, why are you still married?  Is it because they have a decent income?  Or are you intimidated by a woman who wants to support herself.  Newsflash.  It is 2013, and you can get a job.  

I have always hated working with women, because they are petty and spiteful and hate you if you are smarter or prettier than they are.  Even if you aren't, if they think you are, that is all it takes.  So that is why I wanted to go into a more male dominated field, because I prefer working around men.  Especially one that I had no experience in, because that way I wouldn't run into the problem of the one or two men who hate women who are smart.   (And trust me, they all like to work surveillance.. not sure if it is the pseudo authority figure thing, but that group of guys was, ummm, special to say the least... first time I have ever encountered a group of men who were like that)

I'm not saying I'm smart, or I'm better than anyone else, I just know my head is full of useless knowledge because I am a nerd, and I like to read.  If someone mentions something I know nothing about, I ask questions, and then usually do a ton of reading so I will know for future reference.. it's fun to me.  I watch documentaries, and play video games.  I don't do things because they are cool.. I do things because they interest me, and I enjoy them.   Maybe it's that independent streak that annoys people.  I don't know.  Most people love talking to me, or hanging out with me because they always get to do something cool.  People call me and invite me places because they know I'll throw some random piece of information at them about something obscure while I'm tossing back a shot.  Some of my friends call me Shenny -- As in a cross between Sheldon and Penny from the Big Bang Theory LOL.

Anyway.. sorry to ramble.  I guess the point is, I'm starting to question everything that I love about myself.  It took a lot of therapy to get me to love these things about myself.  It took a lot of therapy to stop being hard on myself because I am a nerd who likes to get her nails done.  I don't want a beautiful sofa... I want a comfy gaming chair with a kick ass laptop.  I hate being stuck in a little room, and I prefer the open road and being a little free and a little different.  

All those things that I accepted and finally began to live my life for ME and not because I was trying to impress the neighbors, well, now I feel like I'm strange.  And I don't belong anywhere.   And now, I can't even get a friggen internship because I'm a girl... in an industry screaming for qualified people....

I mean how often can I take hearing.. I'm sorry, but we don't have female coaches, and our coaches' wives won't let them train women... before I just give up because I feel like I'm never going to be able to support myself because I am who I am... 

:( 

Thanks for letting me vent

1g5w94,13,2013-06-11,"facing the consequences of that ""one last time"". bad news is I have to quit for real this time, good news is that i get to quit",pine-appletrees,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1g5w94/facing_the_consequences_of_that_one_last_time_bad/,"learn from me guys, here is my story: about two months ago I started seeing a free substance abuse counselor at my school. I came to the conclusion I needed to give up the tree to focus on finishing school and getting a job/money for the summer. It was damn hard but i pulled off solid grades in my engineering courses and finally landed a full time internship. Seeing a counselor every week was a great help but I had to stop going to that because I had to move back home. I made it 40 days before I started to lose my sanity and I convinced myself that my anxiety was reason enough to smoke again. Show up for the first day on the job(after a whole semester of searching) and surprise surprise I had to take a drug test. By some ""cheating"", and a lot of luck I passed after three days sober. 

That was last thursday when i found out my drug test results. That night I smoked and it made me feel better temporarily sure. The next night I took the last of my stash and my bowl in my bag to go to a Ultimate frisbee tournament with my team. On my way to my apartment, I got pulled over suspiciously, and long story short, I fessed up to what I had on me. Now I have to go to court to try to and erase the charges of possession(only .2/.3) and paraphenialia(little bowl). I never thought something like this would happen to me.

But in the long, it'll be for the best. I will fix my problems and focus on bettering myself and not blazing up. I'm going to quit and I'm going to fucking like it! Sure I will have to jump through a lot of hoops because I wasn't careful enough, but I accept it as part of my journey and finally leaving those deceptive trees behind. My doubt, depression, and anxiety will eventually be history just like the costs of legal trouble. 

tldr:quitting for real this time. Wish me luck convincing myself as well as a judge(facing possession and paraphenialia) and my family that I'm motivated young student who is going to do big things!"

I've got another qualification coming (will know in about two to three weeks).

Now the past year I've been doing this internship in a public school acting as their ICT Coordinator. In this year I have stripped and rebuilt their network from the ground up, cleared up their systems, and generally gotten the systems used to a place where I don't need to be there all the time. One day a week suffices. The school can't hire me due to idiotic legislation here in Ireland for public services and hiring, BUT they can contract out to me.

So, contact dept of social welfare, apply for the Back To Work Enterprise Allowance, and assuming I get it, I'll be a fully registered company in about two weeks, providing ICT Support to schools ONLY. Too many companies try and be all things to all men. Schools are quite different and require a different approach.

Just wanted to share that. Rather hoping it takes off and I can make a nice living doing what I love and be able to support my family."
1ga78d,10,2013-06-13,I need help on how to not care...,[deleted],howtonotgiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1ga78d/i_need_help_on_how_to_not_care/,"I know that there's more to life than money. I hate how society revolves around it and I don't want to participate, but I have no choice. I left my job about 8 months ago, saved some money up first, but I hadn't anticipated being unemployed this long. I've been applying for jobs anywhere I can, but nobody has called me back. I have an internship which I need for school credit, but it's unpaid and also 40 miles away. I've borrowed some money from friends and family is unwilling to help me out (except my grandma, who has been awesome, but I can't borrow more from her than I already have). I had to pay almost $2k in order to register for the units for my internship through my school, which is ridiculous.

So I just got a text this morning, like I do every morning, with my bank account information. A bill was due yesterday and now I have about $400 to my name. Next week I have a car payment of $250 due. I don't know what I'm going to do from here. I feel stuck and I can't help but caring. I hate that my family is so unsupportive. I originally left my job because I was suffering through bad anxiety that was being made worse by the stressful environment of the job (retail). Anytime I even try to talk about my problems with them, they never fail to remind me that I'm the one that quit my job in the first place. My younger sister told me, ""I don't want to let you borrow money until I see that you have been trying."" That is ridiculous because I have had 3 interviews (which fell through because of my availability, which is silly because I have awesome availability, but they were looking for something else). So my family apparently thinks I'm not trying. It's hard not to give a fuck. This is something that I should be used to by now with them; they've always been very passive aggressive and non-supportive. The funny thing is that they think they're being supportive and every time I mention otherwise they think I'm being bitchy or having PMS. 

I feel stuck. I want to not care. I want to live my life by my own accord and not have to rely on anyone else. I was doing so well before I quit and I don't want to start believing them that it is my fault, when I know I am so much happier without working in the retail hell situation I was placed in. I've been on medication and am now doing so much better than I was before, where I would vomit and feel nauseous daily from the stress. Nobody seems to understand except for a few close friends, but they are living their own lives right now.

Please, I need some insight, maybe some encouraging words, or some tough love. I don't know. "

I go to a public state school that has an applied math department with a good reputation. I currently have no exams passed and no internships. I will be taking P/1 in September and FM/2 in February. I will hopefully knock out MLC next summer. I will also have all 3 VEEs complete by the time I graduate (statistics this fall, economics in spring and finance next fall).

I won't be able to have an internship next summer because I have a few summer classes I need to take in order to graduate. I'm afraid I will not be a good candidate in my area without an internship. I live near NYC and I would like to stay within the tri-state area but ideally I would love to work in Manhattan. I've read on AO that it is much more competitive in NYC and 3-4 exams plus a great GPA and multiple internships is the norm. 

What do you guys think? Will it be impossible for me to find a job in NYC with 3 exams, 3 VEEs and no internship? I would really appreciate any insight from those of you who have worked in or near NYC.

Is there anything I can do to become a more competitive candidate other than get an internship? I have some experience with computer science but nothing beyond data structures and basic algorithms. I have been programming in Java for a year but I don't like software development very much. I'm going to work on learning Excel and VBA this summer. I have wanted to learn Python (specifically for scripting) for a while. Would that be of any use to an actuary? I'm going to learn it anyway but I don't want to waste too much time on it if I could be doing something more useful.

Thanks so much for any help."

I have two promising leads right now; one is a medium/large office that focuses primarily on interior architecture and planning and the other is a medium/large office that works on a broad range of building types and even does some urban planning.

I have about 1.5 years of experience at this point, am working towards my IDP hours, and will be looking at the ARE soon. If my goal is to become licensed in a short time frame and to be a functional well-rounded architect will I be limiting myself by working for a firm who primarily deals with workplace interiors and corporate campuses? Both offices have a fantastic office culture and will take good care of me. I'm really just torn between the experience potentials.

So what do you think architects of r/architecture? What types of work/firms are best for interns fresh out of school who are trying to gain valuable experience for licensure and future practice as an architect?"

Doubt anyone will respond, or that I can handle anyone's response.

We all have one. A guy that we can compare ourselves to whenever we doubt ourselves or our self-worth, that we can safely say ""At least I ...""/""At least I'm not like that guy.""

I'm a rising senior in college studying Solar/Earth/Planetary Sciences. Rejected from every internship I've applied to. Worked in a restaurant for the past two summers, and due to the owner retiring I've had to find another job. Also rejected from everything I've applied to, even restaurants - the one thing I had experience in. To top it all off, I've never had a girlfriend - hell, I've never even gotten to first base.

To list the accomplishments of my various college friends - internship, internship, overseas internship, lab position, research assistant on campus, Summer RA, previous research position on campus, to name a few. All of which are in relationships (some with each other). High school friends - accomplish artist, world travelers, film maker, graphic artist. And here I am  sleepless at nearly 7AM, without a job, a girl, experience in my field, or hope of a successful future. 

And I know about the hardships my friends have. But the fact that you're ultra-conservative parents don't want people knowing you sleeping with your boyfriend, doesn't negate the fact that you HAVE a SO or that you have a job, or that you're one of the most well-known and like people on campus. And the fact that you have an unusual amount of bad luck, doesn't negate the fact that the first summer internship you applied for accepted you, or that you found a girlfriend at the start of college. And the fact that you didn't get an internship this summer doesn't negate the fact that you;ve been doing research during the school year for past TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

And its easy for me to want to blame my problems on the economy, or that I go to a shit school, or that I have bad luck, or that girls are bitches. But I know that the only consistent factor in my life of failings is me - that I'm the problem. I'm fucking worthless is what I am. And that's my greatest fear. 

More specifically, my greatest fear is my parents thinking I'm worthless. They've payed for me to go to college, they've payed for everything my whole life. They don't want me to worry about finances, ""Just focus on your education. when you get out, you'll have a jump on life. We don't want you to have to worry about living paycheck to paycheck, let us take care of that. Just focus on getting your degree."" My degree. Yea, my degree. My degree is worth more to me as toilet paper if I can't get a job or higher education. My greatest fear is them waking up and realizing they just sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into me, for nothing. I can already hear my father screaming at me, ""What the fuck do you mean you can't find a job! Do you know how much we've spent on you to give you the best chance?! Fuck! That's bullshit, man! I might as well have sent you to Sussex Tech and you learn how to be a plumber, goddamnit! Would have saved me a lot of fucking time and money."" And I'd just sit there with a lump in my throat, trying to hold back tears like I did when I was 8 or 9 when I fucked up. 

Often I just wish my parents would just...forget about me. Not have to worry about me. Not have to support me. Just let me go - or more likely, let me fall. I don't want to make them waste anything more on me. And I've tried telling them, but they refuse to listen. They can't fathom the idea of me not doing well in life, after all the TIME, and the MONEY, and the EFFORT they put into me. Now they don't say it like that, but they believe in me. But the only things they've put in me are time, effort and money. And they're so proud of me and my 'accomplishments'. WHAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS?! I graduated highschool? I have a 3.4 GPA? 

I'm an investment to them. Maybe they would disagree, but its true. And I've tried so hard to convince them that my stock is bad, that its going to drop to nothing soon. But they continue to have faith in their investment, and that faith is going to cost them I feel.

I just don't want them to think I'm a failure. That's all. That's really it. And I read posts here everyday. Terrible, tragic, unbelievable posts. About things I'll never have to deal with, and I think to myself what right do I have to complain about my life. I guess I really am shit, for having my parents pay my way through college and then daring to compare my 'plight' to the others on this sub. I'm a whiny, melodramatic, ungrateful little shit that can't appreciate what I have. But all I see in my life is everyone else's success, and I'm just sitting here complaining about it on reddit. And its not just spotlight syndrome, and I am in fact too late at 21.5 years old. 


tl;dr  I feel like a failure, which is the last thing I want my parents to see me as, and I have no right to complain about it on a sub like this."
1g9bzv,1,2013-06-13,I don't know if I made the right choice about college and now I'm sad all the time,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g9bzv/i_dont_know_if_i_made_the_right_choice_about/,"After high school I took a year off because I didn't know where I wanted to go to college. After a super awesome internship I decided on Montana State. It was in the mountains, far from home and everyone I knew, and had a great film program. A very competitive film program. So I took out the student loans ($30,000 because I was from out of state) and went. It was sad to be away from my family and my roommate complained about everything, but I lived on campus and had my first job. I would walk to the store and buy my own groceries. 

I'm not great at first impressions and don't make friends very easily, I spent a lot of time in my room watching hulu. When I had a day off I would walk to town and go to the little stores on main street. I counted down the days until thanksgiving break. When I got back I started counting down the days until christmas break. I wasn't doing so well in my film classes, I procrastinated way more than I should have*.

After winter break I made was kind of surprised to learn I had made a friend, she lived on my floor and was in one of my film projects for me. She had brought me back a christmas gift, we started going to dinner together every night. I told her that I wanted to go to more parties, she started taking me to them. She was a snowboarder so she had access to an easy set of friends. She shared her friends with me and the last three weeks before summer break were awesome, exactly how I expected college to be. Frisbee, barbecues, block parties (in the snow), scoring with boys, sneaking into the all boys dorm to play drinking games. Plus my friend kept me on track with doing my required homework, offering her help as a model for my photography class. 

During the last week of school freshmen who want to enter the film program have to submit a portfolio and an essay about why they want to be in the program. Only 200 people are allowed in a year. I was not one of them. 

If I repeated my freshman year that would be another $30,000. After five years of college I would be $150,000 in debt. That is law degree money spent on a film degree. 

 Me and my friend both tried to get jobs as RA's earlier in the year but neither of us made it. Her dad told her she couldn't stay in Montana if she wasn't an RA because it would be too expensive. 

I decided not to go back to Montana.

My mom tried to make me go back, but I couldn't do it. MSU doesn't offer any kind of housing other than single and double room dorms with a shared floor bathroom. I would be a twenty year old living in the dorms, taking classes with 17 and 18 year olds with no friends and digging my debt hole deeper and deeper.

I moved back in with my parents and started going to the local university. I run into kids from my high school all the time. There are no production classes here, I've spent three terms taking different classes that revolve around just watching movies. I still don't have friends in school. I hardly have any friends out of school. I work at starbucks, 40 hours a week which is way more than I'm used to, all I do is go to school, go to work, go on the internet. I have to commute to class every day, I used to be a five minute walk from anywhere I had to be. My mom is always trying to tell me what to do, she doesn't want me to move out until I pay off some of my student loans, which makes sense but I feel like my life would be ten times better if I could move to the city. 

It's been a year since I've been in Montana and I still have a longing to go back even though 95% of my time there was shitty. Whenever I think about Montana or college I get super sad. The new monsters inc preview makes me sad. My current college is around $22,000 dollars cheaper a year, but now I live at home in the suburbs feeling sorry for myself all the time. 

Even though I know I wouldn't have wanted to go back I really wish I would have. Why?

*I'm a chronic procrastinator. If something is due in a week I will get a stomach ache over thinking about how I'm not doing it for six and a half days, rush through it in an hour, and regret it when it comes time to turn it in and I know it is shit. This happens with things as simple as a response paper or on things as important as the final project in my required film class. "

And that's why I'm kinda worried.

I started out writing ""SEO""web copy on a freelance basis for a startup agency in the middle east, three weeks ago. SEO is in quotes because, as I see/understand it, if you're writing well and using the concrete words you need to get across your point,you're writing to SEO well enough within the context of a writing for a web page.

This agency is an ambitious project started by a former brand manager whose big vision involved him starting an ad agency in Dubai and taking his place as an ad giant in the region,over time. The crux of his method involves bringing on design and dev (and apparently now, writing) talent from around the world to work on accounts in the middle east. We all telecommute. The hours can be odd for some of us, but it's exhilarating to work with talent from all sides of the globe, simultaneously. Ive worked for couple of agencies as an intern, and have never encountered something like this. Consequently, I want to make sure this project is successful.

Since beginning, I've displayed at least some ""competence social media strategy"", which, as far as a self-assesment of my knowledge would indicate, equates to knowing how to build and run a multi-channel content calendar, use HootSuite, and draw general opinions from Facebook insights.

I can crank out blog posts fast enough and well enough to be dangerous and get the site ranking for some terms, I'm just not sure which...

I'm concerned that I'm not fully grasping the scope of the task before me, and that if I dive head first into any one component of what is growing to be my role in this particular project, I'll miss the big picture and neglect a crucial component on content creation for this business.

I'm asking for a bit of guidance and direction that addresses some of the following questions:

What is does this agency probably need most?
Is a cloud-based agency a novel idea? Can it be presented as a USP?
Am I planning to publish the right content?
I'm thinking I'm doing copy and content strategy, I'm just not sure if I'm using the second term properly.
What type of thing should I keep in mind when writing for a foreign (specifically, Middle-Eastern) client?
For content marketers: Did you know what you were doing when you started your first content strategy job?
AM I DOING IT RIGHT?!!

Thanks, in advance!

However I never completed any internships and the job I got straight out of school that was more suited to my minor of Sports Medicine.

The company restructured and I got put into a position that didn't suit me well and I ended up quitting because I couldn't deal with a few coworkers (who had way to much sway with management) and my direct boss who didn't like me from before I switched departments.

I've been looking for jobs since I quit a few months ago but have only received two notices saying they were looking elsewhere out of 30-40 applications (including a temp agency that never contacted me back). I am really self conscience about failure (job searching notwithstanding) so after a month or so I stopped applying altogether. 

Now I either see basic job requirements (for entry level jobs) and say right off the bat they won't hire me or see what the job entails and not like it and never apply.

I'm really open to a lot of jobs but I do get nervous/stressed out when dealing with phone calls so I would never want to do sales. Also I am pretty much a jack of all trades type person. I have skills with MS Excel, Adobe Photoshop/Premiere, Film/Television, Photography, Finance, Healthcare, Retail, etc. But I have no emphasis in any one area, and I feel employers aren't looking for someone who can do a lot of things well, but someone who can do one thing great.

I look for jobs all the time, but when I search I just get depressed thinking that so and so will never hire me and end up not applying for any jobs and quit looking. I don't know how to motivate myself to apply for jobs when I just have a mental barrier to doing so."

I love her alot, and I always felt like she did too. She and I are both pretty busy people, both freshman in college, and so we rarely see other, even now in the summer, since I have an internship, and she lives with her parents, and studies and has other obligations. 

In the past, we always tried our best to see each other, be it in school or out, and since we didn't alot, she'd always skype me at night, and we'd have these amazing, fun phone calls late at night. Recently however, for about a month, she all of a sudden, became distant. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I have a fear of losing my girlfriend, as my last serious relationship ended after i dismissed my gut feeling that my girlfriend was being distant. 

Instead of talking for a long time like we usually did, this past month, she'd call just to say goodnight quickly. Sometimes, so quickly, she/I don't even tell each other ""I love you."" She doesn't seem to try to make plans with me anymore, and although she texts me, her responses are conversation stoppers that make her seem disinterested, such as just ""haha"". 

I talked to her about my feelings last night, and it didn't help. She just halfheartedly apologized, saying ""I'm sorry you feel this way, its not my intentions,"" and in general, stayed silent while I told her. She said she was just too tired, and ""we saw each other 2 days ago anyway."" This scares me, since she's never told me she was too tired ever before, in fact I'd always force her to sleep before exams instead of talking to me etc. Plus, she has never said anything like the 2 days ago thing either, she always complains we don't get to be together enough etc, and even if i leave somewhere for just a day, she always says she misses me a ton. Eventually, I just told her to sleep, since she didn't seem to care/know what to say anyway. I feel very insecure about it now, and it just seems like I care more about her than she does about me now. That scares me, and I want some advice, or just anything i guess for comforting.

TLDR: Girlfriend more distant all of a sudden after a year of dating, I have previous insecurities about SO's falling out of love with me. Talked to her about it, didn't help, still feeling insecure, and that I care more about the relationship/her than she does. "

Me[22F], him[22M], 1 YR.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g8vtf/in_love_but_a_world_apart_and_i_dont_know_what_to/,"I really, desperately, need some help and clarity with my current situation. 


Basically, last summer, I met K. I've never felt closer with anyone in my life. We were completely inseparable and in love. Problem was, I was halfway across the world, on an internship, and we only had 3 months together. Once I left to go back home, he visited me a month later, and stayed with me for a month. All was bliss. I didn't know where our future was going, as we both had plans to stay on our sides of the world...but I didn't care. Come December, when I was planning to go back and visit him, we had a talk about the relationship 10 days before my flight. We realized, after my planned visit...we wouldn't be able to see each other for about 6 months afterwards. We mutually thought that my visiting him in December would be too painful, with the unknown looming over us...so through many tears and the most heartbreaking Skype conversation I can imagine...we broke up. 


Fast forward 6 months. We still talk almost everyday. I tell him everything, and he does likewise. I still have strong feelings for him, and I fight them, but they just don't go away. He says that I was the love of his life. We still entertain the thought of one day ending up together...but that would be far into the future, at least another 5 years from now. The complication is, we both *tried* to move on with our lives, and we're both seeing other people. My current relationship isn't going too great, and it's also long-distance (albeit much shorter). He is also seeing someone. This summer, I am planning to take a trip and go and visit some friends I have that live closely to K. Obviously, I want to see him. I've been daydreaming about seeing him again for so long now, it hurts. (I'm planning on ending my current relationship when I see him next). 


Now, the problem. If I see him...I don't think I can handle seeing him as ""just friends"". I want to enjoy the bliss of simply being together, like old times. I told him how I felt today, but he said he does not want to end things with his current girlfriend  for ""a few days of fun"" and then have to deal with the misery of me leaving and him being single again and alone. But if this is the true love I keep telling myself this is (and he keeps swearing it is)...wouldn't he willingly break up with her? He says he isn't in love with her...""but she's nice"", and he does not like being alone. 


Am I wasting my time on him? Am I being selfish? Should I still visit him, but not sleep over...and see him as a friend? Cutting off communication with him is not an option because he truly is my best friend. I simply do not know what to do.

tl;dr: Fell in love with a man across the world last year. Spent an amazing 6M together. Broke up due to distance and now seeing other people, but still talk everyday. I want to visit him, but I want us both to be single. He says he doesn't want to break up with his current GF. Does this mean his feelings aren't quite as strong, and I should give up? Or am I being selfish?"
1g8rsd,1,2013-06-12,"I feel that I will eventually commit suicide. Not today, or this year, or even this decade. But eventually.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g8rsd/i_feel_that_i_will_eventually_commit_suicide_not/,"The thing is that I don't have a good enough reason for it. I know, I know, ""There's never a good reason for suicide."" But if there was, mine's not it. My life's been relatively good, actually. Mom and dad still together, two younger sisters, pets, living in the suburbs, having college paid for, eventually graduating college (I'm a rising senior).

Despite all of this I can't think of a time that I've ever been truly happy. I've been diagnosed with depression, got some social anxiety and OCD on the side, and I take meds to make sure I don't become listless and dark all the time. But pills don't stop me from having feelings of inadequacy over my more successful peers or prettier younger sisters who have their whole lives ahead of them when I've already fucked up mine. They don't stop the constant self-criticism and the idea that nothing is worth it. I probably won't get that internship; why even apply? That guy would never be interested in me; what's the point of talking to him? Losing weight won't make me prettier; why bother? I'll just binge eat and sit at home all summer with the minimum wage job I've had for the past 5 years while my friends plan for their futures, go out and have fun, enjoy being young.

It wasn't supposed to be like this. I'm the oldest on both sides of the family, the first to do everything. I was told I was smart from the beginning, never had to work hard in school, always assumed I'd do well and make friends and get a job and be happy. But nope. Depression kicked in, I never seemed to be part of the group that I wanted to be (the ""popular"" kids) in high school, had a shitty time my freshman year of college, and feel that I missed out on those experiences. I built a life for myself in my mind and when real life doesn't add up, I don't know how to deal. 

You know why I didn't get those jobs or internships? I didn't apply. I'm a senior in college and have never had an internship. I have no discernible skill or experience. I wanted to move to NYC after school and work but now I have some pipe dream of backpacking across the world just to escape everything and avoid ""the real world."" I want to be the girl who was ""so brave to travel by herself,"" had great ""adventures,"" broke the status quo. But how can I possibly travel when I'm so socially anxious I'd rather wander lost for hours than ask for directions? Where am I going to get the money?? And what if I did travel...what happens when I come home? I have to look for a job and settle and feel inadequate and watch everyone else succeed while I wallow in misery and become a deadbeat, fat, wrinkled, undesirable, broken down mess of a human being.

That's where the suicide comes in. Because I'm too lazy to get my shit together that I'd rather just end it all and not deal with the reality. I'm a pathetic piece of shit who just assumed everything would go her way and now that it's not, I don't know what to do. The meds sure aren't helping. I'm already seeing a therapist. I'l have moments where I'm motivated to take on all my problems, but those are few and far between. I'm currently laying in a mess of a room with all my shit scattered everywhere, my OCD repressed for now despite my need to binge eat and obsess over my issues. I just want to burn all my stuff, start over, go back in time and not screw everything up, have a new life where I'm not angry and sullen all the time. 

I sometimes think I'm losing touch with reality...or maybe I was never in touch in the first place. My moods and emotions scare me occasionally. But no one knows the true extent of my issues. I'd never mention my thoughts of suicide, because I'd hear that it's not worth it, you're life is fine, everything can be fixed, just change what you don't like!!!!!!!!!!!

But part of me doesn't want to change, I want to lie in bed all day and feel sorry for myself, to convince myself that I'm pathetic and useless because sometimes I doubt it and think I'm normal, that everything's normal, that there's an excuse for me not doing anything with my life.

I'd never say all this to anyone because, technically, I'm young and my problems aren't that significant in the big scheme of things. I'm just an angsty and insecure 21 year old. Understatement of the century.

Well now the title doesn't make sense, none of this does, and I want to cry and I hate crying. 

And here's where the egomania sets in amongst the insecurity, I'm secretly hoping that someone finds this an eloquently written call for help...maybe I'm even the next Sylvia Plath like thousands of girls before me. And now I hate that the rational side of me has stepped in and called me on my bullshit. This is all easily fixable. And here come's the doubt and inadequacy, because it's not is it? I've screwed myself over.

So I guess the title does make sense then, eventually this will all take over completely and I'll just end it. Happy days are here again."
1g8qsp,9,2013-06-12,"Currently working with Salesforce in a job with no advancement opportunities. Having trouble getting more Salesforce experience, and I feel stuck.",db2765,salesforce,https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/1g8qsp/currently_working_with_salesforce_in_a_job_with/,"So just some quick background on where I'm currently at. I went to a technical college and graduated with an associate's in Control Systems Technology (http://www.ranken.edu/academics/electrical-division/control-systems-technology), but had terrible luck landing a job after getting out. Eventually a friend was able to land me an internship at a small marketing company close to home. They mostly do email and call center marketing (through ActOn and Five9). They called it an internship, but it ended up being a call center job. Luckily, I have a pretty strong background in Excel, and was able to take some side projects with their database team to write up some macros that they just didn't have the time to make themselves. After a month or two, they decided to bring me on full time.

Right now, I mostly spend the day pulling data in and out of Salesforce, creating reports, making layouts, custom objects for some of our clients, things like that. I feel pretty comfortable in Salesforce, for the most part. A while ago, I was able to start messing around with APEX code when they needed some help with triggers, and have been getting more comfortable with making workflows. I'm wanting to learn Visualforce, but haven't had a chance yet. Also haven't had much of a chance to do much with the Opportunity object yet, either. My manager deals with all the permissions and security, so I have no experience with that, either. There wasn't much training, mostly learned by fire. Was able to teach myself the APEX coding by reading code that was already written.

The issue is that the company isn't doing too great. There were massive layoffs back in December, and another batch of layoffs a few weeks after that. I never ended up getting my yearly raise, and when I went full time, I only got an extra $0.75 (only making $12.75/hr right now). I tried asking about a raise, but the question is always dodged by management. The company is small, so the only way I could advance upwards is if I became incredible at sales overnight and moved to that department. I want to get more experience with other parts of Salesforce, but I'm pretty much stuck on list pulling and report creation for now, and still do more Excel work than anything. The other two on my team just don't want to give anything up that they're working on so I can get more experience.

I love working with Salesforce, and have heard that the market for Salesforce admins is pretty good right now. I feel stuck though. I'm not sure if I really have enough SFDC experience to get a job somewhere else, and since the team won't give me more work, I'm not sure how to go about getting the experience I need. I mess around in our org when I can. Should I work on maybe getting certified? Just not sure where to go from here.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

If there are not any good 18+ night clubs, can you give me some opinions on the 21+ venues?  I'm not here for long and would like to experience the best while I am.  Some I have found online are Pheonix Landing, Middlesex, and Royale.  Any others?  Which is best?

Over the past week, I have sent 15 e-mails to 15 different studios around the area and have called atleast 10 of them.

The catch is I am only 15 and most studios (understandably) do not accept high school interns.  

To my surprise, I have gotten a few responses and this is where I am at now:
-An engineer at a fairly large studio has contacted me with the steps to acquire an internship at the studio (cool, nice guy) (www.phillysoundstudios.net)
-The manager to a fairly small kind of sketchy studio had reached out to me for ""general studio work"" (www.boffostudio.com)
-The manager to a fairly large studio has denied an internship but offered for me to sit in on sessions and walk me through an entire session of my own for $10 (www.msoundrecordingstudios.com)

This is where my decision becomes difficult.  The biggest studio in the city, Milkboy Recording (www.milkboythestudio.com), has gotten back to me with further contact information, yet have not contacted me back yet.  The plus is that the studio manage is a very good friend of a family friend AND my friend's SAT tutor is one of the few engineers at the studio. So, I have two ins, but I really don't know how to approach the situation.

I selfishly have my heart set on working at Milkboy, yet I do not know how long the process will take while I have a few other options ready for me to jump on.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.. Thanks!

TL;DR - Cannot decide on studio internship, regardless of several oppurtunities"
1gddv7,2,2013-06-14,I'm kind of into my mother's friend?,whoahitter,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gddv7/im_kind_of_into_my_mothers_friend/,"I'm a 21 y/o male, and I'm opening a business with my mother(42 I think). She has a friend(29, F, 4 kids [oldest is 11], single) that she knows through her online classes. She has come to visit for a week (almost over now) and is also considering moving in with my mother sometime if she can find an internship here.

I'm actually really into her. I'm not sure if I have any good reasons to be into her though. She's not as mature as I would expect her to be, being 29 and my mother's friend. But she's fun, bubbly, cute, and can be funny. Now some things that immediately made me want to be around her in the beginning: she acts just like an old friend that I haven't seen in awhile and really miss, she is very flirty (this threw me off quite a bit), and I've always had this weird mom fetish ( I always thought it was hot when a female had a child [not pregnant]. Don't ask me; I don't know where I got it from.) So I'm already not sure if the last several attractions are fair reasons to want to get with someone. On top of that, I almost feel that I want to have sex with her just because she's my mother's friend as well. My sister and her boyfriend (Only two people I'm friends/hang out with at the moment.) both think she's dumb and don't like her at all, so I've been a little embarrassed to talk to them about it at all.

Last piece of information: I almost thought in the beginning that my mother was trying to hook her up with me. She was continually inviting me to do stuff with them and putting us in situations where we were doing stuff alone. But it turns out she is actually quite perturbed by what she is seeing (conversation that she had with my sister who in turn told me), particularly one night that we had a cookout with the whole family. The friend was drinking a little bit and was getting very flirtatious with me and making borderline lude jokes with me (i.e. joking about her vagina being tight) in front of everyone! No one was really paying attention, but whoa. I can't tell if she is just flirty with some guys, or if she is actually kind of into me.

So should I maybe bring it up in private if I get another chance, or should I walk away and never think about this again?

tl;dr: I am very oddly (sexually and personality-wise) attracted to my mother's new friend, not sure mom is happy about it, wat do?"

&gt;Be at the movies with boyfriend. 

&gt;He's been excited to see ""The Internship"" since the trailer came out. 

&gt;Get situated, it's a Saturday and theater is pretty full.

&gt;Notice my iced tea is starting to ripple in time with mighty footsteps. The chatter in the theater turns to a low murmur.

&gt;Tyrannosaurus-esque roars coming from the stairs.

&gt;Double check my ticket to make sure I am not at a showing for Jurassic Park.

&gt;Hamtanker emerges with large popcorn, candy, Icee and snacks under each arm wheezing as she struggles up six steps. 

&gt;She's alone.

&gt;Dwarf star wedges herself into the seat directly behind my boyfriend and I, grunting and groaning as she adjusts her fat spillage into the much-larger-than-your-average-theater seats.  

&gt;The people she's sitting between are using her enormous spare tire as tables.

&gt;Lights go down. Porcine smacking, burping and wheezing noises radiating directly onto us. 

&gt;The noises don't stop.

&gt;One of the main characters is an incredibly stereotyped home schooled Asian with a Tiger Mom. Vince Vaughn tries to give him a high five near the beginning of the film and Yo-Yo flinches defensively. Vince then makes a joke about him being beaten in school to which Yo-Yo replies seriously that his mother physically ""disciplines"" him.

&gt;The black hole behind me is howling with laughter for a solid minute and a half as she struggles to breathe. 

&gt;It wasn't really anywhere near funny enough to warrant that kind of response, but okay.

&gt;Movie continues. A fat character is ripped on a couple times (South Park style.) throughout the movie for his weight by Graham, the main antagonist who isn't supposed to be likable in any way. 

&gt;Really not overly shocking or over the top mean comments being made, just referring to him as ""fat"". 

&gt;Ambulocetus grunts discontentedly every time the character is referred to as ""fat"", but apparently sexist, racist and child abuse jokes are still hilarious enough to warrant extended wheezing fits.

&gt;Finally toward the end of the movie, looking forward to escaping the rapidly expanding galaxy sure to be sucking us in within a few minutes.

&gt;Graham makes another fat remark. Not funny enough to warrant a laugh from the audience. Fatty sees the opportunity to waddle upon her soapbox. 

&gt;Wails ""AND YER UH FUCKING ASSHOLE!!!"" at the top of her lungs.

&gt;Entire audience turns and stares. 

&gt;Large refillable tub of popcorn is empty. Candy boxes and wrappers strewn about the floor and arm rests. 

&gt;I'm actually impressed. 

&gt;Butterball realizes everyone is staring. She snatches up her refill bucket and waddles out of the theater. 

&gt;Comes back for the very end of the film, her bucket already 1/2 empty. 

&gt;Aforementioned overweight character gets his minor ""revenge"" on Graham, as is expected for any feel-good comedy.

&gt;Fatty literally stands up, starts hooting and hollering, **clapping** and making a fucking scene because Graham gets flipped off. 

&gt;A few people get up and leave. 

&gt;As soon as the credits roll, Jupiter pushes through an entire row of people to get out first.

&gt;Trips and spills her popcorn everywhere and starts visibly panicking. 

&gt;Grabs her feedbag and stumbles out the door.

&gt;See her refilling it again as she leaves."

[Part 1: Origins](http://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1e7zs4/the_psycho_bitch_origins/) [Part 2: Begin The Bitch](http://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gbj1c/the_psycho_bitch_begin_the_bitch/)

The Cast:

* Me - nerdy, but pretty normal English education major
* Sweet Roommate - architecture major, super sweet Asian girl
* Psycho Bitch Roommate (PBR) - architecture major, holy fuck crazy but we'll get to that
* Scoop and Dunk (SnD) - MCB major, super chill, fellow redditor, bit of a nerd like me
* Computer Douche (CD) - comp sci major, started as a nice guy but ended up being not so cool

And here we go. April was drawing to a close and this meant a lot of things were happening for me. I had decided to try and reach out to CD the only way I could since he wasn't speaking to me: through the internet. On facebook I saw that he had landed an internship over the summer. Knowing how hard it is to get any sort of job, I sent him a quick comment saying congrats on the job. To my surprise, the comment vanished. No big deal, internet in the dorms can be pretty shoddy. I try again.

It is then that I realize that he's actively deleting the comments. Okay, that's just gone from mean to childish. As I leave the dorm I run into SnD and her boyfriend, T. Now T has never been a fan of PBR, but this just reinforces it. T remarks that he is going to go onto CD's facebook to post and comment on everything. I laughed and a bit later saw that he had left a comment (nothing mean, just a smiley) and liked something. So in response, I sent him a message saying ""T, you are my hero"".

But ultimately I had bigger fish to fry that day for many reasons. My boyfriend's family and his younger sister were coming down to visit since she was looking to attend the university next year. I earned major brownie points by taking her on a tour of the dorm and while the bf's parents chilled. No BF because he was writing a huge paper. They were super sweet and took me to dinner afterwards. 

On my way home to the dorms, I ran into my knitting crew, a bunch of sweet girls. They asked me to join them for some kickass tex-mex and who am I to say no to free chips and salsa? As we enter the diner, we're chatting about our lives and what we're currently knitting, and suddenly my phone starts blowing up. Not literally, but it starts buzzing like nuts. Guess what, it's CD!

""Wtftortillas, never contact me again. We are not friends, what you have done to PND is unacceptable, you're awful, etc.""

Most of that is verbatim. My friends could see I was upset, and I ultimately told them what was going down. I've never seen a group of people so pissed off. And they had knitting needles, so they were gonna do some damage. However, after a few margaritas, all was well again. That night I had to get home since I had an event.

Freshman year of college I got into swing dancing. How do you say no to well dressed gentlemen who can dance? This weekend was our annual invite where people from in the surrounding states and universities would stop by to dance with us. This was my first year going, so I was psyched. However, that night as I was headed home, I got another acidic text from CD.

""This isn't funny, I told you to leave me alone, i know you're behind this, stop posting on my FB wall, etc.""

What. All of my what. I texted that I had no clue what he was talking about, especially considering I'd been away from the computer for about five hours at this time.

Fast forward to the next night, I'm getting ready for the semi-formal dance and of course, my phone goes off. It's PBR, demanding to speak to me. At this point, my tolerance for BS was pretty low, so I said no, I was busy. She demanded I come by to speak to her, so I wandered over, makeup half on, and told her that she had five minutes because I was busy. She and CD were curled up on her dorm bed, with PBR's dorm roommate nowhere to be found. 

What happened next was an interrogation of sorts. They asked why I was posting on their walls, and I told them that since CD wasn't talking to me, I figured it would be nice of me to congratulate him on his internship. Then they asked me about T's comment and like, saying that I'd told him to do it. My eyebrows were about in the stratosphere at this time, and I said that I hadn't told him to do ANYTHING. They then asked about what I'd said to T about him being my hero. I said that he'd made me laugh, so it was my way of saying thanks. They made their point clear, and I left.

More to come if you guys still want it."
1gd3zi,3,2013-06-14,After 11 years I've given everything I have. Time for me to go.,offmychesttryanother,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gd3zi/after_11_years_ive_given_everything_i_have_time/,"I was the 2nd employee you hired, the 1st one was a close personal friend of your partner.  From the start I bent over backwards to make everything work.  You were learning as you went along too - even though you never really developed a strong grasp of every tiny little nit picky detail because that's what I was for.

You quickly learned that it would be much cheaper to put me on salary than punch a clock.  I didn't mind.  I hate punching clocks.  From time to time you would throw me a cash bonus because I was working **hard**.  You don't know that I still keep that first $100 bonus that you gave me in the parking lot in my wallet.

Time went on.  The business grew.  And grew.  And grew.  I was kept busy - very busy.  I was your right hand guy.  Anything and everything that you needed done I did.  For the business and for your family.  I didn't mind.  That's who I am.  If I'm not being useful I don't feel like I have value.  I don't think you were intentionally taking advantage of this, nor would I really care if you were.  I did what I did because that's who I am.  I make no apologies nor utter a word of complaint.

More people were hired.  Then other people were given assistants.  Not me - I was super crazy busy and I liked it that way.  It would have helped had I had one, but that was OK.  Eventually you did assign an assistant to me.  Some friend's wife.  She was useless.  She complained a lot that I wasn't holding her hand and telling her to do every tiny little thing.  I had more than 800 projects I was juggling simultaneously.  Maybe it was over 900.  We were wondering when it would break 1,000.  She couldn't keep up even when I was giving her specific tasks.  But it was your friend's wife, she was hired without even talking to me about it - she was just *there* one day.  I managed.

The annual raise and end of year bonus certainly helped.  I was content.

The wife quit and moved on to something else.  You hired her friend.  The wife had been bad mouthing me to her friend and her friend insisted that I not be her supervisor.  You never talked to me about it.  But you hired her and she didn't report to me.  Other people got more assistants though - but never me.  She was fairly useless as well, but since she didn't report to me I couldn't even give her training or correction.

I was putting out fires.  I was on call 24/7 and getting calls in the middle of the night.  I was answering the questions you wanted answered IMMEDIATELY even if it was via text messaging while I was getting a root canal - there I am, leaning back in the chair, all kinds of crap hanging out of my mouth but you wanted to know something *right then*.

You started to ignore me and deal with long-term planning with others.  I was still the key to everything - not a single thing happened unless it went through me.  At first you were trying to be sensitive to the fact that I was so incredibly busy, but eventually you slowly grew more distant for some reason I never really understood.  You were becoming less of a friend and more of a boss.  Even though there were only 15 people working in the office you would still introduce me to our clients and make comments such as ""I don't know what he does"".  That kind of stung a little.

Then one day you made an announcement: you were going to start focusing on other things (lots of personal projects because everything was running so smoothly) and so somebody was going to become the ""me while I'm gone"".  A kid half my age who started as an intern a couple of years after I was keeping everything running.  A kid who didn't understand everything I did, certainly didn't have the same work ethic, flat-out refused to do anything to inconvenience himself to get things done.  But he was the new you.  He attempted to order me around but I would have none of it.  On more than one occasion he didn't like the way I was continuing to do things and would go running to you to get you to force me to change but where he would not listen you would and would tell him that I was right.  I always was.

There would be closed-door meetings with this kid and another employee, I was kept completely in the dark.  Even though I kept everything running I wasn't included.  I noticed, but my needs were still being met and I was keeping busy.  The end of the annual bonuses was noticed and missed.  I was aware that others were getting raises but I was not.  I was not feeling particularly secure in my position but, you know, the economy.  Where would I go?

I am widely regarded as one of the very best people in the country for what I do.  I have received far more recognition than you ever knew about because you never paid attention.  I was the keynote speaker at a regional trade meeting and I don't think it registered.  I received acclaim and accolades and I think all you said was ""that's very good"".

Flash forward.  **HE LEFT.** Your favorite left.  I knew he would.  It was obvious and inevitable.  And he did.  Suddenly.  Without warning.  Then the other inner circle person was gone.  I was completely exhausted.  After 11 years I hadn't ever taken a real vacation because even when I was gone for only a couple of days I would still get one or more calls a day.  I was feeling stressed as a result of the lack of raises and an actual pay *cut* were squeezing me against inflation.  For the first time ever I was struggling to keep up with everything.  You didn't notice.  You became demanding.  You would give me four or five ""do this right this second"" tasks within the space of five minutes.  You would demand that I fix very technical and complicated problems immediately without even understanding what the problem was.  I was finding myself with more holes to fill in the workflow.  I wasn't in a good place emotionally or mentally - I couldn't concentrate or focus.  The business is declining and you yourself say it will be gone within 2 years.  You have plans on where to go next, but I can't see how I am a part of them.  I don't see any possible place for me here any more (even if I could afford to remain) and no longer see a future.

I am in talks with somebody who sees great value in me.  He will offer new challenges, opportunities to grow, things I have never done before.  I am hoping that everything will be finalized and that I will be out the door within a month.  You have no idea what is coming.  You are going to miss me when I am gone.  Business is slow these days anyway, so you should do ok but you won't have anybody who puts forth the effort anymore.  You will be just like everybody else.

Part of the changes I can attribute to stress.  You have a lot of it.  You carry a lot of weight.  You have one of the kindest hearts I have ever known.  You are the type of father that everybody should emulate.  Part of the changes though, I don't understand.  They stung a little bit, but your good parts outweigh the bad parts by far and I forgive you for that.  But now, my time here is done.  Now, for perhaps the first time I am at the point where loyalty and perseverance and dedication have to take a back seat to what I need: about tree-fiddy.

(Sorry, sorry, I've always wanted to get that into a post, couldn't resist.  But seriously, as the song says, I can't leave with a bad goodbye and I was feeling a little too intense as I typed this up.  I needed a smile.)

In the back of my mind I've been kicking around the idea of offering to continue to help you out with things part-time.  I don't need much sleep and I could certainly use the extra money but I think that a clean break is going to be best for me.  I know my history, and I don't really maintain connections with people in past lives so when I'm gone, I'm going to be gone for good.

I will never tell you all of the reasons why I'm leaving, nor will I ever tell you how hard this is for me.  I'm going to tell you that I'm being offered more money and you will understand that with perfect clarity.  There is more, much more, but you will never know.

Goodbye."

1gcfw8,40,2013-06-14,[Rant] I want to quit my job. I really do. I just don't know how to condense this rant and make it not seem as angry as I truly feel.,goddamnitbeeline,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gcfw8/rant_i_want_to_quit_my_job_i_really_do_i_just/,"Where can I start? I started working a mall job at the end of my senior year of high school. 


It felt all, well.. It felt all **cool**, like hey I always get to shop, and hang out at the mall and blah blah blah-- false sense of entitlement. 


At first, it was great. I'm not going to lie-- coming from a waitressing job that was off the books, with an asshole boss who'd talk down to me and I KNOW he talked shit about me in Chinese with his family members-- and paid me $4 instead of $5 [for the *free* food you get for your ""break"" in which you have to leave to deal with other customers], stole tips, and also illegally deducted 10% of your tip for credit card transactions. I quit this job, was hooked up at the mall job. And it was fantastic. At first. 


A year later, I'm dreading coming into work. Dreading it. It's a **shitty fucking mall job**. There's no room to fucking move up. And I hate my boss. 


**The customers** I know that wherever you go, you're going to meet absolute *cunts* for customers. And that's fine. But there's a point where you're *so tired* of being haggled with the same shit every fucking time you work. And it's for the stupidest shit. And at the end of the day, I feel bad.


For one, the customers lack common sense. Our price tags have five different prices on them because the headquarters of the store is in Germany originally. They've expanded to stores all over the world. They create the merchandise in one country and ship overseas. In case the shipment gets messed up, we can still sell these items.


Customers have a tendency to look at the cheapest price, the *Euro*, not *USD*. They'll rank up a lovely charge, and when I say lovely, I mean we get closer and closer to goal and that's awesome. They see the total, with tax.. ""Oh, the tax is **that** much? No, I don't want any of it."" -________- ""Why does it say *Euros* then?"" -_________- ""Well, can I pay in *Euros*?"" -______________________________-


The worst part is the refund. I'm so sorry, if you're reading this and you recognize what store I'm working for. I would refund your money, but my boss says not to. Unless it's for earrings, I can't refund that-- we don't have the right tools to sanitize every pair of earrings we sell (there are about 20,000 items of inventory in stock). And that's just for hygienic purposes. But our store policy is that you have 14 days to return or exchange jewelry for *store credit, only*, no refund. Why? It comes out of our daily turnover-- so we don't usually meet our daily goal (which is true), and then we don't meet our monthly goal, and we don't meet our yearly goal. Which means, shit hours-- and that my boss doesn't get an award that tells her that our ""team"" made the most money of all the stores.


When you look at it closely, we really don't make much money. A lot of people are coming back for refunds because all of the merchandise is garbage. Granted, there are some REALLY cute pieces, but we know what's garbage and we know what's not. And yet, there is this hidden need to tell the customer that the $10.83 umbrella she's buying *won't* fall apart the first time she opens it. 


**The Schedule** Anyone who has ever worked mall hours, know that they are the *fucking worst*. You work one day, or two days out of the week and then every other day you're free. At least, for me that is. They have the most inconvenient shifts. Closing gets you out by 10. And yes, I may have a busy school schedule, but it's not every single day. I can work mornings on certain days, and have expressed this to my boss. And yet, she consistently schedules me for such busy days that I'll be up since 8 am in school, out by 2, off to work by 3, at work by 4, and home by 1030 to 11. Not cool. 


Flashback to a store meeting, I went to, when I found out that she took my one and only day I was working that week, and gave it to a co-worker who had just recently came back from a paid internship. That would make it two weeks that I'm not working. I'm 19, with bills to pay. Two weeks without pay, is not cool. 


And there's a problem with **seniority**. See, I've been here for a year exactly. I build my trust with customers by being honest with them about what I think they should wear and what I think they shouldn't buy. I'm *not* a bad sales associate. And there are moments that make the job worthwhile-- I've gotten compliments, people asking for my name to tell the manager what a great job I've done. It makes my day. But, the girls who have been here for 3 months-- they get 20+ hours, and I get 9.5.. For two weeks straight. 


I've been working on this promotion to be a keyholder, and a girl that just came here in November got it before me. For fucks sake, I trained her. Where the fuck is my recognition? And here you are, cutting my hours, keeping me off the schedule for two weeks and giving them more hours... Why is it so hard to split the hours. Make it equal. No. Apparently not. I'm not a valuable employee? If I'm not, why has a year gone by and you haven't fired me yet?!


My boss called me one day while I was at work, and goes..
""Oh, you're finished with school? I can give you more hours!""
I respond with, ""Yes, that'd be great.. Schedule me away!""


I check the schedule for this week, Friday and fucking Sunday. ARGHHHH!


It's not like I'm irresponsible, or inexperienced. But just the way I feel walking into work, like I'm not good enough-- it kills my motivation. I need to get out. I've already applied to other jobs in the city, and I really hope I get a call back. I got such a professional vibe from the stores in the city and I feel like I don't fit into this one anymore. But I don't know how to break this to my boss. "

I was offered a couple internships but declined them because they were all unpaid.I paid my own way through college, had to put gas in the truck and food in the stomach so no money coming in was not possible for me at that time. I graduated with a 3.3gpa and currently work in banking as I have since I was 18. 

Currently I am sitting for my CPA payed for the prep classes on my own with no job offer in place and really just hoping that works out for me. Upon completing the tests I will need 1 more semester to meet the 150credits as well as I need 1 year accounting for the experience requirment. 

I really want to get into IT auditing, I love computers, fixing them, writing some code, I host my dads business website as well as a few other of his friends in the same fields website, computers just come naturally to me. Sometimes I spend an entire day messing around in excel for the heck of it. 
My question is am I going about this the correct way? Should I be doing anything different? Are there certifications I should get after completing my CPA to excel me in the area of IT auditing? I live in south jersey now so Philly is a possible job spot for me as well as atlantic city (10mins). I also would be open to moving to Denver where I have family or California (bay area) where my parents live.

1gbp63,2665,2013-06-14,YSK that on Tuesday a judge confirmed what intern advocates have been alleging for years: a lot of upaid intership programs are illegal.,God_Wills_It_,YouShouldKnow,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1gbp63/ysk_that_on_tuesday_a_judge_confirmed_what_intern/,"Unpaid internships* are increasingly a fact of life for college students. The National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 55 percent of the class of 2012 had an internship or co-op during their time in college. Almost half of those — 47 percent — were unpaid. A third of internships at for-profit companies were unpaid.

Depending on how you look at it, this is either massive exploitation of young people by powerful corporations which worsens inequality, or a valuable opportunity for on-the-job training at lower cost than a degree or certificate at a college or university.

But whatever your moral leanings, a judge on Tuesday confirmed what intern advocates have been alleging for years: a lot of these programs are illegal.

Judge William Pauley, who sits on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled that Fox Searchlight’s use of interns in the production of the movies “Black Swan” and “500 Days of Summer” violated minimum wage and overtime laws, and that those interns can file a class action against the studio. He concluded:

They worked as paid employees work, providing an immediate advantage to their employer and performing low-level tasks not requiring specialized training. The benefits they may have received — such as knowledge of how a production or accounting office functions or references for future jobs — are the results of simply having worked as any other employee works, not of internships designed to be uniquely educational to the interns and of little utility to the employer. They received nothing approximating the education they would receive in an academic setting or vocational school.

The tests being hinted at there — of whether an internship provides valuable training and whether it benefits the firm or the intern more — reflect the reasoning of a 2010 fact sheet put out by the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Divison, which enforces these laws. That fact sheet sets up six criteria to determine if an internship is legal or not:

1.The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;

2.The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;

3.The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;

4.The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;

5.The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and

6.The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

Pauley cites that fact sheet, reproduces all six points, and then proceeds to determine if the internships in this case satisfied all six requirements. Perhaps the most important result of the ruling is that it treats that fact sheet, effectively, as a binding interpretation of federal law around internships.

Some employment attorneys think that move is a mistake. “You’ve got to consider a lot of different factors including these six factors,” Camille Olson, a partner at Seyfarth and Shaw who frequently defends companies in wage and hour cases.

A better analysis, she argues, can be found in Xuedan Wang v. The Hearst Corporation, a case in which Wang, a former unpaid intern at Harper’s Bazaar, tried to put together a class action on behalf of the Heart Corporation’s unpaid interns. The judge in that case, Harold Baer (also of the Southern District of New York), didn’t discount the six-factors in the fact sheet — “After all,” he writes, “they emanate from the agency that administers the laws under which Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit.” – but also argued that one must look at the “totality of circumstances.”

Baer ruled that Wang couldn’t file a class action, as she couldn’t show that all of Hearst’s interns faced similar enough conditions for them to file a suit together. But more importantly for these cases going forward, he denied summary judgment for the plaintiffs. That is, unlike Pauley, he declined to rule, without a trial, that Wang and her prospective co-plaintiffs were employees covered by minimum wage and overtime laws.

The trial has been adjourned indefinitely, though Juno Turner, one of Wang’s attorneys at the firm Outten &amp; Golden, which also represents the interns in the Fox case, confirms that they’re planning on going forward with a jury trial. All of which reinforces Olson’s point that Pauley is just just one judge, in just one district, and it’s hard to predict what appeals court judges will rule on any of these cases.

As you can imagine, intern advocates disagree vehemently with Olson’s suggestion that the reasoning in the Pauley ruling was weak. ” I think the reasoning will stand up strongly and clearly,” Ross Perlin, author of “Intern Nation” and a critic of unpaid internships, says. That includes, he continues, the reasoning that for-profit companies’ interns are employees entitled to back pay, and that they constitute a class that can file a class action suit.

They also differ on which kinds of firms are breaking these laws. Perlin argues that even non-profit firms — which are allowed to have unpaid “volunteers” — are likely in violation of the law if they have actual unpaid interns. “Just because you’re working for somebody who’s been classified as a 501(c)3 doesn’t mean you don’t have to treat them like workers,” he says, though he concedes, “Interns would have the burden of proving they’re not volunteers. Somebody is going to have to step up and make the case.” A logical place to start, he says, would be D.C. “Congress has exempted its own interns from fair labor standards act,” he says. “That’s something waiting to be addressed.”

Olson thinks that’s far-fetched. “We’ve had volunteers at hospitals and not-for-profits that are performing responsibilities, and never had a claim to paid work,” she says. “It would be a first, but I don’t think there’s a strong argument to be made there.”

But the two agree that there are many for-profit companies currently in violation of the law, even if Fox Searchlight and Hearst aren’t specifically among them. “In the last 3-4 years for-profit companies are really reviewing their internship programs, and eliminating unpaid internships more and more, because they don’t want to run the risk that there’s not enough benefit for the worker,” she says. “Of the ones that do offer internships, many have revised them so they are paying minimum wage.”

That’s largely an effect of media scrutiny, she argues. “The media coverage has made a difference in companies having heightened awareness, that they want their programs to be compliant,” she says. “And that’s a really good thing.” That could be the most important way that cases like this change things. Neither Olson nor Perlin have noticed the Department of Labor stepping up enforcement lately, and lawsuits are a rather expensive and time-consuming way to protect your rights. Olson notes that some settlements in these cases have been as paltry as $1,100.

She advises interns who think their companies are running afoul of the law to talk to their human resources department, perhaps through an anonymous tip, or to contact their state or federal wage and hour department to get answers on what’s required, and whether the company is violating those rules. Potentially the matter could be resolved without the cost of a lawyer.

Of course, you’d expect a defendant’s lawyer to say that, but she has a point. The worst thing that happens if you file an internal complaint is that you lose the unpaid internship, and the $0 in future compensation that you could have gotten from it. And if the reputational cost of being fired from the internship is too great to bear, then legal recourse is still available. Unpaid interns have nothing to lose but their chains.

\* Full disclosure: I’ve had three unpaid summer internships in my life, two at nonprofits and one at a for-profit that hasn’t made a profit in years. The Washington Post pays its interns, who are great.

Update: The first version of this article said 52 percent of the class of 2012 had internships or co-op experiments in college. The actual number is 55 percent. We regret the error.

I'm not really outgoing person and don't have many friends so I saw this as an opportunity to get myself out there. Plus, there is one student from my school who's doing the same internship program but don't work in the same lab as I do, so I thought that I'm not completely alone. At first, she would contact me a lot to go somewhere but she found other people to hang out with from another program (of which I missed the orientation because I had an appointment with immigration office). I tried contacting her by phone to meet one day, but never responded. This always happens to me. People only talk/hang out with me if they have absolutely no choice. I know I'm not the funniest/entertaining person around but I do try to be a good companion. What the fuck am I missing?

And it's not like I've been sitting in my room, sulking about how my life sucks. I went to the school's international student office to see if they have some social events for international students but their first response was ""why did you come during summer?"" They added that since it's summer vacation, there are no classes and there isn't much activity going on for international students. I can see at the cafeteria and common lounges students from the US/Canada but it's really hard to approach them, since I'm pretty much alone and they're always in groups of more than 5. I can maybe approach one person when he/she is alone but I can't introduce myself to a group of people; it terrifies me and I don't know what to say and proceed. Normally, I would go to basketball court and play a pickup game or something but I got hit by a fucking car a couple of months back and my leg is not feeling well.

I thought going abroad will help me to break out of my shell but it's the same as before. I'm just sitting in my room after work/school, wasting my life away. I always feared that once I graduate from the university and get a job, I would just go to work, come home, eat, sleep and repeat and I'm getting a preview of that right now. I'm even thinking of not doing study abroad later if this is how I behave in a foreign country .

I'm sorry for posting yet another ""I'm lonely; I don't have any friend"" post. I needed to vent what's going on in my life to someone and had no one to do it. But if you read this far, you have my gratitude. "

First we went to NYC one weekend that it was my turn, then to DC another weekend and drove back to VA where he stayed for a week. I was initially planning on moving up to PA permanently and finish school at the AI there. But of course with my luck things went wrong. The art institute there does not have the same curriculum as the art institute of VA. If I were to transfer to PA I would have 2 years left of school as opposed to a year here in VA. He was pretty disappointed and we had a small fight about it. In the end he said he wanted what was best and that we would make it work. So to try and get to PA sooner I decided I should focus on school by quitting my job and upping my class intake. My family fully supports that and has said they would help with my bills until I graduate. Now I am looking at 18 classes and after summer term ends in September, I will have hopefully 9 months left of school. I am looking at internships for summer so that I can knock out a bunch of credits and graduate even sooner. It just sucks that my school schedules will be so hectic and I have classes on Saturdays now. Typically I would fly out on Friday night and fly back on Monday morning. Driving is out of the question since parking where he lives will cost me over $200 in two days. I'm worried he will grow tired of having to come see me more over the summer since my school schedule sucks. I feel like I need to get back on xanax or something to keep me calm and not as stressed.

All of us staff members have to work the event. I just graduated from college in May, I actually had my internship at this organization which is how I got hired by them. 

I don't know exactly what I should wear to a black tie event or if some of my dresses that I own are fancy enough. I am ok with buying a new dress, but being that I am a new college graduate I don't have tons of money to spend. I will have my 22nd birthday before then and will have some more money, but the most I am willing to spend is about 60 dollars for the dress, and 40 more for shoes and accessories. I have seen pictures from past years and know that as staff it's ok for us to wear cocktail dresses but that's about all I know. Also I have gained some weight going from walking all around my college campus to a desk job with my internship/job and I don't think some of my fancier dresses will fit right now. I am currently in the process of trying to lose weight but who knows where I will be one month from now. 

Here are some pictures of me in two of my fancier dresses. I am on the left in the first picture.

A sexual relationship evolved and he enjoys being with me in other ways as well, but is consumed by guilt at the wedge he has created in the group.  I have made my case about staying together multiple times now, but I am tired of serious conversations.  He is currently thinking it over in the countryside.  I don’t know whether to keep fighting anymore.

I was with my ex boyfriend for 3 years, most of it long distance, and this last year we subsequently broke up after living together.  All this taking place in a foreign country to me.  To have moved here, I took language classes, created an income from tutoring english and maintaining it by living minimally, made new friends...I invested time, effort, and emotion.  

We broke up after he had admitted to cheating on me during a trip to Cuba.  This happened two months ago, and he confessed a few days after he returned.  He wrote it in a letter and said he didn’t feel bad or sorry about it, he thought it was a good thing actually.  Oh boy.  

I disappeared for two days but came back after deep reflection and tried to understand his point of view and why he had cheated.  I forgave him (though he wasn’t sorry).  We made a list of things we could do to build the relationship, slept together in the same bed, shared a few laughs.

Mine and my ex’s plan for a long time had been to register as a domestic partnership, ensuring a future return option to the happy-go-lucky lifestyle I have here.  See, tutoring is nice and i’m my own boss, but isn't my passion, so I’ll be going home to pursue an internship and get a few job hookups...see my family and friends...speak english.  But all with the hopes that I can learn some skills in the States and come back over the pond for some applicaton.

We had solidified this plan a week before we broke up.  I asked him, ‘Do you still want to be my domestic partner?”  and he said, “Yes” and kissed me.

We broke up a week later, after I go in for a kiss, and he dancingly backs off, singing “distance!”

I can’t believe I was ever with this clown.

I move to the couch downstairs and we frustratedly ignored each other for a week until one day, he enters my den and sits down.  He asked me if I had thought about what I was going to do with my future?...this insecurity was one of his reasons he cheated.  I was just shocked by his approach.  I moved here to be with him, excuse me if I have just graduated from college and didn’t find a career plan in a foreign country.

I told him that we both know we don’t want to be with the other.  He deceived me in regards to the domestic partnership.  I will leave in very poor form this country which I had come to love. 

Despite my frustration with him, we had a bit of a post mortem conversation, played backgammon and smoked a joint.  Things were genial.  

And luckily, just a week before we broke up, my oldest friend/twice ex-boyfriend had moved into the house.  Therefore I had gotten over the breakup quickly enough, sexually speaking...and also he was a good support system emotionally, telling me that he respected me for having a good head on my shoulders throughout this debacle.  

Nonetheless, I was still moping about the fact I had no way of coming back.  And things were not long term with me and my oldest friend.  He proposed to his girlfriend a week later.

The next weekend, I go out with my (F) roommate one weekend.  We meet up with some people she knows through my other (M) roommate and his buddy (read: my ex's buddy as well.  They all know each other through the same group of university friends), who she was occasionally having sex with.  We partied a bit hard and the three of us, me, my (F) roommate, and buddy ended up back at his apartment.  I don't remember the specifics of the conversation there, but in my drunken ramblings I was complaining about being squeezed out of a domestic partnership and how betrayed I felt.  The buddy apparently offered up his little brother to me.  That ngiht we slept like sardines on the bed.

The next morning I woke up and left them to have some alone time, trying to make up for the cock blocking I had done the night before.

A week later my ex upsets me for shitting all over an idea I had about my next move in life, after he asked me again of my future plans.  I was vulnerable and feeling down, so I went upstairs and cried, and reemerged, heavy hearted and confiding in my (F) roommate about my state of my affairs.  She holds me and tries to cheer me up by jokingly reminding me that buddy had offered up his little brother.  In the heat of desperation I said something along the lines of, ""Oh, yeah, I should really get his number"".

Apparently sometime after this meeting, (F) roommate shoots off a text to buddy saying that I might really want to meet his little brother, or that I seem pretty desperate, somewhere in that genre of pity.

A week or two later, we threw a party at our house.  In preparation, myself and (F) roommate stocked the bar, cleaned, etc, though we had invited no one.  The insignificant 5th roommate in the house, who invited 50 people, twiddles his thumbs and watches us work.  My ex, who invited plenty of people, eventually shows up after midnight.  People are being stupid, belligerent drunks.  It was a fucking mess, and I was hating every second of it.  The music was shitty, and the DJ nearly had a meltdown when I asked him to lower the music.  It was ridiculous.  

In the middle of this bordelique shitfest, buddy asks me if we can speak outside for two minutes.  We go on the balcony which is filled with loud, wasted people (our poor neighbors) and he starts on about how much time and effort I invested into being in this country.  That getting a domestic partnership is just a matter of paperwork, and worth it so that I can stay.  I can barely hear him, and he's fairly soft-spoken, so I say, ""Yeah, I should look up your little brother""

He looks at me confused and says, ""No, I'm talking about me.  I won't be married for another 2 years at least, I'm not looking anyway, and it's just a matter of paperwork.  I can help you out.""

My eyes lit up and it was like I was really looking at him for the first time.  It is such a kind gesture and in that moment I realized what an incredibly nice man he is.  But I ask him anyway, ""You're not doing this to fuck me, right?""

He assures me that it has nothing to do with that.  And I believe him.  I ask if he's any longer with my (F) roommate and he says, ""I prefer her as a friend"".  He told me that he asked my ex if having a domestic partnership with me bothers him.  My ex told buddy that he didn’t care, so there we go.  Buddy texts me his email in case I ever need anything.  We go back inside.

The incompetent party continues but I am running around, cleaning up everyone's mess with a spring in my step.  I am sweeping broken glass off the floor when the buddy swoops me up and carries me outside and tells me that I should be having fun, not cleaning.  He holds me and smiles with his eyes.  I wriggle out and go back to cleaning so that we weren't sued in the morning.

Everybody finally passes out.  The sun is up.  Buddy gets next to me in bed and gently puts his hand on my hip.  The next morning we wake up and he takes my arm and puts it under his head and cuddles me.  As this is happening, (F) roommate walks in and sees us.  I think, from her lack of reaction, that things indeed must have cooled between them.

Fast forward a few days later.  I'm in the town and my oldest friend blows me off.  I sent off a text to the buddy asking if we can grab a beer and talk about this domestic partnership thing.

We meet up and he gets the first round, I get the second.  We’re halfway to losertown in a blind quiz when the pitcher appears.  I knew where it was headed, the signs were clear.  I kissed him outside the bar and at the end of the night he unneedingly asks, “Are we going to mine?”.  I sit on the handlebars of my bike as he pedals and sings in my ear.  

We make love, again and again.  He is an adonis, strong and gentle.  He is a cool person and a good conversationalist, he remembers what I say in conversation and quotes me.  We laugh a lot and have a great time.  He loves to be held, and his head is often on my bosom.  We both feel good.  

We’re in bed when he asks what should we say to the people around us about us?  We agree to say nothing.  We just want to give it a try, we said.  No need to put pressure on us.  I’m leaving in two months, so let’s just have some quiet fun.

That plan blows up pretty quickly due to the fact that I live with my (M) roommate and (F) roommate.  They put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly, when they saw me struggling to look good the next weekend before I went out.  They asked me who I was flirting with that night and I kind of hesitated in my response.  Some friend of my oldest friend.  And they called their buddy to see what he was up to, and he said he was with a friend.  They all speak one of those old gendered languages so they are like, “Oh...who’s the dame?”, and they became suspicious when he was tepid on the subject.

Being exposed in the way we were made us cringe; we hadn’t acted like adults and and we felt bad.  I really love my (F) roommate and never meant to hurt her.  She was upset that I had taken her for an idiot.  I apologized as best as I could.

With that dose of guilt sloppily resolved, the buddy and I have a sexy weekend.  But it was interrupted by a slew of angry texts we had both received from my ex.  My ex is not as tight with this buddy so he found our relationship out a week later.  He wrote that he wished he never met me.

I texted him back, saying we would speak that later that night.  We took a walk through the city streets, him toting him bike, and railing on about how there are so many men in this city, why did I have to sleep with his friend?  He then irrelevantly spiraled off and unearthed a whole recap of the failures in our relationship.  I asked him if I stopped seeing his buddy, would he go back to being friends with him?  He said he didn’t know and pedaled away to a party of his friends, the same group of college kids he knows his buddy through.  They didn’t talk much at the shindig, but the impression was clearly that my ex wanted some distance from him.  My ex then chugged a beer and left the party.  

The last functioning drunk at the party approaches the buddy and says something like, “Hey little husband” in reference to him partnering with me.  That much is apparently known among the members of the group.  But the buddy in his utter emotional dilemma confessed to this friend that we had had sex and that’s why my ex wasn’t there for long.

The next morning, my ex picks another fight with me.  He has now also found out that I slept with my oldest friend, and wants nothing to do with him, either.  Things escalate and he puts his hands on me, which I never in a million years thought he would do.  I saw him handle being ripped off by his old roommates with admirable grace, and I thought he was always so emotionally controlled.  Not this, he was really upset.

That night, I meet up with the buddy to discuss his feelings.  We talk, I try to convince him that I’m his friend’s ex for two months now, that my ex is perhaps mad about me having sex in general (as per his response to finding out I had slept with my oldest friend) and that if we stop seeing each other now then all this shit we stirred up will have been for nothing.  We’re kissing all the meanwhile but anyway he says, he needs some time to think about it.

The next day he sends me a text saying he thinks we shouldn’t see each other anymore.  It being a textual conversation, I was court with my disappointment but thankful for his continuing willingness to partner with me. 

The day after that, my ex and I get to talking again and we bury the hatchet.  We shake hands and he apologizes for the first time for having hurt me when he cheated on me.  Since then we have been very pleasant with each other.  He’s either one hell of an actor or he’s truly calmed down.

The day after I sent the buddy a text asking about some papers for the partnership, and also to tell him that my ex and I are on good terms.  We meet up in the park and we are stroking each other as he says his decision is non-negotiable.  I make my case again about validating what we went through, giving it a try, and also that all my ex is asking for is some distance, he doesn’t want to know or care what we do, and he’s much more at peace now.  In fact, that very night my ex had brought over a girl to the house to cook dinner for, and I was counting on buddy to hang out with me a little while so I didn’t have to go back early.  He happily obliged to play billiards with me so I don’t go home prematurely, and we make our way over to a hall.

On the way over, we’re talking but it’s fairly littered with innuendos, about him being a heartbreaker and whatnot.  He stops in the middle of the journey and says that I have him in my pocket and we kissed.  We got at the billiard hall, betted on a couple of sexual favors, and headed back to his place.

The next night, he has a drink with (M) roommate to talk things over.  (M) roommate thinks this whole thing is a bad idea.  He thinks it’s a violation of the bro-code.  Despite the fact that the girl my ex brought over the night before was once (M) roommate’s love interest.  (M) roommate is a real man of principle. 

I was worried so I sent a message to buddy, asking him that he keep me up to date with his feelings because they effect mine.  He asked if we could meet up over the weekend.  I was convinced that this would be the end because (M) roommate and buddy are tight.  I was all ready to say that I will be friends with him, for his mind’s sake.

Saturday comes and he approaches me in the park with a crisp “Hey lady” and kisses me on the mouth.  He tells me that he feels bad about what happened with my ex and his friends (he thinks his other friends have lost trust in him), but when he’s with me life is beautiful.  And he wants to spend time with me and if or until the guilt gets too overwhelming, we’ll be good friends otherwise.  I was happy with that, and we went back to his and made love.  We both had plans that night so we parted ways, with plans to see him play tennis with his little brother the day after.

Well, he had partied hard and wasn’t feeling very sportive the next day.  But the way he worded his texts, saying, ‘take care’ and signing his name...I knew something was off.  

I waited three days and then I called him.  I was in town and wanted to know if I could stop over.  He said yes.  I go over and he tells me he talked with another friend, and he feels bad about us again.  He thinks we shouldn’t be together, or even get a domestic partnership.  I am exhausted, tired of making the same argument, and basically just call him a loser.  He says, “Fuck you.”  I say, “Yeah, fuck me”.  He did.

We had a great time as usual, and in the morning he told me he was going to the countryside with his family to reflect.  I told him I wanted him to talk to someone, his family or a stranger, but someone not from his friend group who can shed some unbiased opinions.  I wanted him to hold on to the partnership agreement, because I already spent more money, more time, and more effort reloading the process.  Most importantly, it’s obvious that this partnership was the birth of our relationship, so if we broke that off then we really went through a whole bunch of social awkwardness, friendship straining bullshit for nothing.  

This is where he currently is: in the countryside, pondering over life.  I am currently at home, on a saturday night, writing this.  He told me don’t fret about it, that I should have a good weekend.  I can’t.  

I need some advice.  I don’t know if I’m in the right.  Things are resolved with him and my (F) roommate; in fact, her, my (M) roommate and him are looking to move into a house with another friend.  I have extinguished the tension at home, and I believe that my ex’s behavior towards me predicts that one day in the future my ex and his buddy will be able to put it behind them.

I would let him go, except that we get on so well with one another.  He makes me happy, and I make him happy, and I want to fight for that, and convince him if I can that it’s okay for us to see each other.  I hope this isn’t wishful thinking.  I know I can’t control the thoughts or actions of others but is there something I can do to help my desires be realized?

Thanks for tuning in.

edit: clarified my tl;dr...doink!

I sleep eight hours on most nights, but I always feel fatigued and weak during the day, which causes me to just sit around and daydream for hours, and then cancel whatever plans I had to spend many more hours in bed on the computer until I go to sleep.

There are so many things I want to do--finish a business plan I started, finish a novel I started, get fit at the gym, etc--but I feel blocked from doing anything but wasting lots of time. Forcing myself to do something just results in such low quality that I end up having to throw it out anyway. And I have no energy to exercise at the gym on most days.

I have a problem with social anxiety as well, due to the fact that I am ugly and too quiet. This has led to me being rejected from so many job interviews for jobs that I actually felt motivation toward doing. I am now working at a crappy and dirty job for minimum wage, and I literally sob myself to sleep thinking about suicide every night after I get done working.

I am one semester away from graduating from college, and I haven't gotten any internships due to my incompetence at interviews. I am screwed, and I am going to be working jobs like the one I am in now forever unless I end it.

The only thing keeping me around now is fear, and the fact that I don't want to leave my family with a corpse and a need to fund a funeral."

My fiancé and I recently broke up. We were together for five years and though I didn't see it for much of that time, she was my entire world. Now, our relationship was far from perfect, we had fundamental difference about where we wanted our lives to go, but we got together young and we loved each other so deeply for so long that I thought we could work our differences out. Compromise and still live a beautiful life together. I still don't think I was wrong having this perspective, and in the end it was not our differences that led to our separation. 

Unfortunately, it was my behavior that really tore us apart. At about year 3 I started taking her for granted and focusing all of my time and attention towards my career and academic work. She began getting fed up with me, but I did not pay her feelings much attention. I just thought she would change to accommodate me as I was being responsible and ambitious by focusing on my career. A few weeks ago I took a 3 month internship out of town. She wanted me to stay with her and not take it. I didn't have to take it, I had plenty of other opportunities in town. I just though it was a good career move, so I did. A week into the job, she let me go. 

Immediately, my world fell apart. I told her I would quit work and come back to her. Do anything to have her back. But it was an action too little and a moment too late. I had squandered all of her patience. 

I barely sleep nowadays and I keep waking up drenched in sweat. Any moment alone is unbearable so I go out every night. I literally talk to anyone about anything just so I do not have to be alone with my thoughts.

I'm going to spend the next chapter of my life becoming a better man. The lessons of heartache have really illuminated my flaws and I cannot ignore the things I have learned. I don't think there is any chance she will ever take me back, but I want to make sure that if I ever get the chance to be with a woman as kind and as beautiful that I treat her as she deserves to be treated. 

Peoplez, always treat the people you love with greatest care. Nothing amounts to anything without them.

1geh9i,4,2013-06-15,It's over and I [24/f] know it. Just need some after-the-fact perspective with [31/m].,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1geh9i/its_over_and_i_24f_know_it_just_need_some/,"First of all: Thank you SO MUCH in advance for reading. Onward:

We dated for a total of four months. I was hesitant to commit to the relationship at first because he has two full-time jobs and a slew of other commitments, but he asked that I ""just say yes"" and I stopped fighting the fact that I was becoming increasingly interested and emotionally invested in him. I thought he felt the same. 

As the weeks went by, he was seeing me less and less. Started at two-to-three times a week, months two-through-four ended with an average of once. We live two metro stops apart from each other. He has literally taken a 12-minute run to my place before. I tried my best to cope with his responsibilities but he's also a very dry and highly private person. I'm a bit on the ""needier"" side and if I'm not exposed to much contact, I'd like to be reassured that I am wanted in someone's life in other ways, but his emotions are equally as compartmentalized as his schedule.

We just weren't matching up. I started becoming a major source of stress in his life because I would speak up about how I felt like a time slot, and he started becoming a major source of depression in mine because I felt unworthy of someone's attention or reassurance. He would invite me to events that he participated in every now and again so I at least knew that he wasn't hiding me away from his friends. But he would be too busy for anything having to do with my world unless it was to come over to see me exclusively once a week, which was always so carefully timed. 

If I playfully held onto him in bed for an extra five minutes in the morning, he would become grumpy about how he ""set an alarm for a reason."" The more I got to know him, the more his responsibilities seemed to consume him and the more I felt completely helpless. In spite of this, I grew to admire and love him as a person and all I ever wanted was to be there for him as he was there for me in a couple of emergency situations.

Unfortunately, I came to two big breaking points where I completely flipped my lid. The first time was when I had a dear friend visiting from another country and he could not spare 20 minutes in the span of four days just to introduce himself. I felt so insignificant. I started thinking of my previous relationships when I'd be in school full time, working 35 hrs/week at an unpaid internship, bartending at night to sustain myself, and would still move things around to make my SO feel like an SO. After my friend left I wrote him at a highly inconvenient time when he was working within a deadline because I. Just. Couldn't. Take. Anymore. He immediately called me and the next day we seemed to work it out. Promises of him trying harder, promises of me being more patient, etc etc...

Nothing changed. And when I confronted him about this, he told me that the change has to be gradual or else it would not be genuine. I understood and a big part of that understanding came from legitimately respecting the work he was producing. It is undeniable that the guy doesn't respect his limits, but he's absolutely brilliant and I wanted to continue to support him in any way that he'd let me. But I started to grow resentful of how he roped me into this relationship in the first place, and that's when the creeping feeling of ""he's just not that into you"" kicked in. It just didn't seem like he was eager to see me at all anymore. At the end, getting him to just let me cook for him was like pulling teeth and I was losing my mind again. I wasn't sure if I was in love with him or so deprived of attention that I was going bonkers, or both. It came to a head two days ago:

We had both been away traveling for work and hadn't seen each other for a week. Again, he's not one to express himself romantically so I just had to believe that somewhere between our sarcastic text messaging he held some kind of feelings for me. He slept over once after our trips and we took a run the day after for an hour then had dinner for another hour. During this time, he just wasn't being affectionate and I was well aware of how under pressure he was feeling from his work but I just couldn't get past the fact that there was nothing I, his girlfriend, could do to improve his mood or that he didn't even seem to miss me. A few days later, I encountered a work conflict of my own and he agreed to meet me for lunch because I was just shaking with frustration. We had plans to spend time together that night. He playfully told me to punch his hand. I did, softly. He said ""no, harder, for real."" I wouldn't. I was just exhausted and emotionally drained from four months of feeling like I'm fighting an uphill battle to get my own boyfriend to enjoy spending time with me, and missing a deadline at work. He then told me to punch his hand like I mean it or he'll slap me, in a joking manor of course. Before I could finish saying ""you're not going to slap me"" he did. VERY playfully and lightly. I cannot emphasize this enough. If it was any other day, with any other person, under any other circumstances I'd laugh and call him a buttplug then actually punch his hand. This was not in any way, shape, or form aggressive or abusive behavior. It was just a joke that I would normally be very receptive to. 

Not today. My mind just went blank and I walked away from him. I wrote him telling him to ""fuck off"" and that ""words cannot express how done with you I am"" followed by the full gambit of telling him how unwanted I feel and how I really must have little to no respect for myself to be with someone that treats me like another one of his carefully timed responsibilities even when he does spend time with me. 

It took me a few hours to cool down, and I felt absolutely terrible for how poorly I reacted. I apologized like it was my job. I told him that I don't want to lose him, and that I've just been feeling like I'm going insane in the relationship but I want to work on my patience because I don't want to be this insecure person anymore. I told him that I've never experienced such turbulence in the first four months of dating someone and I am not used to someone as aloof as him, but I admire him and adore him so much and I want to make this work. He told me that the stress I'm causing him is no longer worth it. I asked him to think on it, and he told me that's he's no longer willing to talk or think about this for a few days and he just needs a mental break. I obliged and I went home to cry. Not only because I feel like I'm losing a great man, but because I seriously hurt someone with being, for lack of better words, a total crazy bitch. We each did not hold up our end of the bargain. He allocated even less time for our relationship/affection towards me, and I couldn't hold myself back from overreacting and subsequently stressing him out again.

What the hell is wrong with me? I have never acted this way before. Why does he make me insane? It's only been four months. Am I truly so ridiculously needy and insecure and living inside my own wormy brain's paranoia that I can't handle being left to my own devices six days out of the week? It's not like I don't have things to do. I have a pretty demanding job myself and I run, am occupied with some minor health problems, I'm furnishing a new apartment, I have friends, I write, I'm working on my ""best of"" Batman comic collection, you get the idea. I would, however, keep my schedule extremely fluid and even get behind on some things because his was obviously far more structured and if I wanted to see him at all, that's just the way it had to be. And if I am just a totally normal female, why have I allowed myself to be treated like I'm a casual hobby for four months by the first guy I slept with after moving to a new city? Am I some kind of masochist chasing after unavailable men because I think so little of myself?

**TL;DR: seeing a guy for four months who very carefully allocated a small amount of time for me, went a little bonkers with my insecurity, need advice on what the hell is wrong with me.**

*EDIT:* I know I've said it in the beginning but THANK YOU. I was really expecting to be torn a new one in my psycho-chick caboose but you guys have been so rational and kind while putting my mind in the right place.

*Second EDIT after reading this with a calmer head:* Grammar, some further clarification, but the point still remains. And, again, **THANK YOU ALL.** This is why I Reddit.

1gec0o,2,2013-06-15,Quick advice/What does this mean?,Gimlet40,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/1gec0o/quick_advicewhat_does_this_mean/,"First time posting here and just started following seddit and bettering myself; I'm still learning the ropes. Figured this would be better for this subreddit. 

A little backstory: The place I intern at got a new, cute girl intern a couple weeks ago. I figured that since it's only for the summer, what the hell, I'll try to see where it goes. Things seemed to go great...she went a little out of her way to say hello and goodbye when she came and left, we went to get lunch a lot, touching and joking around, and she really seemed to enjoy talking to me. 

So I was going to go get food at this place that has a little car meetup every weekend. It's a fun place even if you aren't a car nut and there are plenty of places to go around it. I invited her thinking that whether she comes or not I'll be going and having fun. Sometimes a couple friends are there so I did mention that some guys I know may be there for a while, but we wouldn't hangout with them for long. She seemed interested to go, gave me her number, and I texted her last night to confirm. 

She wrote back:
""Hey yeah Im staying at my friends tonight and tomorrow so im gonna see with her but that should be good""

Followed with:
""So she's in and she said she's bringing someone else too but idk who. So we will be there :)""

I'm pretty confused and some of my girl friends I asked are also confused as to why she didnt ask before she invited her friend(s). The last two weeks she seemed really interested and we even escalated with kino. Then this came in and it seems it could be a lot of different things. Either since she thought I'd have friends there she thought she could bring some incase it's awkward, it's a double date (if her friend is bringing a guy), or this is a bitchy attempt to friendzone me by not being alone with her.

I was thinking of telling her Im canceling today and trying to set up a more direct date another week without any friends, or I may just go, be social, and just enjoy the event and not care what happens. Sorry for the wall of text...but I'm confused as hell and want to learn from this experience. Any advice on what I should do, or why this happened? 

TL;DR: Invite girl from summer internship to a casual food/car show place to hangout. She ends up inviting her friend, who also is bringing a friend. Don't know whats going on."

It was Friday, and it had been an excruciatingly long week at work. I was thrilled to be going home to spend the weekend with my wife, Lauren. On my way I stopped off and picked up a bottle of Merlot and cheesy slasher flick from Blockbuster.

I pulled into the garage and made my way inside. When I entered the living room, I heard the shower running, and I made my way across the hall and into the bedroom to change out of my shirt and tie. When I entered the bedroom, I froze. Laying out on the bed was the black, single straped cocktail dress that I had bought for Lauren on our anniversary several years ago. To be honest, I had forgotten all about it. She had worn it a grand total of two times – once, the night the I gave it to her, and a second occasion on my birthday last year. She had told me that it left too little to the imagination and that there was never really an appropriate time to wear it.

I heard the shower switch off, and I untied my tie, pulled off my dress shirt and unbuckled and discarded my pants in the hamper. As I was pulling on a pair of gym shorts, Lauren entered the room wrapped in a towel.

“Hey there, my man,” she said.

I walked over and hugged her against me. “Did I forget an occasion tonight?” I said, looking at the cocktail dress lying on the bed.

She looked at the dress, as if seeing it for the first time and then said, “Oh! No, nothing like that at all. I don't remember if you recall me mentioning it, but out intern at work? He's been a little mopey this week. I pried it out of him – his long term girlfriend gave him the boot last weekend. He's been acting like a beaten puppy all week, so I told him I was going to take him out tonight to get his mind off of it. I hope that's okay?”

I looked at her lovingly. I have always been so taken in by her capacity to find kindness for anyone in need. “Of course, that's okay,” I said. “Where were you planning on taking him tonight?”

She tilted her head to one side as she attached a ruby, teardrop earring to one ear and then followed suit with the other. “I was thinking of taking him to the oyster bar on Longbough Avenue – they have such an exciting atmosphere there.”

“That sounds like a great pick,” I said. “Can I help you get ready?”

She kissed my cheek and turned to her dresser, pulling out the top drawer. Dropping her towel to the ground, she selected a pair of lacy black panties that she stepped into and pulled up over her hips. I dug around in another drawer in the dresser and found her matching bra, which I helped her clasp once she pulled it on. She straightened her hair and applied her mascara. Her eye liner gave her an exotic appearance, like the princess of a king's harem.

Finally, she pulled her cocktail dress over her head and inched it down her body. Lauren is a little bit on the heftier side, like a dark haired Adele with a thinner, more assertive face. The cocktail dress compliments her curves perfectly, and I feel my heart hasten its pace.

“You look amazing. As always,” I said.

She smiled and twirled for both my benefit and the mirror's. She collected her purse and kissed me again. “I'm not sure how late I'll be out tonight, so don't feel like you have to stay up,” she said. We both know that I will.

I walk her out to her car and watch her drive off before heading back inside. This is where time screeches to a halt, where I'm alone in the apartment with nothing but my thoughts. I decided to take the time to clean. I put away the dishes and vacuum the living room and the bedroom. I scrub down the toilet bowl and the bathroom sink. Finally, I turn off the lights and slump down on the couch and start flicking through the channels, trying to find something worth watching, but nothing holds my attention.

Most of the remaining hours are spent pacing furtively before I start to nod off.

I'm woken out of a doze by the sound of a car pulling into the driveway. I make my way over to the window and peer out of the blinds. It's not Lauren's car, but I see her get out of the passenger's side all the same. She makes her way over to the driver's side and leans through the open window for several seconds before pulling her head out. When she does so, I notice that the strap on her cocktail dress has slid down almost to her elbow. She pulls the strap back up and starts making her way towards the house, one foot in front of the other like she's doing a field sobriety test. She's holding her heels in her right hand. When she's climbed to the top of the steps, she turns and waves and the car pulls out of the driveway and drives off. I hear her fumbling with her keys outside before I open the door for her. She looks at my dreamily as she steps inside and half falls against me. I can smell the alcohol on her breath and I'm so grateful that she had the sense not to drive home.

“Welcome home, wifey,” I said, as I guided her into the living room, sitting her on the couch. “Do you want some water?”

“Do we have anything else to drink?”

“I picked up some Merlot on my way home tonight,” I said.

“A glass of that,” she said, and giggles girlishly.

I fetch her a glass of wine and hand it to her. At this point she's leaning against the back of the couch, slumped slightly, and I kneel down in front of her on the floor. I place a hand on each knee and spread her legs, allowing for her dress to ride up her thighs and pile around her hips. She lifts her self up and pulls the dress up the rest of the way. At this point I have my head between her legs and a musky smell of sex washes over me. Her pussy lips are red and swollen, they look as though they've been in a prize fight and won. Part of me wants her to say something like, “You should see the other guy,” but of course she doesn't. This is an intimate moment and talking would ruin it. This is sacred.

I start kissing her outer lips to determine their sensitivity and she lets out an appreciative “ooh.” I start delving deeper with my tongue. Exploring her wetness with gentle lapping moments. Finally I'm rewarded with a small gush and a stream of his come runs out. I dart my tongue underneath to catch it and draw it into my mouth. I feel it rolling around and I can't help but think of oysters in the own liqueur. I hold back a laugh, tilt my head back, and swallow. I feel the slime slide down my throat.

Before I can investigate for more, Lauren grabs me roughly by the wrist and pulls me to my feet. She pulls down my gym shorts and boxers and manhandles me to the couch. She slings one leg over me and then pulls up the other, kneeling on either side of me. She lowers herself down onto my now stuff cock and I feel myself sliding into her. She takes me all the way into her with ease, and holds that position for a moment, but it's too intense. I feel myself start to stiffen and spurt into her.

“I'm sorry,” I said, out of breath, “I'm always too quick.”

She smiles, “It's okay, believe me, as sore as I am, this is a good thing.” She kisses me and starts to stand up, her feet still on the couch.

She sets one foot up against the back of the couch, leaning against the wall with one hand, taking a sip of wine from the glass in her other. Then she lowers her bare mound over my mouth. I start lapping my come out of her and she grinds herself against my face. I start having difficulty breathing and I pull my head back but she drives herself down harder. Stars explode in front of my eyes as she rubs her clit against my nose and I feel her legs finally tightening as she comes. We collapse together on the couch and turn the television on. She's laying behind me, I can feel her breasts press up against my back as she reaches around to play with my now soft cock.

“Do you want to hear about it?” She asks.

“I do, please. Tell me all about it.”

“What do you want to know?” She teases.

I pause. She knows what I'm going to say, but even after all these times, it still isn't any less embarrassing to say.

“Tell me about his cock.” I finally say.

She's moans slightly, briefly to prolong my torment. “He was big. Probably seven or eight inches, and thick.” She says thick like it was butter or chocolate melting in her mouth. I feel myself stir again.

“I told him you were out of town, and that I was alone and bored for the evening, and 'could we go back to your place to keep drinking?' We fucked all night, and he filled me up. And the cum that didn't slide out of me and down my leg is in your belly now.” She started stroking me harder now.

“Was it better – than me?” I gasped out as she jerked me off.

“Words can't describe how good it was.” She leaned it and whispered into my ear,” It was like he was born to fuck my cunt.” I squirted out onto her hand and she raised it up to my mouth. I licked her palm and her fingers clean, and then she wiped her hand off on my side.

And like that, we fell asleep wrapped up together. Dreaming of the events that night and of events to come."

1gdk1n,2,2013-06-14,Vote up if I don't understand kids today (I'm 24),proROKexpat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gdk1n/vote_up_if_i_dont_understand_kids_today_im_24/,"I sponsored a highschool intern from August to Jan of 2012-2013. I had this young kid come into my dealership to learn about car sales. He said he really liked it, and that he wanted to make something out of it. Well he's 18 and we got issues with hiring 18 year olds. The primary problem is that they are 18 and immature. 

Well he finished High School and wanted to come work for us, my senior mgt was very much against the idea of hiring an 18 yr old (we have a poor success rate, and we aren't the kinda dealer that just takes anyone) but because I went to bat for him they said to give him a test run. If he does well on the test run based upon my word they will hire him.

The kid knows what time our shop opens, he also knows I expect everyone 30 minutes early everybody does. Those 30 minutes allow you to adjust for the day and get ready. 

So I called him and said ""Kid, are you serious about working for us?"" he goes ""Yes"" I said ""Ok, we are going give you a test run tomorrow do you know what we expect of you?"" he goes ""Yes I do"" I then said ""Come here, and kick some ass tomorrow and we will go from there""

Kid didn't come in at 30 minutes prior (as he knew was expected and as I was expect on a guy who is serious about making 80-100k a year at 18 he understands this)

Kid didn't come in on time (at this point the kid was fired before he started)

Kid didn't show...He's done.

When I was his age and wanting to work for my company my boss said to be here at 9 AM I was there at 7:45 and spent my time reading all the window stickers on the car and had a few questions on what some options where...

A bit disappointed but relieved not I don't have to worry about this kids ability to do the job...Cause he will never work for us."

I just finished my first semester at college with a 3.5 GPA and towards the end of my second semester I finally decided to major in math, as my school doesn't offer an actuary science major. So far I've completed Calculus I+II+III along with discrete structures I. Next semester I am planning on taking differential equations, Linear algebra, applied statistics and computing I in terms of math classes. 




   Now I've been lurking around for a bit as well as looking things up and I'm trying to find out a way to start my studying. I've come up with the idea that I'll start studying for my P exam over the summer and along side my statistics course, and then continue studying until I feel comfortable with the material to take the exam. My second semester of sophomore year I could take a course that will complement the FM test and then I could get started on that as well. Then finally what I have in mind is that I could try for a internship the following summer to start building up a resume.  




Past these ideas I don't know what will happen/where to go. I was hoping you guys could criticize and or give me advice on what to do such as what book to get to start studying for the P exam.  



   I notice this one - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BPCJA6/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller= On amazon and was wondering if that was a good choice.



  Thank you for reading and I am well aware that become an actuary can take a lot of time, not just from the years and years it takes to finally become certified, but by the day by day process one must take."

As my internship is in Emerging Market debt, I am going need to know a lot about bonds.

At the moment I understand the basics (I.e What is a bond, why do they exist), but other than that my knowledge is pretty thin.

I have set aside a fair amount of time (~70 work hours) between now and my placement to develop my knowledge further, and would greatly appreciate any guidance any of you may have with regards to learning resources. My issue is that I am keen to learn but am finding it difficult knowing the best way to channel my work into such a broad field.

As a mathematics student my ideal resource would be:
- Mathematical in nature
- Textbook-like form with definitions, examples and problems
- Challenging and not dry
- Available online

Clearly it's unlikely that more than 1 or 2 of these criteria will be satisfied, but I think it's important to give you guys an idea of the way I'm trying to tackle this.

Any help will be enormously appreciated!

During the month of July I'll be working as an intern at an advertising firm in your beautiful capital. I'll be staying in the portuense area (I know it's not going to be easy, I don't speak Italian and it's an area for locals-only, but it was very cheap) and going to the office located very close to the Roma Ostiense station, but I'll be working all day and head into the city centre on the weekends. Shopping for groceries shouldn't be a problem, haha.

But during the weekends, I'll take my trusty bike (I get to borrow one) and hopefully discover small hidden gems of Rome. I'm not that interested in the touristy places since I've been in rome on several occasions. But I'll probably visit a few museums since I'm very interested in art.

I also have a few questions:

1. I've heard the season tickets for public transport is fairly cheap. Since I'm arriving on the 1st of July I should probably buy one for the month. Is this a wise desicion? Who sell these season tickets?

2. Any nice places to visit in Trastevere? Or maybe even in Portuense? Any fun markets? 

3. Shops for italian produced things? I'm looking for stores similair to [Labour and Wait](http://www.labourandwait.co.uk/) in London or [Manufactum](http://www.manufactum.com/home.html) and [DYRM?](http://www.doyoureadme.de/) in Berlin. Movies, books, magazines, music, tools, clothing and bric-á-brac etc.

4. What kind of gift should I bring my colleagues at the office? What's always appreciated? 

5. How insanely hot is it during July?

Thanks for any tips or recommendations!

We went through three years of high school dating and just finished our first long distance year away from each other at college. During college, we are about three and a half hours away from each other. Anyway, I thought that coming back this summer to our hometown where we both live would be great and that we would have a fun and memorable summer and fall in love even more since we would actually be close and around each other more! 

That's not what has happened so far.

So far, I have worked about forty hours a week while we works at his internship three days a week and teaches tennis lessons a few days, as well. 

I'm trying as hard as I can to still communicate with him. For example, I try to text him everyday that I wake up to tell him that I love him or even just to wish him a good day at work. It's frustrating to me because  if i dont text him first, he will wake up at 8 am and not text me until at least 4 in the afternoon. I just feel like he isn't even trying to communicate or have a relationship with me. I even try my hardest to make sure I am showing appreciation whenever he says anything nice to me or texts me good morning, but I don't think he is getting the hint. 
I just need help finding someway to make our relationship have that spark again.

 I have been trying to make time for him, but every time I try he says that he needs to have a family night with his family or that he already didn't hang out with his friends once this summer so that he could come see me. I just wish that we could get our spark back and that he would take time out of his life to even just text me a nice message or something! 

**How do I get the spark back and how do I get him to notice and communicate with me more?** HELP!

tl;dr **how do I get the spark back with a boyfriend who will barely communicate with me because he is too busy?**"

1gfnzg,2,2013-06-15,Dad.,fadelakin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gfnzg/dad/,"My dad is not my biggest fan. He doesn't support me in the things I do. He never told me he loved me. He's cold. I remember when I was young, he would always decide what I did. I have never really had to decide anything for myself. He always had the last say and his say was final. My parents got a divorce the summer before my freshman year of high school and I decided to move in with my mom. Moving in with my mom was the greatest decision I ever made. She allowed me to think freely. I could do things I want. For once I had a social life. I was making friends in school because I could now hangout with them after school. I was getting invited to parties which for me was a big deal. I really felt like I could do anything I wanted. My mom was the best. Then it all changed. In January of this year after losing her job and not finding a replacement, my mom decided to leave the country to go back home to Africa. 

I was fine with it. In fact, I was planning to go back with my mom because I haven't stepped foot on African soil in nearly 8 years and I would like to go back. My mom said no. She said my education was more important and she wanted the best for me so she sent me to live with my dad. After being with my mom for so long, I thought things would be fine. They weren't. I went from being a social person back to an outcast. In high school, all that matters (at least at my high school) is your social standing and if you can hangout, go to parties and what not. My dad did not let me do any of that. It was always a no. He never offers a reason as to why I can't do the things I want to. 

This summer, I was given an opportunity to attend an internship at a tech company in San Francisco. I love programming. I love to travel. I was excited. I told my dad about it and he said ""ok"". I didn't know what he meant by that but it seemed vaguely positive. I began to look for housing. I found housing in SF. I had the CEO of the company help me check out the place and person I would be staying with and he said it would be perfect for me. I was so happy because now all that was left was for me to book my flight and my dad had said that wouldn't be a problem.

He lied. When I told him about me finding housing and asked him about the flight, he came up with an excuse. He said he would be quitting his job for 3 months to do an internship that his university arranged for him so he could get the credits to graduate. I think I should also mention that my dad is near 50 and he has 3 degrees. I have no idea why he keeps going back to school. It seems like all he wants is more and more and more and more. He can't have enough. So because he was quitting his job, money would be tight around the house. Ok. I emailed the CEO and asked him what I should do. He got back to me and said they would be able to book my flight for me. Wow. That's fantastic. I immediately go tell my dad and once again he says ""ok"" which seems vaguely positive. As a 17 yr old, who is trying to live life to the fullest, this is a good thing. I'm going to a new city for a couple of months while doing something that I love. No problems right? 

I get emailed some forms that my dad needs to sign. A ""Release of Liability and Indemnification Agreement"" and the internship offer letter. I ask him if he could sign the forms so I can figure out when they should book my flight and know when I can go. He says no. I've received the word no from him all my life but this time was different. I felt like a part of me was removed and just disappear. Him saying no affected me more than it should have. I nearly broke down because I just did all this work to be able to go and I can't because my dad won't let me. He says the only way he would sign the forms was if I didn't go. I'm still trying to understand what he meant by that. I don't know what to do and I just need someone to talk to. I really feel like I'm being held back by being with my dad. He and my mom don't talk so there's nothing she can do. I'm going to be a senior this coming school year and I'm turning 18 in October. I would love to move out but I'm dependent on him with the visa I came to the US with so I can't just leave. I have a year left before I leave for college but I don't think I handle it. I've suffered from depression before to the point where my mom had to drag me to see a bunch of psychiatrists and therapists. I don't do any self harm but I do have suicidal thoughts from time to time. I feel myself getting more and more depressed the longer I stay here and it feels different this time. I don't want my mom to know that it has started again because I don't want her to worry. I don't think my dad truly knows how the things he says and does affect me. I want to break down and call it quits but I know I have to stay strong and be there for my sisters and that's all that matters right now. 

I don't know what to do. I've been in the basement for the past couple of days just thinking. My dad won't talk to me and won't tell me why he won't sign the forms. I feel like the longer I'm here, the more bad things will get. I'm his first born and his only son. He doesn't't think programming will lead to a good future. I make a couple apps and the money I make from them, he ends up taking it. I would get out and go for a drive but he won't allow me to get a license or a car. I've been receiving college letters from Princeton, UChicago and MIT which is amazing but he doesn't want me to apply or go to those colleges. He wants me to go to the college he went to which is 45 mins away. I don't think I'll ever leave this place. 

I don't even know if any of this made sense. I just needed to get things off my chest. If anyone has some advice that they could offer, that would be amazing. "
1gfjqc,940,2013-06-15,Momma Ham and Tween Ham are offended by my thin body at the pool.,laura__laurent,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gfjqc/momma_ham_and_tween_ham_are_offended_by_my_thin/,"So, I've been lurking this subreddit for a while now, so I've decided to create this account to share some of my own encounters with fat logic, for I have experienced many in my career as a pharmacy intern (and soon to be licensed pharmacist). However, this first story I'm going to share with you is unrelated to my job. It just happened today. First time greentexin', jimmies, fasten your seatbelts. 

&gt;Be me, 5'4"" 99lbs, thin 23 year old female. It's my day off, and I have nothing to do, so I decide to head down to my apartment complex's pool, as it is a lovely, hot day and I'm hoping to soak up some summer sun. Put on my bikini and head out! 


&gt;Stake out a seat, slather on the SPF, put my headphones in, and proceed to zone out. Ahh, relaxation. 


&gt;Been relaxing for approx. half an hour when suddenly, the water in the pool begins to slosh back and forth.


&gt;Sky goes black; has the sun disappeared behind a lunar eclipse? 


&gt;No, it's just a hamplanet, approaching me with her mini-ham daughter in tow. 


&gt;Momma Ham is a bit taller than me, maybe 5'6"" and I'd say about 350 lbs. Ham Tween looks to be about 13 or 14, and is about 5'0"" and at least 180, maybe 200. 


&gt;Although there are many lounge chairs available, the Hams decide to plop down on the two chairs right beside me. We make awkward eye contact. Being born and raised in the Midwest, I smile at them automatically, out of polite acknowledgement. Momma Ham side-eyes me and grunts. Notice tween Ham whisper something to Momma.


&gt;whatever.jpeg, go back to listening to Jake Bugg and close my eyes again.


&gt;Moments later, I am disturbed out of my cat nap by an irritable voice, grubmling, ""Excuse me, Miss?"" 


&gt;Hmm. Can't be talking to me. I'm just gonna ignore that...


&gt;""Excuse me?!?"" 


&gt;Please, no...please don't let that be...


&gt;""Hello! Excuse muhh!"" 


&gt;Take my headphones out and sit up. It's Momma Ham, and she looks pissed. Her beady eyes are sunken so far deeply into her flabby face that I can barely make out her expression, but I can only assume she's glaring at me. 


&gt;""Uh, yes ma'am?"" I ask.


&gt;Momma Ham: ""I would appreciate if you would cover yourself up. The way you're dressed is not appropriate."" 


&gt;Quickly glance down, make sure no wardrobe malfunctions have occurred (at this point I'm assuming one of my tits is hanging out of my top or something). Nope, bikini top and bottom are safely where they should be! So be me, rather confused. 


&gt;Me:""Sorry, I...I'm not sure I know what you mean. This is the pool, and I'm wearing a bathing suit, just like everyone else here..."" 


Here I'll add, Momma Ham was wearing one of those frumpy swim dress things, like a one-piece swim suit with a little skirt on the bottom, but tween Ham was wearing a comparable bikini to mine. In fact, I would argue that hers was more ""revealing"" than mine, being that her boobs were spilling out of her top, and I have none to speak of.


&gt;Momma Ham: ""Ain't no one else here wearing a bikini like that! You skinny girls, think just cuz you got a body like that, you can just show off all your bits, it ain't right!"" 


&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, I really don't know what you're talking about...I'd say all my 'bits' are fully covered. Your daughter's suit is about the same as mine, out of all the ladies here in bikinis, why are you asking me to cover up and not them?"" 


&gt;Momma Ham sighs indignantly. ""You're hurting my daughter's feelings! Because she has to sit here and look at *you*, she's reminded of all the people in this world who tell her she's not good enough just because she's not some skinny little twig!""


&gt;Tween ham starts giggling. Clearly, she's very upset. /s ""Yeah, so just put a t-shirt on, will ya?"" *chugs a can of Sprite* 


&gt;I'm not too confrontational, but I just couldn't let this bitch be so rude to me, so I say, ""You know, it's not very nice to call me a skinny twig. What if I told you I actually had an illness that makes me this small?"" Which I do, chronic migraines, and the medication I take to prevent them doesn't help. 


&gt;Tween ham pipes up, ""Oh yeah, like anorexia?"" 


&gt;At this point, I'm expecting that I'm on the TV show ""What Would You Do?"" and that John Quinones and crew are gonna come out and tell them this was all an elaborate rouse. Sadly, I'm just part of a real life FPS. 


&gt;Me: ""Look, I'm here to get a tan and enjoy my afternoon. If you don't like to look at me, there are plenty of other chairs on the other side of the pool deck, why don't you go sit over there?"" 


Note that I didn't feel I should have to move, I was there first, dammit, and they were the ones causing a scene. At this point, several other people who were near us were glancing over to discern what was occurring.


&gt;Momma Ham gets up to bitch to the pool monitor. Pool monitor is not a lifeguard. He's just a guy who sits at the pool all day to make sure that everyone who comes in is actually an apartment resident, isn't bringing alcohol, and is over 18 (can't be under 18 without a parent). 


&gt;I hear her all the way across the pool deck, yelling about how scantily clad I am, how I'm arguing with her, and how I'm hurting her daughter's precious feelings (by existing?). I worry for second; Pool monitor is a big guy himself. But it appears her fat logic isn't working on him! They both walk over to where our chairs are located (Momma Ham huffing and puffing the whole way.)


&gt;Pool Monitor, to me: ""Dear, are these ladies bothering you?"" 


&gt;Me: ""Yes sir."" 


&gt;Pool Monitor: ""I thought so."" He directs his attention back to Momma Ham: ""Look, I heard your whole conversation with this lady, you started the whole thing. She's clearly within pool dress code, doing nothing wrong. She gave you the option to move, and you refused, so I'm going to ask you to leave for the day."" 


&gt;Momma Ham is furious. Starts blathering about ""You can't kick me outta here! I pay my rent just like her! She's the one causing a disturbance! You just took her side cuz she's skinny! Imma take this up with management, you'll be sorry!"" She continues to whine as she packs up her cooler of snacks. she and Tween ham both shake their turkey gobbler necks at me as they are forced out by cool Pool Monitor, my new BFF. 

**tl;dr I offend Momma Ham and her tween Ham daughter at the pool just by existing in a thin, bikini-clad body.**

For the record, [this](http://i.imgur.com/nUp14mT.jpg?1) is the exact bathing suit that I was wearing. While I am not quite the goddess that Candice is, our proportions are quite similar. "
1gju1q,1,2013-06-17,"Hey ladies, some advice for financially getting through my last year of college would be greatly appreciated! Wall of text, TL;DR at end",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gju1q/hey_ladies_some_advice_for_financially_getting/,"This subreddit is full of strong, independent women who have gotten through tough times in so many ways, so I thought this would be a good place to turn for this.

I'm going into my senior year as an out of state student at a Big 10 University.  It's pretty expensive, and due to financial reasons my family was no longer able to back me for loans, not even the Parent Plus type loans, for the past year, and will not be able to in the future.  I have no other family for which it is an option, as well.  My recently graduated boyfriend has offered to help me out, but I just received my financial aid package and it's looking too bleak for even that. 

My entire junior year was half time, which fortunately didn't put me behind schedule due to going into school with nearly a semester's worth of credit due to AP classes.  However, if I want to actually graduate on time, this next year will have to be full time (I'm going to try to coerce my adviser into letting me take it all in one semester, I'm used to working 50+ hours per week while taking classes, and one of my jobs is in a computer lab where I can complete homework, and most of my remaining credits are in things such as public speaking, or in psych or math/statistics (both of which I have a high GPA and passion for).  

Anyway, I don't want to be working full time or more as a full time student, especially while applying for graduate schools and looking for internships, and I can't afford to take time off because I would have to start repaying loans.  I also can't afford to transfer, because with the number of credits I'd need somewhere new, I'd have to do at least two years there, which would cost me quite a bit, as well as at least a year of my life.

Do any of you ladies know of any resources that could help me in any way?  For example, I have one credit card that I use for food and such, and I always pay it much before the due date.  Even though I'm only 20, is there a chance I'd be able to apply for a student loan with that company (Chase) without a co-signer since I've been with them since the end of last year?  Or do you know of any other not-too-sketchy loan companies that I might have a chance with?  Also, any other words of advice, or stories you want to share about putting yourself through school or any other tough time would be appreciated, because it's nice to see that people can get through things like this.  

Thanks, ladies!"
1gjlm7,0,2013-06-17,21 [F4M] Philadelphia - I'm a radical girl on a mission for the crystal eye!,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1gjlm7/21_f4m_philadelphia_im_a_radical_girl_on_a/,"Hey y'all! 

I'm kind of looking for something new and exciting. I can be pretty exciting all by myself, but I miss talking to someone who can stimulate me via conversation. My days normally consist of waking up early, going to class, and then working at my internship in Center City, so I'm lacking a social life lately. I want to get to know someone who is intelligent (preferably a college student around my age) and is also a gamer, seeing as I'm a PC gamer myself (well, SORT of... I play LoL on my mac, gotta love the new beta client). I'm more of an XBOX gamer, though. 

About me:
I'm 5'9"" with read hair and blue eyes. I'm also really, really pale. I'm pretty sure my skin is so white that it reflects the sun. Other than that, I'm slightly chubby (180 lbs), but lately, I've been making an effort to drop some weight (dat freshman 15 has kind of stuck around for a few years now). I'm also a pre-med biology major. Science is fun.

Things I'm into:
I have gotten really into running lately. I love working out and I love playing contact sports (field hockey.. its a contact sport, I swear!). I also love playing my XBOX (halo, skyrim, bioshock infinite....). I really love, love, LOVE to read. I read all of the Game of Thrones books and I read a lot of philosophy books in my spare time, which is weird, since I'm a biology major (I also have minors in chemistry and psychology! I couldn't decide on a major :/ ). Sartre is really amazing (No Exit) and I'm a huge fan of Camus (The Stranger is my all-time favorite book EVER!) I like exploring and I really like to try crazy foods. Also, I think I have a thing for (parentheses). I'm a smoker (non-menthol), but I'm really trying to quit. I also like to drink, but not excessively. I'm 420 friendly, but sometimes it makes me a lil' paranoid. I like being sarcastic and making offensive jokes (in private, to my friends, although I know that doesn't make them any less offensive). I like people who can dish it out, but take it right back. I guess I'm kind of an aggressive person. Also, hiking and taking long walks through the city 
can be fantastic ways to kill time.

Things I DON'T like:
I don't like people who are rude or mean for absolutely no reason. I don't like people who chew with their mouths open and talk with their mouths full. Serious pet peeve. I don't like people who joke at other peoples expense often (I know I said before that I make offensive jokes, but they're more like ""thats not what your mom said last night"" or ""wow, with your shirt open like that, you kinda look like Fabio"". Ok, those are awful jokes. Sorry. I swear my sense of humor is better than that. And now that I think about it, theres nothing wrong with looking like Fabio.) I don't like people who are inactive. I have nothing against them personally, but I can't stand people who either sit in front of their computer all day or do nothing but watch TV. Hygiene is also really important to me and theres really nothing worse than someone who doesn't brush their teeth regularly. 

Wow, ok, this is a lot longer than I'd anticipated. If you think we'd get along, message me and we can trade pics or whatever!

What should I do? :(,sad0,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1gj8ov/mother_seriously_ill_what_should_i_do/,"This morning my mother told me she has cancer. She is going to have an operation in about a month but that is all I know, because I've been too afraid to ask. I didn't really react when she told me but then I went into my room and cried.

I had my first day at an internship today and I had to try so hard to keep myself from crying at my desk. 

My mother has always been dear to me but we have never really talked a lot at all. Now every time I think about her illness, it makes me cry and I'm afraid to talk to her, because I don't want to make her sad. At the same time, I feel that I should talk to her to support her, but I don't know how or about what.

Some background information: My dad doesn't live with us. I'm 19, I have 2 younger siblings. I don't live at home, but I'm home for summer. I have a boyfriend who is coming over to see me tomorrow, so I have someone I can talk to. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I talk about? What should I do?"
1gizgm,2,2013-06-17,"Me[23F] with my SO [22M/F] 5 months, having trouble figuring out where it's going.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gizgm/me23f_with_my_so_22mf_5_months_having_trouble/,"So I've been with my SO for about 5 months now (friends for about a year before hand), long distance for the last month or so while we're both working internships for the summer. It was pretty serious from the start, as we both knew each other pretty well, and neither of us are the ""casual dating"" type.

I think I really love my boyfriend, he's the most amazing thing I could ever ask for or want, but I'm not sure where it's going. I know we're young, but I like things as simple as they can be (I know, a ridiculous expectation for any relationship, because nothing is ever simple), and this confusion about how I feel is driving me insane.

We said ""I love you"" to each other pretty early on, but the feeling was mutual, and we talked about it before hand. In fact, I said it first, I was drunk one night, and it just kind of slipped out. We talked about it, slowed it down a bit, and I didn't say anything again until he was comfortable saying it as well.

Now, I thought it was true when I said it, and up until a little bit ago, I thought it still was true. But now I'm having doubts as to if I meant it or not. I usually trust my drunk self, she's able to see things clearly without over thinking them, and rarely lies, especially when it comes to my true feelings about someone/something. But I'm just not sure anymore, or what I want from the future. I can see him in it, and I can see him out of the picture, which I'm both ok with and not ok with at the same time.

The main problem is, I had a friend a few years ago that I was very close with for nearly 2 years, until we had a falling out, then we didn't talk for about a year, I sent him a few emails, he responded, until he said something and I basically said ""fine, if that's how you feel, I'll respect your wishes, and we won't talk anymore"". This happened about a year and a half ago, and we haven't been in contact since. We never had any romantic involvement, but I sporadically wished that there was during our friendship. My biggest issue now is I still can't stop thinking of him, and it still bothers me that we don't talk anymore, and I still miss him. And then I'm wondering if I was in love with him, and still am, but just never realised it myself since I'm incredibly terrible at recognising my own feelings. I think I'm missing a sense of closure with this other guy, and it's interfering with my current relationship. I don't get strong feelings for very many people, and even less for potential/current SOs. After a while, with all my past relationships, I felt that I was too apathetic towards my SO and it would end. But I really, really don't want to mess up with my current boyfriend. He's amazing and supportive, and everything I could want in an SO, but I'm hung up on my past and I'm making myself doubt everything.


**tl;dr**: In a great relationship, but I think I'm ruining it because I'm caught up on an old friend that I haven't talked to in years. Help!!"
1giqbr,15,2013-06-17,I got passed over for a promotion today.,flatlineskillz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1giqbr/i_got_passed_over_for_a_promotion_today/,"I have been working in state government doing IT since I was an intern in 2003. I have an excellent resume and skills to back it up. I am constantly commended by upper level managers and business units I support for doing an excellent job.

The guy they promoted over me has been working on the project for over a year and made no progress. They are effectively going to pay him more to do the same shit job he has always done. No one I spoke to wanted him to get the job. The position was misleading as it was geared toward networking and telecommunications but in reality they only did that because this guy got a better score on that civil service exam. For example the job posting asked for experience with wireless networking, VPNs, and working knowledge of DNS. I built the wireless network, supported the VPN for 5 years, and have 10 years experience in IT support and telecommunications.

I have been actively looking for advancement opportunities for over 2 years. I have a folder on my work pc with all my resumes and cover letters I have prepared for ever position I have applied to. I have applied to over 30 job postings and this job was my first interview. I've been strung along by my managers for a year and a half that there would be a promotion opportunity for me but every time I get frustrated enough to ask they say that it’s been pushed off into the next quarter. I can't take this shit anymore. I want to move forward. I want to marry my girlfriend. I want to move on to the next level of my career, serve the public, and use the skills I have acquired over the past 10 years to make my workplace better. Sure I could move to private industry but the stigma of being a public employee in New York they automatically assume you are worthless and lazy.

I try not to internalize the rejection and reassure myself that I am qualified and worthwhile but it’s been so long since I started trying to advance I can't help but wonder what is wrong with me. Why can't managers see what everyone around me sees? I don't know what to do anymore. I look at my collection of rejected resumes and cover letters and wonder what I am doing wrong. I have been to a career counselor and had my resume professionally critiqued but none of it helps.

TL:DR Got passed over for a promotion for a job I interviewed for last week. They gave the job to an asshole who has not accomplished anything. I've been trying to advance for years and exhausted every avenue of change. I can't take it anymore."
1gif40,2,2013-06-17,I've reached a dead end,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gif40/ive_reached_a_dead_end/,"I'm suffering from severe depression, panic disorder, agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder. It's been almost two years now since it started to get worse and out of control as it is right now. I'm afraid to leave my apartment or meet other people. As a consequence I've cancelled all my seminars at university and I'm withdrawing from my friends and family even more. Most of the time I'm all alone and don't do anything at all.  
  
As a result I'll probably drop out of grad school very soon. Therefore I've been looking for job opportunities with my current degree, but there's really no chance for someone with my subject and degree. I've never had the courage for a part time job or an internship so I actually have no qualification or experience at all. Moreover I'm completely lacking in motivation and confidence. Plus I've lost all interest in any activities. There's nothing in life anymore that I really care about.  
  
You'll probably advise me to go see a therapist, start doing sports etc. But I've tried all of that. I went to a therapist, even tried meds and frequent exercise, but instead of improving it only got worse after a while. I don't know what to do anymore and every day I'm getting closer and closer to finishing myself off. Right now I'm only waiting for the day, when my suffering becomes so great that it overcomes my will to live."

I apologize if my grammar isn't the best right now- I admit drinking doesn't necessarily solve, or rather it rarely does solve problems, but it helps migitate my brains negative focus at the moment.

I know this isn't, nor are my problems usually, the most dire of circumstances, but for me they worry me and are important to me- I'm sure a fair amount of people still struggle with my kind of problem, and I'd want to just hear some extra encouragement, any- that the caring people on this sub might have for me

To be blunt. I suck at making new female friends. I realize that yes, I do have people in my life that care about me, and want to spend time with me- my already existing friends, my fraternity brothers, my family- I just feel like something's missing in my life though. Yes, I do have female friends already, but I don't like bothering them, you know. They invite me to have lunch and stuff on occasion, and make time for me. And that's great, but again I find it so, so hard for me to just reach out to a new girl, or a fresh face I barely met a day or so ago, and call them up.
Even just to be friends, it's just. It doesn't happen. Believe me I try, I'm not so shy that I won't be able to initiate conversations at all, but calling on the phones weird if I don't know them yet, so I try texting or Facebook messaging. I know, I know it isn't ideal. And it actually does sting even more when I see someone's read my message and just chose not to reply, when the conversation wasn't necessarily dead or whatnot. I've made a ton of friends via tumblr but, pretty much all of the girls eventually just forgot about or chose to ignore me/make me the second option of a friend.

I don't ask for much. It'd just be nice, that I'd make a new connection- entirely new, and I didn't have to meet her through anyone else, and they legitimately wanted to be friends. Text occasionally- hang out once in a blue moon, or Skype if they don't live close.

Most people that view me now, wouldn't think I have this problem actually. The current version of me is worlds better off than the me a year ago when I couldn't even talk to them. He'll, some of my friends think I know a shit ton of girls and stuff, and in a way eventually I supplemented this, but not necessarily lied- here let me explain. I eventually became the sweetheart of the sorority council on campus at my university, because I go to their meetings and support them whenever I can. Then I got my sweater with that title on it- thing is, while publicly I may seem to get along with them all very well, I doubt even less than half of them would wanna hang out with me. It's the same pattern, I get ignored when I try to message them. It's nothing creepy I assure you, just hey, or I don't wanna study- or one girl I saw was starting a new job or something so I asked ""internship?"" Ignored.

I can tell you various, numerous instances when I've tried putting myself out there, to fall flat on my face, figuratively speaking.

A recent story: I went to my very first anime convention, and I took a picture with one girl dressed up as one of my favorite characters- I knew she had to take group photos with the whole gathering there so I let her go and didn't try Pursuing her again. I accidentally run into her profile on ok Cupid and message her on Facebook, and surprisingly she replies, and often! I was really happy because I might've found a new female friend that's into anime like I am and she doesn't live like a state away or something- I tell her to add me on Instagram and she did, and I asked to hang out sometime, which she says is fine- she asks me to hang last Friday when I posted a picture of food somewhere and, turns out, that didn't happen. I was gonna wait a day or so more to confirm that we could still hang, but I noticed she had a semi sad status on, and I wanted to check on her. She said yes, just someone broke her heart and led her on for a while up to now- understandable, that's awful. I asked her for her number but it wasn't shown to be read, next night more than a day later I asked if we still were going to, and I didn't get a thing until Friday morning when she said she was with her parents visiting her nephew and that she's sorry. And part of me agrees with a friend of mine ""at least she sort of cards for your feelings by replying-"" yeah.. But I don't get it why? She knew. She was the one that told me. And yes I get I'm being so immature here, she was visiting her family. But it wouldn't have hurt to tell me, I mean I'd have understood. I'm not insensitive. Got all excited for nothing. I wasn't looking to take advantage of a recently hurt girl, and I wasn't even sure I wanted to date her. He'll, I only had two legit days of fb texting under my belt to get a feel for what she's like. 

I used to, or think something's wrong with me. Physically, I'd think so all the time. But I was still losing weight and now I know I'm not horribly ugly, I'm decent to look at I admit and some girls compliment me, which helps. So if its not physical, is it something I'm saying? I know small talk, and trying to reach out when I'm already in the mindset that this person might be receptive. ""You're their sweetheart, so it must mean the girls enjoy your company!"" If only that we're true.

Note, I don't have to date or get into the pants of every girl I talk to, I just legitimately want a balance of things in life- and hanging out with girls is one part of that want. So I'm not always hanging with the guys.

Why is it so hard for me to find nice girls? Or I do and they all just leave me or stuff. And I don't get it, not all the girls I tried to connect with seem mean, just mean to me or mean by ignoring. Is it that hard to give a person a chance?

And this just relates to my probable #1 fear of being alone in the end and I won't find a girl that'll love me. I'm not entirely rushing for it, even though it'd be nice as I haven't had a girlfriend before, but still. 

I'm also still in the mindset, that tells me that if I don't try, nothing will happen. But if I try ive nearly always failed. 

I've hit the same wall I was at a year ago- I've grown significantly, and have some female friends, whom I love and treasure, but why is it so hard for me to make more? I agree that quality is better than quantity, just.. Why are people so mean? :(

I'd appreciate some bro fist bumps or Internet hugs, or anything to MMFB.. "
1ghktr,14,2013-06-16,Story Time,hookahteam,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1ghktr/story_time/,"I was chilling with friends by a local reservoir smoking hookah. A man with a fishing pole comes by and comments ""you enjoying that?"" and then proceeds to begin fishing. After catching a few panfish he leaves. About 10 minutes later we also leave, 2 of my friends going to their car in the parking lot, and me and another friend going to my truck in a neighborhood we park at since I have permission of someone there to park in front of his house. As we are leaving the neighborhood a truck is driving down the middle of the road and parks right in the middle of the road, turning his truck so noone can get by. After repeatedly honking at him to move I have to drive in the grass in order to continue down the road, thinking that he is drunk. Leaving the neighborhood I drop my friend off to get his car and then we drive to his house. We have to go by the same neighborhood we parked in and as doing so 2 cop cars are pulling into that neighborhood. As soon as they see my truck they do a u-turn and begin following me. There were also 3 cop cars going into the other neighborhood where my friends were parked. They follow me for about 3 miles and when I put on my blinker to go to my friend's neighborhood they flash their lights to pull me over. By this point I knew they were tailing me but wasn't worried as I had cleaned my truck out very well the week before (living in Arrestafield I am used to being pulled over for bullshit). The cop, a middle-aged man who looks like he has a rod stuck up his ass, asks for license and then begins asking me other questions to which I respond ""I don't answer questions"". Immediately he has a sour look on his face and tells me to get out of the truck. I do so, locking the door behind me. I ask what for and he says he believes I am under the influence and he wants me to do a sobriety test. I start laughing, and ask him why he pulled me over. He said I ""failed to maintain my lane"". I ask why he was u-turned and followed me for 3 miles and he said he received a report that kids were smoking weed at the dock. I tell him that there was a reckless driver in the neighborhood who tried to block us in and that he needs to get policemen to pull him over and he responds that he doesn't tell me how to do my job, I shouldn't tell him how to do his. I respond ""if I was doing as shitty of a job as you at my job (I am an intern at a pediatric office and a waiter) I wouldn't have a job"". He responds by calling in the drug dog and making me do a whole sobriety test... the whole damn thing. I followed a pen with my eyes, walked a straight line toe to toe, counted from 11-33 and back to 22, counted and touched my fingers, and said the alphabet from D to M. At this point another cop car came, now there were 4 cops and 3 cop cars with just me (they didn't pull my friend over). I asked him whether I had a warrant out for my arrest and why there were so many cops for smoking tobacco.... he ignored me. After waiting 20 mins for the drug dog to come I told him he could search my truck. As he does he almost drops my laptop, throws my CD's all around the truck, and after I show him what a hookah is he talks shit about how bad it is for you, why would you do that, etc. etc. I tell him to stop talking shit or I'll talk shit back to him. Finally after finishing tearing my truck apart he says I am free to go. This is just one of many experiences dealing with asshole cops in my area who at the slightest chance of there being weed or underage alcohol go anal. While not directly about weed this story shows how far some places have to go to get rid of the stigma weed has had for so long. This is in VA btw.
All in all 6 cop cars were called in because a man said kids were smoking weed when all we were doing was smoking tobacco. I was pulled over for a bullshit reason (the cop couldn't remember at what spot I had failed to maintain lane) and put through a sobriety test, threat of drug dogs, and car search all for smoking hookah.

1ghhsi,0,2013-06-16,[24/f] Still in love with an ex (24/m) after 6 years... (shortened version of original),necromanticize,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ghhsi/24f_still_in_love_with_an_ex_24m_after_6_years/,"I wrote a MASSIVE wall of text the other day on this, and I didn't realize it would be so long until it posted. If you're interested in reading it, here it is: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gfcko/24f_still_in_love_with_an_ex_24m_after_6_years/

It's very hard for me to condense 6 years into a very short post, so I'll do what I can and leave out as many unnecessary details as possible. 
Less of a story and more of...an explanation, perhaps.

I met this boy my sophomore year of college, and we were very into each other. I wanted things to go further sexually with him, but he wanted a relationship first which I was not ready for at the time. Eventually I was, and we dated for only a month and a half.

The reason for such a short relationship was my mental issues. I took things too personally when I should have let them roll off my back, we were both 19 and immature, and I made a rash decision and broke up with him. I tried to remedy the situation but he was too hurt and said he might like to try again, but it would be awhile before he'd be ready.

I pined, lovesick for about a year, before trying to move on. He was gone a lot (very intelligent engineer, had an internship in Japan and a few more in other states) and when he finally returned and wanted to reconnect I was in a relationship.

The guy I was seeing at the time I was also living with, and we had been together for almost two years. But I was ready for it to be over. It was not a healthy relationship. My friend from Japan came to visit one weekend and I decided to take her out for a bit of bar hopping. The first guy, not my boyfriend, ended up joining us towards the end of the night. At bar time he invited us back to his apartment for a bit of an afterparty.

Basically he ended up with me alone in his room, confessing everything to me, about how he still had feelings for me, and apologizing for what he put me through, but he knew that he couldn't do anything because I was in a relationship. I admitted that the relationship was soon to be ending, and he asked if it would be out of line to kiss me. I said yes, because even though my relationship was as good as over, I didn't want to compromise my morals and cheat.

Not but half a week later I broke up with my boyfriend. He blamed this other guy after I confessed what happened that weekend. Truthfully though I was planning on breaking up with him without having any idea the other guy still had feelings for me.

We hooked up a lot over the summer, but when he ended up having to go back home for work, things abruptly ended and not on a very good note.

When he returned the next school year, he apologized for everything again. We met up a few times, once where I ended up sleeping on a mattress he pulled out for me on his floor next to his bed, thinking he was going to sleep in his own bed, but he crawled in with me. I don't remember much of that night but I'm 98% sure we at least kissed.

I saw him at my birthday party, and we ended up at his apartment again, and two of my girlfriends were sitting next to me. One got up to use the bathroom, and he quickly took the opportunity to sit next to me and put his arm around me.

A couple months ago I went to visit him again, and we just sat around watching old shows on Netflix. Once again he pulled the mattress out for me to sleep on, but he left it in the living room and went to bed.

Now we've been texting within the last week or so about trying to get together, and he was kind of giving me crap for ""leaving him all alone"" in his apartment. We kind of mess with each other like that, so it didn't bother me. Then he told me he got a job back in the city we went to school in... which is much closer than his hometown.

I feel like we've both matured a lot (I mean, we were only 18 when we met) and that things would work out if we tried again.

But I feel like I've been getting mixed signals, and I'm not sure just how interested in me he still is? Because I am definitely still head over heels for him, and I probably always will be.

Another issue is that my parents and friends don't like him. He overcompensated when he first met my parents 5 years ago, and seemed a bit arrogant to make up for his insecurities. Not to mention they and my friends have really only seen me upset over him for years, and so obviously they blame him. They don't think getting involved with him again would be a good idea, but they don't see him like I do.


TL;DR: Boy I've been in love with for 6 years likely still has feelings for me, but things were shaky in the past. He's a good guy but my friends and family think he isn't because of how much he hurt me, but the only reason I was so hurt was because I felt so strongly about him. I don't know if we've matured enough to try a relationship again, and how I can get people to see him the way I see him. I'm also unsure if the recent attempts to get me to see him and him letting me know he will be closer soon is a hint that he still has strong interest in me."

I've gathered that having volunteer experience such as this can help qualify me for PC and that the application process takes about a year, but does it make more sense to apply after I've begun my internship or go ahead and submit one now?

1gm93z,1,2013-06-18,Legitimate Kinect Kuestion,FerRealz,xboxone,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1gm93z/legitimate_kinect_kuestion/,"Believe it or not, I'm actually very interested in Kinect 2.0. For anyone who has played the original kinect in a ""party"" scenario, it is actually quite fun. Limited, but quite fun.

I'm thinking about adding Kinect Sports: Rivals to my list of preorder launch titles. I actually want to test out the new kinect for myself and what better way to do it then an actually fun kinect game? However, I have a few concerns. 

Here's my scenario: I'm in college, and I live in a house with two other guys. I keep my video games in my own bedroom because I'm hands down the most hardcore gamer in the house so when I wanna play, I wanna play haha. One of my other housemates has a xbox he keeps in the living room and thats what i have my kinect hooked up to because its useless in my room. 

I'm the only one in the house getting an xbone on day 1 because I have a paid internship and whatnot so I have a good amount of cash for a college student. I plan on keeping it in my room because I dont want it ruined and all that hardcore gamer stuff. 

Here's my real question: Anyone who owns the orginal kinect knows that it has to scan your room and memorize whatever it does for it to work properly. Will this still be necessary? Im going to have it sync with my bedroom because I'll need to, but what if I want to bring my xbox downstairs to play some kinect sports rivals? Will it be a pain in the ass to rescan? Also, my room is small, so sometimes i turn my tv so i can play from a different angle because its more comfortable. What if I need to turn my kinect for a game i want to make use of some small kinect functions? And me and my bros usually all bring our xboxes to one house, all bring tvs as well, and play halo/gears online all night. Been doing that for years. But with xbone and kinect, will it be a pain to rescan everytime we want to bring our hardware over?

The new kinect sounds advanced enough to be able to handle this, I just want to know if any questions like this has been addressed yet?"

I built my gaming computer mid-late December of 2012. I know got an internship for the summer - therefore I am getting a small amount of fun money to play with. So I am considering putting a few upgrades into my computer. Below are a list of some of the parts I am looking for:

-x2 Acer S201HL: I already have one... if I can get two more that would be great. If you one - then post up anyways. I am okay with buying one at a time as well. 

-Logitech G600: I do not need a gaming mouse... I have a Razer NAGA at the moment. And I love it, but I am have heard great things about the G600. So I thought I would give it a shot. If you have one and are willing to sell it, please let me know. 

-7970: I know this is a broad request. But at the moment I have a XFX 7850 DD. It does everything I want it too, and I love the damn thing to death. Just thinking if I finally roll around to getting a triple display set up I will want the power. PM me or post up what you have! 

-G.SKILL Ripjaws 2x4GB DDR3: Now this I am going to be picky about. I already have one set of this, and would like another. Here is the Newegg link (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231428). I know there is a slim chance someone will be wanting to get rid of a set - but its a shot. 

-1 TB HD: I already have one (Seagate I believe) and almost have mine filled up... so I kinda need another one. (Damn Steam games and porn...) 

-Gaming Headset: I just want a good high quality gaming headset. Preferably a wireless one, but just let me know what you have. 

There is my list... if you have it, let me know! I would be greatly appreciative. I do not need all of this - but I figured reddit would be a great place to start. Thanks in advance!  "
1glxl2,3,2013-06-18,1 year left of college. Time to start planning for life on my own after graduation.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1glxl2/1_year_left_of_college_time_to_start_planning_for/,"Hey /r/PF,

As I said, I'm starting to lay the blueprints so that I can graduate and be fiscally responsible and happy.

A little about myself:

* I attend a private, liberal arts school majoring in Computer Science.
* All totaled, I have ~&lt;10k in students loans through my university and FAFSA. Very low interest rate, which is nice.
* I do not have a credit history, but I have been banking through Chase under their college checking account. I have 1 debit card. I have roughly $600 in the bank.
* I am working at a paid internship this summer. On top of what I have, take away what the necessities (fuel, rent, food) and small personal expenses (damn you, Steam summer sale!) and I'll have ~3k in the bank come September.
* My parents have good credit. One works for the university I went to, the other is self employed. Before taxes, they brought in ~300k last year. I'm damn proud of them.
* I have a car that is paid for.

So, questions:

&gt; I need to build credit. I estimate that I spend &lt; $1k per month, which is greatly diminished during school months. So far I have found that the Chase Freedom card is compelling, but I'm afraid of credit utilization when factored into my FICO score, i.e., if I pay $650 for rent this month, on top of ~$200 for personal expenses, and I have a 1k credit limit, won't that adversely affect my credit score? I am rather good about tracking my expenses (I use Mint) and I will always pay the statement balance / current balance.

                                                                                                                                              .

&gt; When I graduate, I will no longer have my Chase college checking account. What should I do? I'd like to set up my checking account as the money vault (i.e., where I have my paychecks sent to), the savings account as the emergency fund, and use the credit card for expenses (for the rewards). Who should I bank with? What differences should I pay attention to? What SHOULDNT I do?

                                                                                                                                              .

&gt; Any other financial advice you would give to yourself were you graduating at this time (don't spend money on girls, budget for entertainment, what type place to live in, how to minimize costs on groceries and otherwise, etc)?

THANK YOU!"
1glsy5,805,2013-06-18,I would like to share my abortion experience....,Halcyoningenue,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1glsy5/i_would_like_to_share_my_abortion_experience/,"When finding out my partner of 8 months and I were pregnant, we knew the only option was to abort it. We are both sophomores in college, and definitely not financially or emotionally ready to start a family. 


Since I found out my pregnancy early on, I decided to miscarry it naturally since my friends in the past have successfully done so. After two weeks of trying, and not even a cramp occurring, I gave up on a natural abortion and started making plans with planned parenthood.


Planned parenthood was courteous and after a few appointments for a pregnancy test, and learning about contraceptives to start after the procedure, my appointment was scheduled and I was ready to go.


Yesterday, my friend and I drove to planned parenthood and then proceeded to wait about two hours after signing in, which is really my only complaint about the day. They had me take a vaginal ultrasound, and gave me the option of looking at the image, keeping a picture of it, telling me if I had twins or not, or if I didn't want to know anything at all. I chose to not know, to keep as much emotional detachment to this process as possible. They then showed me to another room where a lady gave me a cup of multiple pills where she explained exactly what they were and what they did. She said they were basically to get me drowsy and to help with anxiety before the procedure. She than placed me in the waiting room till the pills kicked in and I was ready to start the procedure. 


I met my doctor who would be performing the abortion, and he was kind and asked me how I was feeling, and if at any time I was too uncomfortable to let him know. He left for me to undress, while the nurse at hand and an intern who asked to be present stood by in case I toppled over from the medication. I sat on the table and draped the paper over my lap, put my feet in the stirrups, and the doctor returned. During the abortion he explained everything he did before he was about to do it to put me at ease. He would tell me when he was about to do something that made cramping, and the nurse would automatically rub my lower belly, and the intern would be standing by asking if I needed the hot water bottle. But the cramping I experienced from the abortion was much less than the cramping I had experienced from just a regular period. The really only pain I would say I experienced was just the slight pressure of inserting the speculum to open the vaginal canal, and also the pressure of opening the cervix. The actual suction of the abortion was basically painless. 
Within 7 min. the abortion was done, and the doctor went in another room to examine the tissue to see if the abortion was complete. He returned, said it was a success, and asked how I felt and If I had any more questions. I replied I felt fine, and he wished me luck and left. The nurse helped me get dressed, even though I had no nausea or pain, then escorted me to the recovery room where a nice older lady gave me another heating pad and drinks and snacks. She asked me after awhile to check my pad and tell her the amount of blood was there, for safety just in case I didn't clot properly. Only a small amount existed, and I was able to sit in the waiting room for as long as I wanted. I left soon after, and I am relieved to say I've never felt better.


I know this story is very undramatic and simple, but I wanted girls to know that abortion is not a scary horrible thing that people make it out to be. It happens every day to normal women, and after there doesn't have to be guilt or depression, sometimes there is relief and a feeling of wholeness again. I had an extremely pleasant experience with my abortion, and still plan on it being my last. Before the procedure I asked to have the Nexplanon inserted, so now I know I'll be pregnancy free for the next three years! 
I welcome any and all questions, and remember to be smart and safe so this isn't a story you will have to tell one day.

Peace!

**tltr: had an surgical abortion that was very pleasant, wanted to share story for education purposes**



**EDIT:** By posting this I was aiming for just a basic medical account of what exactly happened and a whole can of worms exploded! I mean it in the best way possible, because lets face it: Female problems aren't frilly, perfect, sparkly badges that we wear on our dresses. They are scars of experiences that were earned through blood, sweat, and emotional turmoil. And I think it is our job and duty as women to keep it honest between each other and the rest of society, on exactly what we go through and to be as supportive as possible. Because women know what is best for women, and this post just fills me with joy seeing all these brave women share their stories with details that would make the manliest man squirm in his pants! What I mean is, this post affirms in me the fact that we need to, as women, take what we have said here into the real world and share the raw facts with others in our daily lives. I would love to see these conversations being had openly some day with girls faced with this decision from their friends, or mothers, or grandmothers, and without judgment. Because I know I didn't have that growing up. I just wanted to thank you all for making this post more than just a discussion, and more of a support group for women now, and in the future. Thank you and Peace!

1glotd,0,2013-06-18,The story behind RAM,TheBigC98,DaftPunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaftPunk/comments/1glotd/the_story_behind_ram/,"( Warning!!!  Wall of text!!)

It all started in Area 51. The United States had begun a series of experiments to try to create the ""ultimate robot."" The recent influx of science fiction during the 1900's had inspired some big heads at Headquarters, while the recent world wars gave the rest of the staff that final kick, and they authorized the beginning of a compact, neuron network. This was during 1942, and when they finally finished designing the necessary transistors and fully assembling the brain and the exterior chassis, it was February of 1947. They began to train it through a series of combat and sociological lessons, every day. These lessons mainly consisted of calibrations, since most of the knowledge could be programmed directly into the ""super-soldier"". This continued until the fateful day of Valentines Day, 1947. Most of the staff went out to celebrate, and they only left the intern to keep an eye on the robot. The robot managed to escape and ran to Vegas, where it managed to backpack it's way across its country. It showed a profound interest in human behavior irregularities and in society in general. It spent most of its time in nightclubs and bars, first trying to avoid most human contact, then attempting to mingle with some humans, mostly resulting in screaming and mass hysteria where it would then relocate itself. It was then where it began to become self aware and fully functional, as well as beginning to fully access its flash RAM, which is what we were able to salvage from the explosion. It did this for a few months, until it had found its way to Texas, where it was almost shot and hunted down until it managed to lose his pursuers under an overpass, where it managed to hide from thermal and infrared surveillance hunts. It would go into Internet cafes and coffee shops to recharge its batteries on occasion. It was after its brutal rejection and manhunt when it began to experience a longing for a return to its ""birthplace"" and its creator. It returned to Area 51, where something was sighted by the perimeter guards. The perimeter guards were rendered unconscious and the inner gates registered a disturbance. The base was on a code orange when it discovered to  already penetrated our defenses before we could get our troops on ready! This technology has major implications for penetration and assassination if only we could continue our work... Anyway, it was found to be talking Dr. Maurice Ewing while he managed to put it in an infinite logic loop before it could do anything else. Since he was now effectively immobilized, he had to be terminated to insure future security breaches would not happen again. However, since the RAM is not used consistently, it had the luck to not be accessed while we terminated it. We had to see what was currently written to the RAM, so we inputted it into two of our lower level robots that could not become consciousness. However, we had to be sure that this RAM would not affect the robot's programming, which it did anyway. We locked them into immobilizing containers, with the base on code maroon, and asked them what was on the RAM. They almost fried themselves, until Dr. Maurice smartly told them them to stop before they destroyed themselves. We then had an emergency meeting with the President and the cabinet before deciding that the only form to get the information off those RAMs were to represent them with music. Music is the universal language, right? It then produced the album now known as Random Access Memories. The reason this album leaked is due to the sheer ingenuousness of the information inside the RAM. Those sticks of RAM is possibly the answer to self awareness, and I don't really trust those robots with objects of such volatility. It's information caused the robots to act perfectly normal and operate as expected until they were able to escape to Europe through a Lay's shipment where they published the album as their own creation and now is making buckets of money off of iTunes. We are currently unable to do anything to them as the general public holds them in high acclaim, and we cannot do anything without alerting the UN or MI6, and the general public. To top it all off, now Obama has banned all future production of AI systems and now Google wants to build a neural network.

1gllte,2,2013-06-18,Struggling since the start of summer vacation.,1440p,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gllte/struggling_since_the_start_of_summer_vacation/,"I am a 17 year old male. I go to an all-boys private high school, so I rarely make contact with girls my own age and see attractive women only occasionally outside of school (I suppose you could call it super hard mode?). Final exams ended on June 4th, so I have been on summer vacation for about two weeks now. During school, I didn’t have great urges to fap because I was so busy with schoolwork, job-hunting, and lifting, which combined took up all my time and energy. I didn't even think about girls often. But recently, I’ve been having trouble controlling my sexual urges, which I suspect is due to staying at home. The following paragraph details the ones I have been dealing with so far.


I have a footwear fetish which has not gone away after abstaining from porn for a long time. Specifically, I am really attracted to boots, and sneakers especially when worn with knee high socks, on the opposite gender. I have also tried self anal stimulation several times in my life (including once while on NoFap), because I wanted to know what it feels like (it felt good). Lately when I wake up in my bed in the morning, I have been fantasizing about [getting fucked in the ass](/nsfw), although I am heterosexual. I think I have this fantasy because my body is craving sexual release and that is one way of achieving it. And because I go to an all boys school, perhaps my subconscious has realized over the past six months that sex with the opposite gender is not going to happen anytime soon, and that the only sexual gratification I can get is self-gratification. It has probably also realized that fapping is not an option either, so the only self-gratification it can get is through prostate stimulation. Thus, I get this fantasy. Once I get out of my bed and start about my day, this fantasy mostly dissipates but throughout the day (again, I’m home alone) I still get the urge to stimulate myself anally. I also got a new pair of sneakers recently and when I wear them in my room to try out the feel I get a rock-hard erection. This always happens when I wear brand-new footwear indoors, so I’m pretty sure it’s a part of my foot fetish. I have done this a few times for at least twenty minutes since I got them and it probably messed up my dopamine levels temporarily, since I was so aroused from it. Right now I am battling a huge desire to do everything at the same time: [put on knee-high socks and the new sneakers, and stimulate myself anally](/nsfw). This would give me a MASSIVE dopamine rush.

Is this something I should do? I now realize that doing this is probably not healthy, but my brain is justifying it under the guise of “exploring my sexuality.” These urges have consumed a significant portion of my willpower these past couple weeks. Apart from this, objectively my summer is going very well. I start a paid part-time summer internship next Monday, and I’ll also be doing some unpaid work on my off days starting in July in astronomy, which is my favorite field in science. 


Last weekend was the first time I had an actual conversation with a girl about my age probably since LAST SUMMER. I have known her for years since we have the same piano teacher; she is in fact three grades above me and was back home this summer after finishing her sophomore year in college. Basically we caught up for about thirty minutes. On the outside I was pretty calm, but on the inside my system was in shock that I was actually talking to an attractive girl. Honestly I was kind of intimidated just from looking at her. Yesterday and today I have still been thinking frequently about her and the conversation we had. I just can’t help it.


I ask for your support. I need to somehow make sense of all of this. Should I continue resisting my sexual fantasy/fetishes until my internship starts and I won’t be at home all the time anymore? That seems like the best course of action for me, and hopefully my outlandish urges will dissipate. What should I make of the conversation I had with my friend? Where does that fit in? I felt a big rush from just talking to a girl for the first time in forever, and I certainly want to talk to other girls this summer. How should I go about this? I’ve actually watched several of RSDTyler’s videos, they are absolutely brilliant and make perfect sense to me but I’m not sure exactly how to apply his ideas to my situation.

1glhv1,1,2013-06-18,"31 years old, BiPolar II, first day of NoFap",npsol,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1glhv1/31_years_old_bipolar_ii_first_day_of_nofap/,"I just found the NoFap community on Reddit and I think I'm ready to start. I want to share my story and why NoFap resonated so strongly for me.

I'll start with what's most important: I have been depressed for as long as I can remember, hospitalized twice for suicidal behavior, and recently diagnosed with BiPolar II, a version of BiPolar that follows similar cycles, but is typified by more intense and extended depressive episodes and isolated, less intense and less frequent ""hypomanic"" (not full manic) episodes. For me, the story of my depression has been intertwined with the story of my relationship with masturbation.

I discovered masturbation by accident when I was about 12. I was doing pull-ups in my basement and found that I could push myself further then I normally could when I was aroused. I always held off on ejaculation because I didn't know what was going on and I thought I was going to pee all over the place because I'd never felt anything like it before.  When I finally did allow myself to ejaculate, it was like nothing I'd ever experienced before, and the combination of exercising to exhaustion and the dopamine rush of orgasm was so overwhelming that I became obsessed. From that point forward, much of my conscious life would be consumed with thoughts of masturbating at almost all times.

Discovering masturbation coincided with the formative years of middle school and the most difficult social time of my life. I had been fine in elementary school, but somehow for reasons I didn't understand I was the target of bullying. Popular people I hadn't even met before not only knew me but went out of their way to bully me and I had no idea why. The way my young, impressionable mind made sense of this at the time was informed by my Catholic upbringing. Between my superstitious understanding of a God that gave favors to those who behaved and punished those who didn't and my CCD teachers giving lessons on puberty that told us masturbation was a sin, I came to believe that masturbation was the direct cause of all of my problems. Every time someone was needlessly cruel to me, obviously God was just using the bully as a tool to punish me for masturbating the night before. 

Throughout my early teens, when my brain was still growing and developing, I was struggling with being the target of bullying by what seemed like the entire school out of nowhere, a raging libido that I could not control, and a God that was both promising eternal damnation and providing the link that made me believe that giving in to my sexual urges in private was somehow leading to public punishment at school. To top all of that off, it was the beginning of my life-long battle with depression and suicidal ideation. When I wasn't fantasizing about sex, I was fantasizing about killing myself and leaving the stresses of school, social isolation, and cosmic punishment. I was only 13 years old, and although the reasoning has changed, the patterns of thought remain with me.

In early high school I mustered all of the willpower I had at the height of my libido to attempt NoFap fasts of my own before I had a name for it. And things did improve. I was in a different environment that didn't have the hierarchical prison mentality of middle school, I was less burdened by the guilt I had put on myself, and I was trying my best to direct the overflowing sexual energy I had to more productive pursuits. I eventually got a girlfriend and we were in love as only 16 year olds could be. I thought I owed it all to the discipline of NoFap, which inevitably had led to discipline and focus on the moment in other areas of my life. And I was so in love that I thought any sexual energy directed anywhere other than my girlfriend would be a betrayal. During this time, I was also what psychologists would call ""Hypomanic"" which just means extremely productive, requiring little sleep, doing a million things at once, etc. It sounds like something everyone would want, but for people with BiPolar II (which I didn't know I had yet) the cycle always comes down ...

It was in college that my depression came back with a vengeance, and with a new computer and high speed internet for the first time (it was 2000) that depression coincided with a major increase in masturbation. As I got older, the religiosity that fueled my previous NoFap discipline had faded -- I would make attempts to make myself believe in the depths of my depression, but religion just wasn't the fit that it once was for me.

It was in college that masturbation became the primary expression of my depression. I would masturbate, and in the flood of dopamine, I would drift off to sleep ... at first it was a simple matter of preferring my fantasy and dream life -- where there were no consequences -- to the more complex, disappointing, and generally difficult life of college, and then it became a way to literally shut off, like a mini-suicide. I didn't want to live anymore, so sleep was the closest thing without dying, and the easiest way to sleep was masturbation.

I went through ups and downs, but generally was able to perform well in school, which helped me justify not getting help. I thought everyone got depressed, I thought everyone was suicidal, I thought everyone isolated themselves for weeks at a time fantasizing about not living, etc. And as long as I somehow managed to keep my grades up, that meant I was doing fine. Eventually I went into an extreme depressive jag in my last semester of my last year, right before I was about to graduate. Excessive sleep is a classic symptom of depression and I was masturbating and sleeping all day and my body had completely adjusted. Eventually I was sleeping 14 hours a day, but not by choice. It's just what my body was doing because I was suffering from depression and because of how I had trained it. And no matter how badly I wanted to get out of it, I couldn’t help but sleep all day, everyday.

This forced me to get help at Student Health, where a doctor sat with me for 5 minutes and prescribed me an excessive amount of anti-depressants, which are extremely harmful if you have bi-polar, but he thought I was a classic depressive. Anti-depressants made it extremely difficult to get erections, so eventually I quit them and continued floating on, crossing back and forth between barely functional and extremely depressed. 

After leaving college I managed to get a job doing something I felt was very important related to social justice helping those living in poverty. It was the only way I could get myself to do anything: I couldn't find meaning or motivation within myself, so the only things I could commit to had to have intrinsic, obvious meaning. Even then I struggled getting out of bed, and if I hadn't been forced by deadlines and travel I would be masturbating and sleeping all day. In fact, whenever I had a moment free, whether it was as little as 30 minutes or as long as 5 days, I would exclusively masturbate and sleep.

I worked for years like this, with constant, never ending stress, because the boundaries of how much time I had to masturbate were always flexible. I could come in late for work just this once. That deadline isn't as hard as they say. It's fine if this one thing goes by the wayside. What was worse is that these decisions had major consequences because I had put myself in a position where my job actually mattered to others besides myself. I was disappointing everyone around me, which drove me further into panic, depression, suicidality, and masturbation. These had ceased to be distinct phenomena of triggers, diseases, symptoms, and coping mechanisms, but a set of behaviors so intertwined that they came in one overwhelming lump, like being rolled over by a giant boulder.

But somehow I managed. I was never happy, but I managed. I continued just barely hanging on and ended up in law school. Law school was really stressful, but the structure of it limited the time I had to masturbate if I wanted to keep up ... but then as I had more freedom and less classes as school went on, the depression, masturbation, and suicidality came back stronger than it's ever been. I made a plan to kill myself, I bought a rope to hang myself, chose my tree, and a feeling of relief washed over me. For months all I had thought about was killing myself. For months, before drifting off to sleep I would masturbate, and in my dopamine haze I would imagine the release of hanging myself ... 

It was ultimately through a stroke of luck that my girlfriend called me for a spontaneous dinner the day I was planning to commit suicide. I had become expert at hiding my thoughts and emotions from all the people closest to me, and I had become distant from my girlfriend who had been with me years and had moved to be with me while I was in law school. My depression had so overtaken me that it was as if I didn't see her at all, and the immediacy of that dinner when I knew I should be hanging from a tree instead of sitting across from this person who loved me broke me down. I told her what I had been planning to do. We called the hospital together.

I ended up in the Psych Ward for a week, shuffling down the hallway in a hospital gown, unable to go outside or even crack one of the sealed windows and watching reality tv with drug addicts, elderly senile people, cutters, autistic young adults, and people prone to violent rages. Like them, I was mentally ill. The doctors diagnosed me with BiPolar II and put me on mood stabilizers and they helped a lot. But six months later I was back, after a failed suicide attempt, trying to hang myself in a hotel bathroom. This time I was in the Psych Ward for 2 weeks,  and they forced me to take a semester off of school, and go to intensive group therapy for 3 months. 

Believe it or not, this was the best thing that ever happened to me. Therapy helped me get a handle on some of the root causes of my depression and the level of my suicidality is nowhere near where it once was. I was able to come back to school, and even though it was hard, I finished my last year. I owe all of that to getting the mental health care I needed, the support of my girlfriend and family, my group therapy members, my therapists, and the medication.

But throughout my recovery, I never talked about the role of masturbation. So much of what prevented me from getting the help I needed for my mental illness was the overwhelming sense of shame. Shame that I would even consider suicide, consider hurting those that loved me, do this supremely selfish thing. But even as I was learning to overcome that shame, I was too ashamed to talk about masturbation. 

People, particularly professionals, seemed to not take the role of masturbation too seriously whenever I did muster the courage to mention it. They viewed it as a symptom, not a cause. They seemed reluctant to draw any connection to masturbation and depression. Generally, they assured me that as my depression cleared up, my relationship to masturbation would sort itself out.

But even though I've made an enormous amount of progress with my mental health, I am still a compulsive masturbator. Since I've returned from recovery, it's been difficult for me to maintain an erection with my girlfriend. The reasons for this may be complicated and could include the pressure I put on myself, the lingering memories of previous failures, or the fact that this physical connection used to be the one solid, uncomplicated, and joyful thing that we shared and the fear of its fading is too much to bear ...

But there’s another overwhelming simple reason: chronic masturbation. I masturbate a minimum of twice a day still. I look at cascading images of porn with a rotating cast of a dozen pornstars while maintaining a lubed up death grip on my penis. My mind is always elsewhere and I overstimulate myself so much and so often that it's no wonder it's difficult to maintain an erection.

And the other thing is that my recovery is fragile. I'm on medication and I see a therapist once a week, but during periods of extreme stress, I still find myself completely laid low by massive depressive episodes where I can't get out of bed and devolve back into the old habits of masturbating myself to sleep. At the moment I should be working on a paper that is long overdue that my graduation depends on and I am starting an internship that would be perfect for me, but am taking the day off because I can’t bear the thought of going into the office. The pressure of the transition, of finishing the last bit of school and starting the next phase, triggered another depressive episode and yesterday I masturbated eight times and slept all day. No matter what medicine I am on, or how much therapy I do, the escape of masturbation is always there for me and it's impossibly difficult to resist.

Throughout the years, I've privately understood my relationship with masturbation through the language of addiction. I'm a sex-positive person and I no longer think that masturbation is evil or against god or whatever. Alcoholics say that normal people can drink alcohol without drinking compulsively and suffering severe negative consequences, but an alcoholic can have one drink and set off a chain of addictive behaviors that ruin their lives. I feel the same way about masturbation. I think normal people can and probably should masturbate, but my relationship with masturbation is extremely destructive and I need to get it under control. The feelings of escape and the dopamine rush that I CRAVE from masturbation are like every depiction of heroin use I've ever seen ... like a heroin nod, I'm chasing the release of the ""masturbation-nod."" For me (emphasis: FOR ME) masturbation is bound up in depression, escape, suicidality, avoiding responsibilities, disconnecting from my relationship, and engaging in a variety of destructive behaviors.

I am powerless over my masturbation and I just want to see how long I can go and what changes I'll be able to see. I also hope to stop using porn altogether.

I know this has been long, but like those other addiction 12 step programs, I'm really happy there is a community here to help out, to share stories, and to generally provide support. I spent far, far too long trying to deal with my mental illness alone, I don’t want to make the same mistake with my addiction to masturbation. So thank you for providing this forum and thank you for letting me share my story."

When we first started dating we had both recently moved to a new town (Town A) and worked at the same place. However she was an intern for 3 months and was moving back to her hometown (Town B). She broke up with me on facebook chat after 2 months stating she didn't want to get too attached and then have to move away. However a week later she asked me to take her back saying it was stupid of her to breakup. I took her back. We did long distance for 8 months, then she moved back to Town A and we have been dating for almost a year since then. About 5 months ago, she told me that when we were broken up for a week, her boss had kissed her (the boss got fired later for unrelated reasons). She never told me that before, so my reaction was a mix of shock/anger. She stated that it was like sexual assault and she just froze. After going through much tears, we sort of stopped talking about it (I suggested we confront him, inform someone, she was adamant against confrontation). The whole incident, coupled with the fact that I am a little insecure about the fact that she has dated 4 people before (unlike me), has led me to have trust issues about her. I don't want to bring it up with her as I feel it's a very touchy issue. What do i do?

Edit - i wasn't sure whether it's worth bringing up again, after reading the replies, decided i shouldn't. After reading the replies, it also feels like I am being unreasonable. going to get her flowers now :)"
1gkhzu,0,2013-06-18,I (23f) cheated on my SO(27m) in a LDR and don't know what to do next...,throwawayaccountq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gkhzu/i_23f_cheated_on_my_so27m_in_a_ldr_and_dont_know/,"EDIT: I've told him. It was rough. He is thinking things through now. I can only hope that maybe he will be able to forgive my actions. 

 

There are a lot of threads here about cheating and LDRs. Most end with “you are a POS and you don't deserve them” etc. But also, the approach of knowing WHY you cheated seems to be a common theme. 
I've thought long and hard about this, and I know why it happened. I have very low self esteem and the guy I cheated with was the only person I've ever felt confident around. I love my SO more than anyone or anything else in this whole world, but I still feel inadequate around him and shy. I've tried to explain this many times to my SO, but he told me he “doesn't ever want to hear me talk about that silly nonsense again” And so the guy I cheated with was I guess an outlet for me. 

Back story: 
My SO and I have Skyped every night since we met in October, and text/message each other throughout the day, every day. I visited him in his country during my spring break to meet in person for the first time. It was magical. Everything was better than I had ever dreamed it would be. He is But he was so gorgeous. The most perfect man I've ever laid eyes on. And it was intimidating. And I fell even more in love with him than I could ever think I could be. He is perfect for me, in every single way, and I've never felt the way I feel about anyone else. And he says the same to me! 

I've made plans to move to his country, learn his language and take an internship there in August. We will then go to Australia, when my internship is over, for the european winter, and then come back to tour Europe for spring/summer. We have an entire year planned out to travel the world together...to be in love and to be happy with each other. And I'm so scared that if I tell him about my mistake, it will all come crashing down. 

The actual cheating took place during finals week. (Yes, back in May) It was a hectic time in the school year and I was crazy with work from finals and my senior thesis. Plus I was trying to balance hanging out with people as much as I could before I graduated. A guy who I had once had a little crush on a few years back started hanging out with mutual friends/roommates and was over at my apartment often. We started chatting via text, and it was nice to have made a new friend. But soon he became pretty interested in me. I wasn't interested in him, and told him frankly that I was in a relationship, but when he would leave every night, he would give me a hug. And it was so nice to have that human contact. If I closed my eyes, it felt like I could be hugging my SO.

I craved the human touch from missing my SO and being stressed. But it escalated from hugs and a little cuddling now and then to this: one night, after a bar run, we all came back to the apartment drunk. And it just sort of happened. Everyone went home or to sleep, and I went to my room, and he followed. And we had sex. 

I should have told my SO right after it happened, but I was so scared (and still am) that I will lose him, and our beautiful future. I view sex much differently than he does. I think that sex can be just an act that humans do, but I know that sex can be amazing and bonding experience for people who are in love. He thinks that sex should only be between people in a relationship. 

To return to my point about “why I did it” was that for the first time in all my life, I felt confident and sexy. My SO and I had sex when I was there in spring, but I felt so shy and scared. I know I should have talked to my SO to try to solve my confidence issues with him, but he just seemed like he would have none of it. 

This took place in about a week's time, and then I moved away for the summer. We (the guy I cheated with) have talked about what happened and have decided it is best that we don't talk anymore. He understands the situation, and seems to be over me. 

I continue to talk and laugh and plan and love my SO every day. He knows nothing. 
So what should I do? Do I tell him about my mistake and why I did so? Or do I leave him in an ignorant bliss and try to solve these issues without telling him? If I should tell him, do I to do it in person? But I know the longer I wait, the more it will hurt him... I won't be in his country until mid August. He says he is so in love with me, and tells me that I am perfect and beautiful and he just can't wait until we can share our lives together. And I feel the same way! 

TL;DR I've made huge plans in my future with my LD SO, but made a mistake and don't know what I should do..."
1gkgeu,159,2013-06-18,He's gone.,fadelakin,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1gkgeu/hes_gone/,"My dad is gone. I was in the basement and I heard some commotion upstairs. My dad had a couple travel bags in his hand and I asked him where he was going. All he told me was don't wait up and he left some money on the kitchen counter for me. He gets called into work at odd times of the day when he's needed so I'm used to him going but this time was different. 

I just went into his room. It's cleaned out. There's nothing in the closet. His tv and all his clothes are gone. There's nothing there. All he left me was $500. I don't like my dad but I never wanted him to leave. 7 months ago, my mom did the same thing to me. I woke up and there was a letter on my desk. My mom left and went back to Africa. I then moved in with my dad. 

I don't know why but the people I'm supposed to love and care about I end up pushing away. My mom left me. Now my dad is gone. I don't know whether I should be sad, scared, angry, happy or whatever. I don't usually feel emotions like other people. I'm alone on this big blue marble that's suspend in space and spins around a giant ball of gas that's on the outside of a collection of stars, gases, and dust. 

All alone. I want to break down but I don't want to because I hate being depressed. If I get depressed now, I'll never make it out alive. 

Fuck. I think I'll go skate.

TL;DR my mom left me. now my dad has left me. i'm all alone.

Update: It's like 12:30pm and I just woke up. I called my dad a few times but he's not answering. Called my mom and she's not also answering. I just remembered I have an internship in SF that starts next week and I don't know if I should still go or not because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. Even though my dad left me $500, I have money in my bank account that should last me for about a year or two if I spend it right. My job is a freelance programmer and that's what I'll just keep doing. The hours suck but it pays very well. I don't turn 18 till October 30. The thing is our house is payed for. We don't pay a mortgage on it since my dad bought it full price with cash. I have money that I can use to pay the utilities. I have netflix and hulu plus so there's no need for cable. I already pay my own phone bill. I was raised in boarding schools most of my life so I'm used to being alone all the time. I'm meeting with a lawyer later today to see if I can stay in the house since my dad left the deed to the house (I guess he didn't take it) and probably get emancipated on the account that my parents abandoned me. If I plan things right, I know I can last till next year. All the people that I have called haven't returned my calls. I'll go take a shower. I'll be pretty pissed if I have to sell my BRZ because the title is in my dad's name even though I payed for it. Since the title is in his name, he legally owns the car even though I payed for it. I'll go take a shower and meet with the lawyer and see what to do. 

Update #2: Got back from lawyer's office. They're going to try and get in contact with my dad. They might have to give him a subpoena whatever that means. I've made the necessary steps to get emancipated. If my dad doesn't show up to court on the court date, I become emancipated and my own legal guardian. I'll be able to keep my car. I've removed my dads access to my bank account just in case. As for the house, I'll have to go to court and prove that I'll be able to make ends meet for me to stay and I can be a responsible young adult. If not, I might have to find someone to stay with till November. Once I turn 18 and if I want, I can take the deed and become the legal owner of the house provided that my dad doesn't return to claim the house before then. So I guess things are looking up...in a way. I still haven't been able to get a hold of my dad or my mom but no worries. I hope things will be alright."
1gkg9b,5,2013-06-18,"Depression from junior year of high school on, never sought help.",[deleted],BackOnYourFeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackOnYourFeet/comments/1gkg9b/depression_from_junior_year_of_high_school_on/,"There's a long story, but I'll shorten it up. Currently I just graduated this past semester with my BS, and am looking for a job but failing.

In high school tried getting girls and being social but was constantly rejected, and could barely hold a friend. I went into a spiraling depression and was constantly sick. I threw up everything (even water) for essentially a month straight and had no appetite for months. I ended up losing 40 lbs, and this affected puberty. I ended up not growing to my potential and essentially look like a 15 yr old due to my skinniness and shortness.

All the doctors couldn't figure out what was up. They kept going for medical testings and what not. I even had an endoscopy. No one ever thought it was a mental thing. I myself was just scared and wanted to feel better.

Anyways, that depression (I realize what it was now) lasted through college up until now. Due to my physical stature and my mentality (extremely low self esteem, no drive, no motivation) I couldn't get a girl and barely held friends (again). School wise I just couldn't bring myself to do anything. I tried to do well but just felt a constant apathy, and therefore my grades suffered. I graduated with a pretty low GPA (2.8ish). Never sought any internships or anything. 

Now here I am, contemplating suicide just for an easy way out. It was stupid of me never to seek help. I was afraid, ashamed, and I wish a hundred times a day I could go back to do it again, another chance. Now I'm burdened with this big student loan and struggling to find a job (barely any experience isn't that appealing). Whenever I think about the opportunity that was squandered because of one small period of trouble in my life, I feel complete despair.

I realized I fucked up, but I don't want to give up. I care too much about my family, that's the only thing stopping me. And I know I'm still young, and I can turn things around. And I feel like a fucking loser for complaining like this when other people may have it worse. I don't know what I'm looking for here.

I just have an issue, the only job I have had in this field was during the last 7 months of college career, and it was an unpaid internship.  I just graduated in may. The internship was me working by myself to launch an ecommerce store using magento community edition, I did every aspect of the project, from wireframing, coding, database, and adding hundreds of SKU's.

My question is, what do I put for desired salary. I live in the midwest region in a large (capital) city. I found something online that says mid 80k average, but not quite sure what to put. Do employers automatically skip over you if you ask for too much? Do they negotiate? Any input would be great!"

I don't have close friends I can talk to. So Reddit will have to do. I love you all.

I'm an Asian 17 year old turning 18 on the 6th of July. I have an absolutely terrible relationship with my parents. Honestly, I think I hate them. I've always heard people say oh you can't hate your parents and all this other stuff but that isn't true.I do not consider these people I live with my family because family , i believe, is chosen. Just because you gave birth to me doesn't mean shit. I absolutely do not like these people. Even my freshmen year of high school, I told everyone I was adopted. Honestly, I wish I was. I really hate it here. I don't even call them ""mom"" or ""dad"" anymore. They're furious about that. I think I stopped calling them ""mom"" or ""dad"" back in January 2009, Martin Luther King's day. That day was a Monday, of course. II think I actually wrote it in a reddit comment a year ago.

Found it.
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/xjb3z/cant_tell_if_this_is_good_parenting_or_bad/c5mzo8d

So ever since that incident, I never acknowledged them as my parent ever again. I never really attempted to have any sort paternal relationship with them. Everyday went about the same. I'd go to school, come back and play on my computer and not leave the room. well hallway. I was given the hallway from the house to the backyard as a room. Only back in November did I get my own room. Took 17 years but I finally got my own room. Living in that fucking hallway was a nightmare. Honestly, No privacy. People would walk through it whenever they felt like because it was the only way to the backyard. I'd wake up to strangers walking through this place because they had to do something in the backyard or get something there. It was disgusting to live there. Even after I got my own room, nothing really changed. I spent 23/24 hours of my day in my room if I didn't go out that day. I basically lived like this from when I moved here 4 years ago till now. Ever since I got kicked out, They treated me a bit better. The constant screaming at me and the constant belittlement dwindled down but every now and then we'd get into arguements. Honestly I don't even remember most of them. I do remember one really big one from the summer of 2012. I had an internship I worked really hard to get in my junior year. It was a paid internship with a really good engineering company. When I went in to get my paperwork to be filled out, I found my green card was expired. I was dropped from the internship, leaving my summer basically empty. I was yelled at so much for that. Even when it was not even my fault. After constantly being asked what I was going to do that summer and how fucking lazy I am, I yelled back. We got into a really big arguement. I had no idea how me not knowing my greencard was expired was my fault. I never held onto those documents because they did. Welp. I finally told them how fucking stupid they were for losing that shit. The father is a very uhhh, I think rough might be the right word. He's a guy from China and he's very foul languaged. When he gets angry, He goes crazy. At the time, we got into a huge arguement. I don't remember most of it but I do remember screaming at them that as soon as I was 18 I'd leave. Honestly I regret not saying one thing in that arguement which was that I haven't acknowledged them as my parents in a long time. Maybe this wouldve let them know why I haven't called them ""mom"" or ""dad"" in so long. Back to this in a bit. So we got into that huge arguement and then I remember leaving the house that day in my headphones and going to the local park and just crying. I called my close friends on my way to the park and I realized that they're not as close to me as I am to them. The people I called gave no help what so ever and honestly didn't even care. Which was whatever. I cried that day, went to the park and just cried. The rest of the summer went about so slow because every day consisted of computer and once in a while I'd go out to hang out.

This brings us to today. I'm graduating high school on Friday. I get 3 graduation ticket to Barclay Center where my graduation is held. I had my senior dues paid for by the parents so obviously they'd be going. The last ticket, decided to ask an aunt. Because parents didn't know English I knew I needed to have someone guide them. I asked my Aunt yesterday to go. She said yes but suddenly parents went crazy. Apparently, I should've formally invited them as well. I assumed they were going but they started screaming at me at how I should've asked them as well. How I do not consider them parents anymore. This is true but this was completely uncalled for. They were saying how they don't wanna go to my graduation and if I won't call them mom or dad then I'm not their son or something like that. This is where I wish during that fight where I was really upset last summer , wished I would've told them that I didn't consider them parents at all anymore. Then this wouldn't have happened because they'd know. But nope. They just constantly screamed at how much of an ungrateful kid I am blah. Okay. So yeah. This was all yesterday. I feel like after or before friday, another big arguement will happen. This is because on thursday , after Graduation practice, I'm going to head over to my cousins house and stay there because it's more convenient to be driven to Barclay Center and I can give my tickets to them. I am going to do this because honestly, I do not want parents at my graduation and if I go to my cousins on thursday, parents wont be getting any tickets. Therefore they can't attend. I know I'm a terrible child for doing this but I want to. Hence the I will have to leave my house soon. After this, things around this house will be a living nightmare. Probably all the freedom I have will be taken away. It's always been my dream to leave when I'm 18. A dream for a very long time. I currently have $1000 to my name atm which I got through working part time as a teacher's assistant. $7.25 op. Anyways, after graduation a big fight between me and them are going to erupt. I think, no I know, I'll probably end up saying the things I wish I wouldve said last year. The relationship will offically be broken then. This will most likely end with me saying something along the lines of Leave me alone, I'm turning 18 in 2.5 weeks and I'll leave that day. Until then just leave me alone. I'm sort of prepared. I got a few friends to hold my stuff when I leave until I find a stable place to stay and retrieve them. I don't know where I'd go honestly I were to leave right now. Maybe stay with a few friends but oh well. I know I seem really immature and childish in this. It might be. But please, even if you tell me how stupid and pathetic I am, Do not tell me to try to reconcile this dead relationship i have with them. I'm done. If you read this, Thanks. If not, whatever, i just wanted somewhere to say this. peace.

TL:DR I'll be 18 in 2 weeks and I might be homeless by end of this week."

The switch isn't showing any activity or links when all of the boxes are plugged into it, but direct connections between the servers shows activity.  I have no idea what I need to do for this all to work.  I was reading that I would need a subnet manager and I tried to run one on a ubuntu server VM on the 1U box but it wouldn't detect the device.  The IB NICs only show up on the xenserver console or when going into the xenserver shell.  

Any help is welcome on this.  I would like to be able to just use a VM to handle it but if necessary I can just put a ubuntu on bare metal on one of the blades.  Thank you."

Background story:  I've been married for just under a year.  We are college students.  He got an internship for this summer.  Because we're newlyweds and in college, we have very little money.  

I have an aunt and an uncle who live within an hour of his internship.  We couldn't find an apartment for the summer that we could afford (it's hard to find a place that will lease for less than six months, and it's in a wealthy area), so we've been staying with them.  Commuting has been hard on our car because it's older than me, but anything is worth it for him to get this work experience.

My aunt is nice, but my uncle can be really nasty sometimes.  He constantly yells at me over everything.  Some of it is my fault (like not closing a window all the way), some of it isn't.  

This morning, it happened again, and I'm just feeling like dirt about it.  I came back from taking my husband to work and went to do some homework.  A few hours later, there's a knock on my door.  It's my uncle.  He says that I left the back door open and just completely lets loose screaming at me.  I'm in tears trying to apologize.  He is mad about the door, he is mad that I am in my room all day doing homework, he is mad that my husband twisted his own ankle a few weeks ago, he is mad about everything.  He finally leaves.  I go back in my room and cry some more.  I could've sworn I closed the door.  I'm usually so responsible.  I can't blame him for being mad about this because it's not wise to leave doors wide open.  I text my husband at work and tell him what happened and that we're probably going to get kicked out.

A little later, my aunt calls me and tells me that the door wasn't me, it was her.  She is super nice about it and takes me to lunch to try to make up for it.  She says that she and my uncle fought all morning about it.  She apologizes for him a lot.  She tells me that even though I did nothing wrong, he said that if I ""make"" them fight again, he's going to kick us out.

It's his house and he has every right to have things the way he wants them.  He also has every right to kick us for any reason -- it's his house, and I understand.  I just can't take being constantly screamed at all the time, especially for things I didn't do (this kind of thing happens more than I'd like).  We really need this internship and we have nowhere else to go.

I've been hiding in my room since a few weeks after we got here because of this sort of thing (we've been here a little over 2 months).  I've been starving myself in order to avoid going to the kitchen as much as possible so that I don't accidentally leave a crumb on the counter.  I'm so stressed that I can't sleep and I keep having terrible nightmares.

Please give me some encouragement to get through this for the next few months."

I'm also taking a trip to Europe this winter and want a card with no foreign transaction fees and/or Chip &amp; Pin.

Unique Case.",lovethrowawayy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gomll/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_in_a_semiofficial/,"If this doesn’t belong in this subreddit please delete it.  I will be cross posting to many subreddits, I am really lost here.

**Intro**

This will be a long post, but I think it’s necessary to go over everything because my situation is unique.  I really love this girl and I don’t want to give her up, but we hit a major snag.  I appreciate any advice at all, whether it be to break up and how to get over her, or how to move on with her.  I will keep most of it brief until the recent events.

**Background**

I’m a male, 21 years old, she is 21 as well.  We go to the same college.  She was my first, she lost her virginity in high school.

In 2011 in August, I met this girl, Mary.  Due to my nervousness and me being beta, I failed to talk to her until October 2011, but she seemed interested and we went on a few dates.  The problem is, my friend was in her class, while I only knew her from a party I went to.  Anyway, even though I told him I liked her; he ended up making a move on her and stole her away.  I hadn’t asked her to be my girlfriend yet so I don’t consider what she did to be anything bad.  Anyway, they dated until April 2012.  Along that time I talked to her a bit, only when she wanted to talk.  I didn’t want to be a bad friend to my friend (beta I know).  Turns out she grew to like me while we talked.  I found out later he was emotionally distant and abusive to her, and that they never really had a long shot chance.  She never cheated on him emotionally or physically, but after they broke up, we started talking again.

Summer of 2012, we messed around a bit and talked, but midway through, she told me she had feelings for him still, and I wasn’t going to put myself in that position to be her rebound, so I said we can’t talk to each other if she isn’t going to respect me like that.  We parted ways, and she kind of went back to him, hooking up and stuff, but nothing was there for her.

November of 2012 she texts me, saying she misses me.  I take this as a sign of interest and start taking her on dates.  Things go well and she stops seeing the other guy.  I meet her parents and she meets mine right before January 2013.  The problem is she was to study abroad in Spain Spring semester.  We decide to keep in touch but not make anything official.

While she’s in Spain, we talk almost every day, always through Facebook or Skype.  Things go awesomely.  We fall in love.  The extra kicker here is she has an internship in Morocco for the summer of 2013.  She never cheated on me in Spain.

I visit her during her first week in Morocco in May 2013.  Everything seemed to go well (I’ll get back on this) and we make it official over Facebook.  I still didn’t want to make it official but she was adamant about it, so we did.  As I’m about to board the plane we hug and cry, I’ll see her in August of 2013.

**The problem**

At first things are fine.  We don’t talk as much because she is busy with her job (she’s interning for the government).  She mentions a group of Marines that she hangs out with.  She mentions how one of them is hitting on her.  I tell her I trust her completely and that even though it doesn’t make me feel good, I won’t tell her who she can and can’t hang out with (apparently these were the only people her age).  After a few weeks I start to notice her mood start to change, so I ask her about it.  This spawns into a talk about our relationship and how she really loves me and that I’m sweet but that there was a spark missing from our relationship.  I tell her I have a spark for her, and this goes on for a while.  She mentions how when I visited her we shouldn’t have been able to keep our hands off each other.  But before that she had told me not to do any PDA because of the customs in Morocco, plus she was representing the US so she could get in trouble.  I start to tell her that if she doesn’t feel this way towards me, we should end it, because I deserve someone who loves me completely.  She gets a little mad that I’d go to such lengths.  Finally it starts to click for me.  I start to realize the reason why she has no spark for me is because our relationship started out as friends and me being there for her in that capacity.  I hadn’t had a chance to transform into a more masculine role.  She mentions how she feels like she could hook up with someone here and I would still stay with her.  I tell her no, cheating is not something I’ll tolerate.  After an hour she tells me that maybe I’m right, that she respects me as a person and not a man.  She reveals that she made out with a guy who she’s ruggedly attracted to twice within the last week and that she feels awful about it.  After collecting my nerves I end it with her, as in we break up.  She tells me she’s sorry and that she respects me for ending it.  I am devastated, but I was firm with her, unwavering, and cool about, ie I didn’t do anything unclassy on Facebook and I’m not going to drag any friends into this.

**What I need help with**

I still love her and she still loves me.  We can’t talk about it much because I have Army training for a month in two weeks.  We haven’t talked since.

She is probably right now hooking up with this guy, although I know that they don’t have anything emotional, it’s only physical.

She is physically attracted to me and our sex life is fine (although I admit I need to be a little more confident in bed, but I’d only just started that aspect so I know I could improve), but the thing she has with this other guy is more of an animalistic spark that she doesn’t have with me.

I want to take her back, I feel if I can be more of a man to her once she gets back, it will work.

**My questions**

1.	Should I take her back at all?  I feel like the trust can be repaired, as I really have been only been friends with benefits with her so far, even though we are in love emotionally.
2.	Should I say something to her now?  We haven’t spoken since we ended it, and I know I no longer have any dictation over if she sees other guys there, but it bothers me, obviously.  I am not and have no desire to see other girls.
3.	Any other advice?

Thanks for any help in advance.

After a few weeks I start to notice her mood start to change, so I ask her about it.  This spawns into a talk about our relationship and how she really loves me and that I’m sweet but that there was a spark missing from our relationship.  I tell her I have a spark for her, and this goes on for a while.  She mentions how when I visited her we shouldn’t have been able to keep our hands off each other.  But before that she had told me not to do any PDA because of the customs in Morocco, plus she was representing the US so she could get in trouble.  I start to tell her that if she doesn’t feel this way towards me, we should end it, because I deserve someone who loves me completely.  She gets a little mad that I’d go to such lengths.  Finally it starts to click for me.  I start to realize the reason why she has no spark for me is because our relationship started out as friends and me being there for her in that capacity.  I hadn’t had a chance to transform into a more masculine role.  She mentions how she feels like she could hook up with someone here and I would still stay with her.  I tell her no, cheating is not something I’ll tolerate.  After an hour she tells me that maybe I’m right, that she respects me as a person and not a man.  She reveals that she made out with a guy who she’s ruggedly attracted to twice within the last week and that she feels awful about it.  After collecting my nerves I end it with her, as in we break up.  She tells me she’s sorry and that she respects me for ending it.  I am devastated, but I was firm with her, unwavering, and cool about, ie I didn’t do anything unclassy on Facebook and I’m not going to drag any friends into this.

**What I need help with**

I still love her and she still loves me.  We can’t talk about it much because I have Army training for a month in two weeks.  We haven’t talked since.

She is probably right now hooking up with this guy, although I know that they don’t have anything emotional, it’s only physical.

She is physically attracted to me and our sex life is fine (although I admit I need to be a little more confident in bed, but I’d only just started that aspect so I know I could improve), but the thing she has with this other guy is more of an animalistic spark that she doesn’t have with me.

I want to take her back, I feel if I can be more of a man to her once she gets back, it will work.

**My questions**

1.	Should I take her back at all?  I feel like the trust can be repaired, as I really have been only been friends with benefits with her so far, even though we are in love emotionally.
2.	Should I say something to her now?  We haven’t spoken since we ended it, and I know I no longer have any dictation over if she sees other guys there, but it bothers me, obviously.  I am not and have no desire to see other girls.
3.	When she gets back (I have some of her stuff), I plan on going over to her place to drop it off, and instead of sulking about it or anything like that, I'm simply going to act like she's any other girl I like and invite her to a party, where I'll be as alpha as possible (without douching it up).  Any advice on how the cheating stuff may factor into this?

Thanks for any help in advance.

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend cheated on me, but I don't believe it is relationship altering, I need advice on how to forgive her and if a relationship is possible now.

1gnt0e,41,2013-06-19,My new Ouya - a non-backer's perspective.,nckangelo,ouya,https://www.reddit.com/r/ouya/comments/1gnt0e/my_new_ouya_a_nonbackers_perspective/,"I had not heard about the Ouya until the past few weeks.  After researching it and all of it's possibilities, I wanted to buy one.  Clearly, I was not able to back the Kickstarter campaign, so I looked on eBay.  I was able to get the standard console with an extra controller for $160, only $10 more than what that would cost me if I waited until next week (and only $1 more if you consider sales tax!).  I am here to write a review for the console from someone who was not waiting for months for the console.  I imagine my review would be similar to someone that picks it up in stores in the coming weeks.

The Ouya arrived from the seller Monday.  The backer that received it hadn't taken anything out of the packing.  The controllers and console all seem pretty solid, considering their price.  I expected some cheap feeling controller.  Not to say that it doesn't have its flaws, but they are better than I expected.  I thought it was nice that they include batteries and an HDMI cable.  Those are things that most electronic devices would not include, and it was a nice touch.

Before discussing the software, I feel that I should talk about me and what I was expecting from the console.  I have a Raspberry Pi that I set up as an emulator about a month ago using RetroPie.  I was happy with this, except I really wanted N64 emulation, and better PSX emulation.  That being said, one of the main selling points for me was the N64 emulation available on the Ouya.  It certainly is not perfect, but I have yet to find an emulator that is.  I also enjoy playing indie games from the XBLA, so I was excited to see what this had to offer.  There are a lot of fun, interesting games on the Ouya, and the fact that you can try them all for free is great.  I have yet to buy any games, but I did purchase the full version of FPse yesterday.  I was pretty bummed to find out that after a few minutes of playing FF7, the sound cut out and I was given the option to pay for the full version.  I was so excited to play the game that I gave in and paid the $2.99 for the full version.  I hope to see some nice updates to this emulator, since the menu is not the best for a TV screen.  Purchasing things on the Ouya is almost too easy, and I feel like developers are going to benefit greatly from impulse buys similar to what I did with FPse.

I also have set up my Raspberry Pi as an XBMC media center.  I sideloaded the android version to try it out and compare it the openElec build that I have running on the pi.  Menu navigation seemed to be much snappier, which I enjoyed.  However, I was unable to get the remote app on iOS to work with it, and it wasn't showing up as an Airplay receiver either.  I will keep using my pi for XBMC until that works.

On the topic of sideloading things, I was able to sideload GTA3 yesterday and play it with the controller without any additional setup.  It takes some playing around to figure out the controls, but it does work.  I tried dead trigger, but the additional content would not download, so I couldn't play the game.  This was probably just an issue with my apk.  

I just read today about Kainy getting a native Ouya version, and I am excited to get that hooked up to play Steam games from my laptop.  I haven't used Steam before, but I still look forward to getting it set up.  I also plan on buying the new Humble Bundle and trying those games out as well.

Lastly, I want to talk about the controller.  I am happy (lucky?) that I have not seen any considerable controller lag, even in the emulators.  I have been playing it in an open room, where the couch is very close to where the Ouya is sitting.  However, the joysticks have got a ring worn around them already, and I've only had it for two days!  I saw some posts regarding this, and tried sanding down the faceplate to no avail.  I will try again, but this is definitely going to be an issue if people are supposed to buying these things in a week.  You think they would have caught this and fixed it while testing.  I guess that can be said for most of the issues that they have had though.

All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.  I am going to school for Computer Engineering, and I work as a Software Engineering intern, so I am very interested in making my own game for the Ouya.  To me, that's one of the best things about this system.  I have some ideas, but the great community support and documentation for things like the ODK and the Android SDK, as well as engines like libgdx are very promising.

I'm interested to see what less-informed consumers think of the Ouya in the coming weeks.

**Update: 6/19/2013, 6:46 PM**
I am adding some photos of my controller.  You can see that the analog sticks have been worn where they rub on the faceplates.  This can be seen on the right side, where only half of the analog stick has a ring worn on it, since only half of the stick is surrounded by the faceplate.

**Update: 6/20/2013, 10:44 AM**
In the wake of them adding a 16 GB version of the Ouya on the preorder page, I was reminded about my experience with the USB drive.  I have a 320 GB external HD (Seagate Free Agent) that I keep all of my movies and TV episodes on for XBMC.  This worked just as it would in openElec, or I assume any other XBMC distro.  I also have my ROMs on a 16GB flash drive, which worked with all of the emulators that I have been using (Super GNES, Mupen64, FPse, NES, GBA, and GBC).  I will eventually move all of the ROMs onto the HD as well, but having them separate was a good test of the Ouya.  After unplugging the flash drive and plugging in the HD, it was mounted to /usbdrive without any issues.  The Ouya also seems to power the HD fine.  However, I don't think that it draws a lot of power to operate, seeing as my Raspberry Pi will power it as well, along with a WiFi dongle.  I have not gotten to the point where I have ran out of space on the Ouya for downloaded games, but USB support is something of a necessity for a device like this, and I can only assume that they are working on it (hopefully for a launch-day update).
In a way I feel like June 25th will be like getting the Ouya all over again.  If they are smart, there will be a software update with some huge changes/fixes/improvements, and there should be many new games to play.  If only the people that made this thing happen were able to enjoy it."

I've been in a relationship with my SO off and on for about 4 years. The first year of our relationship seemed to to be the personification of a fairy tale in terms of  happiness and apparent compatibility. However, later in our relationship issues began to arise. I felt that things had become somewhat complacent and asked her if she would mind getting ready more often. t I just wanted her to do her hair a little more and maybe put herself together instead of always bummin' it. (Though I did my best to word it in a less offensive manner.) Well I failed and this opened a floodgate of insecurity that I was certainly not expecting nor intending to promote. She felt ugly - something which is absolutely not the case, and I have told her as much time and time again. 

Well after the onset of insecurity we moved to another state for a summer internship she had. Our relationship degraded, as she felt insecure and I felt unappreciated. It was her first time away from her family and I figured this was mostly why she was always depressed. So I would make her dinner, take her to the park, have drinks ready when she came home, etc. etc. In the meantime - she was talking with her family about how horrible I made her feel. So the family began to resent me and I became 'a monster' without any ability to voice my side of the situation. It just seemed the harder I tried to make her happy and work on our relationship the more she descended into depression. 

Well we make it through the summer and she wants to go on a break - where we agree upon not being with other people... just time to give her some space. A week or so later she calls me up and we get back together. Shortly thereafter I discovered that she had left herself logged into her email on my computer and I (ashamedly) looked through her emails. I found conversations between her and a work associate pretty much bad mouthing me for half the duration of the internship - and further detailed a planned meeting between the two during our break. I can't adequately explain what that betrayal felt like - I've never cheated on a girl. Honesty and trust are, I'd venture to say, two characteristics I have tried to define myself by as a man. I felt like the two of us always had each other's back - no matter what. It didn't matter to me if we were fighting or not, I would defend her to others because that's what loyalty is all about... but I just found out that my partner did not have my back. Quite the opposite.

So I confront her and she lies. 'Oh I never actually went to see him --&gt; Oh ok I started driving and turned around --&gt; ok I drove down but we just talked --&gt; and finally We met up at a coffee shop and he kissed me... which was the end of it.'

We broke up, got back together, broke up again. Finally it seemed the relationship was over. Her family hated me, my friends hated her, I had lost all my trust in her, and we were mostly just confused and heartbroken. While we were apart I slept with a couple other girls, mostly just trying to move on. She slept with another guy, trying to do the same I reckon. 

Months had gone by when she called me out of the blue because a friend of hers had died. I talked her through it and did my best to console her. A few days later she told me she never fell out of love with me and wanted us to make this work, that she was in this 100%. I asked to take it slow and we did, until eventually we were dating again.

The problem is, old ghosts still haunt us. It's been nearly two years since the incident with her co worker. I do my best to trust her, but find myself always wondering. I ask her still, if she told me the whole story - if she had actually done more than kiss this man. She tells me no, and that she learned her lesson regarding truthfulness. Her family still hates me, because she had in the past painted me as a horrible person - though I honestly think what had her depressed was being unfaithful to me through the degrading and inappropriate conversations. Further she still suffers from insecurity - I can tell her she is gorgeous 1000x and it just doesn't stick. It's hard to reinforce that attraction, however, when I am feeling distrustful. I honestly don't know how to go about feeling safe with her again, and I know that until I feel I can trust her it is unlikely that I can really help her by being congruent with my attraction and actions towards her. We are talking of moving in together again, which requires me to move to another state. I guess I'm just afraid of her betraying me again, and don't know if I should go through with this. Perhaps its better that we cut our losses and take our lessons to the next relationship? IDK

**tl;dr**: Summarize with a tldr!: How do you build real fundamental trust back after it has been broken and cure self image insecurities?"
1gmwju,1,2013-06-19,"Hurt, Frustrated, and Very Confused",FatCatThreePack,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1gmwju/hurt_frustrated_and_very_confused/,"To start off I'll provide a little disclaimer: I know that Reddit is not a substitute for a medical professional. I plan on going to the sports medicine clinic at my university's gym (where they can assess and refer you to a doctor that might take my insurance) as soon as I am able to.

So, I guess I'll start from the beginning:

I, like so many others, have lifted weights since high school - but not really. My version of lifting weights was going to the gym maybe twice a week, maybe three times on a good week, and doing a random assortment of lifts with various friends (and of course seeing no progress). At the beginning of my Junior year in college, I was maybe 130-135 pounds, 5'8"". I could bench 95 pounds for maybe... 10 reps? I had shitty posture (I'm guessing some APT and too much curve in my back, like lordosis. Never been diagnosed or anything).

I got some sort of virus right after a concert in the early Fall, throwing up everything I ate, high temperature, had to go to the ER, dropped 10 pounds in a week or two to end up at 125 and extremely weak, where I stayed until January of this year.

Then I started lifting seriously with my roommate, focusing on diet, realizing that I actually needed to eat more and that I could gain weight, no metabolism bullshit etc. etc., all of that good stuff. Did bench press, squats, dips, pull ups, rows, the usual stuff. I felt better, stronger, healthier, body starting to look good, didn't get sick often, got up to 145.

Then I hurt my back doing squats. Probably around March or April? Can't remember. Light too, just 135 for 10 reps, on my 3rd set something... gave out. It's hard to describe the pain with the terms people often use here (like stabbing vs. aching and whatnot), it felt like if my back was a rubber band, the rubber band suddenly went from taut to loose - but it at the same time became extremely rigid. I immediately racked the weight, walked around the gym in confusion, and went home. The pain was predominantly on the left side of my lower back, wrapping around the hips and glutes, in an area that seems impossible to stretch out even if you want to badly. My back was hurt and incredibly weak, bending over like in a bent-over row position was impossible, my back just screamed that it wanted to collapse at me. Anytime I lay down and *fully* relaxed (which was hard because I always wanted to tense up to avoid this) my back hurt as my butt angled towards my shoulders and my back arched.

It slowly got better over the next couple weeks and I didn't work out. The relaxing thing still happened, still felt shitty after stuff like playing volleyball, but eventually I got better-ish. Started working out again, upper body only, but it just didn't seem as good as hitting legs too, I stalled.

I went to the little clinic at my gym and told them how I felt, they said I could probably start up again. I got a massage too just because it felt good. After a quick trip back home at the beginning of summer I changed routines and dedicated myself to lifting with proper form and eating right. I had all summer and an internship only to get in better shape. I started lifting low rep ranges more, started deadlifting which quickly became my favorite lift. I thought that maybe the injury was great to happen to me because it made me wary of form.

I got up to 155 and started feeling really good about my progress, I was confident in my lifts and felt strong, flexible, and overall great, even with posture improving to boot (all relative for a beginner of course). I stretched all the time.

Even with all these setbacks and slooooowly starting from the bottom when I hurt myself I got to bench 135 for 3x5, 155 for squats 3x5, and deadlift 245 for 3 pretty easily. Tiny numbers in the grand scheme of things but it certainly felt great to me. I wasn't sure why my deadlift was disproportionate, maybe it was because I was still increasing slowly on the other lifts?

Today I ran into the gym after work for squat deadlift and power clean and other leg stuff today.

I hurt my back. Again. At the bottom of the 1st rep of my first set it just *happened* and I dumped the weight on the racks. Knowing what it meant made me so fucking frustrated I wanted to bitch and moan like a little baby. I just honestly don't get it. The kicker was that I was planning on submitting form check videos for squats this week since I spent the last two weeks on deadlift videos. If only I had made it another week maybe people here could've seen some glaring error.

Now I'm lying in bed at home typing this. Sitting up like a sit-up sounds like an impossibility right now. Arching my back like a bridge? Same thing. Getting up needs my arms, everything sucks.

I just don't get it. How can I deadlift easily and without pain and hurt my entire lower back with squats? I feel like I always hear about deadlift back pain here, not squats. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong and I'm incredibly frustrated at the prospect of starting from square one again. Maybe my posture has something to do with it. I feel like a goddamn old man who can't function right, and I feel almost foolish for getting so excited and over-confident earlier on.

Have any of you had anything similar happen? Any advice? I don't really know what I'm looking for with this novel that I've published... maybe just to write it out so I don't whine to people like I have been. I gotta own up to that for sure. Maybe help in articulating how this injury feels would help. I don't have much of a clue right now.

TL,DR: Thanks for attempting to read my extensive autobiography/injury report, just hurt my back squatting for the second time. Frustrated, confused, bitching, the works. Asking for advice and possible leads on why my lower back feels like something is wrong with it."

* Caddy ($ less important): I just want something reliable and long-lasting. If there is a $20 one and an $80 one, I would pick the better one.
* SSD ($ more important): I am looking for something less than $400. Obviously more storage space the better, but I am looking for latest-gen for the sake of longevity.

Edit:
I really want to add an SSD to make it a two drive configuration. 

The SSD is meant to boost performance, so I certainly want to put it in the main bay as many of you have suggested.

For the caddy, I was hoping someone had direct experience with getting one for a slot-loading machine like I have."

I am a college student studying electrical engineering. Love the tech, and now that I have some money from a summer internship, I am looking to upgrade my laptop.

I have the [**HP Envy 14 Beats Edition laptop**](http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c02878045.pdf) ([link to almost the exact model: this is virtually the same](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02914274&amp;tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5128672)). Save the beats-circle jerk for later (joke), because now I need some help. 
The computer has a slot loading drive, so doesn't have a typical drive.

1. I need help finding a great, quality **caddy** to put an SSD into.
2. Then, I need a **solid SSD** to put into the caddy you guys/gals helped me find!

As far as budget:

* Caddy ($ less important): I just want something reliable and long-lasting. If there is a $20 one and an $80 one, I would pick the better one.
* SSD ($ more important): I am looking for something less than $400. Obviously more storage space the better, but I am looking for latest-gen for the sake of longevity.
Overall I want to spend the least possible, but make it a worthwhile investment.

I appreciate all the effort ahead of time!"
1gmtvn,1,2013-06-19,I had sex with my roommate and cheated on my boyfriend.,dontok,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gmtvn/i_had_sex_with_my_roommate_and_cheated_on_my/,"I'm renting an apartment for just the summer with a guy I met back in January. We kept in touch, both of us got the same internship in the same city, and now here we are. 

Last night we both went out to celebrate my 21st birthday. Both of us got inevitably drunk. Me more than him. We came back to the apartment. I fell asleep on the couch, but I woke up about an hour later to use the bathroom. He was sitting beside me watching TV. It was completely innocent. 

I came back, still kinda drunk, and sat down with him we just started talking. I don't know if he was sober, but I kissed him. I'm just a horny drunk. I made a bad choice. 

He pulled away and said we shouldn't do that, and that I should get some rest, but I started kissing him again. I remember I called him by my boyfriend's name. I don't know why. I knew who he was. I wasn't that drunk. But I wanted *him*. 

We ended up having sex. It was fucking incredible. I can't even tell you guys. I loved it. Shamelessly. I fucking loved it. He made me feel things I have never felt before. 

I don't regret it. 

I haven't seen my roommate at all today. I think he's embarrassed or upset with himself or me. Maybe both. I'm debating on telling my boyfriend what happened. He'll dump me, I'm sure. Maybe. We've only been dating a little over a year. 

But sex with my boyfriend has never been as amazing as that one time was last night with my roommate. I'm a girl that needs to be satisfied. 

Is that so bad?"
1gmekf,3,2013-06-18,I (18F) am sneaking off to my boyfriend's (19M) house this week and feel guilty for using and lying to my family.,runawaygirl123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gmekf/i_18f_am_sneaking_off_to_my_boyfriends_19m_house/,"We are college students who have been dating for 6 months and are staying in our hometowns during summer break. I recently introduced him to my family, and while they're fine with me dating, they're against me having sex and have been emphasizing for me not to have sex ever since I told them I started dating. I've been pretending that I'm still a virgin.

They also won't let me sleep over at his house because they think it's inappropriate. Problem is, we won't have many chances to see each other during summer break because of our busy schedules (I have 2 internships and he has work). So the only time we might be able to see each other is during the 3 days that my parents are going to be out of town. I'm planning on sneaking over to his place during those 3 days.

A lot of conflicts have risen up while arranging this. He can't drive over to my city (which is an hour away) because of gas prices and his parents don't want him to drive long distances after he got into an accident recently. I can't drive over to his city because I don't have a license yet. The train station is too far away from my house as well. So we've decided that as long as I get a ride to another city that's halfway there, he can pick me up at the train station in that city.

My grandma and aunt live in my house so they're aware of the plan and are helping me pull this off. They'll have to lie to my parents and my aunt will drive me to the other city, knowing that if we get caught, they will completely lose my parents' trust. They agreed to help me after I promised them that I would sleep in a different room and would not have sex with him. When I had to ask my aunt to drive me, she said, ""Promise me that nothing will happen.""

That's when I started feeling incredibly guilty. I am pretty much using my grandma and aunt and lying to their face, and I feel really awful about it. I don't know what to do about the guilt. Should I not have sex with him and sleep in separate rooms in order to keep my promise? Or should I do whatever I want and not feel ashamed about having sex? I'm leaning towards the latter, but some perspective and advice on this situation would be nice.

**TL;DR:** My parents won't allow me to sleep over at my boyfriend's house, so my aunt and grandma agreed to help me sneak over there after I promised them that I wouldn't sleep with him. I feel guilty for using and lying to them and am not sure what to do about the guilt. "
1gr6lw,1,2013-06-20,does anyone else need to vent about unfair treatment by a pissy resident?,[deleted],medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1gr6lw/does_anyone_else_need_to_vent_about_unfair/,"sorry i figured this was probably a goldmine, and i just got home and had to put this somewhere before i explode. i'm currently on my sub-i in the ICU, obviously i'm trying to get good face time with attendings, get honors, and hopefully get a good letter. if this one resident doesn't ruin everything for no reason.

the first two weeks were great, as i spent most of the day with the same chill intern. he had us do almost all his scutwork, but it was valuable practice for intern year actually, and it made it easier to follow the patients when i was the one writing notes and getting consults all day. he showed us how to do everything - notes, orders, look up imaging, consults - and thanked us for our help. i felt like a ""real doctor.""

now we are spending every other day with two different residents, who now have to do Q2 since that chill intern is gone. neither of them are happy about it but one of them is really going out of her way to make our lives miserable. the first day working with her we told her we had no problem writing all the notes (like we had been every day for two weeks prior). then when we didn't have them done by the time she wanted (obviously we should have read her mind) she assumed it was because we were having trouble getting them done, waited till we were gone for the day, and complained about us to the attending. he now thinks we were ""overwhelmed"" and only lets us do a couple of things during the day now. i went from feeling like i had done a hard day's work and had actually contributed, to feeling completely unsatisfied and like i'm a completely useless moron.

so we spend a lot of time sitting around, trying to find ways to be useful. but if i try to do something for her and she doesn't like the way i've done it, she assumes it's because i'm an idiot and reams me out for it in front of everyone. either that or she's done it already and is annoyed at me for even bringing it up. on the other hand, if i try to stay out of her way and just check on my patients and read about their conditions, invariably she'll come over and start giving me grief for NOT having done something (almost always something she never told me to do in the first place). i'm damned if i do, damned if i don't; she never gives us instructions, but gets mad when we don't do things...but if we try to anticipate what needs to be done and take the initiative to do it ourselves, she always has a problem with that somehow too.

she's like a dark storm cloud on my mood, and makes me incredibly anxious. i tip toe around her all day. then she'll make some passive aggressive comment, or talk to me like an idiot, or roll her eyes when i try to tell her something, and i'll get all anxious and worked up. i'll finally calm down and find something useful to do, just focus on my patients, and before i know it she's coming out of nowhere to ruin my day again. 

even the battle-hardened ICU nurses are on edge, and are telling me to tell her things for them, because as one told me, ""i don't want her to think i'm bugging her and have her roll her eyes at me again."" at least it's not just me. the best part of today was when our attending forced her to leave and go eat lunch, and we all got to chill and talk about basketball. 

i know this is a long rant but i had to get it out. thought i might as well use this as an opportunity to start a bitchfest and hear everyone else's worst resident stories. i know you've got some.

tldr: my resident not only sucks, but is sabotaging all the hard work i've done to make a good impression on my attendings. i'm dreading going to work tomorrow cuz i know she's going to interrupt me during rounds and try to make me look stupid again :(

What. The. Fuck.

Why would you tell me that knowing what I'm fucking dealing with right now? 9 years. I was sober for 9 years. I fucked up, and part of my recovery is to let the people I care about know what is going on with me. THAT makes you have a crush on me? A pretty obvious one at that.

I'm fucked up in my own way, but seriously... every other month you and that guy you live with go through the SAME FUCKING DRAMA. Break up with the guy already, but leave me the fuck out of it.

I've told you numerous times that I can't be the ""rock"" that everyone needs. I can't be the one who takes care of everything. I NEED someone who won't be completely dependent on me. I can't trust MYSELF to be the dependable one.

Yeah, I've accomplished a lot blah, blah, blah. I know what I want to do with the rest of my life blah, blah, blah. However, I don't want to be the one who fucks it all up for someone else. If I do that to ME, that's my fault. If I do it to someone else, that's unforgivable.

I'm moving 1200 miles across the country for an UNPAID internship. UNPAID. Sure, I'm going to have a job afterwards. But still...

1gqvwk,1,2013-06-20,Willing to check out my Personal Statement?,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1gqvwk/willing_to_check_out_my_personal_statement/,"It’s about 8:05 in the morning and our subject is officially late. I’m on my second cup of coffee. Knowing that I have midterm exams coming up, as well as the MCAT less than two weeks away, the last place I want to be is in this chilly converted basketball gymnasium. David, the graduate student I work with in the Motion Analysis Laboratory at the University of Oregon, reminds me that the subject received his concussion two days ago and that we should give him some extra time before leaving. When I saw him struggle to walk through the door a few minutes later, I felt a twinge of guilt. As we attached the reflective markers on his various bony landmarks to allow us to carry out our research, I learned that his name is Connor and that he’s on the university’s rugby team. He remembered going for a tackle in their game two days before and then regaining consciousness on the turf, staring up at his coach and trainer. He was told that he took a knee to his head. They then conducted some tests to confirm that he had a concussion.

We performed some seated cognitive tests on Connor and had him stand up to begin our research. I didn’t need to look at the data to know that he had a dramatic sway to go with his sluggish gait. I had never seen a subject struggle so hard to stay within the taped off runway. Then we began to integrate the cognitive tests while he was walking, and Connor took almost three times longer than the control subjects to answer the panel of questions. David and I decided to reduce the number of trials out of fear that we might end up doing more harm than good. I asked Connor how he was feeling after we finished, and I was amazed that he claimed to feel “normal” and not unusually foggy or slow. 

I was one of the assistants working the day Connor returned for his one month post-injury data collection. It was great to see that his symptoms had subsided and his deficits had disappeared. As strange as this sounds, I could completely sympathize with what Connor had gone through because I had once been in his shoes.

My interest in medicine began as an offshoot of my participation and passion for sports. Anytime I would get hurt or hear about somebody else getting hurt, I wanted to learn more about it. I wanted to know exactly what happened when I sprained an ankle or what it meant when Rich Gannon separated his shoulder. My fascination with sports injuries came to a head as a junior in high school. Having made the varsity football team, I was competing for the starting center position. While preparing for our upcoming game against Albany High School, I was taking part in a tackling drill in practice. According to my teammates, I collided with the ball carrier facemask to facemask, but we hit at an angle and my head twisted around quickly. I don’t remember much from the rest of practice but I know I didn’t stop playing. I didn’t know it at the time but I had suffered a concussion. What I do remember is that headed back to the locker room, I couldn’t walk straight and fell over halfway to the gym. Some of my teammates grabbed me and helped me to Mrs. Gibson, our athletic trainer.

Although this was more severe than before, this wasn’t the first time I had experienced symptoms like these from playing. I wound up missing three in-season games and developed a severe case of post-concussion syndrome. I ignored the headaches and attributed my sleepiness and depression to being 16 years old. However, I could not ignore the persistent bouts of dizziness that once caused me to fall out of my chair while sitting in AP Chemistry.

As an athlete, I just wanted to get back on the field to regain a sense of normalcy. Being a teenager, I developed an attitude with Mrs. Gibson when she held me out for the third game. Finally, she snapped at me and explained that if I returned too early I could suffer permanent trauma or even die on the field. That really resonated with me. As an athlete, I had grown accustomed to the gradual recovery from an injury, but the lingering effects of this concussion were particularly intriguing to me. I recovered and my post-concussion symptoms subsided, but they planted the seeds for my desire of a career in medicine.

As I sought to learn more about concussions, I realized that the information available was pretty limited—a barrier I felt I needed to break. I have just completed a class on the neurophysiology of concussions, which I had to petition the department to offer since it had been cancelled indefinitely. I have worked as a first responder for the intramural sports program at the University of Oregon, performing on site first aid as well as diagnosing concussions. I have worked with athletic trainers at the high school level, helping with sports injuries of varying severity. More recently, I have begun working as an intern athletic trainer with the university’s football team, working with the athletes in therapy and on the field as well as the trainers and team physicians in a clinical environment. I will continue with this opportunity throughout the season this fall. As I gained these experiences, my desire and drive to attain more knowledge of medicine as a whole grew. They have shaped my plans to attend medical school and pursue a career as a physician.

1gqicr,4,2013-06-20,3 things triggering my depression.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gqicr/3_things_triggering_my_depression/,"I have always been a fairly optimistic and carefree person, and never really been upset up until this year. Some background of myself that's probably irrelevant but I'll just say it anyway's, I'm 20 years old I'm semi-introverted and I'm shy as fuck - literally I don't speak to people unless they strike a conversation with me otherwise I can spend the whole day with a person and not speak a single word. I don't find myself interesting, I don't have any real hobbies or interests because I don't find much interesting. Last summer I moved to a foreign country (technically my birth country but I've never lived here) for a summer internship, when unexpectedly I had to stay here for longer than expected with having only made a very limited amount of friends from then to now. And now on to the main topic, I'll start with what's bothering me least at the moment to what's bothering me most.

Back in March of this, my mum tried to commit suicide. She locked herself up in her room and tried to overdose on sleeping pills, if she had not sent messages in her haze about her writing a will and how I should go find my sister (who at the time they didn't have the best relationship) and to live with her if she dies. Me and my family had to call a lock pick to open her door. It was not a good experience and kind of traumatized me slightly for a few weeks and still is at the back of my mind. However she's been getting help, by seeing a doctor and medication and even socialising a lot more. However this event happening made me realise that I was in fact suffering from slight depression for a long time. 

Up next is cancer, like I stated above I unexpectedly had to stay in a country that's foreign to me and didn't really know well, the main reason is because during the summer I found out I had cancer and had to stop Uni. Hodgkin's lymphoma to be exact, its not a difficult form of cancer to treat compared to others but it was quite a shock to me as I had none of the symptoms originally. I only found out after coughing for a month solid, a cough which made me physically sick and couldn't eat, to which I then got an X-ray and found a tumour 8.5CM in diameter. At first when I was told it I didn't really click, I wasn't upset, I was OK with it however 20 minutes later when exiting the hospital my aunt who accompanied me broke down in tears... And I couldn't stop my owns tears after seeing it... Then came the treatments, as expected they sucked more cock than Sasha Grey but the treatments were working, my tumour was shrinking... up until my last treatment when I was supposedly done, it was discovered that my cancers spread and wasn't reacting to the medication. So now I have to go through the whole treatment again and through bone marrow transplantation. 

And lastly, breaking up with my first girlfriend/first love of 5 years which only happened 2 days ago... My girlfriend also came to the same country as me in the summer, so that was okay. but we didn't really see each other much with treatments and such making going out a difficulty a lot of the times and her working and going out with her friends. But I didn't really mind of course because I trusted her. Then came the depression, and I began questioning my trust for her because of her constant going out, this was kind of on and off but I knew what I was doing was annoying her as the 2-3 years prior she was the one accusing me of cheating all the time (funny story; she accused me of cheating throughout the whole year when I was living with her and spending only around 3-4 hours without her a day while I was still in University) but I couldn't help myself of wanting her to reassure me. Then I started getting feel better and we spent more time together and I got over the anxiety and jealous. But over the last 4 months I began seeing her post pictures with another guy a lot of the time, obviously I told her upfront that I was jealous but I trusted her and she reassured me that she loved me and was cheating. . Move forward a month I find out that I have to go through the whole cancer treatment again but this time I'll be in hospital a lot longer, and she starts becoming more distant and annoyed when I talk to her I thought she was on her period and what not.LAter on, I kept reassuring her that if she wanted to move on and break up with me, she'd only have to tell me as I understand that the situation I'm in isn't exactly going to be easy on our relationship she told me she still wants to be with me regardless. But I see love quotes and such on her WeChat (which I don't use but its similar to FB with a newsfeed and such)  and posting bottles of wine and how ""romantic"" it was. I confronted her staight away, but I was assured yet again that there was no cheating and that she was with her friends... I was stupid. Then a month ago, while I was looking for my iPod using findmyphone I saw that she was out. I tried calling her and such, while she proclaims shes at home sleeping. I kept quite. Then I hacked into her WeChat, which she didn't think I could do and personally I feel like an ass for doing it but I was furious, and found out that shes hanging out with that guy a lot more than she admits too. Then comes fast foward to this week, and I see her on a date with this guy, while out with my family I didn't confront her face-to-face. She says she'll meet me later to explain, I wait the whole day she continues to say she's meeting her friends who are on holiday here and more excuses I gave her a meet up time before I give up completely. she didn't meet me. I got so enraged that I used the erase phone setting on her phone, and deleted EVERYTHING of hers on my devices and such. She then continued to say she wasn't cheating and that they were only friends I ignored her. Then came the day afterwards, I was stupid and willing to her another chance to explain things, she said she'd meet me but later and that she loved me and wasnt cheating. So being my nosey self I rummaged through my previous texts which I luckily didnt delete yet, to find the guy she's datings number. I called, he answered and I instantly asked ""Are you in a relationship with x?"" he answers yes. and up until that point I was driving myself insane and when the answer came I was slightly relieved... But I'm depressed over it still . She keeps texting me she loves me... and so far I've ignored her for the past 2 days. Admittedly I wasn't the best boyfriend in the year prior to this, due to getting frustrated at how she constantly accused me of cheating (which I have NEVER done) and these past few days I've just keep wondering what would of happened if I did this, if I had done that. 

I know I'll get over this, and that time heals all wounds blah blah blah... But I really needed to vent this. And I'm sure not many people will read this. I know what I should do to get over this even quicker, by going out with friends and meeting new people which I am to some extent. However in the next three weeks I'll have to be in hospital by myself for 3 weeks due to bone marrow transplant and I know that those 3 weeks I'll be depressed again because I'll have too much spare time to myself...  

Basically; Suicidal mum, Cancer, girlfriend cheated.

1gq8oo,3,2013-06-20,Resources for a therapist helping male teenagers,HookersInMyHouse,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1gq8oo/resources_for_a_therapist_helping_male_teenagers/,"Hey all. I am a therapist intern at a local mental health agency and the majority of my clients are adolescent males. I have noticed that often times the issues my clients will bring up in session are related to gender norms, roles, and ideals. As a guy myself, I feel that I can relate and process many of these issues with them, however it is sometimes difficult for me to articulate. As a therapist, my main responsibility is to help clients navigate difficult life issues without bias. I have noticed that male teens (and even young adults) are struggling with their identities as men and expectations for how they must act to portray being men. This often leads to situations where they are in physical altercations and risk bodily harm without concern for their own safety, they have adopted warped views of women/boundaries/sex, and struggle with basic emotional insight. I want to help these guys by challenging some of these maladaptive, ingrained beliefs so that they can gain insight about positive values of manhood and adopt a wider perspective on the rights afforded to them not only as a male, but as an individual. However, I feel that I need to prepare myself more in order to do so. Can anyone recommend any books that could help or be of use in a therapeutic setting, or just in general? Thanks!"
1gq8kk,0,2013-06-20,[22/f] wondering if the relationship with my fiance [25/m] is only going downhill - should I think about leaving?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gq8kk/22f_wondering_if_the_relationship_with_my_fiance/,"My fiance and I met in college. He was two grades older and we had a long distance relationship for my final two years of school. I just graduated and worked really hard to find a job in the area (which I did, and I love my job). We had originally planned on moving to my hometown, which is in a completely different state, because I had a job offer from an internship I did in college. The only thing I wanted was to be close to my family, but my fiance hates my family and I ended up giving in and finding a job here (6 hours drive away from them). My fiance took a rather dead-end job after his own graduation partly because he wanted to stay relatively close to me while I was in school (we ended up being an hour's drive apart) and partly because he had a garbage major (this he knows and says himself) and he couldn't get a job in this economy with it. 
We work different hours (I have an 8-5 and he's got different shifts), so we hardly get to spend time together. He works most evenings, and I'm already asleep by the time he gets home. He has off Sundays and Tuesdays. Up until last night, I was under the impression that he worked nights on Wednesdays, because he had not come home until the usual time (around 11 or 11:30) the past two weeks. Turns out, he was just having ""guy time"" with two friends at a bar or somewhere. He claims to have told me this, but because I don't really have any friends in the area (being from a different state and all) I take good mental note of any time we could possibly spend together since it is so limited. I don't recall him telling me. Ever. 
Anyway, we just moved in together three weeks ago, and we haven't so far as had dinner or anything to celebrate this ""step"" in our lives. In the past two weeks he's scheduled ""guy time"" twice, and done nothing with me. Am I right in being upset, or am I just being pathetic? 

I've told him before (maybe 2 weeks ago) that there have been points in our relationship that I feel that I'm ""putting more in than I get out"" and he basically just shrugged it off. He comforted me when I was crying about this, but didn't make any effort to understand why I was upset with him. Basically just sat there with a hand on my head, shoulder, etc. until I got sick of crying and just went to sleep. 

This is going to be kind of a long post. Sorry. 
The other day, I bought a Groupon for a restaurant we've always talked about going to, but never have. I sent it to him as a ""gift"". That evening (Tuesday, so he was home) we talked about when we wanted to go. We agreed to do it that weekend. So I went ahead and made a reservation for Sunday at 6:30pm, a regular dinner time, right? I told him that I made it for then, and he says ""Well, I had planned on doing something with * friend * that day. Can you push it to later?"" ....really!???

Also, I learned that his best friend (who currently lives around 10 hours away) is coming to visit in the next week or so. I said I didn't want him to stay with us (we have a 900-sq foot apartment, we don't have a spare room or spare bathroom) because I would like more privacy than that. When I said this, my fiance looked at me and said, ""fuck you, he can stay here, get over it."" If he's spending the money to drive here and visit friends, he can certainly stay with someone who has more space than us or pay for a cheap hotel, right? Honestly, this is the only friend of my fiance's that I don't like. He's lazy and I don't see him accomplishing anything with his life. My fiance says he's ""one of the smartest people he's ever met."" This guy doesn't have a job right now, he doesn't take care of himself physically, and still lives at home. That's not ""smart"" in my opinion. If he really is that smart, (he went to the same university as us, private very expensive liberal arts school) wouldn't he be out there making something of himself? My fiance and this guy play video games and voice chat for at least 2 hours every night, sometimes until 2 or 3 in the morning. Should 25-year-old men be doing that every night? It seems like something a teenager would do. I know I can't dictate who my fiance can have as friends and what his hobbies can be, but how do I make him realize that grown men with real-world responsibilities shouldn't behave that way? 
I worry that if we have kids some day, he'd still behave this way, and put himself, his hobbies, and his friends before me and children. My fiance is a kind and loving person, he's motivated to find a new job and he's self-studying for certifications in the IT field instead of spending the money on school. He's already passed some, and I know he's smart and motivated to get a better job (he hates his current one). I'm a corporate recruiter so I'm well connected and doing everything I can to find him good opportunities. I just don't want to be wasting my time if he's not worth the effort.

Am I being irrational, or is he really putting his friends and his hobbies before me? How do I go about this situation? He's known all of these friends longer than he's known me. Some of them are married, some of them are single. I feel like that as his (maybe) future wife, I should come first in plans/free time at least some of the time. 
Please be honest in your response. I'm not really easily offended, and just want to hear the truth. Thank you!"

I don't know what to do.",NicolasCage421,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gq1zf/24m_me_and_23f_get_along_really_well_but_we_both/,"I met her in a club about 4 months ago. We were both sober and immediately got along really well, talked, danced and made out. We exchanged numbers, she invited me to come visit her. I spent the weekend at her place, we had a great time, had sex and started seeing each other as often as we could. Which wasn't that often, because she lives far away. Since then, we spent 5 whole weekends together and had a great time.

She just graduated and right now she's kind of taking a break and spends her time doing internships all over the country before starting her masters next year. This means that we can't really see each other that often, especially since she's doing a long 5 month internship at the end, which will be a 8 hour drive away from my place.

We already had ""the talk"" and we both agreed that it's better to not start a committed relationship right now, but our reasoning is a little bit different: We both think that it would be weird to jump into a long distance relationship right away, but since we get along so well and have so much fun together, we definitely want to keep seeing each other.

The thing is, I would love to be in a relationship with her, if only she weren't so far away. I know it would be silly to start a relationship at this point, but I'd probably do it anyway if she were ready for it. I know that she really likes me, but she has other issues... her last relationship ended only 6 months ago and -on top of the distance thing- she doesn't feel like she's ready for another relationship at this point (but could definitely see herself being in a relationship with me at some point in the future). 

This would usually be a big red flag for me, but since a relationship is not going to happen *anyway*, I don't know if I should just keep seeing her and have fun, or end it immediately since we're not on the same emotional level and I might end up seriously falling in love with her and get disappointed.

I know that she's trying not to become too attached to me by doing stuff like sometimes forcing herself not to text me (which I think is silly, but w/e). She told me that she wants to prove to herself that she can get along without a partner and that she has sworn to herself that she wouldn't date someone for quite some time - until she met me.

What should I do? End it immediately or keep it going?

**TL;DR: Met girl who lives far away, we both agreed not to have a relationship right away because of distance, plus she doesn't want one because her last relationship wasn't that long ago. I want a relationship in the future. Should I keep seeing her?**"
1goz0g,3,2013-06-19,I'm Completely Lost with This Girl...,Lost2521,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1goz0g/im_completely_lost_with_this_girl/,"This story spans over several years, so I'm going to keep it as short as possible. Scroll down to the bottom for the TLDR. 

I (25M) met this girl (23F) out at a bar two years ago. We hung out a few times, things went well (no sex), but she knew I was moving two hours away to law school within weeks. She sent me a three page ""you're a great guy, but I can't set myself up for a long distance relationship"" text, and that was that. We didn't talk much my first year at law school, but did keep in touch. 

Fast forward a year and a half to last Christmas break, and we saw each other out again. We hit it off great and I told her I was going to be home for the summer (we are from the same hometown). Since that point, we texted each other pretty much daily for about six months. It got to the point that I expected to have a text from her every morning when I woke up. Now we have a million inside jokes, tons of common interests, and really enjoy each other's conversations. 

So then school ended I moved home for my internship. We met out at bars on weekends (not exclusively, but intentionally met out downtown) and had a great time. I asked her to dinner, she said yes. When the date came, however, she said she got called into work. It seemed super suspicious...and unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed. She didn't talk to me for 10 days or so, then texted me and apologized. She said she ""was kind of seeing someone, but not exclusively dating,"" and she was too scared to just cancel on me.

For the first time, I told her how I felt about her. I got everything off my chest (excerpt): ""Do I like you? I have no idea if I do or don't. But I simply continue to believe that if we were to hang out, we could have something special together. That's all.""

She responded positively. She said she kind of felt the same but didn't know what to do with this other guy. She invited me to get drinks just last night. We had a great time. She even said she's never been with a guy that makes her laugh hysterically at one point, then segways to very serious conversations the next. 

Bottom line (TL;DR): we have a ton of common interests, love talking to each other, and always have a great time when we hang out. BUT, she's unofficially with this other guy and I feel like the friend zone is fast approaching for us (if we're not already in it). 

So, the big questions: is there any chance she likes me, and if so, what's my next move?"

I've been getting a lot (recent grad) and thought nothing of it. I go through the ringer with the basic questions, obviously impressing the guy. This isn't my first rodeo and I was getting to the question that I hate, ""What was your GPA in college?"" For my field (software engineering) it's not the impressive. I worked full time and had to leave in the middle of a semester due to a bad car crash. 

I said proudly, like I usually do, "" I was able to maintain a 2.8 while working full time."" 9/10 times it follows with more questions, usually wanting to know I if I was a slacker. But this shumck said,"" Sorry, but we don't consider anyone under a 3.0"" and hung up on me. 

Fuck you asshole, you don't know what I can do. If you looked at my portfolio you would see that I clearly know what I am doing. And like I just told you a moment ago I am in an internship right now, so I'm not some idiot. Screw you, I hope you go out of business. Asshole."
1gtqwi,1,2013-06-21,22F and 22M having trouble with summer long distance,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gtqwi/22f_and_22m_having_trouble_with_summer_long/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 10 months and so far, things have been amazing. We've only had small issues (in my opinion) and when we do, we usually talk about them and get them resolved pretty quickly. Small issues being, me being very awkward when talking about love and a future together (marraige, kids, etc) even when joking and him telling little white lies like doing some chore or homework. We've both recognized these and I feel like I've made great improvements while he's only slightly fixed his lying with just admitting to it immediately if I confront him. But anyways, just to give you an idea of the small isues we deal with. No problems with severe jealousy, cheating, etc. We're both very respectful and considerate of each other. 

This summer, I am on the other side of the country from him doing an internship. He is back in our college town taking a couple of classes. We started the summer being as honest as possible about what we expected and needed as far as communication. We both have had bad long distance relationships in the past and we wanted to avoid it as much as possible. I'll freely admit that I was definitely the one being more outspoken and direct about setting up expectations and a ""plan"". And so far, we've video-chatted at least twice a week and we text good morning and good night. Most days we still have long texting conversations during the day but we both understand when the other is busy with something.

Things have gone great for the last month up until this week. We were really learning how to talk to each other deeper than we ever had before. We had/have a very physical relationship and so skype sex was pretty regular and we would sext each other almost everyday. 

Then this week, we had a really deep conversation on Sunday night about our future together. These are things that have kind of been bubbling under the surface since the beginning of the Summer. And I know that he has had as much pressure as I have about figuring out what to do after graduation. Since I am probably going to get a full-time offer from the company I have my internship with and we both graduate next May. He has not had any internships and is actually struggling with getting his classes under control (we both had terrible Spring semesters and our GPAs dropped significantly). He is currently retaking 2 courses and I know for a fact that he isn't doing well in them. I have access to his email since I help him organize once in a while and he has given me free rein to check it. I haven't in the past but he told me Sunday that he's getting an A in one class and a B in the other... So I just wanted to make sure since we've had problems with him telling lies about his classes in the past. He's getting D+'s in both classes. 

Now I realize that his grades are for him and him alone. I have told him multiple times that I only want him to be happy and he is going to school for himself. Not for me, not for his mom, just him. Yet he still lies to me about his classes and only when I confront him directly does he tell me the truth. I was 100% honest when I was struggling with my classes in the Spring and when I got my final grades, I told him right away. He supported me and did a great job encouraging me for the next semester. And he didn't tell me that he had done just as bad until weeks after the semester ended and I was leaving for my internship. I told him that I still loved him and I would support him no matter what. When I asked him if he didn't tell me because he thought I would react badly, he said no and that he knew I would have been supportive no matter what. So I had trouble understanding why lie at all. It seems like such a knee-jerk reaction with him and I have no clue how to fix it or how to encourage him to.

But I'm wandering off topic. So we had this very serious and frank discussion where we both admitted to feeling the pressure to decide something now about if we were going to stay together after graduate. And we were both in agreement that we're going to wait until the summer is over and we're living together, see how our classes are going (since we both need to have good grades to make up for the Spring) and I officially have my full-time offer in hand. 

So we had this great talk, and the next day we kept texting each other how relieved and great we felt (he initiated in the morning). So I had a silly smile on my face for most of the day. Now since I had some things going on this week and so did he, we didn't get a chance to video-chat until last night. We texted everyday still, maybe not as in-depth as normal but I wasn't really worried. 

Then last night, we made a date to play some board games online. And even though he is a very quiet person to most everyone else, since the beginning of our relationship, he's always been chatty with me and talks quite a bit! Yet last night he was so quiet and I asked him if anything was troubling him and he said no. Yet I pressed again because usually he'll lie at first until I basically tell him that I can tell. And the only thing he would tell me is that he just felt ""off"". So I told him that it was okay and that if he needed anything, I'll be here for him. He told me he loved me and we said good night.

Then this morning, I called him like normal (I call and wake him up for class in the morning) and he was very quiet. So I just told him to have a good day and I'll talk to him later (just like every other morning). We said I love you's and hung up. Then a couple of hours later, I shot him a text of something funny and while it usually takes him a while to respond (couple of hours at most and I never mind the delay), he never texted back. So I texted him this afternoon with the conversation below...

Me: is there anything going on you want to talk about babe? you seem pretty distant... 

BF: No babe im sorry i dont want to seem distant ugh im sorry im trying 

Me: no don't be sorry :) i just wanted you to know that there's an open line to me if you need it. i'm not trying to make you pretend things are fine or anything

BF: Ok i am still sorry though i dont want you to feel that im distant i love you

Me: i love you too, you know how much i do. i just want you to be happy and i'm more than willing to let you figure that out if you need to

And he never texted back. For hours I waited for something and his roommate texted me asking to pay the electric bill (My BF and his friend are living in our apartment for the Summer) since he was with my BF and they needed to go pay it. I have no clue why my BF wouldn't text me himself. 

So I'm worried but I feel like asking him and/or telling him how I feel will just fuel the flame of whatever is bothering him. So my current idea is perhaps to let him be distant for the weekend (since we usually don't talk as much Fridays/Saturdays due to hanging with friends) and on Sunday, when we usually video-chat a lot and kind of spend the day together, if he's still backing off, ask him about it. 

So I guess the advice that I'm looking for is what is other people's experience with long distance. Is this pretty common to go through a lull? I know he misses me and I have no fear of him cheating. He's living in our apartment and his friends are all good guys who like me a lot. Should I ask him now or wait it out? I usually feel so open with him but I feel like I've pressed a little and he's kind of retreated more so now I'm unsure as to what to do. I don't want this to spiral downward until I can't reach him anymore.

TL;DR Boyfriend of 10 months is acting distant lately and I'm unsure whether to weather the storm or ask him about it now? "

So please, roll your curves into a comfortable position whilst I regale you with a tale from my past.  
  
  
  


Many moons ago, in the days when the Supersize menu still shone like bacon...err—a *beacon* of hope, I found myself in an internship I had never dreamed I would one day have. Of course, this was not because of the prestige that went along with it, but rather due to it being absolutely nothing like what I imagined it would be.   
  

  

In the third year of my bachelor’s degree in linguistics I fell upon hard times financially. Since I was jobless and had been funding myself through grants and scholarships thus far, I had to venture into the proverbial deep-end to find a job—lest I find myself behind the counter of a gas station again. As I had vowed to myself to never let such a fate befall me ever again, I tried alternate means. This, of course boiled down to me eventually guilt-tripping a professor friend of mine to help me get an internship.

My search finally ended when I got accepted at the local job center in my university’s city. For those of you who do not know, a job center is essentially at its most basic level, a place where jobless and often uneducated or disabled folks go to seek employment opportunities through the state—think a government sponsored temp agency.

As an intern, my job was simple—or so they said. I would call out the next name on the sign-in list we had, call them back into my make-shift ‘office,’ and interview them to see if they qualified for any work programs or job opportunities we currently had available.

This interview process was ultimately a series of yes/no questions and questions regarding their job history and skill (or lack thereof) in certain areas. Also on this list were questions regarding their physical abilities and disabilities (I’m sure you can see where this is going). 

Of course, being the not-so-jaded younger me that I was, I figured this would be a walk in the park—I mean getting paid to ask questions…what could go wrong? Right?

**Wrong.**

I found out quickly that there was a very real and valid reason they gave the intern this job—and it wasn’t because it was the ‘simplest’ job, as they had advertised it to me on my first day. And, after the first few that I was walked through by a coworker, I was on my own.

At this point, I will apologize for the length of the introduction—but I felt without proper context that these stories would largely lose their weight.

However, I will further preface this with a rough estimation of my being at this point in my life. During my time at the center I was on my university’s track team and was working out 6~ days a week, and was visibly ‘in-shape’ (6’0’’, ~185lbs). 

Of the literal thousands of people that I interviewed there during my 2 ½ year tenure at the center, only a few stick out in my memory—these are their tales.



It was a cool September day, the type of day that sucks energy out of you faster than a double-wide straw on a fatty’s cola. I had overslept and thus missed class that morning, so being the studious me that I was I showed up at work a few hours early—little did I know the landmine I had just stepped on as I opened the doors and stepped inside.

I took my things to my ‘office,’ and went about setting up for the day. Some ten or so minutes later, I went up front to call my first ‘client’ back for the day. A short man who had fallen on hard times when the factory he worked at his entire life had fallen under—a sad story, but business as usual.

After clearing a few more people through my queue, I went back for the last one I would take before I planned on taking my lunch break (It was almost noon by this point). As I peered down at the list of names, my peripheral vision alerted me to a mass of flesh gyrating off to the far left of the waiting room. My eyes, as if mesmerized by the waves of the sirens of lore, were drawn to (what I would soon find out was a) her. She was sitting with her bottom strewn across the groaning supports of 3 fold out chairs—a feat which I had never seen accomplished before this.

Now we, like any other social service, see all types of people—slim, fat, tall, short, black, white, etc., etc. But, this was different—I had never seen such a monster with my own eyes. After a few seconds, I managed to return my focus to the paper in front of me and stared at the name whilst whispering a silent prayer that she wasn’t the person I was about to call.

Many times, like any other time strangers are forced to pronounce another stranger’s name from a sheet, I butchered names. Normally, I would just laugh it off with the person and it wouldn’t matter—this time was different.

“Sorry, I’m probably going to butcher this but, Shady-nasty.” (I tried my best to pronounce it, but honestly I’m bad with ‘modern’ names). 

“BOY YUH BEH TRIPPUN’ IT’S SHA-DYNASTY (highly different split in word order).”

I realized at this point what I had said, due to the distraction of her size I had managed to not only mispronounce her name, but totally masticate it in the process—she wasn’t impressed. However, the rest of the room exploded in stifled laughter and hysterics.

The lumbering beast raised her mass with what can only be described as a mastery of the principles of physics, propulsion and inertia. The cheaply made fold-chairs were cast to the ground like fallen soldiers in her wake, and with extremely labored breathing she made her way towards me. 

After what seemed like an eternity, she finally found herself upon the threshold of my pseudo-office.

“YUR DOOR SIZE AIN’T UP TUH CODE, I’M DISABLED AN NEED BIG DOORS, I THOUGHT DIS WUZ A GOVERNMENT BUILDIN.”

“Well mam, I have no control over the door size, but if you can’t fit we can always do the interview back out in the lobby…”

Her beady eyes burned with the heat of a thousand McDonald’s deep-fryers as she spat out, “YUH SAYIN I’M FAT!?”

“No, I was just attempting to accommodate your special needs, here at the job center we attempt to make it useful and accessible to everyone.”

Instantly relief washed over what I still to this day assume was her face, “OH, GUD—BUT I CAN FIT!”

Crisis averted—or so I thought. She proceeded to ram herself sideways through the doorway; I could feel the pressure in the room changing as her fat sealed a vacuum with the walls—breathing was getting harder.

Finally, she managed to leverage herself through and cast her entire weight upon MY chair—I watched in horror as she contorted her fat more impressively than the contortions of the Cirque du Soleil people. 

Oh well—I took the seat designated for her, and took out my clipboard. But before I had even had a chance to look up she had already opened the black hole storage system of her purse and dumped out a half-eaten bucket of KFC onto her lap (I wish I were kidding). 

I politely cleared my throat and said, “Um mam….could you please refrain from eating during the interview…it won’t take but 10-15 minutes at most.”

Beetus meltdown in T-minus 3……….2………….1

“YUH SKINNEH PEOPLE ER ALL DUH SAME! I GOT NEEDS YUH KNO, IT’S MUH DISABILITY” she howled.

At this point, I was getting rather hungry myself (it was well past noon by now) and I could tell this was going nowhere fast, so I decided to go on the offensive.

“Well, if you really are disabled then that severely limits the possibility of us being able to place you in a job—and as you don’t have a visible handicap may I see your doctor’s verification of your disability please?” 

We had had so many people attempt to scam us by saying they were ‘disabled’ and then demand the easy ‘handicapped accessible’ jobs (which we had VERY few slots for) so they didn’t have to do real work that we required a signed document from a doctor verifying their ‘disability.’

Needless to say, Shadynasty had no such paper, and I had been banking on this.

“YUH CAN SEE MURH DISABILITY THOUGH!” she moaned, between bites of KFC drumstick. 

This is what I had been waiting for.

“I’m sorry, I really can’t” I said as I was fighting back the urge to grin impishly, “Unless of course you are trying to make the case that your size **is** your disability, mam.”

Her face immediately contorted into an expression that I could only infer meant the two remaining neurons in her beetus addled brain were desperately attempting to find one another to create a cohesive thought. 

They failed.

“MUH SIZE AIN’T NO DISABILITY, I’M A REEL WOMYNZ—YUH ER JUST TOO DUMB TO APPRECIATE MUH VOLUTUOUSNESS,” she spit at me with an air of utter triumph—she thought she had told me.

“Well you are a real woman, but you also just admitted your size isn’t a handicap—thus I can only offer you a few physical jobs that we have openings for at the moment. I would be more than happy to recommend you to any of them,” I said as calmly as I could.

“NO, I CAN’T WORK MUH DISABILITY I CANT SIT HURTS LEGS YUH ANOREXIC FAT SHAMER!” (of course this line of obscenities went on much longer, but I’ll spare you all the misery of trying to make sense out of her inane ramblings). 

At this point, she had gotten up and was shaking a chicken wing at me like a flail and was threatening me to give her a disabled job.

“IF YUH DUN’T RECOMMEND MEH, I GOT FRIENDS WHO WILL KILL UR ANOREXIC ASS, YOU BETTER NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT I GOT PEOPLE!” she howled, in the true song of her people.

Finally, a chance to use the panic button—I had been waiting for so long. The office has a button under the desk that allows you to call in the police security officers from the front of the building where the metal detector is. As this is a government facility offering help to many unstable people, the guards take their job seriously.

As I pressed the button, a rush of satisfaction washed over my being…I now knew what it must have felt like to launch a nuclear warhead.

“DON’T YUH TURN UR BACK ON MEH, I’M TALKIN TO UR DUMBASS, YOU STUP—“

Two guards had bust in and one had tackled her before she (or I) even knew what was happening. To this day, I have never seen such a beautiful sight pass before my eyes. In almost real-life slow-motion her many layers of jiggle and girth wrapped around the officer as he drove her frame to the ground with strength Hercules himself would have ‘mired. Perhaps the best part was the chicken—as she was flying towards the ground, her bucket of chicken and its contents were flying around the room as if they no longer had weight now that they had escaped her gravitational field.

As she fought and wriggled on the ground, like a bloated earth worm about to be squished the officer put her in handcuffs and arrested her on the spot and walked her out of the room as I thanked them for helping me.

As I went about tiding up the ‘office,’ I noticed that it was only half past noon—I still had 30 minutes for lunch left. So I got in my car and headed towards the KFC down the road—I had worked up quite the appetite for some of the Colonel’s finest.



Once again, sorry about the length—but I really wanted to get the full girth of the story across. I hope you enjoyed the read and I will be putting a few of my other experiences up in the days to come!

**TL;DR – The Colonel’s finest original recipe chicken reaches escape velocity when landwhale is taken down after becoming enraged that she was outsmarted by an “anorexic” man.**

1gsywp,4,2013-06-21,"Film School: Yes or no? And if not, then what?",[deleted],Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1gsywp/film_school_yes_or_no_and_if_not_then_what/,"I've seen a lot of sidebar conversations, comments, etc. on here that are either for or against film school.  I just wanted to make a few points to the budding filmmakers.

I went to film school.  I can say both good and bad about it.  BUT, if you're going to say ""fuck film school,"" -- you need to be prepared to do the work yourself.  You can't just go out there and make a movie because you have a 5D.  Trust me.  I tried.  There needs to be more of an emphasis on study as well.  Not just practice.  That is if you want to make some actually good films.  So here is where film school succeeds in my opinion:

* Making connections.  Peers, internships, jobs.
* Getting on sets.  The best experience you'll get.  Definitely better than the classroom if you want to be on the production side of things.
* Forced to create --&gt; forced to sit in a room and listen while your peers tear your (amazing) work to shreds
* Trial and error.
* Access to movies, scripts, literature

That goes with saying that film school is all about what you put into it and how you navigate getting what you want out of it.  For me personally, I was 18, and just wanted to enjoy college, so I didn't do the most intense academic study of film until I graduated.  That is really where I would like to make a recommendation to those eschewing film school.

* Read film criticism of the movies you watch.  Learn how they did what they did.  Learn how ideas are visualized, what they mean, and how they were, or were not, successful.

* PTA did an interview with Charlie Rose where he talked about the 1 day he spent at NYU's film school.  He hated it, and he had a recommendation on the curriculum, and I thought it was brilliant.  Instead of starting the curriculum with the beginnings of film history (because it often times can be boring trying to talk to college students about Battleship Potemkin &amp; Ozu, in a way that will be relatable) professors should start with contemporary cinema, and then go backwards.  So you can start with a movie like The Big Lebowski, and then talk about the Coen Bros. and from whom they referenced, and then keep going backwards.

* Learn how the best director's made the films you love to watch, and then go backwards.  And be RELENTLESS on watching movies, building your database of references, read anything and everything you can.  Cast the net as wide as you can.

* Go out and make movies.  You will make bad ones for awhile, but the great thing is that we're here to tell you that, and to tell you where to fix your mistakes, how to fix them, and to keep going.

* Be better than those making movies now.  Shoot for the fucking moon, because making movies is a beautiful career, but it's extremely difficult.  So be hard on yourselves, and those you work with.

* Surround yourself with people/collaborators who are more talented/experienced than you.  Let yourself learn from others.

* Read.  Everything.  Watch.  Everything.  We're lucky to live in a time period where almost everything is accessible.  Inside the Actor's studio is amazing.  Interviews are amazing.  Looking up director's and watching extended interviews with them is really eye opening.  I also highly recommend r/TrueFilm

* Here's one for the directors:  If you want to be an actor's director, learn how to act before you can direct an actor.  For example, if you took a course on acting for the camera, you'll pick up a new language on speaking with actors.  Really some of the best advice someone ever gave me.  Get inside their heads as people, and you'll be able to talk to actors on a whole new level.

Anyways, from those of you who went the film school/no film school route, what advice can you give?"

So I've posted several times about my predicament with a specific ex-boss not paying me. Well, here I am, almost July, still have not seen a single cent of the 1600EUR he owes me. So I'd like to give a friendly warning to everyone I can to avoid him and his company like the plague and not to work for him.

Silverio Park is the head of Azubu Interactive GmbH which is registered in Berlin. Now, this Azubu is not to be confused with Azubu Europe AG (the Azubu that is very well known in the eSports world, though at one point in time when I was working there they were connected). He hired me as an intern, I signed a contract stating I would be paid 400EUR each month for 6 months and I have yet to see 4 months of that pay.

On top of not paying me (which I have been very friendly and professional about, sending out Mahnungs and trying to give him plenty of time), he never reported my income to the government, therefore committing some fraud of his own (he never paid the social security on me to the government). He works in Hamburg as well as Berlin, so I will be x-posting this over there as well.

Just avoid this man at all cost. Don't work for him, don't work with him. I'm beginning the process of suing him for my missing salary, which will hopefully get me my money in at least 6 months because I can't afford a lawyer to help me out.

Hope that this little PSA was of some use and saves someone else the headache that I've gone through."
1gs877,0,2013-06-21,I'm having trouble with my female roommate and one of my good friends/ crush.,what2do321,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1gs877/im_having_trouble_with_my_female_roommate_and_one/,"Well, here goes. I would like some advice please from a guy's perspective.

Basically, I share an apartment with two girls. I have my own bedroom, but nonetheless live with two other girls. One of the girls, lets call her June, has been increasingly bothering me. It all originally started because she is extremely stingy, close-minded, and hypocritical. Despite this, I still got a long with her, but more recently she really has started to bothered me, especially in regards to my crush.

The first incident occurred was when Paul came to visit me and some friends. I ended up getting a little too drunk and put myself to bed early. The next day, I had a few missed calls from Paul when I woke up. Paul had also texted June to see if I was all right. When I went to see Paul and my other friends up once I woke up, they basically all asked me if June had a boyfriend because she was being pretty flirty with Paul. Paul asked for her number because he thought she was interested. When I told her this, she claimed she didn't hit on him and that it was SOO awkward blah blah (mind you, she has a boyfriend). She knows I liked him and claims she wasn't flirting with him at all. Nonetheless, she kept texting him first. After he left, she texted him to tell him he left his contact solution even though I literally talk to him every other day. She kept claiming she wasn't hitting on him and never intended it.

Well, Paul decides to live in the same city as I do for summer with a couple of our friends. Since Paul has gotten here a few days ago, Paul has been coming over to see me every night. Night one, Paul comes over and she immediately starts talking to him excessively. Her boyfriend is just silently staring. I just felt entirely left out and annoyed by the situation, so I went to bed. He eventually noticed I left and went home thereafter.

The next night, he texts me to come over to use my kitchen. I tell him it's cool as long as he cleans because June is back and she's anal. She starts doing the same exact thing all over again. I went to my room for a bit to finish up some work and when I come back she's still chattering away. I ask Paul if he wants to stay to smoke or get ice cream and he tells me he's probably heading home. Coincidentally, my other friend, Josh calls me and asks me to hang out. I tell Josh to come over whenever he's free and I'll be available. Paul realizes I'm about to hang out with someone else and suddenly he ignores my room mate to talk to me again

Paul ends up deciding he wants to get ice cream with me, so we go. Paul is being super nice the entire time. He keeps asking how he can make it up to me for flaking on plans we have this weekend because his parents are visiting. He says we should go see a movie and grab dinner before. He tells me he's going to miss me when I leave back home and I should stay living up here longer (my internship ends earlier). Most of all though, he brings up my room mate June though. He asks if everything is fine with her, especially because of the kitchen because he didn't want to create tension. He wanted to make sure I was fine and there weren't any problems there. Anyways, he ended up coming back to my place and hanging out alone with me in my room until my friends showed up. 


Anyways, I don't really know what to do. My room mate June is already bothering me for unrelated reasons and her behavior towards Paul is really starting to annoy me. She claims she isn't hitting on him when she clearly is right in front of me. Every time I bring him over, she tries to talk to him the entire time. If I go anywhere with him, she always wants to come too. Paul is obviously my friend of years and knows I'm getting annoyed with her, but he's kind of put in an awkward situation.
I'm not even sure if Paul likes me, but we hang out a lot. What should I do about my room mate and Paul?

1gs499,27,2013-06-21,"My ""father"".",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gs499/my_father/,"I just need to tell this story to *someone* because I never talk about it. Someone asked me the other day, and it made me realize how little I talk about it.

I'm 31 years old as of Monday. My parents got divorced when I was seven.

I remember when they got divorced. My mom and I went to the grocery store and she let me buy anything I wanted. Cookies, candy, toys, cookie dough, nothing was off limits. I remember thinking how weird that was, but I thought nothing of it because I was seven. Then my mom asked me if I wanted McDonald's. Sweet! Happy Meal!

My mom told me in the McDonald's parking lot that she had left my dad and we were going to her new house. Without my dad. He was in NYC at the the time, and I couldn't figure out why things were happening without him.

We moved into our new house, and suddenly my dad wasn't around. We were supposed to play golf together, he was supposed to be at my baseball games, he was supposed to be there.

But my dad was a multimillionaire. He was 36, single, driving his Ferrari, and going home to his 5,000 square foot house. He was taking private planes and sitting down for dinner with my idols. He suddenly had no time for a son. It wasn't convenient.

As I grew older he was in my life again. I was a three sport letterman in high school, I was taking AP classes, I was the son he wanted. He bought me a car, he suddenly was there for me. I was the ideal son. The one that made him look even better.

He always told me that I could go to ASU or DU. If I got accepted to either he would pay. I got accepted to both and chose DU so I could stay close. I even got an academic scholarship. And he disappeared, again. My multimillionaire dad suddenly didn't have a dime for college.

My academics were paid for through my scholarships, and I paid everything else through student loans. Not bad, but the little things add up quickly. Room, board, food, etc. I graduated and suddenly my dad was there again, promising to pay for my law school.

He didn't, not that I was surprised.

I got through law school, with a lot of help from my mom. She makes good money, but nothing close to what my dad makes. She actually paid my rent for 6 months when I had an unpaid internship. Most amazing mom ever.

Anyway, I got out of law school and got a great job. Suddenly my dad was around again, telling me how proud he was of me. He was retired at that point. Playing golf at the country club, traveling,  enjoying life. Suddenly he was proud of me.

We had a ""relationship"" after that. I joined his country club, we played golf, had beers together, all that. We were suddenly ""close"", but we weren't father-son, we were friends. 

My mom is remarried, and I consider my step dad more of a dad than my real dad.

Back to the point,  my dad was suddenly trying. I had a son and he was buying everything for him. He was around all the time. He bought my son clothes, toys, everything. I'd buy him something and my dad was upset that he couldn't buy it.

But I still resented him and didn't understand why. Why are you providing so much for your grandson that you didn't do for me? Why are you so intent to provide my son? It makes me upset that you suddenly feel like you should be in his life. You weren't in my life. You abandoned me. Why are you trying so hard?

Then I found out my dad had cancer.

My dad died two months ago. I treated him horribly for the last year of his life. I'm crying as I type this.

My son won't remember his grandfather. He just turned three. But I know he loved him. You could always see it in his eyes. When grandpa was around he just lit up.

Thank you dad. I idolized you. I'm successful because I needed to live up to you. You weren't a great dad in the traditional sense, but you shaped me into the person I am today.

Your grandson loved you to death. He smiled every time he saw you.

I love you dad. We weren't close. But I miss you so fucking much.

I had to get it off my chest because I never tell anyone. I never talk about it. Thank you for the chance.

Love you dad.

**TL;DR love your parents. You will miss them so much when they're gone**"

I never felt that way. I only took 2 AP classes in high school, had a 3.8 weighted GPA, and somehow got into one of the top notch and well known university in the US for engineering. My parents were proud, but I was actually surprised to have gotten in.

My cumulative GPA was 2.7 by the time I graduated (and had a 3.2 major GPA ). All my friends had incredible grades. I didn't have any experience with work, never did internship, and I somehow got into the master program even though my writing in the GRE was below the requirement. Nonetheless, family and friends were amazed that I was going to get a Master's in engineering.

Throughout the year, all my graduate friends were finding incredible jobs left and right, and I was unable to seal the deal by the time I got my advanced degree. I had a 3.3 GPA, while all my peers had 3.7-4.0 GPA. I was desperate, so I settled down with a job that was half the pay as my peers.

But I was able to leave that job after a year because I was offered a much better job at a well known aerospace company. People are proud and impressed, but I just feel so lucky. I wouldn't have gotten the job if my friend, who already works there, referred me when there was an opening. I don't know how I can be so lucky throughout my life. I have been a lazy bastard since middle school. All I wanted to do was play games, and not study. I don't feel I deserve this. I still feel like an underachiever even at this incredible company.

I am very thankful, though. That I had made it to here. Now I have a chance to show myself that I am worthy of this position and worthy to work at this prestigious company. I just hope I don't fail because I have never been a hard worker. It is hard to stay motivated for me and the people around me are the ones who impress me the most. They are the most dedicated people I have ever seen. I feel that I can never achieve what they have already done. I don't feel the motivation, but I will give myself a try."
1grv4l,5,2013-06-20,Eating disorder recovery and running. Advice appreciated.,castedncrutches,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1grv4l/eating_disorder_recovery_and_running_advice/,"I've been bulimic for about 7 years now, and this past fall started seriously working on my recovery after running too much too soon after foot surgery gave me an awful stress fracture in my left foot. Something clicked, and I realized that running while injured to lose weight isn't helping me out at all, and it's just going to make running harder in the future. The end goal is to be able to eat right, not throw up and love running again like I did when I was in high school. I know I probably won't be as fast as I was, but I just want to have a be a relief, and fun, and not something that causes me anxiety.

After taking about 6 serious months off from running, I've focused on stopping the purging, and working on liking me and eating enough and for the right reasons. I feel like I've made some progress here, I'm happy in my body and like where I'm at.

The problem comes now that I haven't thrown up in almost 3 months (which is a pretty big fucking deal after going 7 years of purging at least 5 times a week, I'm not a binger), I have started running again. I don't run with my watch because I'll be disappointed if I run to slow even if I ran the fastest I've run that route before. I just go out and run whatever I feel like doing, and finally I feel like I've found some peace. But then I start second guessing myself, and I don't know if I'm eating enough between starting running again and my new internship where I'm on my feet and walking around all day. I feel so tired most of the time, and get a little dizzy if I stand up too quickly.

I guess I'm just super scared that I've done all this work for nothing and that I'm not making any progress because I still get dizzy. I feel like I'm eating a lot of healthy and nutritious foods without being so health conscious that it's obsessive. I'm scared that I'm not eating enough, but also scared to have to make some more increases to my meal plan.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, or have advice on what I could do to continue my progress of recovery and start to learn to love running again?"

the first two weeks were great, as i spent most of the day with the same chill intern. he had us do almost all his scutwork, but it was valuable practice for intern year actually, and it made it easier to follow the patients when i was the one writing notes and getting consults all day. he showed us how to do everything - notes, orders, look up imaging, consults - and thanked us for our help.

now we are spending every other day with two different residents, who now have to do Q2 since that chill intern is gone. neither of them are happy about it but one of them is really going out of her way to make our lives miserable. the first day working with her we told her we had no problem writing all the notes. then when we didn't have them done by the time she wanted (previously unspecified) she assumed it was because we were having trouble getting them done, and complained about us to the attending after we left. he now thinks we were ""overwhelmed"" by the work cut back on a lot of what we were previously responsible for.

if i try to do something for her and she doesn't like the way i've done it, she assumes it's because i'm an idiot and reams me out for it in front of everyone. on the other hand, if i try to stay out of her way and just focus on my 1-2 patients, invariably she'll come over and start giving me grief for NOT having done something. i'm damned if i do, damned if i don't.

she's like a dark storm cloud on my mood, and makes me incredibly anxious. i tip toe around her all day. then she'll make some passive aggressive comment, or talk to me like an idiot, or roll her eyes when i try to tell her something, and i'll get all worked up again. i'll finally calm down and find something useful to do, just focus on my patients, and before i know it she's coming out of nowhere to ruin my day again. even the battle-hardened ICU nurses are on edge, and are telling me to tell her things for them, because as one told me, ""i don't want her to think i'm bugging her and have her roll her eyes at me again."" at least it's not just me. 

i know this is a long rant but i had to get it out. thought i might as well use this as an opportunity to start a bitchfest and hear everyone else's worst resident stories. i know you've got some.

tldr: my resident not only sucks, but is sabotaging all the hard work i've done to make a good impression on my attendings. i'm dreading going to work tomorrow cuz i know she's going to interrupt me during rounds and try to make me look stupid again :("

I'd be willing to take a paid internship to get my feet in the door or a full time position if my education and experience fit a need. 

I understand the accounting standards are different and qualifications are required that can take several years to achieve. My long term goal is to acquire ACA, CIMA or ACCA qualifications.

1gvomn,1,2013-06-22,A few questions...,calterun,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gvomn/a_few_questions/,"Sup guys.

I just started work as an intern in IT and contrary to popular belief we do a bunch of heavy lifting. We lift tons of CRT monitors (35+ lbs) and computers (25 lbs) daily and it has been killing my back. The work itself isn't too hard but I am getting some annoying upper back pain (probably as a result of my lifting technique). Normally when I lift from the ground I use my legs, but things that are on desk level are VERY uncomfortable to pick up using legs. Would it be helpful to do some back exercises specifically in addition to my regular routine?A

On an unrelated note, I think I have extremely weak forearms. I can bust out 10 pull ups consistently, with a max of about 18 on a good day - but I can *barely* eek out 2 towel grip pull ups without some crazy pain in the forearms. I was checking my grip against my buddies and his was at least twice as strong without him exerting that much effort (on that note, he does have 50 pounds on me - still pretty significant though). I have tried fingertip push ups and I cannot form the ""tiger claw"" to save my life; my fingers always ending up going straight or bending concave out - which seems to be grinding the joints up more than making me strong.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - [Infinity table w/ raspberry pi](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1ec2ux/my_roommates_and_i_built_an_infinity_table_for/), [super-fly kegerator build](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1c6r1m/my_old_kegerator_broke_and_this_is_my_replacement/), and [a SWEET treehouse](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1f7dru/it_was_about_time_for_a_treehouse_beginning_to/).

&gt;##3. Do you have any ongoing projects at the moment?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - I have been working on a Geocache that has been extremely frustrating, I've built it three times already and I'm still not completely happy with it. It's turning out to be a perpetual project.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Trying to get my cat to stop licking my face while I sleep.

&gt;##4. Why DIY? Can't you just buy what you're making instead?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - Sometimes it is more practical and cheaper to buy something instead of making it yourself, in those cases it just makes sense to buy that product. Most of my projects are not things that you can just buy at a store though, so I need to build them myself.
There is also a great satisfaction that comes from taking a project from idea to completion; especially when it's a difficult build.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Real men build things.

&gt;##5. What types of projects are commonly posted on /r/DIY? What types of projects are less common that you would love to see more of?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - It seems to me that the most commonly posted projects to /r/diy are refurbish/restoration types. There's also an unending supply coffee table builds.
I really do love all the diy projects submitted to this sub (as long as they follow the submission guidelines and offer a detail of the build process). For me there is a real satisfaction in watching a project unfold.
I would really like to see more projects with an artistic touch. Although I enjoy seeing builds like sheds, decks, and kitchen remodels, I'd really like to see more unique projects like the infinity table or even more cool quilts.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Definitely right now there's a summer trend of decks, backyard stuff, planters, etc. Things I don't see enough of are car restoration. There's a few but not enough IMO.

&gt;##6. If you were able to spend any amount of money on a single project, what would you make?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - A street legal go-cart

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - A pool from a hole in my backyard

&gt;##7.Is the community in this subreddit different from the rest of reddit?

&gt;&gt;**freeseasy** - I think it is. It seems as if the subscribers of /r/diy really care about keeping the sub true to its purpose. Submissions that don't follow the guidelines frequently get downvoted and reported. Spam posts die a quick and miserable death in /r/diy.

&gt;&gt;**roastedbagel** - Id say yes, the majority of the comments are people being helpful and complimentative. That's hard to find these days in subs with 100k+ people.


Now you might be thinking to yourself, ""Who is this guy? Why is he here? Why am I listening to some guy who used to be good? Why isn't he good anymore?"". Well luckily for you, I am here to answer some of those questions (although you may never know how or why I used to be good). 

I am a new intern here at SROTD who is relatively new to reddit as a whole. I mostly browse the larger subreddits, but love finding small ones too, especially if they have unusual topics. I currently am a college student going into my third year as a comp sci major and somehow ended up doing some writing between semesters. Hopefully you guys will enjoy my articles; I look forward to featuring some great subreddits while I'm here.

See you next time!"
1gxn3p,24,2013-06-23,My last month at my retail job (Part 1),aurelia_55,TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gxn3p/my_last_month_at_my_retail_job_part_1/,"I've worked for a big retail store (The Fast, Fun, and Friendly Store, or FFF Store) for the past nine years. I started there when I was sixteen, worked my way through high school and college, and this past December I finally graduated with my Bachelor's. I got recently got a job in my field of study (teaching) and have given my bosses notice that I would be leaving for good.

Because of this, I decided to stop putting up with the crazy bullshit that happens daily to me and other employees. I decided that I would be a lot less miserable if I started standing up for myself. These are some stories that I have from this past week, in which I tell customers, bosses, and other employees to stop being dicks.

I work in one of the food departments in this department store. We sell a lot of snack food as well as pizzas and pastas. Because of this, there is a lot of food prep in the morning. The mornings are our busiest time because we have to prep for the entire day as well as the next day. Because we're a ""snack bar"" people assume that we're not really doing anything if we aren't busy with customers, and those people are usually other employees that work in other parts of the store. They bring their stuff up to us and ask us to ring them up. This is really annoying because we're running around, trying to get all of our prep work done ALONE, and they come up and bother us when they can just as easily go through a checkout line like everyone else. One morning recently, I was there by myself. I had a very limited time to complete my tasks because I had to switch over from breakfast to lunch time, and that's a stressful time. One guy who ALWAYS brings his stuff over to have me ring it up comes over to the counter. He stands there, and kind of clears his throat and taps his fingers on the counter so I know how impatient he is. He works in another area of the store, and I know he doesn't have to put up with other employees coming to bother him when he's trying to work. So I go and start ringing up his stuff. We have a conversation that goes like this:

Me: ""So are there not any lanes open out there or something?""
Him: ""Uhh yeah they're open.""
Me: ""Why are you bringing your stuff over here, then?""
Him: ""I just don't want to walk over there and wait in line."" *He laughs nervously*
Me (extremely pissed off): ""So you're basically just lazy.""
Him (thinking I'm joking and laughing a little more): ""I guess.""
Me (completely serious): ""When are you the most busy?""
Him: ""Usually at night when I have to get my zone done.""
Me: ""OK. Well we're the most busy over here in the morning. The next time you close I'll make sure to come bother you when you are just trying to get your zone done. The next time you want to have your stuff rang up, just be a dear and go through the checkout line.""
Him: ""Umm...OK. Thanks."" and he walks away.
_____________________________________________

Same day, oddly enough:

A young pharmacy intern was standing in line behind a little old lady that does the food sampling at the store on weekends. I told the lady about my new job, she congratulated me, and walked away. The intern comes up to the counter and says, ""Congratulations on your new job!""
I say, ""Thank you! I've been here for nine years and I'm ready to move on.""
He says, ""Oh really? I never would've guessed that you had your degree.""
Me, really mad and sort of shocked, ""Why's that? Because I work in food?""
Him: ""Uhh...no. Not at all! I didn't mean it like that.""
Me: ""Oh, OK. Because I had to work to put myself through college. I didn't have parents that could afford to put me through.""
Him: ""Well...good for you! Have a good day!"" and he walks away.
z____________________________________________

I get to my job at 5 PM to close. The very first customer I get asks for popcorn. Another employee rings her up, and I go to grab the bag. I stick my hand down in the bag without even thinking to expand it, and immediately this lady says, ""Did you just stick your hand down in that bag?"" really, realy loud and very rudely. 
I throw the bag down, and say, ""Nazong (which means dickhead in Chin, and since she's some redneck piece of white trash she doesn't know what I mean when I say it). Sorry. I did it without even thinking."" I sanitize my hands, put on gloves, and scoop the popcorn. I hand it over to her and I can tell she feels like an ass, so she says, ""Thanks for doing that"" in a much more polite tone. I'm still pissed that she was rude about it, and I said, ""Well I don't blame you. My hands are really, really dirty. I mean, I never wash them."" She gets a nervous look and leaves.


I'll post  more as they happen. My last day there is in July. Thank goodness I'm finally getting out."
1gxejd,2,2013-06-23,What can I do with a B.A. in political science and a B.Sc. in applied mathematics and statistics?,quantifypolisci,PoliticalScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1gxejd/what_can_i_do_with_a_ba_in_political_science_and/,"To make a very long story short: I entered college as a political science major and I switched halfway through to a double major in computer science and applied mathematics and statistics. I only switched so I could get a decent job. I took a few programming and theory classes but hated them, so I dropped computer science and just stuck with my applied math major. Recently, I went to the political science department website to make sure I had everything in order for a minor. I was surprised to see all kinds of cool new classes and lots of internships and research opportunities. During my freshman year, the department had hardly any classes and there was nothing like this.

I have 3 semesters of school left and I only need 7 classes to have both degrees. That leaves room for an internship or research. My political science classes all center around American campaigns/elections and the psychology of voting. 

I haven't spoken to the political science undergraduate adviser yet and I'm not super aware of what I can do with both degrees. Ideally, I would like to do something involving data for a campaign or advocacy group. Does anybody here have any experience in this area or any suggestions?"
1gx2f3,11,2013-06-23,Learning to Code for Post-Grad Neuroscience,shug3459,neuroscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/1gx2f3/learning_to_code_for_postgrad_neuroscience/,"Hi, I'm currently finishing up my applications for PhDs in Neuroscience and have a summer with not much planned (mostly just free-lance work) so was thinking about learning new coding languages/ to practice the limited coding I already know.

Over a few internships and a year-long project I can generally work my way around MATLAB in creating computer-based psychophysics tasks and doing some rudimentary analysis in the command window. I also have some basic experience with Javascript from high school classes and mucking around.

I was wondering:
a) If it was worthwhile spending the time improving my coding skills but I assume this is a given as it's something I've seen suggested time and time again, especially as the work and degree programs I'm most interested is fairly computational.
b) What languages I should work on. Given I have some basic MATLAB experience I assume it comes down to either improving this or starting with a separate langauge (I was thinking about Python)?

Sorry if this is a repost, I did some searching and couldn't find anything on it. Have a nice Sunday,"
1gwz8y,18,2013-06-23,"Me[22M] and my girlfriend [20F] have been together for 5 years. She has broken my trust in the past, and I think she is doing it again.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gwz8y/me22m_and_my_girlfriend_20f_have_been_together/,"My girlfriend and I have been together since high school. We have two little girls (18mo/F) and (4/F). These girls mean the whole world to me and I'm afraid of losing them. I am also very much in love with my girlfriend and don't want to ruin things with her.

My girlfriend was emotionally enveloped in a second relationship when ours began. She supposedly extinguished it until last summer when they reconnected. We had big, big issues until she decided that it was more important to be with me than him. I waited 6 months for her to pick me. While this was going on, she also developed another relationship with someone a state away. We broke up for a week and got back together, with her saying that it's all over.

I'm no angel, though. In order to find out about these relationships, I went through her Facebook and texts. I understand this is wrong and I have recently made an appointment with a therapist to work on my trust issues. 

I went through her Facebook again, after seeing the same signs of withdrawal, aggressiveness and protectiveness of her electronics (phone and computer) that she normally does, along with her choosing to talk to other people than hang out with our family.

I found that she found another friend from high school that she is getting really close to. He is working in Africa and they've decided to get together for ""skype sex"" and it's eating me alive. I tried talking to her about it but she denies it of course, and lies to my face about innocent things involving her friends. I don't control her whatsoever, so she goes out some nights while I stay in with the kids, clean, and do homework. 

I've been told, and believe, that I am a great guy. We laugh, get along, I give her nightly massages, I support her financially and even agreed to uproot the whole family so that she can take an internship in Seattle (3,000 miles away). I clean and take care of everything. I have never missed a birthday, holiday, and take the whole family out to do fun things like camping, climbing, parks, zoo, museums, etc. I'm at a loss.

One more question:

Most of her friends hate me. This isn't because of my personality, but because she says the opposite to them. That I'm lazy, that I'm not going to Seattle with her, that I never clean and take care of the kids. Her personality otherwise is great. What's interesting is that when I tell her friends what I do for her, how I take care of her, and how I don't believe it's fair for them to support her lies and infidelity, they stop talking to her. I've only done that to two friends and I know that's wrong too. She needs someone to vent to. Anyone know what's up with that?

I love her and I wouldn't trade her for anyone else. Her family loves me and she loves me (she has shown it; I wouldn't misunderstand it). She has urged me to propose a few times, but I haven't because of these hurdles.

Remember, we have kids and I don't think a breakup is the best option. I want to keep our family together.

EDIT: Fixed most nights to some nights for accuracy.

EDIT 2: Okay, I think it's pretty clear now... ugh this sucks. I will break up with her as soon as I can. I won't fight it anymore. So first, legal advice. Second, custody? Third, break it off. Thanks everyone.
---

tl;dr: My girlfriend is awesome and loves me, but has emotional relationships with other guys. Also, she lies to her friends about me being terrible when it's the opposite."
1gwt3s,220,2013-06-23,This subreddit has given me the best gift I could have ever hoped for.,chwell,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1gwt3s/this_subreddit_has_given_me_the_best_gift_i_could/,"About six months ago, I saw a post from a San Diego bro who had just been accepted into the U.S. Navy medical school in Washington, D.C., and would be attending in the fall. 

While this was not necessarily that strange (you all are a bunch of achievers; I see you doing awesome things all the time), I did find it interesting that someone else was also moving across the country, to and from the same city as I was, and at almost exactly the same time.

We got to chatting, and that night alone, we sent a solid miniature novel back and forth via text message. We agreed to set up a time to meet for drinks and talk some more, but by the time the ""meet up"" came around, we were both well aware that it was more of a date than anything else.

We spent our date chatting and laughing for hours upon hours of time; it felt like we had known each other forever, and for me at least, the rest of the world disappeared that evening. He accompanied me back home for continued conversation, and we proceeded to share the night together.

We ended up spending the vast majority of the next five days together, after which I had to leave for an internship in Washington for ten weeks. On New Year's Eve, just five days after we had officially met in person, we decided to call ourselves exclusive. We managed through the ten weeks just fine, and he came out to visit, once to D.C., and we met again in NYC, two of the best experiences I've had.

Now, we're once again separated for a short while. He's completing Officer Development School at the current moment, and is for the most part deprived of any method of communication with the outside world, so it'll be a while before he sees this, I'm sure. I am extremely proud of him for pursuing his dream, and know that he'll be a Navy success story in a short amount of time. 

I apologize for the gushiness of this post, but I just wanted to thank you all, the members of this community, for existing. Without this subreddit, I would never have found the amazing man I did. We'd have been two different people with two completely different lives, with slim to no chances of ever meeting in person. I find myself more and more appreciative of the circumstances that brought us together with each passing day, and know that the future is much brighter, if only because he's in it. 

So again, thank you bros, and keep on doing what you do best! Cheers!"
1gwpk7,1,2013-06-23,Relapsed after a week. Difference between porn+fap or just fap?,PlopFromTheOffice,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gwpk7/relapsed_after_a_week_difference_between_pornfap/,"Hey guys, this is my first post on NoFap, ever.  I just made a new account because my old one would have too easily revealed my identity. But anyway. I have been lurking on this subreddit for a while and decided to attempt the challenge.  I made it 7 days and relapsed yesterday afternoon.  I am currently working an internship in a state where I know nobody and I'm all alone so there's really not much to do and I get bored easily so it's amazing I even made it a week.  But before the relapse I was starting to feel like I had more energy and was just generally happier and possibly on the verge of obtaining those superpowers I've been hearing a lot about.

When I fap I watch porn 99% of the time but when I relapsed yesterday I didn't.  I'm thinking that the problem stems more from an addiction to porn than the fapping.  But I am attempting to eliminate both.  Not watching porn yesterday and for the past week was a step in the right direction but this time I want to go longer and see what happens.  I am hoping the support from this subreddit will help me stay focused and motivated."
1gwklj,4,2013-06-23,[22/F] Broke up with my boyfriend of 6 years [22/M] and not coping so well.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gwklj/22f_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_of_6_years_22m_and/,"To give you a little summary about us. We started dating when we were 16 and we were each other's first real relationships. We've had major ups and downs like a previous break up but I always thought if we could get through that one break up, it would last.

Fast forward to this break up, which happened around the beginning of June. He wanted to break up because he didn't feel that certain expectations were being met and I felt a little sad that we weren't spending enough time together because of financial problems and busy schedules, so we decided this was for the best. He and I both felt that we still wanted to be a permanent part of each other's lives as friends so we agreed to remain friends. I wasn't very sad in the beginning, I think it was because I was just trying to avoid the problem and then I thought about it. I thought about what really tore us apart and I do believe it is my fault.

I know one must not place blame on themselves during a break up or on anyone for that matter but I really do think it is my fault. I have taken him for granted. I realized now that I wasn't making much effort to spend time with him, and I would be the one complaining about it. I spent more time with my friends than I did with him. He would always make suggestions about spending time together like taking walks or playing games. I feel stupid for not listening to them. I guess I wanted to do more than that with him. I felt that we should have been doing more like taking trips to other cities. It really is the small things that mean so much.

I don't mean to make excuses but after thinking about it for a long time, my attitudes about our relationship during the last few months or even last year stemmed from our first break up. Back then, I was so clingy and rude to him and his friends. After we got back together after that first break up, I made an effort to not be that person again. I started hanging out with my friends more, I started concentrating on myself and so did he. At some point we were at this apex where I knew or I thought I knew that no matter what happened, we would always get through anything together. Things started to go downhill when I let my insecurities take over. I felt that my friends were somehow more into being friends with each other than with me. I felt like the odd man out because I didn't share their interests as powerfully as they did. It kept building up until eventually, I wanted to keep hanging out with them more to solidify these friendships. I wanted this so badly partly because I didn't have that many friends and partly because after the first break up, I didn't want to be constantly pestering my boyfriend to be hanging out with me all the time. I felt it would ruin our relationship. Eventually without realizing it, my time became devoted to trying to make new friends. Sometimes, my boyfriend would ask to hang out but it'd be too late because I had plans. 

I feel absolutely terrible. I let all these insecurities get a hold of me and I realized too late that my friends really did care about me. I poured all of my break up troubles to them and they just held me and even cried with me. Now because of my stupid insecurities I've lost the most wonderful relationship I've ever had in my life. I even turned him into this vessel where I poured all my problems on whenever I had problems about my friends.

I spoke to him recently about how I wanted to get back together but he felt it was best if we stayed apart. He still wanted to be friends. He was such a sweetheart. He held me for as long as I wanted and told me everything was ok, like he always did. I wish I listened to him before.

I still love him and it hurts so much not to be with him. I had a week long trip to Japan, and I didn't enjoy it one bit. I was so irritable and sad the entire time. I spent some of those nights staying up and thinking about what went wrong. I felt like I've ruined this second chance that he gave me and I don't think I'll ever get another. 

Today, I'm still so miserable and it doesn't help that he's already started another relationship. I wrote a letter to him that I hope to give him, explaining to him things that I never got to talk about because I'm so bad at being verbal. The letter also says that I want one year away from our friendship so I could get over him and that if he still wanted to be friends, we'll meet up again in 2014. I blocked him on facebook, because it's just so damn hard to see the words ""in a relationship"" without my name being there.

My friends tell me I shouldn't give up on him because of our long history but I really believe I've screwed things up so much that I'll never get another chance. It's ok, I'd like very much for him to be happy. He didn't have a very good childhood, so he deserves the best future. I really hoped that I would be the one to give him this amazing future but I no longer am able.

Despite all my wishes for him, I don't know where to begin getting over this relationship. I've started exercising and I plan to play dodgeball and take up Ba Gua soon. I'm also a little short on money so doing fun distracting things is hard. I'm an animation major and I love to draw but he and I shared this love of creating stories together and every time I draw, I'm just reminded about how I'll never be able to talk to him about stories like we used to. The back and forth was nearly endless and now that he'll be in this new relationship, I feel like there will be limits to how much we can communicate and share our love of stories. It's cliche to say I know but I feel like colors aren't as bright as they used to, food doesn't taste as good as it should, days seem longer, etc. I still cry everyday usually by myself but sometimes I'll talk to a friend.

I want to get over this quickly. I have a whole future to plan out. I have internships to sign up for and a portfolio to remake but it's so hard without him. I know it takes time to get over a relationship, but time is not something I have a lot of.

I love him and I miss him so much. I don't know what to do.

tldr, my boyfriend of six years and I broke up. I realize now that it is my fault because I took him for granted and I have no idea how to get over him."

I'm a university student who was originally going to be in Cairo this summer to intern at an NGO for the month of July -- I actually posted on this board before. I've spent a day in Cairo last summer on a layover and have been able to visit the Pyramids as a result. However, the internship program I am going through may cancel the whole thing given the unrest in the area, so I currently have a round trip ticket to Cairo (7/1 - 7/30) that I don't plan on forgetting about and no real idea on what to do once I arrive. 

I was wondering if you guys could help me consider some options:

- I was considering staying in Cairo and working as an English teacher (ReachOut, a place I contacted earlier). Not sure if Cairo is vibrant enough of a city to be entertaining for a month especially during Ramadan.

- I was planning on visiting Luxor/Alexandria (1-3 days each), Jerusalem/Tel-Aviv (a week?), and Petra (2 days), regardless of the scenario. So maybe I could make this into a bigger thing and spend time in all of these places? What would the budget be like and is a solo trip enjoyable enough?

My last resort backup plan would be to take an EgyptAir to Kenya, where I volunteered last summer and would have contacts who could get me some more volunteer experience. But since I've already been there and I have the opportunity to be in the Middle East, I'd rather experience new things. 

I feel like I'm missing a lot of information and perhaps making an unusual request but I hope that you guys would be able to help me make some good thoughts here. Thanks"

1gwdno,23,2013-06-23,When your significant other is intimidated by your success or doesn't understand the desire to pursue further education,gaussiansurface,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1gwdno/when_your_significant_other_is_intimidated_by/,"A bit of background:

I'm currently in the midst of completing my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, and I've begun to open up very real possibilities of having a chance at admission into strong controls engineering PhD programs.

I've mentioned to my boyfriend that I've thought about going into a PhD program, to which he replied with ""Why? I would NOT want to spend 6 more years in school."" Keep in mind, he'd be very interested in working right out of undergrad (nothing wrong with that) and establishing himself and a family perhaps 3 years after graduating. For him, pursuing a master's degree in his respective field of engineering would only be done if absolutely needed (he's expressed many times that he ""hates"" school but loves working at his internship). 

I've always been a go-getter and interested in furthering my education (and possibly a research career), but I can tell right off the bat that being with someone while completing a PhD will have its own unique struggles, especially if you participate in a program as a married woman. 

Of course there's another side to my boyfriend's argument, where he does notice that the stresses that go hand-in-hand with living an ambitious lifestyle can take a toll on your health or your relationships with your family, friends, etc. A PhD in engineering will be exceptionally difficult, and I would imagine there will be many late nights I'd be staying in the lab while my significant other stayed at home alone.

I'm really looking for advice or experiences you all have had in dealing with building such a fast-paced, hard-hitting career while in a relationship (or while in a relationship where the other person may not be as supportive as you'd hope during the process).

I am a transfer student and considered a Sophomore. At the moment, I'm not completely confident in my major. I was in a similar program in high school and I enjoyed it very much. What holds me back is the job opportunities available after college. I've heard a majority of the jobs are low paying and not beneficial for your career.
So I'd like to know what current students think of their classes and internship opportunities. How are the professors? Are you satisfied with what you've learned? If any alumni happen to read this, is your current job related to your degree?

Sorry for all the questions; any kind of input is welcomed. Thanks :D "
1gw7je,0,2013-06-23,Lost Potential [long],hillsat,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gw7je/lost_potential_long/,"I moved a lot as a kid.  I remember that distinctly.  Right after I was 5, cross the country to the SW, then when I was 7, to the Midwest.

One of my first memories was being spanked.  I remember looking back at my rear end and seeing 3 deep purple lines strewn across it because I couldn't grasp the concept of subtraction at the age of 4.  I cried.  I remember choking on some leafy food, because I had refused to eat it and I was forced to by my father, leaving a really sensitive gag reflex that I still have today.  I remember drawing a picture and getting yelled at by my father for it not being good enough.

I hate violence.  I hate that particular type of vegetable.  And I consider myself incredibly unartistic.

I was considered a smart child.  I remember getting told that my IQ was relatively high and as an elementary school student I was encouraged to skip a grade.  My standardized state test scores were in the 99th percentile, but no fact could convince me to leave my warm 3rd grade teacher for a 4th grade teacher who on my first week, ripped up a test I had forgotten to take in front of the class as my classmates chanted ""Burn it!"".  

My middle school experience feels like the highlight of my life.  I had friends, had my first kiss at 12/13, had a girlfriend, played hockey during the day and Ghost in the Graveyard at night.  Our group of 6 would have campfires and go swimming in the lake.  We would jump on the trampoline and have sleepovers.  

I've had a stutter since I can remember, but during 8th grade, I had a wonderful speech therapist (provided by the school) who helped me gain enough confidence to give two speeches in front of the whole school that year as well as be a curator for a random school event.  I was on track and field, played in the band, and graduated number 1 in my middle school class.

I remember never wanting to come home.  If I was coming back home from a retreat or camp, I always felt sick on the last day.  Walking home from school was no different.  If I saw my father's car in the driveway, I would begin to get nauseous and anxious.  If I didn't see his car, it was the best day of my life.  Mondays were wonderful as well as basketball season, as my father would be hopefully be too distracted with football or basketball to yell at me or spank me.  When my mother would leave on long trips or just for the night, I begged to be taken with. 

I love football and basketball as an adult.

High school hit and I realized I was nothing.  My feeling intellectual superiority dwindled into nothing as I ended up graduating barely in the top 25%.  My grades took a hit during junior year, and I almost had a mental breakdown trying to finish my coursework and study for 6+ AP tests.  I ended up taking over 12 AP courses my high school career, but had almost no extra curriculars to supplement that. 

Junior year was also when my parents got divorce.  Unlike most divorces, I was relatively happy with it.  I hated my father and wanted to get away from him as far as possible.  I found a group of friends who were into the same things as me and formed a tight clique.  All kids who were smarter than I was, but made me feel like I belonged.  

I graduated high school, but was disappointed in getting waitlisted and then rejected by my school of choice.  I felt like a failure and was undeniably disappointed in myself.  I decided for the first time in my life to take a gamble and took a gap year to do volunteer work abroad.  

My friends all went on to prestigious institutions of higher learning throughout the states, all of them having a particular focus they knew they wanted to get into.  Fast forward 4 years and most of them are still in school getting their masters as I finish my bachelors in business.  I was going to be a teacher, but changed midway after becoming disillusioned by listening to other teachers complain about their job.  

I held a good internship throughout college, and leveraged that into a nice job as at an agency.  I was stressed out, naive, and ill-suited for the position, but I tried hard.  I ended up talking a lot with the girl sitting next to me and we became friends.  Then more than friends.  But she had a boyfriend.  I decided to travel abroad once again and gave my 2 weeks notice after only 9 months.  I went to abroad for almost 2.5 years and lived life.  Struggled in some places, but had the time of my life in other places.  I taught in order to get by and made enough to take a 2 month vacation before returning to the states.

By the time I came back, all my friends were well entrenched in their jobs.  Far be it from me to be that immature child who compares his stick with his friends' sticks, but it's inevitable in conversation.  ""What are you up to in life?"" ""What are your next steps?"" I remained purposefully unemployed for a year, then unintentionally unemployed for a year looking for work.

I finally found work in an internship type role, only I feel too old to be an intern (currently 30).  Looking back on my life, I don't know.  My friends are always saying that it was nice that I got to travel, but I think its nice that they're putting down payments on houses and getting engaged and married.  I'm not even close.  No money (no debt), no girl, and it's not even that.  It's my lack of interest or motivation for both that concerns me.  I don't know anymore.  If the purpose of life is to continue to the species, I feel like I have no purpose.  It's not that I can't find a gf, it's that I can't stand intimacy and am terrible with relationships.  It's not that I don't want to be rich, it's that I don't care enough about money, other than paying rent, bills, and food.

Sometimes I feel fine. Other times, I question why I'm even here."

I'm in a 4-year BSN program and about to enter into my 3rd year, where we begin Clinicals and take classes like pharmacology, dimensions of nursing and other such stuff (I'm in pathophysiology right now and loving it!).

I have a few questions that I've asked around at school, but it's always helpful to get more opinions.

1) How many hours can you work? Say you want to work 6 days a week and at least 50 hours, it that allowed provided your supervisor wants you on for that long?
2) Is there a pay difference between the associates RN and a BSN?
3) How hard is it to get a job as a nurse? Most people have said it's not very hard, and I'm planning on doing a PCT internship next summer, which I've been told can double my chances of being hired.
4) What's starting salary like provided you're working in a town of 100k people?
5) Any tips before I start the ""fun"" stuff? 

Thanks!"

I'll get the elephant in the room (at least for me) out of the way. I'm a BIG girl and it handicaps me in a lot of ways

I guess I've always been the kid that hides behind moms skirt( AKA socially awkward ). I don't connect with people. I genuinely find it hard to act naturally with people. I've had three people I could ever be myself with two of them moved away to florida and one ended up being the big bad bitch in high school and made me feel like a complete freak ( hello emotional walls ). Now I'm in community college because I was too afraid to leave home.

The two people I thought were my friends currently ignore me texts calls fb you name it I get ignored like I never existed. I was never invited to go do anything with them I always need to ask. It's made me feel like i both people just by trying to speak to them (even posting this I feel like all of reddit is going to be angry with me)

I've been drowning my feelings of loneliness with work since I was sixteen. I just started an internship where I work a full 8 to 5 day. because when I go to work people have to be around me and talk to me. Then when a coworker is nice to me I create a need for them to be around me. I need someone outside my (very screwed up) family to talk to.

I used to think I was interesting way back when but now I feel so boring. I feel like I'm boring to the point that anyone who tries to be my friend is big on charity or (sorry guys who are reading this) are just trying to get in my pants because I'm a lonely fat girl. 

I've given the whole internet friends thing a try before but they all seem to end the same. either I become to boring for them and they stop responding or I get asked for and/or sent dirty pics and messages.

I've basically felt this alone since I was 11 (which lead to self mutilation which lead to more loneliness) and it's finally taking it's toll where I don't see the point in waking up and living *my* life anymore. I just go through the motions to make my parents happy but.  I haven't felt happy or felt like I've had a friend in a long time. Sorry for being all over the place emotions aren't really my thing."

-----

Day 90
======

A trickle down my leg woke me, forcing me to slip quietly out of bed to take
care of myself. After I shut the bathroom door, I ran the shower to get the
water hot. When I stepped into the nearly scalding water, it felt so good that
I just turned slowly around and let it strike me as I breathed in the steam.

That wonderful sense of unity had stayed with me all night. Even the soreness
I felt when I cleaned myself was a source of pleasure as I recalled what
happened the night before. The only darkness in my heart was the fear that
this would be our last night together until summer break. And unless Jules
could come to terms with her fear, it might even be our last for longer than
that.

I hadn't wanted to put any more pressure on her by mentioning it, but my
thoughts kept circling back to John's comments about me moving out with him
alone. I tried justifying it to myself, but there was no easy way to avoid
Jules being hurt even suggesting it. We needed to talk about things, but it
was too easy for us to fall into bed and forget about life for a while.

I turned off the water and stepped out to dry as John came in and closed the
door. He grinned and slipped his arms around me as I stood on my toes to give
him a wet kiss. He broke the kiss with an apologetic look, and sat down to
relieve himself.

""How are you feeling? I was afraid I was a little rough with you last night.""

""I'm fine, you were fine, and it was wonderful."" I dried myself vigorously
with the fluffy bath towel. ""Beyond wonderful."" I gave him a satisfied smile.

""Good."" He sat back and watched me finish drying myself. ""I'm going to get out
of here in a couple of hours. It's an eight hour drive back and I really do
need to get some work done on my project.""

I sighed. ""I know.""

""Are we actually going to talk about anything with Jules before I go?""

""I was just thinking about that. It's too easy to slip into bed and sidestep
the discussion. Let's bring it up over breakfast. I'll go fry some bacon while
you shower.""

""I'd rather you stay and scrub my back."" He reached out to pull me onto his
lap. Kissing him warmed me up, but I didn't let him change my mind. I forced
myself to get up, but couldn't stop the growl of frustration.

""Oh, the things I would do if you were staying...""

""Oh yeah? Like what?""

""First, I'd make you come with me to Mom's to help me pack and carry those
heavy boxes, but you'd have to do it with your shirt off while Jules and I
watched.""

""That doesn't sound like fun.""

I tweaked his nose and slipped out of the bathroom. Jules was still sleeping
in a heap in the middle of bed. I slipped on some clean panties and put on a
long tee shirt that hung to the middle of my thighs. I tied my damp hair into a
pony tail with scrunchy and stepped quietly down the stairs and to the kitchen.

While I started breakfast, I considered how to approach Jules on the topic of
our summer living arrangements. I had to wonder what motivated her to bring it
up at dinner that night. Maybe a part of her wanted to, but her reaction later
demonstrated she was conflicted about it. Since then she had vacillated back
and forth between security and panic. I had no idea how to help.

John's impatience was growing as we watched her struggled with herself. I had
hoped that giving them some time together would help cement their bond, but
his tone when he asked about talking with Jules implied he was perfectly
willing to make plans without her. I couldn't do that to her, not now.

I microwaved a couple of potatoes and sliced them to fry in the bacon grease.
It was horribly fattening, but my Dad had always made them for our weekend
breakfasts and I needed the comfort food right then. While they cooked, I
sliced some tomatoes and set our plates to warm on the stove top.

John came up behind me and slipped his arms around my stomach. I leaned into
him and let his warm breath give me goosebumps as he kissed my neck. ""I could
get used to this,"" he whispered.

""I wish we could, too. Is Jules up?""

""Yeah, she was heading into the bathroom to shower when I was dressing.""

I turned around in his arms and put my hands behind his neck. Our kiss was
tender and sweet. He reached down to pull me against his growing interest.
I moved my lips to his ear and nibbled on his lobe, which made his knees
buckle as he gasped. ""Are you sure you have to leave today?"" I whispered.

""That's not fair!"" he hissed.

""You're right."" I slipped my tongue into the folds on his ear which made him
tighten his grip. ""I'm going to burn breakfast if you don't go sit down,"" I
whispered again in his ear. I felt goosebumps raise along his neck and cheeks.

""This is going to be a long couple of months."" He stepped back and reluctantly
let go of me. ""Can I do anything to help?""

""Cut some fruit if you want. I cleaned the strawberries and there are some
oranges in the bowl over there.""

As he sat down to cut the fruit I flipped the potatoes to brown on the other
side. ""So you have any thoughts on how to bring up moving this summer?""

""I'm not very good at subtleties. I'd prefer to just put it out there and talk
about it. I know she's got some reservations, but we aren't doing any good by
dancing around the issue, especially since you and I already seem to want the
same thing.""

""That's true, but Jules doesn't always react in rational ways where her fear is
concerned. I've known her a long time. When she thought she was losing me to
you, she practically demanded I move in with her. This from a girl who couldn't
stand to stay overnight with people she liked and dated for months.""

""Honestly, that sounds more like a control issue to me. You saw the look on her
face when you talked about packing up and bringing over the rest of your
things. When she brought you in initially, it was her decision. Now that you
have nowhere else to go, it look like it's changed things for her.""

I couldn't think of anything to say to that. He was right. I plated the
potatoes, putting a few paper towels on the bottom to soak up the excess
grease.

""I can't just leave her here."" I couldn't look at him when I said it, because
if I had I'd never been able to get the words out.

""I want to be with you both, but if that isn't possible I can't just watch you
through a computer screen. You have to understand that. It was so hard, like
acid and ulcers hard."" His voice was strained like he was fighting to speak.
""I'm sorry, I'm just not strong enough to go through that again.""

""So what are you going to do for the next two months?"" I turned around to face
him. He was red faced as he ripped the skin off of an orange.

""I'm going to make myself focus on school. I'm not going to call you. I'll send
email, or letters, anything where I don't have to see you here together.""

It felt like I'd swallowed ice when he said that. ""I'm not sure I could stand
that.""

""I don't have a choice, Kate. I wasn't joking. This is killing me, especially
after the trip. I can't take loving you through window any more.""

I realize Jules was standing at the edge of the kitchen, but I didn't know how
long she had been there. ""So, you started without me?"" she whispered.

""No, I'm just now cooking the eggs,"" I said, pretending to misunderstand her
comment. She came in, put away the vodka in the freezer, and poured herself a
cup of coffee. The silence was oppressive.

I cooked two eggs at a time, flipping them once to seal the whites, but leaving
the yolks a little runny. I gave Jules the first plate, but she wouldn't even
look at me. John at least looked at me, but he pinched his lips in a way that
seemed like an apology. When I brought my eggs to the table to join them, I
whispered, ""Bon Appetit.""

""So you're going to cut us off until Summer."" Jules made the statement plainly,
but the tight way she said it hinted at the depth of her feelings.

""I don't have a choice. I'm not joking about ulcers; I had to go to the
infirmary for stomach pains. The nurse kept asking me about what might be
stressing me out, but I couldn't say, 'Oh, nothing but the long-distance
relationship with my two bi-sexual girlfriends who live together and torment
me every night over video calls.'""

""I'm sorry you felt tormented,"" Jules said with an acid bite.

""Christ, how would you feel in my place, Jules? What if you lived here alone
and Kate moved in with me? What if you had to see us every night and knew
that we'd be making love moments after we hung up with you?"" He was almost
shouting at her at the end.

Jules' cell phone rang and she stormed out of the kitchen to take the call. I
had lost my appetite and dragged a bit a bread around, drawing hearts in the
yolk. When she came back she seemed to have calmed down a little.

""I know it was hard on you, I'm sorry."" She paused for a bite of bacon before
turning to me. ""I have to work tonight. The manager is sick with some kind of
stomach flu. Do you think we'll be done at your house by three?""

""If not, I'll tough it out on my own. Could you take me to get some moving
boxes on the way? I can get everything packed up and leave picking it up for
another day if I have to.""

""I can leave you my car if you don't mind dropping me off and picking me up.
I'll have to close tonight, so it'll be about 2:30 AM before I can get
away.""

""That would be great. I'll be happy to pick you up.""

John watched our little domestic scene with an odd expression. Jules tilted
her head at him. ""What?""

""Nothing."" He paused for a second. ""No that's not true, I'm straight up
jealous. I want to be a part of your lives.""

""So what are we going to do about it?"" I asked. ""I don't know if I want to
go two months without seeing you or being with you.""

""This is my third year and the classes are getting really hard. Last year my
grades slipped because I couldn't concentrate with everything going on around
me. I promised myself I wouldn't let it happen again. I've got too much riding
on this, my whole future. That was why I wanted to date someone out of town.
Even though it's been hard so far, I've kept up mostly because I told myself
this was more casual than it felt to me.""

""Until I fucked that up this week. Oh, John, I'm so sorry.""

""Don't be. I'm not, even now. I never really met anyone I wanted a future with.
You both opened my eyes to the possibilities, and now I want it all. I just
can't lose focus on school right now."" He took a long look at each of us. ""But
this summer I want us to move in together.""

""I can't do it."" Jules was white faced. ""Part of me wants to, I swear, but I
just can't. I'm sorry.""

That stopped the discussion in its tracks. I didn't know what to say, but John
was red faced. ""Is it me?"" he asked quietly. ""You live here with Kate and don't
seem to be too shaken up by it.""

""No, it's even hard with Kate. Having her here makes me feel like a compressed
spring all the time. I have to watch myself to keep from overreacting to little
things she does or says, but she is so easy going that it has worked out so
far.""

""Then why did you even invite her to live here with you? I never did understand
how that happened.""

""I don't know now much Kate's told you privately, but I know we've never really
talked about it ourselves. I reacted badly when she told me about your
relationship after Christmas.""

John gave a brief nervous laugh. ""What do you mean? How badly?""

I looked down into my plate. I never put a name on what we did to each other
that day. She called it a grudge fuck when we met in the coffee shop. We'd
never spoken of it again. When I looked up I saw Jules giving him a blank
stare. ""I tore her clothes off and forced her to have sex with me.""

""Wait,"" John said, ""What do you mean? Like rape?""

I couldn't remain quiet after he said that. ""If she raped me, then I raped her
right back. I was callous and thoughtless with her feelings, then stepped over
the line physically. Me, not her.""

""You have to understand. I'd always loved her, John, since we were girls. It
killed me to see how she was falling for you. Then when she touched me like
she did, I got so angry. It wasn't fair that she should touch me like that
after she had already decided to give herself to you.""

""When we talked about it the next day she told me that she wanted to have equal
time, to show me how it could be with us. I was so afraid I was going to lose
her as a friend, but I was determined not to lose you either. I agreed to stay
here with her for one week, but then we drove out to meet you after a couple of
days. When we came back, I never left."" There were tears on her face, but she
wasn't crying. I took her hand and smiled at her. ""I never wanted to.""

""That's kind of twisted. I think I understand, but it still doesn't change how
it feels to me. You're willing to at least try with Kate, but not with me."" He
clenched his hands into fists.

""Please, it's not like that. I can't explain it to you because I can't even
explain it to myself."" She stood up and paced around the kitchen. ""Kate was the
only person I've ever loved until now. I always tried to find a way to tell her
how I felt about her without scaring her off. I even set up crazy situations,
like suggesting kissing practice for when we got boyfriends, just to be able to
hold her in my arms. I finally worked up the nerve to tell her how I felt after
she kissed me."" Jules stopped and faced away from me. ""Then she laughed.""

""Oh, baby."" I was instantly in tears. ""I was scared by how you made me feel.
It was easier to just tell myself you were still pretending to be a boy and
saying what he would say.""

She didn't seem to hear me. She was locked in her memories. ""When I couldn't
have her, I gave myself to anyone who wanted me. My first was a high school
football player while I was still in junior high. He made me feel dirty about
what he did to me, then he tried to pass me around to his friends. I didn't
care, nothing could make me feel worse than her laughter.""

I felt a cold, tingling horror as she opened her old wounds. ""Jules, stop it,
you don't have to do this.""

Her voice dropped to a meditative whisper. ""I have spent a decade watching her
grow more beautiful, dreading the day she would find someone. When she never
dated, never showed any interest in anyone, I couldn't stop myself hoping she
might love me someday, even though I knew in my heart it was hopeless. Then
she told me about you... and finally, after years of waiting, she touched me.""

""Oh, Jules."" John stood up and walked over to her and pulled her into his arms.

She looked into his eyes with a raw desperation. ""It wasn't fair. I wanted to
hate you. She saw things in you that couldn't be real. No one could be that
nice or thoughtful. So I tried to poison her against you. Then when I met you,
oh my God, she was right. John, you are wonderful."" She touched his face. ""I've
spent most of a decade in one screwed up relationship after another. Now I've
got poisonous, ugly things inside me that ruin everything I touch. I don't
deserve this, I don't deserve you, but she does.""

Jules began to shake like she couldn't breathe or was going to be sick. I got
up and embraced her opposite from John. Our eyes locked over her shoulder as
she clung to him. He looked as heartbroken as I felt.

""I'm too big of a coward to just walk away, and no matter how I try I can't let
you go."" She sobbed it out in bits and pieces as we held her, our hands never
still as we both sought to comfort her. ""I feel like I'm losing my mind. I
need to be alone, I need to think."" She tried to pull away, but John and I held
her close and guided her to the couch. She whispered, ""I wish I could die.""

""Jules, listen to me,"" John said as held her hands and I smoothed her hair.
""You're not losing your mind, I just didn't understand. It's clear you've been
deeply wounded, sweetheart. If you are full of poison, then we'll have to see
about getting some help to get it out. I need to call a friend of mine. Can you
stay here with Kate for a few minutes?"" She nodded and he went upstairs to make
the call.

She just stared at the wall as I held her. I never imagined she carried this
around inside her. My guilt sat like broken glass in my stomach. I pushed away
my thoughts and imagined giving Jules my strength and love. It was the closest
I'd come to praying since Dad died. I didn't know if it helped or not.

John came back and sat with us for a second. ""Jules, listen to me. I've got a
friend who's in pre-med and interns for a great doctor. He gave me a referral
for a local doctor who might be able to help. Would you be willing to talk to
him this afternoon?""

""What are you talking about?"" She seemed dazed. ""I have to go to work.""

""Don't worry about that Jules,"" I said. ""I'll call your boss. I'll even
volunteer to take the shift myself if he wants.""

""No, you can't do that. I'll be fine, I just need to work some things out.""

""Jules, being hurt like this is no different than having a broken leg. It's not
something you can just walk off. Do you realize what you said a few minutes
ago?"" She gave us a blank look and shook her head. ""Jules, you said you wished
you could die."" He choked up on the last word.

""No, I didn't.""

I squeezed her hand. ""Sweetheart, you did. I heard you, too.""

""I didn't mean it. I'll be fine, just forget it."" She tried to get up.

""No, hold on, this is serious. You mean so much to me, I'd no more ignore this
than let you drive drunk. I think you should talk to the doctor this afternoon
and see what your options are. Kate and I will even go with you to see him if
you want. I've decided I'm not going back to school today. I'm going to stay
here until we get this settled.""

""No, I'm not crazy! I'm not going to go see a damn doctor, and you need to go
back to school.""

""I can get a deferment for a family emergency if I have to. You are the most
important thing in my life right now. I know Kate feels the same way.""

""I do. Please, Jules, let's just go talk to him.""

""You have both lost your minds!"" She was growing alarmed and getting angry.

""Would you like to stop being afraid of us living together?"" I hoped that might
get through to her. ""Would you like to love me, to love John with a whole
heart? Maybe this can help us all, Jules.""

She stopped struggling with us, but had the look of a trapped animal. ""I don't
know if I can do this.""

""We'll be with you every minute."" John still had his phone in his hand. After
she finally nodded, he placed a call. ""Doctor Valverde? We're coming in.""

I Love her more now than I did while we were together.

This summer I got an Internship out of state (about a 4 hour drive) and am now living in a small town with a paid for apartment making way more money than anyone else my age. A few weeks ago on a Saturday she called me and broke up with me. It was a 2 minute conversation and I said very little because I was mostly shocked. We were having some trouble but it wasn't the first time and I tried and so did she and I figured we would get through it like we had always done.

I went home the next weekend and we met in a park and talked for about 20 minutes, I read to her everything I had written down since the call and was in tears and she just sat there. She said that her not feeling anything was the same as when she called me and that's how she knew she wanted to break up with me. We had talked about if something had ever gone wrong that we were best friends and would continue to be and we even talked about dating around and getting back together in a few years once or twice (when we were unsure about our relationship because it started so young).

Now I have been an emotional roller coaster thinking about a friend from middle school who took her own life and how I might be a disappointment to my parents and crying over patriotic country songs about soldiers and stuff. 

I am now sitting in a nice, paid for apartment (part of the deal with the internship) in a small town with no one to talk to. I haven't really told many of my friends from school because they wouldn't understand. 

I shouldn't be counting down the weeks til school starts back up, this internship is close to the best thing that could have happened to a freshman in college but I just cant stop thinking about winning her back and going to bars to try and meet other people, Its not that my friends at school are bad friends its just that they didn't know much about my relationship because it was always there and something I brought from home.

I guess I just need someone to talk to

I finished my undergrad and masters this past May (PPA/iMPA program, ranked #1 in the country). I am currently working in Houston with a large regional accounting firm, however, their client base does not extend into Austin. 

I'm looking to move to Austin because my wife has a job there, which she needs to keep. I decided to give up my (awesome) job in Houston to go be with her, because working (kinda) long distance has really worn down on our marriage. Unfortunately, for some reason the market for a decent accounting job in Austin is scarce. It seems like I've exhausted my resources with online outlets such as linkedin and indeed (as well as other big accounting firms in Austin, their recruiting classes have passed), so I've made the decision to seek help here to see if anyone is looking. I'm tired of getting calls from recruiters for positions that are almost half of what I'm getting now, so here goes nothing!

I currently work as an auditor, have had multiple internships working in various accounting roles. I am extremely interested in forensic accounting and fraud investigation as well if that's an option, however I am open to any accounting/finance type work. 

Last but not least, I am currently sitting for the CPA exam, so there's that. I hope to finish by the end of the year, if not, by next May. By then I should have the hours requirement for the license as well. "

1gzky8,1,2013-06-24,Help me out with a marketing internship by doing a referral - $5 for every 2 Signups,[deleted],slavelabour,https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/1gzky8/help_me_out_with_a_marketing_internship_by_doing/,"###Doing the referral is free and no financial information is needed   
  
Please hear me out on this  
I am currently in a marketing internship that involves getting referrals for a product which will soon be opening to the public. The service is called Waspit. It is a legitimate company. They offer me $2.50 per signup though I only care about putting a mark on my Resume so I am happy to return the money to those who help me out. I have money added to my Paypal and can pay as soon as I see validation (which will show up on my end). I can’t afford to pay $5 per referral but don’t want to break the rules of the subreddit, so if you can get a friend to sign up as well It will make the $5. Though I can do just $2.50 to you if need be and the mods are cool with it.  
  
[My Referral link](https://waspit.me/signup/index/r/thankyou)  
  
First off let me address the major concern that probably springs to mind in all this.  
**Is this some sort-of scam?**  
No, Waspit is a real service that is nearing launch and is currently trying to build a customer base.  They take no financial information for the referral and you only begin your service if you activate your Waspit Card.  
  
Some references for your consideration:  
1. [The Actual Site] (https://waspit.me/)   
2. [Money2020 Profile] (http://www.money2020.com/company/waspit)  
3. [PYMNTS Article] (http://www.pymnts.com/news/businesswire-feed/2013/march/01/waspit-named-as-a-finalist-for-pymnts-com-innovator-award-20130301006080)  
   
**Important**  
By filing out the form you get sent a card. If you activate the card your service starts. If you tuck the card in a drawer or chop it up and throw it away than your service will NOT start and you not be affected by it ever. If you are interested in the product, more power to ya, I'll be happy to tell you anything you want to know. However, the sign-up is my primary concern.
  
For those interested:  
**What is Waspit**  
Waspit is a new debit card service that is tailored toward college kids, it is attempting to give college kids a more unified and modern carrier so they can transfer money between friends quickly and easily. Hence why it trying this referral system, as it is a low-cost and decent way to get a group trying it out.  

Waspit sends a you a debit card which ties in with a smartphone app. It presents a cleaner UI than a typical bank site, social networking integration, and instant money transfers between other users. It also incorporates groupon, living social, and yelp into its app and your spending. By using these services you gain points which can then be traded for rewards, similar to a credit card reward program but without any risk of running into debt. This is a debit card and can't use funds you don't have.  
The service is free for the first 6 months and then cost 2 dollars a month afterwards. I would honestly recommend giving it a shot during the free period because it is fairly neat. It has some useful and intuitive ideas that need to be more widely adopted in banking.  
A personal favorite feature is split the bill where, if everyone has the card, you can pay for a meal or item with one card and everyone can easily split up the fee through the app and send the money to the person who paid.  
  
Sorry that was such a long post. I just wanted to provide as much relevant information as possible.  
If there is anything on the referral form that you have questions on, leave a comment and I'll provide even more info.  
Just PM me with Paypal information and name(s) used to sign up. I will be checking in very regularly and will pay as quickly as possible.
Thanks everyone!"
1gzkav,16,2013-06-24,New(er) Immigration Policy,anndruu12,mexico,https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/1gzkav/newer_immigration_policy/,"I have a quick question about the new immigration policy that Mexico enacted last year. I am a US citizen married to a Mexican citizen whom I met in the US while she was here on an internship. After we were married, we went through the process of getting her permanent residency here in the US. Lately, we have been talking about moving down to Mexico for a couple years so she can be closer to her family, and I can get the culture and experience. 

I am trying to understand what my marriage to a citizen means for me applying for visas in Mexico. I have tried reading through the laws, but they are confusing. I seem to think that with our marriage, I would only need to hold a residente temporal for 2 years instead of 4, and then I could apply for my residente permanente. But we would still have to show that she could financially support me during that time. Does this seem correct? Ideally, I would need a residente permanente so I could work, but I don't think I can get one, even married to a citizen. 

I tried going the the route of finding a job with a company in Mexico who could sponsor a visa for me. As a software engineer, I found a ton of jobs, but none willing to sponsor. So now I am trying to look at this other approach. Hopefully someone is a little more familiar with the laws than I am. Thanks for the help. "
1gzja6,4,2013-06-24,How to get your parents to treat you like an adult?,gogolmogol,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gzja6/how_to_get_your_parents_to_treat_you_like_an_adult/,"I'll start by saying that I love my parents and I appreciate all the things they have provided and done for me. I believe that I am a successful person largely because of them. However they have always been the ""helicoptery"" type. I should also mention that I am 22 years old. 

Anyways, this has really become an issue since I have moved back in with them for the summer as my internship is ""conveniently"" close to them and it seemed like a financially good decision instead of finding a place just for the summer. 

Specifically its my mom. She calls me every night when I'm out to see when I'll be home, where I'm at, and who I'm with, even though I consistently come back at the same time every night and I let them know ahead of time where I'm going. This isn't a big deal, except that if I don't pick up (phone on silent from work, or I'm doing something, or I just plainly didn't hear) or dont call back within like 10 mins, shit hits the fan instantly. I can't even go see a movie without a freak out about how she is worried about me and can't get to sleep until I come home. 

Most recently I went to a friends lake house for the weekend. My phone had no service out there, and after trying to call a few times, I texted them that I had made it since there was enough service for a text to slip through. An hour later my friend gets a call from my mom and she is freaking out on the phone and apparently never got the text. This crossed the line. She had called my friend after looking through the cell phone bill and getting his number from there. This was so embarrassing and this is not the first time this has happened.

I've tried to explain myself that them constantly hovering is hurting my self esteem and confidence, but their response is that their emotional health is more important than me suffering a bit of embarrassment from my friends. Especially since, according to them, there's crazy people on the road and they wanted to make sure I didn't crash. (Btw I have never gotten a ticket and have never even put as much as a scratch on any car I've ever driven)

I confronted them about everything and probably had my first emotional break down in many years. What started as a conversation turned into a huge argument about how I don't care about them and didn't resolve anything. They said i should have used my friends phone to call them, but i didnt want to since they would save the number and would probably call them looking for me after ive gone ""missing"" for 15 mins at some future point (this has already happened several times while I've been in the shower or they call me at an unreasonable time). I don't know how to deal with them. I really want to blow them off out of spite but I know it would just make everything even worse. If I don't do anything about it though, it will just continue. At least its temporary and I will be graduating soon and hopefully move as far away as possible for my job"

Now it is apparent that I must pick one. For me, the reveal of the program was absolutely stunning, although shamefully not surprising. I had a very generous offer to intern on Obama's campaign last year and I turned it down. Now I know why. I'm very glad I did.

Case in point, what I've been experiencing is disillusionment. I think a lot of people my age have become increasingly libertarian as the episode has played out, and there is a genuine drive to do something.

However, it is increasingly clear to me that there is a certain course of action that must be taken. As of right now and for the next four years,  we are not dealing with a government that cares to listen to the people who put it into power. Congress is in the pocket of corporate and security interests and Obama is using lawyer doublespeak to downplay the scope and power of the program, which makes me fear that the NSA and other security agencies are acting independently of the elected government.

Therefore, I've also been disillusioned with rt4's direction as well. The people calling the shots are not the same as the people we elected, and the people we elected are not interested in input from the electorate. The legitimacy of the American government should not come from the faceless idea of ""national security,"" but rather the individual Americans it is designed to serve. The people should have the right to question or revoke the legitimacy they grant at any time.

What I am trying to say, in short, is thank you for creating this subreddit. I was worried the protests on the fourth would spark and then fizz out, but I'm confident some kind of movement will live on, and I'd like to offer my help in any way it is needed. "
1gyakr,20,2013-06-24,2000 miles seemed to do the trick...hope it lasts,illogicalhuman,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gyakr/2000_miles_seemed_to_do_the_trickhope_it_lasts/,"Wall of text!

My story probably isn't unique. I've been a ""problem drinker"" for almost 5 years - it began as a maladaptive strategy to deal with the unexpected death of someone close to me, and then I never really stopped. I knew all along it was a problem. At first I didn't care, but once I started to care, I found it wasn't very easy to stop. I really have no idea how I've made it so far in life in spite of myself. I went through periods where I'd drink daily and wake up with a hangover 4 or 5 days of the week. I was drinking secretly and struggling with terrible anxiety. I'd have brief periods of remission that might last a couple weeks, during which I'd ""only"" drink (read: get wasted) on the weekends, but I always fell back to drinking at least a bottle of wine 4-6 days of the week - sometimes much more.

I have a great boyfriend who I don't think really knows how bad I was sometimes, although he has mentioned that I'm not a ""pleasant"" drunk (this statement was made after a particularly embarrassing incident that I won't get into). After that I made it a point not to get drunk around him, but since he is so busy (he is working on a graduate degree) I have plenty of opportunity to drink without him. Somehow, I still managed to hold down a part-time research job while also working on a graduate degree - I'm going to graduate in 6 months from a top school, and I landed a great internship on the other side of the country, which is where I'm currently at.

At first I made a promise to myself that I'd take it easy out here and not drink very much - I'd be too poor to keep up my habits, anyway. That lasted about 4 days. I spent too much money on booze (hey, I had to try all the new craft beers - that was my excuse), and my anxiety was awful. But something clicked in me last week that made me realize what a big waste it all was. Here I was, with the opportunity of a lifetime to experience a different part of the country and really excel at this internship, and I was throwing it away for...craft beer? To get too drunk to remember going to sleep and feeling terrible and worthless in the morning? Not to mention the fact that the long-distance aspect of my relationship was made about 100x worse by my alcohol-induced anxiety. I decided 9 days ago that I really needed to make a concerted effort to quit.

In 9 days, I've made incredible progress at my internship, gone to 4 yoga classes, improved my diet, and started watching Star Trek TOS from the beginning (note: I love Star Trek, but I don't think I've ever seen an episode sober. It's so much better when you can remember the details...). I average about 10 miles a day walking and exploring. This morning I woke up at 7:30 to walk 3 miles to go to a yoga class, VOLUNTARILY. I can't remember the last time I woke up at 7:30 on a weekend feeling so refreshed and energized. In a phone conversation yesterday, my bf expressed appreciation that I've been so much more understanding about his stress levels and this whole long distance thing (it's amazing how much easier it is to have empathy and understanding when you aren't constantly suffering from alcohol anxiety!).

The crazy thing is...It's only been 9 days, but I don't even miss it. I hope this lasts. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and now I'm really experiencing life for the first time in forever.

TL;DR I replaced alcohol with tea and yoga and my life is 10000000x better."
1gyaj6,419,2013-06-24,[Series] Heat Haze Delirium: Tales of a Social Worker Part III,onikakushi,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1gyaj6/series_heat_haze_delirium_tales_of_a_social/,"“On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.” – Fight Club

While I cannot argue with this poignant analysis of the human condition, I do however propose a secondary clause with which to more fully flesh this concept out for our behemoth brethren.

“The survival rate for a person suffering from fat logic is derived by a figure of the calories consumed and is on a direct inverse proportion to the number of simultaneous sufferers they are in contact with at any given time.”

Now, I realize that in most circles the use of anecdotal evidence falls far below the standards set by the burden of proof—however, in the case of planetary bodies I believe we can all agree that a preponderance of evidence is more than sufficient for our purposes.

Thus, I will today spin you another yarn from my days as a job center intern that I believe will illustrate why I believe this amendment holds weight under scrutiny (although, with the size of the bodies involved, I doubt you would have to strain your eyes).

For those of us who are newcomers to the series or merely would like to once again regale themselves with the previous two installments, you can find part one [here](http://redd.it/1gthdi) and part two [here](http://redd.it/1gvxza). 

At any rate, the curtain raises a good year and a half into my internship. Over the course of my time at the center I had become rather familiar with not only the job and the often *interesting* clientele, but also with the various personalities of my fellow coworkers. 

Sadly, the dream that I would one day escape the horrors of cliques and lunchroom drama I was first exposed to in my youth had remained nothing more than just that—a pipe dream. For here in my office it was much the same as it had always been—the people were bigger and wore business casual but their behavior remained the same: dumb.

While I am most certainly guilty of allowing brief lapses of “Peter Pan Syndrome” in my life, I try for the most part to be a level-headed adult.

However, it seemed that for the rest of my cohorts in minimum wage job placement Neverland was their constant abode. Indeed, many times the lunchroom resembled something more akin to the Jungle Book than to the grimy concrete dungeon it was in reality.

Like any other social circle, regardless of its location, there will always be groups of people who need to be avoided if one hopes to maintain any shred of their sanity—at the job center however, this was everyone.

Truly, after the first few weeks of trial and error seating arrangements, I came to the stark realization that if I meant to make it out of this internship in one piece, I must eat alone.

So eat alone I did—as mentioned in the previous chapter, my makeshift ‘office’ became a bastion of hope and tranquility. Within its perfectly whitewashed concrete block walls I found a peace the likes of which I had never appreciated before. Where others saw a cramped poorly-lit room, I saw a blossoming Eden which offered me protection and parlay from the waves of insanity outside its confines. 

Nirvana, thy name is utility closet.

For many a cheeseburger did I slowly munch away the delicious minutes of solitude in my concrete cubicle—all was right with the world.

That was of course until the air conditioner broke.

As though Eve herself had been tricked once more into eating the forbidden fruit, I was cast from my concrete garden into the barren wasteland of the lunchroom. 

Not even my car which sat dutifully in the parking lot patiently awaiting my rump to grace its leather seats could spare me from the hell which had befallen me. Due to my status as a struggling university student on a strict budget, I could not afford to go out to eat for lunch most days—and I was thus left with no choice in the matter.

I would have to eat in the lunchroom.

This stark reality hit me harder than the sugar rush you get the first time you drink a Mountain Dew—and as I slowly made my way to the employee eatery my shaking hands only acted to complete the metaphor.

As I briskly seated myself in the furthest corner of the room, like a civil war minute-man staring into a wall of soldiers he soon would charge into I surveyed my surroundings.

The room in and of itself was not notably horrid in any way—in fact I would go so far as to say that in the absence of people it would be a suitable place to eat. However, as the Grateful Dead so dutifully noted, “everything has a touch of grey.” And while it remained the only eating space with windows that opened in the building, it still left much to be desired.

See, this lunchroom didn’t merely service those who directly worked with me up front in the job center—oh no, it accommodated **every** worker in the building. Most notably, the small platoon of burgeoning berthas which made up the phone staff and various secretaries made up a good 70% of the ‘regulars.’

As anyone who has worked in an office complex will likely attest, there is no singular group of people in such a place who are louder, bring more drama, and are larger than the secretaries and phone operators. Their rotund rears and blistering BMIs were already enough to drive even the hungriest of men to starvation, but their personalities would have been banned in the Geneva Convention.

In my first few weeks at the office, I mentioned that I had attempted to brave the lunchroom—the Berthas (as they will be referred to from now on) were the reason I had left. Their constant chatter of the newest cubicle drama, that new fad diet, and of course who had gotten ‘fat’ were all just appetizers to their main course: groupthink.

I can only assume that as new secretaries are hired, they are slowly molded by the berthas until they too are an utterly delusional landwhale in plus sized women’s clothing.

Each more deluded then the last—while more than happy to sop up the newest juicy details like a fresh bun sops up mustard of how their bosses had ‘let themselves go,’ would seamlessly transition to how each of them was looking ‘thinner and sexier’ than the day before.

Their sheer bitchiness and undeserved narcissism had disgusted me to the point where I would wear headphones during eating—not necessarily the best option, but better than the Bertha’s banter by a long shot.

In the wake of the air conditioner malfunction the lunchroom had taken on a new feel—that of a refugee camp. All the displaced prisoners of hot air had relocated themselves to the area for a breath of fresh air.

Needless to say, as the lions in the Serengeti fiercely protect their watering hole, these real life hungry hippos were not keen on sharing their space with the ‘intruders.’

Of the 20 or so women (I use that term loosely) who made up the Berthas, their social order was clearly dominated by their leader—Rotund Rachel and her orbiting moon Planetary Patricia. These two were hambeasts of the highest order—true apex predators in their ecosystem. The rest of the Berthas were quick to fall into a lockstep whenever either even was so much as to clear their throat.

While Planetary Patricia and most of the remaining cursory members of the Berthas fit well into a category of hamplanetry—they paled in comparison to Rotund Rachel. Indeed, Rotundra (as she will now be referred to as) was a class all her own. Her name was not only derived as merely an alliteration to her name, but as a reference to the fact that she was much wider than tall. At a meager 5’0’’ Rotundra’s midsection seemed to bend space and time within its many rolls and layers. It seemed as though her body was in a constant state of combat with itself, with each feature attempting to distort itself further from the norm in an effort to be noticeable—this was aided in no way by her severe overuse of makeup. The Bertha’s clown-like war-paint was a point of constant ‘one up-ery’ within their pack, and Rotunda spared no expense in donning the suit of her ancestors. 

To only further complicate Rotundra’s myriad of problems, as mentioned above, the Bertha’s customary ritual involved complimenting their proud leader at all times—without question. Thus, the only thing in the room that approached Rotundra’s massive size was her completely undeserved ego and pride—a dangerous combination, to say the least.

During my tenure at the office, I had heard through word of mouth that Rotundra already suffered from a slew of medical issues related to her weight. These conditions and ailments ranged from the obligatory sleep apnea, to the beetus and all the way to 2 (**two**) heart attacks. The second of these had been nearly fatal and had necessitated a three week hospital stay and a continued medication regiment to keep her heart in check.

However, as per Bertha by-laws—nobody could say a damn thing about it. Even as she stuffed countless cholesterol packed death traps and chewed her way each day towards and early grave, the Berthas showered her with nothing but compliments on her ‘slim figure.’

So when it came down to the issue of the intruders in their territory, it only followed that Rotundra would lead the charge to vanquish the newcomers attempting to get a breath of fresh air at *their* lunchroom.

Over the next few days I began to notice a dwindling number of my comrades showing up for lunch. It made no sense however as the AC was still nowhere near fixed, and temperatures in most of the building were spiking at around 85F+. I knew something must be up, and luckily the Bertha’s triumphant whale song echoed across the room to my ears.

“I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT ROTUNDRA!” shouted one of the Berthas.

“YEAH, BLACK MAILING THOSE IDIOTS IN I.T. WAS A GREAT IDEA, WE GOT OUR SPACE BACK NOW!” another chimed in.

“TEEHEEHE, I’M THE BEST—I KNOW, ONLY A FEW ARE LEFT NOW, BUT I GOTS A PLAN DON’T WORRY,” I heard Rotundra spit out along with her half eaten brownie.

The shrieking blubber butts continued their victory cheers with another wave of compliments for their lard-soaked leader, “OH YOU LOOK SO GOOD TODAY TOO ROTUNDRA, TALK ABOUT KICKING ASS IN YOUR HIGH HEELS!”

Rotundra basked in her undeserved glory and shook the table with her massive guttural laughs and sickening attempts at modesty. 

To the audience, this is the point in the story where I wish I could convey my acts of bravery and wit in the face of fat oppression—but sadly I did not have the testicular fortitude required to stand up to an entire pack of wild orcas during feeding.

However, the following Friday temperatures had spiked to the low 90s and everyone was dealing with it poorly—even the most civil coworkers had become spiteful, and the Berthas were a sight to behold (not that anyone could possibly pick any of them up though). 

Their overworked sweat glands feverishly tried to flood their bodies with cooling, but were failing miserably. Their clown paint was slowly melting down their faces as if they themselves were becoming pieces of Picasso’s finest works, but nevertheless they chowed down in perfect form.

Only a few members of the office refugees still remained dedicated to eating their lunch in a somewhat cool(er) space, as the rest had been chased off in one manner or another by Rotundra and her gang. The three of us sat in silence at the one table that the Berthas had not claimed and quickly attempted to chow down as quickly as possible so as to escape this proverbial porky purgatory, but we had no such luck.

The heat was getting to Rotundra, and she wanted us gone—now. She walked (hovered, as her legs were not visible under her stomach) over to us and immediately demanded that we leave.

“YOU GUYS AREN’T WELCOME HERE, IT’S TOO HOT SINCE YOU GUYS ARE TAKING UP ALL THE COOL AIR FROM THAT WINDOW,” she bellowed while slamming her flippers unceremoniously upon the table.

Tom from the tech department replied in my stead, “shut up you fat heifer, can’t you see we’re eating—and there are 6 windows and 20 or so of you, do the math.”

Obviously shocked at his snappy response Rotunda proceeded to slam the table a few more times and scream at him, “THIS IS MY LUNCH ROOM, DON’T MAKE US MAKE YOU LEAVE!”

“Try me,” he growled, “I doubt your udders would allow you keep up with me though.”

As she readied herself for a full frontal assault on our foodstuffs and perhaps Tom himself, she suddenly fell backwards and gripped her chest while gasping for breath.

No way.

As she flailed around on the ground in true beached whale fashion, the Berthas slowly realized this was not a strategic move—something was wrong.

As fast as their kankles would allow them to travel, the Berthas rushed to Rotundra’s side, screaming for someone to call 911.

Rotundra was pronounced dead by the time the EMS medics made it down to the lunchroom—cause of death, you guessed it…a heart attack caused by extreme high cholesterol. 

Following Rotundra’s death, word spread quickly that she had not been taking her medications regularly—supposedly due in large part to the Bertha’s constant reaffirming that she was the picture of health.

In her wake, Planetary Patricia was quick to fill the sizable gap left behind by Rotundra and acted as the new leader of the Bertha’s until the day I left my post around a year later.

In closing, as I stated at the outset of this story—a person suffering from fatlogic has a greatly decreased life expectancy based upon the number of other fatlogic sufferers surrounding him or her.

**TL;DR – A pack of orcas attempt to maintain apex predator status in a concrete fish tank. Their leader pays the ultimate price for her status as queen beetus and her pack continues post-mortem.**

1gy7u9,1,2013-06-24,Are they nice to the interns because of HR issues?,harriswill,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/1gy7u9/are_they_nice_to_the_interns_because_of_hr_issues/,"Compelete speculation here;

It seems insane that every time a guy goes after the female interns (Rob Bartlett, Davey Mac) O&amp;A try to snuff out the bit. It's completely out of character cause other than that teen mom recently, any stuck up ""hot chick"" have received absolute wrath on the show (Listen to Ashley Dupre interview from a few years back if you disagree).

Is it possible Opie took on these girl interns as a favor for Brother Wease, and now can't go after them for fear that they'll run to HR and get interns off the show for an extended time again? Intern Stevie was 18 months with no intern, who knows how long a potential sexual harassment charge would be?

Again this is all speculation, and the only reason I bring this up is because O&amp;A&amp;J have never done anything to sacrifice the content of the show without a good reason, and this is the only one I can think of.

If you can think of an explanation like this I'd love to hear. There's no way a couple of 7's can throw off the show like what's happened."

*Episode Story*

Synopsis: Marshall was found ""coloring in his butt"" by Barney, who offered to take Marshall to his tailor and get him a suit for 1/3 the price. Marshall tried to refuse, but Barney tore his pants, forcing him to come to buy a new suit for his wedding and interview. Victoria meets Lily and Robin at the bar, where Lily is looking at wedding dresses. Victoria offers to take Lily to some wedding boutiques to try on dresses. At the bar, Victoria gets a call offering her a baking fellowship in Germany. Victoria and Ted talk about it, and decide to meet up later to talk about what they should do, after giving it some thought. 

Ted, Barney and Marshall, all at Barney's tailor, talk about Ted's decision and Marshall's suit. The tailor is located at the back of a pet store, making the place look sketchy. Meanwhile, the ladies are shopping for Lily's dress. Robin is trying to convince Victoria to choose Germany over Ted. Lily tries to tell Robin to quit it, saying that Robin had her chance and to let Victoria and Ted be happy with each other. Over at Barney's tailor, Barney is trying to tell Ted to tell Victoria to go, saying how he barely knows her. Marshall and Ted come to the consensus that long distance would not be an option. They all ponder the idea if they could be soulmates. 

Marshall accidently buys a $12000 suit (at 1/3 price) and Lily rips a several thousand dollar dress. Forcing Marshall to take the job at **BARNEY CORP**. 

When Ted and Victoria meet up, Ted asks her to stay (despite coming to the ""date"" with telling her to go in mind) after she gives him a cupcake. She immediately responds with ""I have to go to Germany"". They discredit long distance, and Victoria asks Ted to go to Germany with her, which he refuses. They break up.

Marshall suggests the next day that instead of breaking up a day early, they spend Victoria's last day in America together doing ""awesome air kicks"". Ted proposes the idea to Victoria, and they plan out all the things they want to do for the day. They do none of them, they just have sex all day. Classic Schmosby. 

When Ted drops Victoria off at the airport, they decide at the last minute to try long distance.

*Character Development*


What steps, if any, did Barney take toward (or back from) being able to trust the world again? None

What steps, if any, did Robin take toward (or back from) resolving her doubts about her own self-worth and ability to be loved?

Other than her extreme try to get Victoria out of the country, not much. Lily told her that she had her chance, and that she should lay off. Robin also expresses her somewhat discontent with her ""work, work, work"" mentality, expressing how ""there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description""


What steps, if any, did Ted take toward (or back from) developing an identity independent of family, friends, or girlfriends? 

Not many, nothing significant other than him making a spur of the moment decision to ask Victoria to stay. 

What steps, if any, did Lily take toward (or back from) being able to commit herself to a relationship as a spouse or parent?

None.

What steps, if any, did Marshall take toward (or back from) making his life count for something meaningful? 

He stepped backwards when he accepted the internship at Barney Corp.

My name is Josh. I'm 22 years old and a native of Southern California. I currently live in Irvine, CA.

I also work part-time for the Irvine Unified School District as an instructional assistant in a preschool classroom, and I just ended an internship in a 4th grade classroom.

Call of Duty 3 was my first CoD, and I've played every single one since then. I have about 12 days logged in MW3, and 4 days of multiplayer combined from CoD4 - Black Ops 1. However, it wasn't until about 7 days into Black Ops 2 that I really became a competent player. Black Ops 2 is the only Call of Duty game in which I hold a positive KDR, and it still is one that is unremarkable. (1.25) I'm not sure what exactly clicked. Whether it was some deep-rooted desire to improve, my increased play frequency, or my recent acquisition of a SCUF and Kontrol Freeks, etc. Some factors finally came together for me, and I went from being a ""struggle to go positive"" player to one who can achieve the higher scorestreaks on a fairly consistent basis.


I left Reddit Casual in order to join Reddit Black a few months ago. I made the move because I was more interested in pubstomping and playing with competition-minded players. However, nowadays, my interests in CoD have blurred to the point where I'm not exactly sure why I'm even part of a ""clan"" in the first place. I try and treat both Casual and Black as an extension as my friends list, as sometimes I'm in the mood for grinding League, and other times, I'm in the mood for 3 hours of Border Patrol.


Outside of Call of Duty, I have a lot of other interests.


I'm an avid fisherman. I'm a big fan of everything spanning from freshwater bass fishing to fishing hundreds of miles offshore for Bluefin Tuna. ""Piscator"" is actually Latin for ""fisherman""; it's served as my internet moniker for almost a decade.


I love to snowboard. I typically enjoy riding places such as Mammoth Mountain (CA) , Lake Tahoe (CA), Brian Head (UT), and local mountains in Big Bear, CA. You've probably heard of Big Bear during the recent Chris Dorner shootings. It was the mountain town in which he was hiding.

I also go to college in a separate town from work and home-home.

I have one more refill left on my pill packs, and I've been considering getting an IUD or the arm implant. From what I've read, many women on Reddit have a few weeks between their initial IUD consultation and IUD insertion. This makes me think I should find a new gyno either in worktown or schooltown since I might not be able to get the IUD the same week I'm home. 

I would be ok with getting an IUD from a gyno in worktown, but I'm nervous about having issues over the summer that would take away from being able to work. If I find a gyno in schooltown, I'd have to wait until at least September to get it and I'd have to call for more pill pack refills. That's not a huge deal, but I'm not sure if my gyno will refill them without an exam.

I'm kind of leaning towards going ahead and finding a gyno in worktown for the summer so I can go ahead and switch methods. Have any of you been in a similar situation where you moved around a lot and had to accommodate your BC accordingly? What do you think?"

Below is his self written obituary. My family is extremely proud of his accomplishments and his work has inspired me to enter the medical field. I was wondering though if yall could give me some more info on the procedure he developed with Dr. Longmire. My family is also at a loss as what to do with the substantial number of annual medical journals, texts, papers, etc left behind. Thank you all for your time. 





John Mann Beal, Jr., M.D. of Valdosta, died Monday, June 3, 2013, at South Georgia Medical Center. Born in Starkville, Mississippi, on November 18, 1915, son of John Mann Beal and Anna McBee Beal. At the age of 13, he moved to Chicago when his father was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of Chicago. He attended the University of Chicago High School, College and Medical School, receiving his M.D. in 1941.  

He was appointed surgical intern at The New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center in New York City, July 1, 1941 and served on the resident staff until June 30, 1943. He married Mary Phemister of Chicago, Illinois, February 20, 1943. In July, he was inducted in the United States Military service where he served as a surgeon in evacuation hospitals in the U.S. 7th Army until his discharge as a Major on September 26, 1946.  

Dr. Beal returned to the resident staff of The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center October 1, 1946 and completed his training as Chief Surgical Resident in 1948. After six months as a surgical fellow, he was recruited by Dr. William P. Longmire, Jr. as Assistant Professor of Surgery in the initial faculty of the recently formed U.C. L. A. Medical School in Los Angeles. In 1950 he was appointed Chief Surgeon at Wadsworth General V. A. Hospital, the U.C. L. A. teaching hospital at that time. It was during this time that he and Dr. Longmire developed the procedure of interposition of a segment of jejunum between the esophagus and duodenum to replace the stomach for a total gastrectomy.  

In 1953, he accepted an appointment to The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center as Attending Surgeon, The New York Hospital and Associate Professor of Clinical Surgery, Cornell University Medical College, positions that he held until 1963.  

In 1963 he assumed the positions of Chairman of the Department of Surgery, Northwestern University Medical School, Chief, Division of Surgery, Passavant Memorial Hospital, and Chairman, Department of Surgery, Chicago Wesley Memorial Hospital. He also served as Consultant in Surgery, Veterans Administration Lakeside Hospital, Chicago. Dr. Beal was instrumental in the union of Passavant Memorial Hospital and Chicago Wesley Memorial in 1973 to form the Northwestern Memorial Hospital. He was a strong supporter of the development of the formation of the Northwestern Medical Center which incorporated the Evanston Hospital, Evanston, Illinois and the Chicago Children's Memorial Hospital with Passant and Wesley.  

Dr. Beal participated in a number of medical organizations. He was certified by the American Board of Surgery in 1950, and in 1965, he was appointed as a member of the American Board of Surgery and served as Chairman of the Board 1970-1971. He was President of the Central Surgical Association 1972-1973. He was appointed to the Board of Regents of the American College of Surgeons in 1974 and served as Chairman of the Board from 1980-1982. He was elected President of the American College of Surgeons 1982-1983. He served on the editorial boards of the American Medical Association Archives of Surgery, the New York State Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of Surgery.  

At Northwestern University, Dr. Beal was appointed J. Roscoe Miller Distinguished Professor 1981-1984. He received the Distinguished Service Award from the University of Chicago in 1975. He was elected President of the Chicago Surgical Society 1978-1979 and served as Chairman of Surgery B Study Section of the National Institutes of Health 1976-1978. He was appointed to the Council of Medical Specialty Societies in 1977 where he served as Treasurer 1977-78, Secretary 1979-80 and Vice President 1981-82.  

Dr. Beal held memberships in the Society of University Surgeons, the Society of Clinical Surgeons, the American Medical Association, The American Surgical Association, the Pan American Medical Associations, the Chicago Medical Society, the Western Surgical Association, the Illinois Surgical Society, the Societe Inernationale de Chirurgie, the Institute of Medicine of Chicago, the Southern Surgical Association, and served on the Residency Review Committee for Surgery from 1972-1978. He had 190 scientific publications.  

Dr. Beal retired in 1984. He had made his home in Valdosta for the past 18 years."
1h2fjy,3,2013-06-25,"First time posting here. Very long post, as-well as a few questions for those that can help.",[deleted],asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1h2fjy/first_time_posting_here_very_long_post_aswell_as/,"I apologize for this wall of text being really long, but I wanted to include some details for my situation as-well as my personal story.  Let me start off by saying this isn't another post asking whether or not I am transgender.  I have already done my time with a therapist and have been given the okay to see a doctor to start hormones.  **TL;DR**:  The last paragraph is where the questions are, so....yeah.  So first of all, my story thus far.  


  About two years ago in February, I managed to work up the confidence to tell my parents.  I left my mother a letter to read rather than being direct.  She read it and intern gave it to my father to read.  My mother called me down from my room that night and cried with me on the stairs about how she was so sorry this had happened and how she felt responsible that I wasn't able to tell them sooner.  Both of my parents, primarily my mother, were accepting of this and have been very supportive.  A few weeks later, I went to see a therapist for help regarding this.  She said that I was indeed transgender and helped me work through many of my problems.  After about three months of this, I had reached the point where I could go and get started on hormones.  This is where I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life thus far.  I decided to put off hormones until I had graduated high school.  


   At the time, I was a junior in high school, soon to be a senior as this was around the end of May.  For years, I had always been considered an outcast and spent my time alone.  At school, I sat by myself, I ate lunch by myself, and had very few friends.  Nobody talked to me, and I didn't talk to them.  I rarely left the house and didn't have a job.  I also had to put up with my brother and his friends picking on me for my lack of confidence and being overweight (I weighed around 290 at this time.)  So, thus, hormones were going to postponed until after I graduated, a full year away.  


   My senior year was actual hell, as I couldn't stand to look in the mirror at myself, was constantly depressed, and spent most nights crying myself to sleep.  I never went as far as to consider suicide, but I wouldn't be surprised to have considered it at the time.  Also, for some reason, puberty decided to destroy me mentally and emotionally.  I experienced hair growth all over my body, from my legs, chest, back, arms, pits, and cracks and crevasses.  My voice also started to deepen, as what used to be neutral was now lowering more and more.  My current voice isn't too low, but it's not exactly high either (maybe around average.)  I needed something to take my mind off of all this, so I started being more sociable and outgoing with the friends I did have.  This greatly boosted my confidence, but I still had plenty of issues to deal with.  Thus, I started taking steps to bring down my weight.  Currently, this consists of not drinking soda (only drinking water and sometimes tea,) not eating desserts such as cake and ice cream, 30 minutes every day of running, and being a vegetarian.  So far, I manage to go from a starting point of 290 to my current weight of 228, with a future goal of under 200.  


  The end of my senior year was where I began to experience one of those ""the clouds are clearing, the sun is shining"" kind of moments where I was finally done with high school and could begin hormones.  Or so I thought.  I'm not really sure why, but putting it off made me more afraid to begin hormones.  I was already admitted to a university (UCCS in case anyone's curious,) so the only thing I could think of was college.  I wanted to transition, but still was a bit lacking in confidence and was afraid of what could happen.  Thus, I focused more on college and transitioning was put off.  As a result, I started to experience those feelings of disgust and depression about my own body again.  I still had body hair, I was still overweight, and I absolutely hated being male and being referred to as as a guy and being told I should play football due to being a ""big guy.""  


  Finally, I reached the point where enough was enough.  I finally scheduled another appointment with my therapist (more so because I needed someone to help.)  The first visit, I explained my situation and she helped me sort things out and get over the reasons I had put off transitioning.  Finally, I was ready to start my transition, with my first step being hormones.  


  Now, this is where I need some help/advise.  I managed to get an appointment scheduled, but it isn't until September 11th ;~; .  I'm already dealing with being a ""male big guy"" and it really sucks to have to put up with being like this until September.  So my question is, what are some things I can do until then to help pass the time that would be beneficial towards transitioning (if that made any sense?)  I have already started shaving my legs and am looking into laser to get rid of chest and back hair.  I've also started buying women's underwear because, to be honest, I hated wearing men's underwear and it allows my to wear something under my male clothing.  Currently, the only other thing I have to do is lose weight (currently 228, trying to get below 200) and continue working at my part time job.  If anyone has any tips or suggestions of things I could do that would be beneficial towards transitioning while I wait for September to come, I would greatly appreciate it.  Also, if anyone has any relevant resources, that would also be appreciated.  Another question I had has to do with names.  I'm still working on the name I want to take after transitioning, so I need some help/opinions.  Currently, I have a first and middle name already picked out.  Currently, that consists of Luna as the first name and Autumn as the middle name.  If anyone has an opinion on this, that would be great.  Also, is it common or normal to change your last name after transitioning?  I really don't like my current last name and would rather pick a different one (if at all possible, if anyone has any ideas, that would also be great.)  Thank you for your time and I apologize if this post doesn't make sense or had errors."

I do not have a lot of time to study for the MCAT this summer, as I have to work a full time job.  This job is in the medical field, and I have had several internships and jobs in the medical field.  What would everyone recommend a person in my shoes would choose? Keep in mind the future of healthcare in the USA, and how it would affect both positions.  Feel free to include your association to the medical field, so I can see how an MD treats the role of a PA and vice versa.  I need to make up my mind soon, and cannot seem to pin down which one I want to choose, since this is a huge decision.  I have sought plenty of advice from my mentors, and know that I want to help people in a clinical setting rather than research, but as hard as I have tried I have not had that final definitive moment of realization between these two lifestyles.  Many thanks in advance for all of your help and advice. Peace "

My name is Joseph and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, I am interested in relocating and have been interested in spending more time in Boston since visiting there several years back. 

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1h1ges,7,2013-06-25,RWF BATTLEGROUND 6/24 PART 2,RWFInternational,RWF,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWF/comments/1h1ges/rwf_battleground_624_part_2/,"[Muse - Citizens Erased
plays as James LaFontaine makes his way down the entrance ramp, though his usual bows to the audience are replaced with semi-polite waves.]

Andrews: James LaFontaine looks to get back on track and pick up a victory here tonight in Milwaukee.

Slam: He might need a change in his goody-two-shoes attitude if he's going to do it against the cornerstone of the foundation! Maybe he's learned a thing or two from his recent internship with the Glorious Nation of Hurtsville.

Announcer: From New Haven, Connecticut, James LaFontaine!

[Sparks fly from the ringposts as LaFontaine enters the ring, bowing to the audience]

Announcer: And from Stone Mountain, Georgia... Troy Stone!

[Nightwish - Last Ride of the Day plays as Troy, Jim, and Roy Firestone make their way down the entrance ramp. Fans in the front row are displaying brightly-colored and surprisingly well-spelled signs proclaiming 'GAUCHO GHANOUSH' and 'GAUCHO PARMESAN', much to the dismay of Jim. Roy tells him to ignore them as Troy climbs into the ring.]

[The referee calls for the bell, however he is distracted momentarily by Roy trying to calm Jim down at ringside. LaFontaine takes advantage and pokes Stone in the eye, followed by a kick to the gut and a snap suplex as the ref gets back to the action]

Slam: See, that's how you get off to a fast start. Take advantage of these idiots in the crowd.

[LaFontaine goes for a quick cover off the suplex, but Stone kicks out at one. LaFontaine locks in a side headlock briefly, but Stone makes it to his feet and fights out of it. The two opponents back off for a moment before locking into a collar-and-elbow tie-up. The larger Stone pushes LaFontaine back into a corner, and the ref breaks them up slowly. As they slowly unlock, LaFontaine slaps Stone upside the head, drawing the admonishment of the ref.]

Andrews: A bit of newfound attitude perhaps from Mister LaFontaine?

[Stone, to his credit, doesn't take the bait and backs to the center of the ring, motioning for LaFontaine to join him. The crowd begins to chant ""YOU'RE AN EGGPLANT!"" clap--clap--clap-clap-clap, much to the chagrin of Jim and Roy on the outside.]

Andrews: Fans having a little fun tonight at the expense of Jim the Gaucho!

Slam: Well, what do you expect? This is Milwaukee after all.

[Stone goes for another collar-and-elbow, but LaFontaine ducks under and behind, clasping his hands
around Stone's midsection. Stone tries a couple elbows, missing LaFontaine's head, before LaFontaine lands a German suplex. Stone, landing awkwardly, rolls to his side. Lafontaine kicks him over to his stomach, stomps on the small of Stone's back, and locks in a single-leg Boston Crab on Stone's left leg]

Andrews: Nice strategy here, keep the bigger man grounded and wear down his base.

[Stone, in obvious pain, struggles to drag himself towards the ropes. He makes it there, though LaFontaine refuses to break the hold. The ref, getting annoyed, begins his count. One! Two! Three! Four! Lafontaine finally releases the hold, only to stomp on Stone's knee before backing away]

Andrews: Risking a disqualification there!

Slam: He's got 'till five! He's damn well gonna use the full count!

[Stone uses the ropes to climb to his feet, as the crowd's chant has changed to ""GAUCHO'S TASTY""! clap--clap--clap-clap-clap. As soon as Stone releases the ropes, LaFontaine lands a low dropkick right to the Stone's left knee, knocking him down. LaFontaine stands over Stone, lifts up his ankle, and drops an elbow to the knee. Up, and another elbow. Up, and yet another elbow! Lafontaine with the cover as the ref counts ONE! TWO! Stone kicks out at two.]

Andrews: LaFontaine in control, Stone has got to get some momentum going!

[LaFontaine, frustrated, stomps and Stone's chest before climbing to the top rope. He stands atop the top turnbuckle, survey's his opponent for a moment before leaping, but Stone rolls out of the way! Both combatants are down as the ref begins counting, but Stone makes it to his feet first at five. As LaFontaine makes it to his feet, Stone meets him with a massive running/limping lariat! Stone, shaking his left leg to get feeling back into his knee, waits a moment as LaFontaine gets back up, but greets him with another lariat!]

Andrews: Stone back in control, this could be the turning point of the match!

Slam: I hate you so much right now. Let me guess, ""vintage"" Troy Stone?

[LaFontaine, sensing Stone getting the upper hand, rolls out of the ring near Jim and Roy. As the crowd now chants ""WE WANT EGGPLANT"", Roy struggles to keep the emotional, near-freaking-out Jim together. The ref admonishes them, letting LaFontaine sneak behind and reach into his boots, pulling out a set of brass knuckles. As Stone comes over to see what the fuss is about, LaFontaine rolls back into the far side of the ring, setting up for an assisted blow to the back of Stone's head. Stone turns, ducks the blow instinctively, and kicks LaFontaine hard in the gut, causing the brass knucks to go flying. Stone holds LaFontaine up into a suplex position, flips him, hoists him up for a moment, and hits the Stone Wall!]

Andrews: That has got to be it!

[The ref counts One! Two! Three! And calls for the bell]

Announcer: Here is your winner, Troy Stone!

[The crowd cheers as Jim and Roy climb into the ring, joining Troy in celebration as LaFontaine rolls out of the ring, collecting his brass knuckles before anyone notices]

Andrews: Gutsy performance tonight by Troy Stone!

Slam: Impressive comeback, indeed. Our next segment is brought to you by Esther's Eggplant Emporium, the largest Eggplant Distributor in the upper midwest! If you edgy for eggplant, its gotta be Esther's eggplants!

Andrews: We have no such... oh you're the worst kind of person. Let’s see if you can be less of a hindrance as we watch Damian Mitchell take on Joey Knight, right after this!

*COMME#RCIAL  - RWF BATTLEGROUND BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE WIZARD OF OZ – NOW ON TBS ALL THE FREAKING TIME! THANKS UNCLE TED!*

Andrews: Time now for a huge rematch, Rodney.  
 
Slam: That’s right, John. Two weeks ago, Joey Knight lost a bout for the International Title against Damian Mitchell. Tonight, in a non-title rematch, he gets a shot at redemption.  
 
Andrews: Let’s go to Laurie for the intros.  
 
*”Gregorian Chant” by the Benedictine Monks begins to play as the arena goes completely dark with smoke coming across the stage. Damian Mitchell raises from a platform in the stage wearing a long black cloak with a hood pulled over his face. A white, porcelain mask with red and black smears under the eyes like tears. Behind him, Corey and William Blaade walk slowly, almost like his heavies.*  
 
Laurie: This contest is set for one fall. Approaching the ring at this time...representing the Congregation...weighing in at 268 pounds...he is the RWF International Champion...Damian Miiiitchelllll.  
 
*Mitchell parades up the steps, stands on the apron, and flips the hood over as the Blaades nod in approval.*  
 
Laurie: And his opponent...  
 
*”When Johnny Comes Marching Home” blasts as the chorus of “Hoooorah!” is chanted by the crowd. Joey Knight hustles down the ramp hoisting Old Glory in the air and pointing to the ring.*  
 
Laurie: … from West Point...weighing in at 200 pounds...Joey Kniiiiiiight!  
 
Andrews: Here comes a true American hero!  
 
Slam: A hero? He’s trying to keep the Congregation from setting us free!  
 
*Knight hands his flag to a fan and gets in the ring as the ref calls for the bell slightly early.*  
 
DING DING DING  
 
*Mitchell and Knight circle on another. Knight reaches up for a test of strength, then gets kicked in the gut. Mitchell pounds Joey atop the shoulders and beats him down...and again...three times, in fact. Damian crouches down and connects with a short DDT, then stands up and motions to the sky.*  
 
Andrews: What a start for the religious guru.  
 
*Mitchell drops an elbow, but Knight rolls out of the way. A look of frustration cracks the kisser of Mitchell as we see the Blaades on the outside looking stoic. Knight quickly gets to his feet and hits a standing dropkick to the applause of the crowd.*  
 
Andrews: Great athleticism by the veteran.  
 
*Knight is building steam as he irish whips Damian to the rope and catches him with a belly-to-belly overhead suplex! Knight lets out a HOOO-RAAAAH with enthusiasm as Damian rolls out of the ropes to collect himself with his comrades.*  
 
Andrews: Can Joey Knight do the unthinkable? We’ll find out after this!  
 
C O M M E R C I A L  
 
*When we come back, Joey Knight has Damian in the ring in a rear chinlock. The crowd begins to chant “Let’s go Jo-ey! Clap clap clap clap clap (repeatedly)”. Knight begins to shake his legs, then Mitchell quickly does a double ear boxing to shut off the momentum. He walks over to the Blaades and nods at them, who both point to the sky. From behind, Knight reaches over and rolls him up in an inside cradle!*  
 
ONE  
TWO  
KICKOUT!  
 
*Knight seems to have a spring in his step as he gets up at the same time as Mitchell and they both stare down briefly. Mitchell gets a grin of approval as he nods at the veteran. Suddenly, William Blaade gets up on the apron, distracting the referee. On the back side of the ring, Corey Blaade slides across the canvas as Knight is briefly distracted, then eats a kick from Damian Mitchell.*  
 
Andrews: Oh come on, ref!  
 
*Mitchell hoists Knight up in a powerbomb position, then Corey helps him to steady the opponent as Mitchell slowly ascends to the second rope. The referee is still arguing with William Blaade as Damian holds Joey high in the sky...*  
 
Andrews: Don’t do this!  
 
*Corey reaches up as Damian lunges from the ropes as Corey SNAPS Joey Knight down with a neckbreaker!*  
 
Slam : Baptism by Fire! That’s gotta be all!  
 
*Suddenly, “Last Ride of the Day” by Nightwish begins to play as the crowd ERUPTS!*  
 
Andrews: Here comes the Stone Foundation! Finally someone is here to help!  
 
*Troy Stone slides into the ring and begins slugging with Damian Mitchell. Roy Firestone slides in behind Corey Blaade and hits a low blow, then executes the Rollover. William Blaade hits the ring, then eats a superkick to the jaw from Firestone and falls over face first. Firestone clubs Corey Blaade in the back then hoists him in the air for an electric chair, then holds him in the air as Troy Stone scampers outside and to the top rope.*  
 
Andrews: Now we’re fighting fire with fire!  
 
*Stone leaps off the top rope, catches Corey with his legs, then executes a hurricanrana, hurling Corey Blaade to the mat!*  
 
Andrews: What a move by Troy Stone!  
 
*Damian Mitchell has made his way outside with William Blaade as they drag a lifeless Corey outside with them and retreat up the ramp. The Foundation helps up Joey Knight as “Last Ride of the Day” plays.*  
 
Andrews: What a moment for Joey Knight finally getting help against these hooligans.  
 
Slam: Now we know who was on the phone with Drew Hardway this week. The Foundation has answered the call of the Board of Directors.  
 
Andrews: We’ll be back with more action in just a moment.

*ANOTHER COMMERCIAL*

[Don’t Cry for Me Argentina
plays through the Arena as Alan Lightbody comes out, yelling that he is the next King of Argentina! Amy Lightbody joins her uncle, much less enthused. She is followed by El Mondo Loco himself, who is clad in the flag of Argentina. Lightbody, still pointing at himself and yelling ""King of Argentina"" while gesturing for a crown on his head, leads his client and Amy down the ramp to the ring. Loco enters the ring, waves the flag several times before handing it down to Alan on the outside.]
Andrews: Great title opportunity tonight for Alan Lightbody's latest client, the enigmatic El Mondo Loco!
Slam: Show some respect, we're in the presence of royalty! That's His Highness, Alan Lightbody, to you, plebeian!

Laurie: And his opponent, from Helsinki Finland, he is your RWF Television Champion, MIIIIIIIIIIIIIKKOOOO PÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄTAAAAAAAALOOOOOOOO

[Korpiklaani - Tapporauta enters the arena as Mikko and Sara, clad in Milwaukee Admirals' hockey jerseys, come out to the delight of the crowd. The Finns shake hands with a few fans on their way to the ring, but are focused on the ring and their opponents. Mikko enters the ropes and hands the Television Championship Belt to the referee, who holds it up for the audience to see. Mikko rips off his hockey jersey to the delight of the ladies in the audience, and throws it into the fifth row, as Sara stands warily on the outside, eyes locked on Amy Lightbody.]

Andrews: Sara and Amy seem to have some unfinished business.

Slam: The can finish their business anytime, as long as I get to watch.

Andrews: You're sick.

Slam: And you're in denial, but that's besides the point, Mikko has a tough match ahead of him in his first defense of his newly-won Television Title. El Mondo Loco is the greatest superstar to ever come from Argentina, and with a King in his corner, he might be unstoppable.

DING DING DING

[Mikko and Loco circle each other quickly, and this match is underway. Loco extends his hand for a handshake, which Mikko accepts, while the two continue to circle an measure each other out.]

Andrews: Show of respect from two of RWF's top International stars.

[Loco and Mikko drop hands and immediately go for a collar-and-elbow tie-up, with neither man getting an advantage after a few moments of leveraging. They break clean and resume circling, as the ref checks that all of the ringside spectators are behaving themselves.]

[Loco and Mikko lock up again, this time Mikko gets the advantage and shoves Loco to the mat. Mikko runs past Loco for the ropes, Loco recovers to his feet, on the rebound Loco leapfrogs Mikko with a LOT
of air, but on the third try Mikko catches Loco with stiff clothesline, and immediately drops down on top of his fallen opponent, dropping elbows as Loco attempts to cover up his head.]
Andrews: A flurry from the fightin' Finn!

[Loco wisely reaches out and finds he is only a couple inches from the ropes, and scoots towards them, grabbing hold and making the ref warn Mikko to back off. Loco pulls himself up to his feet as Alan Lightbody yells at the ref, admonishing him for being so slow to break the combatants up. Sara's eyes remain unblinkingly locked onto Amy, even as she pulls out a cell phone and types away a message without so much as looking at the device.]

Slam: Good on ya, King Lightbody! This ref is showing obvious bias against his client!
[Loco and Mikko move in again, but Loco kicks Mikko in the shin, causing the Finn to pause briefly. Loco steps back to the ropes and charges back at Mikko, landing a high dropkick to Mikko's head. Now with the advantage, Loco hits the ropes again, landing a picturesque corkscrew moonsault onto the downed Mikko! Loco with the cover, ONE! TW- Mikko kicks out right at two. Loco kicks Mikko's left elbow, then locks in a mean seated armbar as the two combatants catch a breather.]

Slam: Smart move by Loco, you take away Mikko's arms, you take away half his offense.
Andrews: As well as his devastating finishing submission!

[As Loco cinches in the armbar, a concession worker leans over the audience barricade near the Lightbodies and yells out, ""SPECIAL DELIVERY FOR AMY!"" Amy Lighbody, curious walks over to the concessioner, as he hands Amy a massive bucket of fried cheese curds, saying it's ""COURTESY OF YOUR FRIEND SARA"". Amy angrily shoves the concession worker away and dumps the bucket of cheese curds on his head.]

Andrews: Did... is Sara trying to play mind games with Amy?
Slam: Well that's one way to die, piss off Amy.

[Sara remains expressionless as Alan holds back the now-furious Amy from doing something vile. Back in the ring, Mikko has worked his way back to his feet, only to be met by another perfect standing dropkick by Loco. Loco checks on his downed opponent before deftly leaping to the top turnbuckle. Loco waits for Mikko to make it to his feet, and leaps over the Finn, catching him with a massive sunset flip into a pinning position! The ref counts, ONE! TWO! T-Mikko kicks out at two and a half, only to be met with a vicious kick to the face.]

Andrews: Another near fall for El Mondo Loco, and Rodney you gotta be impressed with the skill and athleticism displayed by the Argentinian Luchador!

Slam: I already was, you dolt. Alan Lightbody doesn't manage scrubs.

[El Mondo Loco raises his arms to mixed reaction from the crowd, as Mikko rolls closer to the edge of the ring. With the ref's back turned, Alan slaps Mikko hard across the face, raising his hands in self-professed innocence as the ref turns back to check on Mikko. Amy is still fuming, yelling insults across the ring at the still-stoic Sara. Loco pulls Mikko back to the center of the ring by the arm he was working on before, stomps on it a few times, and as Mikko makes it to his feet, Loco grabs Mikko's hand, leaps up the ropes, and leaps over Mikko back into the ring without letting go, torquing his elbow and
shoulder hard as they crash back to the mat.]

Andrews: I don't even know what to call that? I sliced bread arm-drag?
Slam: He's an innovator!

[Loco covers Mikko again, ONE! TWO! TH- Mikko kicks out at two and three quarters.]
[Andrews: Another near fall for El Mondo Loco!

[Loco pulls Mikko to his feet and locks in a front face lock. Loco tries to lift Mikko up, but Mikko blocks it, and begins laying punches into the Awesome Argentine's abdomen. Mikko, sensing the opening, hooks Loco's neck and plants him with a swinging neckbreaker! Alan yells at the ref about Mikko's closed fists, but the ref keeps focus in the action in the ring, as Mikko collects himself a split-second before Loco, catching Loco behind the neck and dropping him with a smooth DDT! Mikko rolls Loco over and covers, ONE! TW- Loco kicks out just before two.]

Andrews: The Fighting Finn with his second wind?

Slam: What are you some kind of poet?

Andrews: You know it.

[Mikko, standing now, leans down to pick Loco up, but Loco tries to roll Mikko up with El Smallo Packageo! Mikko slips out just in time, rolling thru and getting to his feet, leaning back into the ropes and cautiously waiting on Loco to also get vertical. Loco takes his time, playing possom and dropping again when Mikko charges him, causing Mikko's momentum to carry him thru the ropes and to the outside, between Sara and the Lighbodies.]

Slam: We might be cooking with peanut oil now, boys and girls!

[Sara moves from her corner to help Mikko to his feet, as the Lightbodies also move closer, Alan yelling at Mikko to get back in the ring, Amy yelling at Sara about getting involved. Mikko, confused by the incessant chatter, doesn't notice Loco launching himself into a suicide dive, taking out Mikko and narrowly missing Sara! Alan cheers for the crowd and helps Loco to his feet, as the ref begins counting the double-countout.]

Andrews: A great move by Loco, but he needs to beat Mikko in the ring if he's going to win the title!
[Amy steps between Sara and Alan, Loco, and Mikko, getting in her face. Sara remains stone-faced as Loco and Alan roll Mikko back into the ring, Alan getting a couple cheap shots in. Loco climbs the far turnbuckles and launches himself at the prone Finn, but Mikko gets his knees up! Loco, wind knocked out of him, rolls over on the mat, exposing his back to Mikko. Seeing his opponent's mistake, Mikko slides over and wraps his arms around Loco's neck in shoulder, locking in the half-nelson rear choke!]
Andrews: He's got it! Mikko has the Kajahijime locked in!

[Alan, seeing his client in trouble, climbs the ring apron and begins yelling at the ref, distracting him. Amy shoves Sara to the ground and climbs into the ring on the far side away from the distracted ref. She takes one step towards Mikko, but Sara quickly is into the ring and tackles Amy at the knees, and both women hit the mat with a massive THUD! The ref turns at the sound, just in time to see Loco tap out! The ref calls for the bell and this one's over!]

Announcer: Here is your winner, and STILL RWF TELEVISION CHAMPION, MIKKO PÄÄTALO!

[Mikko has no time to celebrate as he sees Amy and Sara fighting in the ring. He tries to interfere but Amy shoves him aside with one arm, and Alan blindsides him in the back of the head with an elbow, providing enough distraction to get Loco out of the ring. Amy manhandles the smaller Sara up into a powerbomb position, and despite Sara's repeated punches to Amy's head, Amy still bombs Sara to the mat with a sit-out powerbomb! Amy stands and casts Sara aside, exiting the ring as Mikko recovers and checks on his seemingly unconscious companion.]

Greetings

My name is Joseph Sweredoski and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production. 

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1h1cbl,9,2013-06-25,My(20/F) boss(31/M) has come on to me and I don't know what to do from here?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h1cbl/my20f_boss31m_has_come_on_to_me_and_i_dont_know/,"I have been working in a restaurant as a cook for 3 months now. My kitchen manager is my boss and the person involved and has been there the whole time.

A few days ago we were working alone and the usual kitchen banter occurs. For those unaware, in restaurants in the kitchen we usually joke around sexually and say random crap to eachother. ""Hey I need a sausage"" ""Oh I can give you a big sausage"" etc. Hell I've been humped at most places.

Anyways, my boss actually seriously propositions to make out before I leave on friday. I'm not quitting for good, but I have a job over across the country for the summer with an amazing restaurant. He's letting me keep my job for when I come back in September. I said I was down for that at the time, and later I was drinking and we texted about it.

I'm sober now and realize this is probably not a good idea - as hot as the power dynamic is, and the fact I'm usuall horny after/during my shifts (serious eye candy walking around plus the rush and flow of the kitchen is hot and bothering). I mean I told him I was worried and he said he obviously had a lot to lose and everything and he'd keep stuff seperate.

I don't really know what to do, I want to have some fun before I go on my trip, but I'm not leaving the place and am not sure it's a good idea.

**tldr**: Might ""make out"" with my boss before I go on a summer internship, but I am coming back in September to work there again...

*edit*: Yeah, I decided this is a bad idea, but since I already said I was open to it, how do I go back? He's not a bad dude (he doesn't pressure me or anything) but now I just feel bad about going about on saying I was interested."
1h0yf1,1,2013-06-25,I fucking hate your petty-ass mom.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h0yf1/i_fucking_hate_your_pettyass_mom/,"Posted on a throwaway.

Your mom is the weakest, shallowest, most petty individual that I've ever encountered in my life. (And I've had my fair share of interacting with bitter old women.) It's not even a mystery as to why she doesn't have any friends. I'm sure she lost the only few she probably even had a long time ago due to her neurotic nature.

Ever since we got together, all she's ever done is bash on me simply because I'm dating you. She doesn't even have a valid reason to hate on me. ""Just keep trying, she'll eventually warm up to you. She's just being stubborn because she knows we're serious about each other and she can't do anything about it."" Like when you said you were saving up money to your parents. She asks if it's for our wedding, and you were just talking about saving money in general. She then responds with, ""You should become a priest."" What, so she can get her hypocritical ass with a one-way ticket into heaven? Or when we first got together and you told her that some old YouTube star was in your night class. Her response was for you to dump me and start dating her. She's so selfish and stupid.

When I asked for your family's help to get me started where you're living, I never expected to go out of my mind and have my self-esteem pummeled into the ground because of her. I had asked almost a year in advance to discuss this with your parents and have them think it over. She acted like the whole thing was just thrown in her face when I moved in. And despite me working so hard at my internship and constantly searching to find a job, she's asking when I'm going to leave. I'm so glad I was finally able to move out and find a nice family to rent from. Your mom doesn't even know what it's like to live in true poverty. She's a spoiled bonbon who couldn't handle living a lower-middle class life when she left her country.

Your mom is less than a piece of shit compared to my mom. My mom is a trooper and nothing ever stops her from getting what she wants done. She lived in poverty in the Philippines, but was lucky and hard-working enough to get through college with a nursing degree. She moved to the US to support her family back home. If it weren't for my mom, a lot of things wouldn't be possible for my family now. Even now, she's still working hard to support the people she cares about. Even though I'm not living at home anymore, and can support myself, she still sends me money and is always there for me to talk about anything.

What about your mom? Oh wait, she still treats you like you're eight and nags about the most insignificant things because she has nothing better to do with her time. You can't even have a serious conversation with her without getting frustrated. You even lie to her about what we do when going out sometimes just to get her to back off.

You broke up with me because you said I wasn't the same person anymore. I kept telling you to wait until I got out of your house because your mom was making me crazy. For some reason, you didn't understand that, and did it anyway. The only reason we are even back together is because I had to put so much effort into getting you back and to realize that I wasn't going crazy simply because I felt like it.

I tried to get along with her, I really did. Especially the past couple of months. I helped you arrange family dinners to spend actual family time together. I baked a cake with her when your dad went on a road trip to see his relatives for the weekend, so she wouldn't be so lonely. I didn't even care that I wasn't spoken to most of the time because you guys were actually communicating. It was a hell of a lot better than your mom's idea of family time: sitting in church, then buying groceries before going home without saying much at all to each other.

Then the icing on the cake comes along. And yes, it partially was our fault since we drank all that alcohol without drinking water before napping. But when I woke up with that hangover, I was in no condition to go to church with your family. I wasn't even spending the night. I said I couldn't go because I wasn't feeling well. And of course you were going to stay with me because you wanted to make sure I was okay and take care of me. Apparently, your mom thought that was the most heinous offense in her book, because she just started screaming at you. After going back and forth in a language I don't even understand, she says out of the blue in English, ""TELL HER TO GET OUT. TELL HER NOT TO STAY HERE ANYMORE."" I had it. After your parents left for church, I went back to my place and took care of myself over there. And when you relayed to me that your mom was mainly angry at you for not going to church, that only made my anger worse.

When your mom comes back, I am going to give her a piece of my mind. After she meets my parents, like you want. And after my parents leave for their home state, your mom is going to hear what I have to say to her in the most polite way possible, since that's what you want.

1h0s4u,1,2013-06-25,How can I deal with forgetting simple but important things?,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1h0s4u/how_can_i_deal_with_forgetting_simple_but/,"I have a really hard time remembering to do every step in even short processes. In the past month alone I have forggoten countless things Im sure, but I can only remember a few examples. I have bought a new laptop charger only to find out that I forgot to pack it at my friend's apartment and then forgot it was there. I payed a locksmith to stick a glorified coat hanger in to my car window because I locked my keys in the car while they were still in the ignition and the engine was running. I have left the gas stove or oven for hours before anyone noticed. I frequently forget to eat or I make food and leave it out without eating it. 

Now, I'm in danger of losing my research internship because I keep leaving equipment out or leaving the door unlocked. No one will give me another chance if I lose this, and I need undergrad experience to get into grad school. Also, I'm going to be a shitty researcher if I can't fix this and remember things.

So, besides my obsessive mental rehearsal and intense anxiety and self doubt, how the hell can I deal with my forgetfulness?

TL;DR: I'm a fuck up who can't remember to small but important things. How can I fix that?"

Dilemma.,meltingtapes,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1h0gai/which_is_better_for_my_career_dilemma/,"Background: I'm about to graduate with my MBA in Accounting (Fall 2013). I don't have any CPA exam sections under my belt yet, but will be completing them over the rest of this year and next year.

I started interning at a local CPA firm February 2013. After April 15th, I was offered a full-time position with them. I got this internship through school (MBA program is at a local private commuter college, no big 4 presence, small-ish business program, only a few local firms recruit from here). 

The job has been going well, it's my first accounting job. I'm considered a ""Staff Accountant"" as well as a ""Bookkeeper"" for the consulting company they acquired last year. They do business with the bookkeeping clients under a different moniker as well. They hired me so they could introduce me to the bookkeeping clients and have me go out there twice a week. The other two days of the week, I work on various projects from quarterly processing of local business, to sales tax filing and payroll tax filings when the time comes. During tax season, I was mostly working on preparing and assembling tax returns for individuals and a few trusts.

My dilemma is here: I am only getting paid ~35k. I believe this is low for the industry, especially as I am closer to completing the MBA. I understand that I am still relatively new and it may take some time to show my full value to the firm, especially since I am mostly learning things at this point. I've already gotten pretty used to Quickbooks, Peachtree and Excel is an obvious one. 

When I was hired, they told me that they would like somebody for the long-term as the bookkeeping clients are very antsy about change. Even recently when I was introduced to them for the first time, they indicated some concern and I will not be going to their office completely alone until my senior and I are comfortable with all that is involved with the bookkeeping.

I feel bad about thinking/looking for elsewhere, but I definitely do not see myself wanting to stay at this firm for longer than a year. The growth is quite slow, and most people who work here only stay for a few years. There are 3 other full-time staff who have been there for a while, and are not looking to move out of the area anytime soon (getting married, having kids, etc). I am the fourth full-timer, and there are only 2 partners.

Of course, business is business, and if I come across a strictly ""staff accountant"" or auditing position elsewhere for a closer-to-average salary in NY (~50 - 60k) that would be a much better opportunity for me. I am mostly interested in larger regional/national firms, but getting contacts there from my school is damn near impossible.

The more conservative side of me thinks that I should stick around at this firm until I complete the CPA exam (which could be another year or so), and then I would have more opportunities. Either way I am getting experience right now which is the most important thing for my resume.


Have any of you been in a similar position? Leaving a firm must be tough when you've already established yourself a bit, and have people relying on you to take on the work load. The worst thing is, they fired an incompetent part-timer to have me on board. Any tips for which could be the most lucrative and fulfilling move for me to make? Am I being taken advantage of by being stuck as a bookkeeper? "

I have a month and a half left in LA while I finish up my summer internship. I'm looking for THE most special spots in LA that would be a sin to miss before I go. 

Here's a little information about me to base your recommendations on:

Schooling - I study Film and English at University at Buffalo, and have grown up in Buffalo all my life. With that said, I'm a huge film, entertainment, and comedy nerd. I would be very interested in any ""behind the scenes"" things, Q&amp;A's, etc.

Food - I'm VERY open minded and adventurous with food, but I do try to stick to a vegetarian diet as much as possible. I will cheat and have fish occasionally.

Shopping - As a broke college student, I can't really afford to go to any ultra pricey stores. I'm a thrift store addict, so any leads there would be awesome.

Staying Active/Outdoors - I love, love, love hiking and any extreme, outdoorsy fun. I've been getting into yoga lately, so any good classes would be good to hear.

Living Situation - I currently live in Mar Vista, near Culver City and Santa Monica, with mainly a bike transportation. Don't let that keep you from recommending anything outside of that area, but fun things in West Hollywood would be especially good to hear. 

Additional Info - *PLEASE* do not hold back based on the preferences I gave. I'd love to hear it all!

I'm tall, dark and handsome (not to gloat but I see it in the mirror and I've been considered the attractive one amongst my peers for a long time). 

But, I have no real friends.

I've been without friends since leaving uni 6 months ago, I had one that I would consider my best friend but then he got a girlfriend (thanks to my seduction efforts) and he hasn't looked back since. I'm the guy who has to set up hang outs just to get flaked on at the last second, bare in mind these are supposed to be my friends.

I just want some companionship, just one person that I can talk to. I don't even look at women the same way anymore, I'm in a very needy mentality and I don't know how to combat it. Maybe I have a deeper issue, I feel like everyone is judging me and talking behind my back all the time.

I went to a nightclub alone recently and all it did for me was highlight how alone I am. I was tearing up on the walk home and this drunk dude asked me a question about football(soccer), I gave him an answer he liked and he said ""I like this guy"" - can you believe that moment was probably the highlight of my past few months?

I'm rambling now but I hope somebody here can give me some advice.

recently, i've graduated college with a BA in studio art and trying to find a job. before you jump to the 'why would you get an art degree' and whatnot comments, being a fine art major was not my first choice.  i tried for graphic design, but its a program you have to take a year of pre requisites and apply for the program with a portfolio. I applied, didnt get in, but got #3 alternate, in case some people drop out. so i had to change my major. 

i've always been into art, it's almost second nature to me. getting a degree in it wasn't that hard for me, I wish i could go directly to grad school. but money sux. 

anyways, in this job hunt i constantly get asked, 'do you have experience??' well, of course i don't. ive been in college for the past 6 years. i did do a graphic design internship for a few months though, but who knows if that counts for shit.

i'm just getting beyond frustrated. and this is the mind set i feared last year. i knew it was my last year of college and i was dreading it. 

i've been a little suicidal lately. like, do i really belong here?? does this plane really need me?? if i cant find a job and i dont have many friends anyways then maybe the universe doesnt need me. ive always felt a bit different anyways. one of the main reasons i'm still here is for my dad and family. my mom died 7 years ago and it's super tough to put my family through another death. 

i just dont know what to do anymore. every time some ass hat asks me 'do you have experience?' its really really temping to blurt out, 'will you give me a fucking chance??!'

My name is Jason Hobbs and I am a 24 year old comedy writer for such famous shows like ""My Five Moms,"" ""The Midnight Show with Kelly Dolores,"" and lately, ""Internship."" That last one is one of my favorite shows to work on, mainly because of all the meta jokes and fourth wall breaks that happen. It seems really funny when characters do it on TV, but it's fucking weird in real life.

Let me backtrack. So I was in a meeting with a the rest of the writers for the season finale of ""Internship."" I start explaining my joke involving the main character and his run in with Cameron Diaz's body double. Ha, ha, it's still funny. Anyway.

So I'm telling my joke, right? And I stop mid-sentence because next thing I knew, there was this black semi-transparent square floating in front of me. It was so weird, I looked away and it wasn't there anymore. I left early that day and got scared shitless when I saw a black screen on the passenger side of my car. And whatever remaining shit I had left in my bowels were quickly removed when an entire studio audience appeared inside the screen.

It was so bizzare, almost catharic actually, but still scary. I remember saying, ""What the fuck?"" and then everyone on the screen started laughing, but I couldn't hear them. I looked away and it was gone again. I go home, and once again the screen shows up floating again. This happens all the time now, sometimes it's just black, sometimes theres an audience watching, sometimes it's only one person.

It's so annoying, I have no idea why the hell it comes and goes, or how it started in the first place. I call it the fourth wall, but I'm wondering, am I going crazy or is there really an entire audience watching my every move? I guess life came full circle for me or something. I used to think that my life was a movie as I grew up, I started to write shows about characters who knew that they were in TV shows, and now I'M breaking the fourth wall. I guess this is the universe getting revenge on me for being too ironic. :(

I run IT for a small company and I have to do everything in about 4 hours/week. This includes tech support, managing inventory, account, third party services, a lot of websites, etc. 

As I wasn't trained for this and there are only very few people I can bounce ideas on, I thought I might ask you for advice.

**Background**

I work at a small (European) consultancy firm (~25 people) where each employee has its own expertise. I'm the only employee with a background in something vaguely technical, but I now mostly work in policy making. As I am the only employee with a 'tech' background I also manage all the companies IT.

Luckily I have a full mandate to basically do whatever I like, which I do. I've tried to make the technological environment as efficient as possible for both me and my co-workers. I am now wondering how I further innovate/improve my setup.

**Setup** 

* We're an all mac company, everyone gets the same standard macbook air 13inch or a Macbook Pro depending on when they started at the company. Each (even office managers and finance) new employee gets a brand new laptop. After three years your laptops is replaced and put in the stack of ever circulating laptop for our interns.
* We have an onsite data server (mac mini server) that is backupped each day, our office manager takes an encrypted disk home an swappes back-up disks each day
* We have two internet connections (50Mbit on DSL and 110Mbit on cable) with a failover router to ensure our internet connection
* The entire company is wireless, except for the server. This improves movability for the employees and makes meetins so much easier.
* We use google apps for business as our mail provider and for collaboration (a year now), I manage the accounts
* We use an external sysadmin who comes by 4 hours/month to solve long term issues, re-imaging and he checks our server and back-up integrity.
* The company that provides our sys admin also controls a Munki server that provides all our updates to all machines (OS updates, Chrome, VLC, etc.) for 4 hours/month.
* We use a VPS with some good tech support to hosts all our project-sites (~30). We only use Wordpress and I manage the installs, updates, tweaks, etc.
* I manage our inventory using OS X Server profile manager
* Our printer, phones, postage machine, etc. are services from third party companies
* I use an AppleTV to manage streams to our presentation room (just for fun..)

**Improvements?**

I think I have a lean setup at the moment. I am looking for new innovations that makes managing the IT of a varied bunch of people beter. Things that I have on the roadmap, but haven't figured out fully at the moment, are:

* back-ups for Google Apps, 
* a cloud back-up for our data server or move that kind of data storage offsite
* moving away from MS Office, Google drive is not as mature as it could be, LibreOffice might be a step to far, iWorks?

**Budget**

Hardware, software licenses, services, hosting, etc. brings me to around €50.000/year. This breaks down to 1/5 hardware, 1/5 licenses and hosting, 2/5 services, 1/5 'other'. I have no idea if this is reasonable, expensive, cheap?

**Question**

What do you think of my setup and where else do you think I can improve/innovate?"

First some stats:  

26/F/5'5""  
SW: 192  
CW: 168  
GW: 150  


[And now, the graph](http://imgur.com/al6oibr)  


I've always thought of myself as fat. Even in elementary school I felt larger than the other girls in my class. Looking at pictures from when I was younger, I know that was not true. But I have these vivid memories of how much I **felt** fat as a child. As a teenager, I was never very active and always hated PE class. In my junior year of high school I sort of got into track and field, but I didn't really pursue it. In college, I walked around campus every day but ate poorly and partied (way too much). By my junior year I probably gained 30 lbs (!!).  


I didn't hit rock bottom until after I graduated and really had to face *myself* and my flaws. In January of 2010 (the start of the graph; 192 lbs), I began eating right and working out 2 - 3 times a week. I would just walk on the treadmill on an incline... I was terrified of running. Life was really great those first few months, I had started a new job and applied to graduate school. During the summer, I had this fantastic walking route (60-80 minutes) with tons of hills and valleys that I did 4 - 5 times a week.   


By the end of the summer (159 lbs) I had to leave my job and move away for graduate school (RED CIRCLE). I had no friends, and no workout plan. I quickly succumbed to the many stresses of grad school and went back to my old eating habits (BLACK ARROW). I landed an internship for summer 2011 where I had to walk a mile to/from work 5 - 6 days a week (DARK BLUE ARROW). I even ran after work sometimes. The internship was pretty stressful, and I was able to eat okay most of the time, but I drank almost every night to relieve stress. Still, with all the walking and running I got down to 167 lbs. In the fall of 2011 I had to complete my research and write my thesis. It was so easy to let everything else fall by the wayside. This trend persisted into 2012 (PURPLE ARROW). It was getting pretty bad, so I started running 2 months before I had to defend my thesis (GREEN ARROW). After my defense I received some stressful medical news, which spawned this complete lack of desire to do anything. Basically, I sucked a lot for the remainder of 2012 (RED ARROW). December 2012 was particularly rough. When all was said and done, I got up to 184 lbs.  


The new year came and I forced myself to work out every day to prepare for a trip to the Arctic (ORANGE ARROW). I was there for a month and had to walk to get around (~19 miles/week). A few times I even ran for fun (in -20 to -11ºC conditions), which was quite an experience. It really changed my whole outlook on running, I honestly had zero excuses after that. The mentality being: if I can run here, I can run *anywhere*. To be honest, I did have some trouble carving out time to run upon my return, but now (LIGHT BLUE ARROW and onward) I've got a pretty good thing going. I even started feeling weird on my rest days, like I should be outside running! When ever I feel like quitting--or hear that voice inside my head saying ""I can't""--I just think back to those crazy cold runs and how I didn't quit then.   


**TL;DR: When Life happens you have to keep on trying. No goal is out of reach.**

I told her and it just went from there. We started talking about school and the kinda work we both do as interns at our facility. Must have talked for a good 15 minutes. Nice thing was she was actually interested in talking and wasn't annoyed by me like some of the girls that I have been around. I view this as a huge accomplishment because normally I don't talk to many girls. I am more on the quiet side and only talk in great length with people I know really well. I loosely knew this girl so the fact that I was able to keep the conversation going is an accomplishment in itself. I actually feel more confident with myself today.

For the past few days I have been attempting this whole NoFap/PornFree lifestyle. To my dismay, I relapsed over and over again. While there may be many contributing factors as to why, and after reading many posts here on NoFap I realised that *I AM ADDICTED*.  

For the longest time, I only thought of it as an 'unhealthy habit' or 'something natural', you know, 'scratching the itch.'  Upon further inspection, and reflection on the past few years of my life. I came to the conclusion that it isn't just an unhealthy habit. It is an addiction, and I accept this. **I AM ADDICTED TO PORN AND FAPPING**

Having done NoFap a few times in the past, I know how rough the first few days can be. It makes it even worse being somewhere alone all the time with no supervision (my current situation as I am doing an internship abroad). However, I would like to say that tomorrow morning everything changes for me. I've erased my porn, and set up web filters. I want to change my habits. I am young and have lots to look forward to and experience. 


Today I finally understood the quote from Fight Club thanks to a post I saw on /fit/ ''Self-improvement is masturbation. Now self-destruction...''   

You need to destroy your old self and create a new one.  

So, /r/NoFap I choose to embrace this challenge. I choose to live PornFree and Fapless. 

My old self is no more. When I wake up in a few hours I will be a new person, and slowly on my way to victory!

1h7nnx,2,2013-06-27,I'm [20F] worried about my housemate [21M] because I think he might be having some mental issues. What do I do?,sneezingleopard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h7nnx/im_20f_worried_about_my_housemate_21m_because_i/,"I have known my housemate, James, for more than two years. We're both students at the same university. For the upcoming school year, we decided to live together in a 4 bedroom house off-campus, along with my best friend, Megan, and a friend of James' that I have yet to meet. He's always been a little... off, but he's a good friend, and he's a totally fine roommate. Megan and I lived in the same dorm as him a year ago, and we've all spent a lot of time together. It's really hard to explain some of his behavior, but I'm going to try.

Megan and I live on the bottom floor of the house, in two separate bedrooms. My boyfriend is living here with us for the summer to help out with rent, and our fourth roommate is not moving in until August. James lives upstairs. Megan, my boyfriend, and I all like to spend time together, get a little wasted, hang out--and James does too, but very selectively. Occasionally he will come down and drink with us/eat with us, but generally only when he is literally forced by me or by Megan.

* He has a complete inability to make reasonable decisions for himself. For example, he constantly puts himself in situations to fuck up every interpersonal relationship he has, mostly by two-timing girls. It's really sad, because he's not a player at all.
* He lambasts himself for doing this to girls, but he keeps doing it anyway. He constantly criticizes and hates himself for his actions, but refuses to do anything to stop fucking his life up. Self-punishment is something that I see happening a lot. I think he fucks his life up in certain ways as a way to punish himself for his feelings of being a ""bad"" or inadequate person.
* He has a hard time taking care of money, in that he does not understand how to make a budget or how to be responsible. He currently is working at an unpaid internship, and his parents pay for his gas, food, utilities, and rent. He gets plenty of money from them, but he cannot keep track and he often has to ask his parents for more money because he spends on things like alcohol that he doesn't drink and expensive gourmet food from Trader Joe's that he doesn't eat, instead of going to cheaper grocery stores.
* He has issues with his hygiene sometimes and has bad skin. He once told me that he does not use shaving cream, which causes ingrown hairs and a lot of red marks on his face. I asked him once why he didn't just use shaving cream, since it would help his skin a lot, and he told me that he ""likes the pain."" I think it's another form of self-punishment.
* He gets very locked into certain ways of thinking. Once he decides something, regardless of whether it is true or not, he is completely stuck in that way of thinking.
* He gets very stressed by school work and extracurriculars, but occasionally he will become extremely obsessed with aspects of his work. He is a generally obsessive person. He can't let anything go. For example, there are multiple girls who he used to like in high school, who he will not let go of and we still hear about it.

Megan and I have always known that James has some issues, but we love him anyway. He's a really sweet person, when he's not holed up in his room hating himself. T

What brought everything to a point, though, was this past weekend. James was out of town, and Megan, my boyfriend, and I were hanging out up in his room blowing up balloons to fill his closet with (we all play a lot of pranks on each other). We were hanging out in his room, checking out the books on the bookshelf, when we saw one that was turned the wrong way. Megan pulled it out to see what book it was (not unusual for our friendship at all, James, Megan, and I spend a lot of time in each other's rooms, checking out books and hanging out). 

We'd accidentally stumbled on a diary of sorts, that had a LOT of disturbing things in it. If the first entry hadn't been so disturbing, we would have put it back right away when we realized what it was. The first entry was extremely odd. It was written in three different colors of ink. In the first part, in black ink, he introduced himself as James and listed true things about himself. In the second part, in blue ink, he called himself by a different, nonsensical name and included many details including that ""I am a God"", ""I do not pity"", ""I feel no emotion,"" etc. It's a packed book, including odd lists, and strange stories. He references a ""Voice"" and frequently mentions that he is a ""God."" He also includes some entries talking about school work and basically criticizing himself for not being productive. For example, many were along the lines of, ""Got nothing done today. What the fuck is wrong with me. BAD, BAD JAMES."" He also frequently mentioned his ""depression"" and his hatred of life and his worthlessness.

Megan and I care about James a lot, but we're now seriously concerned and unsure of how to start a conversation about this issue. We obviously can't straight up ask/accuse him of being mentally ill. I don't know that I can just sit still and ignore it anymore though, because it's becoming increasingly apparent that something is wrong. I

As I'm typing this, he just got home. My boyfriend, Megan, and I all said hi and he ignored us and went upstairs without saying a word...

1h78io,2,2013-06-27,This is my story so far. I hope it helps you guys. Writing it sure as hell helped me.,afc_no_more,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1h78io/this_is_my_story_so_far_i_hope_it_helps_you_guys/,"WARNING - get ready for a pretty long wall of text.  Sorry it's so long, and I hope it's worth the read.

I've been fapping for as long as I can remember.  I started touching down there when I was younger (probably around 7 or 8) because it felt good, but it was never a problem - I was just exploring my body, which was absolutely normal.  Then around the age of 9 or 10, I discovered internet porn.  It was pretty innocent at first - I would look on google images for pictures of topless women, rub one out probably once every two days, and then be done with it.

Fast forward two or three years to the end of middle school, and I'm still doing the same thing, except now it's hardcore porn; I'm now fapping *at least* twice a day, sometimes using my dial-up connection for hours, so that no one in my family can use the phone all day.  I start getting into fetish porn, [namely BDSM and rape fantasies,] (/nsfw) and it just gets worse and worse throughout high school.

Now, fast forward even more, to the beginning of the year 2013, where I am a 21 year old guy without a girlfriend, without any real friends, and whose social anxiety has already torn apart all of his confidence and his self image.  All I have at this point are my family, my good grades, and an internship in the field of my study.  What's worse, this internship forces me to move away from my college campus and away from home to a new city where I know absolutely no one.  Now, you would think that this new environment would force me out of my shell and force me to go out and meet new people.  It doesn't.

Instead, most of the money I earn through my internship goes to internet porn.  I'm talking thousands of dollars throughout the semester being funneled from my bank account to camgirl sites.  And the worst part?  My addiction has gotten to the point where I can't get off to anything other than fetish porn, [the kind where a girl gets in front of a live webcam POV style and humiliates you while you jerk off furiously,] (/nsfw) alone in a dark fucking room.

At this point, the story takes a pretty steep downhill curve.  I've already got this destructive porn addiction, which takes up most of my time already - I'm probably sitting in front of my computer at least 4 hours a day after I get off work, just watching porn.  To add to this shit, I start drinking.  A lot.  Because it makes me feel less fucking pathetic about watching porn for 4 consecutive hours in my dark living room, all by myself.  At this point, I think one of the people who work at the company I'm interning at realizes that I'm going through rough times, and invites me to go out with him on a Friday night.  So we go out to a bar, get pretty drunk, and play poker with a few of his friends.  Two nights later, another guy texts me to see if I want to play poker again.

Fast forward (one more time) three more weeks.  I'm still spending the majority of my time getting wasted by myself and watching internet porn.  When I'm not doing this, I'm wasting all of my money getting my ass handed to me in poker, and re-buying over and over again until I've spent all of my money.  One day, I get home from work, sit down on the couch with a beer, and decide to check my bank account.  I have 50 dollars left.  50 dollars.  To my name.  From the 12,000 dollars that I had made up to that point in the semester.  I probably only spent 20% of my money on food and necessities - that means I spent about 9600 dollars on porn, alcohol, and gambling (and that's probably a pretty conservative estimate).  I fucked up.  I started panicking.  I even started fucking crying because I had no idea what to do and because I knew that this was my own damn fault.

I don't know exactly what it was, but the next day, something inside of me changed.  I don't know if it was something one of my co-workers said, if I saw something inspiring on reddit, or if I just had one of those moments.  **Everything that I wasn't happy with in my life was my own damn fault.**  And porn had a lot to do with it.  It was altering my mindset - watching hours of beautiful women on my computer screen every day had conditioned my brain to absolutely need instant gratification and to think that everything I wanted would immediately and magically appear in front of me.  Hence the budding alcoholism and the gambling addiction.

I decided to change my whole fucking lifestyle.  I stopped watching porn, fapping, drinking, and gambling, and I started working out and running.  I started lurking on r/NoFap and r/seduction and I began to work on my self image.  I started actively meeting people outside of work.  I started listening to the music I like, spending my money on clothes that make me feel good, doing activities that I've always wanted to do.  And then, two weeks later, I found myself in a situation where I'd never really found myself before - I now knew several girls that were actually romantically attracted to me and wanted to hang out.

Things were going great!  Then, I relapsed.

It's been about two weeks since I relapsed.  I'm now in the same fucking rut that I was in at the beginning of this year - spending large amounts of money on porn, drinking excessively.

So NoFap, I want to say this.  **Fuck This.**  I now know how good it feels to be free from the grasps of porn and masturbation, to feel comfortable in my own skin and body, and to have positive interactions with real women instead of videos of women online.  I also know how comforting it can be to just say *fuck it..* after a stressful day and turn on your favorite porno and unzip your pants.  When you start to think like this... just think about how fucking bad you've had it before and how empty you've felt, when you let your mind slip into that numb, complacent mindset.  Just think about what behaviors in your life are being encouraged by that numb, complacent mindset.  And finally, think about how fucking awesome of a human being you could be and how much awesome shit you could get accomplished if you just dropped that numb, complacent mindset.  And then fucking do it.  Even if it's only for a week or two.  Get on r/NoFap, r/seduction, and start working out and doing things that make you feel good.  Start talking to women and start being social.  Just do it for a week, maybe two weeks.  And I swear, once you experience real life, you'll realize that you don't need to settle for a bunch of fucking moving pixels on the screen of your laptop and the bottle of cheap lotion beside it on your desk.

Long story short back in late February my dorm room was robbed while my roommate, my self, and both our girlfriends were in the room sleeping. (this guy had balls.) He made off with my computer headphones and much more. (around $6,000 worth of stuff) 
After Acquiring a internship with the state I've been slowly buying my stuff back. Next on my list is replacing my headphones within the next month. So I need suggestions

**Budget** - I am have budgeted around $150 i prefer around $100 though.

**Source** - I will be plugging this into my computer. Nokia Lumia 920, A Yamaha Powered mixer board and my Canon Vivixa Camera. My computer supports up to 7.1 surround sound but I already have a Roccat KAVE + headset for gaming. I also own a FIIO E5 (this is in storage) amp luckily it didnt get stolen during the robbery. Eventually I am also getting a ps vita for the ps4 I preordered. However I have 5.1 surround sound system for the ps4 so Ill use that more.

**Requirements for Isolation** - I prefer them to be sound isolating or at least partial isolation. I will be using the headphones for video editing, filming, and listening to music.

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - I want full size over the ear headphones. I have a wide head so I prefer headphones with a strong band. Ive had issues with headphones having their band break after 6+ months. I also prefer replaceable cables and single side cables.

**Past headphones** -
[Sennheiser HD 205](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FYRO/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) 
I love Sennheisers, but these didnt last me that long. Eventually the left ear crapped out on me. They also weren't that comfortable.
[Behringer HPX2500](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SSUQFQ/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
These were really comfortable the sound was okay. The plastic hinges and band broke after 1 year.
[Pioneer HDJ-500K](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047QBFNE/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
I hated these. Very uncomfortable the sound was very bass heavy. The padding peeled off after 1 month and made the headset even more uncomfortable. I ended up giving these away.
[Technics RP-DH1200](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002EXJPM/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
I loved these headphones though they were only comfortable for short periods of time. they worked wonders with my equipment and sounded pretty good. I often used them with my headphone amp. they were a tad bulky and didn't travel well, but that wasn't a huge issue since i wore them all the time. If i can't find anything better these would be my fall back. This is also the pair that was stolen.

In the past I also owned some Sennheiser iems. I used them for listening to music while mowing the law. Loved the little things.

Preferred Music - I prefer melodic indie rock, trance, edm, and anything really catchy. I don't listen to pop, rap, or country. ill post some examples:

[Everything Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKKMfJ8cZoQ)

[Bloc Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3EEaPj-5qs)

[playlist with more examples](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmwsMLbw18JCzL4rrIzns8MBwwi0fLyZh&amp;feature=mh_lolz)

Location - Montana, United States

I hope that is everything and that I formatted decently. Thanks for any help ahead of time!"
1h6wlz,6,2013-06-27,Dealing with motivation and general lack of direction.,SHAMEFUL_CUM_GOLEM,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1h6wlz/dealing_with_motivation_and_general_lack_of/,"So I don't really know if this is the right place to post this, but it seems like a good enough start. I'm a 27 year old gay male. I've been in a long term relationship with the same man since I was 19. I was diagnosed very young with A.D.H.D, and have been diagnosed in the past with G.A.D. 

I'm basically chronically unemployed, and completely lack motivation about anything in my life. I was always praised for my writing ability as a child, and I dreamt of being a poet or a video game journalist or something when I was young and naive. I went to college and got a B.A. in English with a focus in creative writing, wrote some poems and a play and some other stuff, but always felt like I was just bullshitting and never really applying myself or learning anything. I struggled heavily with motivation my entire life, and I also took a very long time to come to terms with my sexuality. 

I was raised in a household where both my mother and father were ordained christian ministers. They weren't really typical hellfire-type people, they were fairly moderate and even liberal in some respects, and both had at least a master's degree so they valued education and intelligence. Still I had a ton of guilt about being gay and didn't come out til I was 18 years old. This was concurrent with an eating disorder that almost spiraled out of control in college. Around this time I found marijuana which helped me feel a lot less anxious about things, kept me from vomiting after eating, and generally helped me have a regular appetite when I was using ritalin/concerta. This was really a huge positive time in my life where I was finally out of the closet, meeting new people all the time, being praised for my work and just enjoying life.

However, I only ever managed to have shitty part time jobs or internships up until I graduated. I never could really keep a job for more than 6 or 7 months because I would get insanely bored and start shirking my duties, or lack the organizational and motivational mindset to keep up on menial tasks. Coming out of college my life was like 6 months of being employed followed by 8 months of being without work. I had a really nice thing going with an online freelance writing gig, but the studio ultimately made too many poor choices with financing and had to scale back heavily to the point that it was no longer lucrative.

Jumping forward a few years, I find myself still only getting absolutely shit jobs which I inevitably quit or am fired from within 4 months. Games journalism is a sorry joke that doesn't exist in print at all, and is largely PR-shill work for money, or legitimate-but-ultimately-unread-and-nonpaying critical theory blog stuff. I obviously can't become a professional poet because that isn't even a thing, and I have no actual skillsets because I took a garbage major that I bullshitted my way through. Even with internships, a 3.6 GPA, scholarships and some published work I could never find a place to hire me for anything. I've been flown out to some stupid technical writing IT job interviews, or met with people to do advertising copywriting but I ultimately don't have experience with these things and don't really have the drive to pursue them.

I find myself at a crossroads because I can't justify draining money from my boyfriend who works as an underpaid social worker, or my parents who are happy to support me when I need it, but deserve to be free of my financial burden. I want to provide some kind of income but I would rather die than work another month in some sterile horrible office setting. I'm 40k in student loan debt from getting my B.A. and Minor (Film Studies, somehow even more worthless than English,) and yet I feel like I need to go to graduate school to get some kind of real world skill or at least a ""marketable"" degree. I worry about going further in debt following a passionless path only to find myself worse off financially with the same outlook on life in five years. I pretty much refuse to work a minimum wage job, and yet I've now been unemployed 9 months and my resume is starting to weaken even more. 
What can I do? How can I find passion or a direction? I feel as though all of my friends have lead more successful lives, but when I ask about how they got their jobs it always seems like nepotism or sheer awful effort and hard work down a difficult path like engineering which I simply don't feel I could realistically pursue. 

Compounding these difficulties I feel that in some ways I have grown dependent on marijuana to regulate my mood and anxiety. I don't directly blame it for my mental state or my unemployment because I had just as many issues with motivation and joblessness before I started using it, and ultimately had less options to cope with the buildup of anxiety and hopelessness. Despite this, I recognize that I use it too much (usually 2-4 times a day) and would rather feel like it was a fun treat than a necessary aspect of my daily life. Attempts to stop cold-turkey in the past have ultimately met with failure because I have almost no impulse control. 

I apologize for the wall of text, but I really don't know what to do with myself and I've started saying stupid things like ""I wish I didn't exist,"" ""I wish I was dead"" etc.  a lot more than usual.

I have too many important links to my family and friends to seriously consider suicide, but I know that suicidal ideation is a negative trend, and at the very least probably hurtful/a turnoff to those around me. "
1h6m7k,2,2013-06-27,"[Rel] Says things are moving too fast, stops talking to me entirely? Please, please help, I'm desperate here.",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1h6m7k/rel_says_things_are_moving_too_fast_stops_talking/,"Hey men of Reddit,

18f here. I had been seeing a guy (20m) at my college for 3 weeks (not long at all, I know, before anyone points this out, but during the last week we saw each other almost every night) and things were going pretty well. The relationship was mostly sexual, but he always asked me to spend the night and we got along really well. **I was happy the way things were and did not want anything else from the relationship.**

He initiated our hookups probably around 80% of the time when we were at school. **Also, any ""relationship-y"" steps we took were initiated by him.** Going to breakfast in the morning, meeting his friends, no big steps but things like that. Also, on our last night together at school, I was practically begging for sex and he said no because he was sober and I was drunk, even though we'd had plenty of sex before, both drunk and sober. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think that meant he cared about me at least a little bit.

Anyways, we live in different states but I'm in his home state for the summer for an internship. When we were at school, **he said he wanted to see me over the summer, even though I asked if that would be too much pressure for him, and he insisted that it would be fine.**

When I got to his home state a few weeks ago, I asked him if he wanted to hang out and he said he absolutely did. He also said that I was welcome to sleepover at his/his parents' house any time. This past Friday I went to his house and we spent time by ourselves for a while and had a good time, and after we hooked up he talked about all the places he wanted to show me in his state. A few hours later there was a party at his house and someone asked if the two of us were dating and both of us were extremely uncomfortable. Still, throughout the night he was taking good care of me and kept wanting to see me. The next morning, his dad saw me walk out of my bedroom and inferred what happened and was incredibly welcoming.

**If you were skimming until now, this is the most important part**

The guy drove me home and **he asked me twice if he could see me again** and I said yes. So early this week I asked if he was free at all anytime soon and nine hours later he responded to my text saying that things were moving to fast, he wasn't looking for a relationship, but that he wanted to be friends. I was so surprised that I responded saying that I agreed things were moving too fast and that I was okay with being friends. He didn't answer, but I hadn't expected him to.

Eventually I realized that I didn't just want to be friends because even though I don't want a relationship, I do like this boy, so the next morning I sent him a text saying that I wasn't looking for a relationship either and I wanted to slow things down, but I didn't want to stop everything. I also said I was happy with the way things were at school and I asked why he had said he had wanted to see me again and then completely changed his mind.

It's been almost 48 hours and he hasn't answered. Should I just give up at this point? We're on the same sports team and we'll have a class together next semester, so I'll be seeing plenty of him. I really think that he just freaked out after I met his friends asked if we were dating and his parents asked me if I wanted coffee when they saw me waking out of his bedroom the next morning, but is that enought to completely change his opinion about me or will he eventually snap out of it?

**tl;dr:** seeing a boy from college who has always been incredibly nice and who invites me to his parents' home (not to meet them officialy, but to just hang out there), things got a bit too intense for both of us because I'm informally meeting his parents and people ask if we're dating, he decides that I had wanted a relationship the entire time even though I didn't, I asked him if we could slow things down instead of stopping them, he hasn't responded.

Please, please help. I know I'm young and this won't matter for long and all that but it still sucks that he pulled a complete 180 on me. He's never had a problem being honest with me, so even if had said that he was done with me I would have preferred that over complete silence. What do I do here? I'm assuming I should let it go and not try to contact him again? Is there a chance he'll still respond? I did give him a very serious question to answer so I expected to have to wait a while, but not for 2 days.

Sorry, I tried to shorten this but I didn't know how.

EDIT: **To clarify, we started hooking up when I initiated sex. And both of us continued initiating sex. When I texted him saying I wanted to keep doing what we were doing, I meant sex and maybe some TV after, just like we had been doing. I do like him, but I'm not interested in seeing him if there's nothing physical.** For fuck's sake, when he asked to see me over the summer, I asked if he was sure and I told him that if I had been home for the summer, I'd probably be hooking up with other people, and he insisted on seeing me. That wasn't particularly nice on my part, but I hardly think I was acting too attached."
1h6bqp,2,2013-06-27,"A couple of changes suggested on the forums. Not mine, I take no credit.",axwin34,Planetside,https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1h6bqp/a_couple_of_changes_suggested_on_the_forums_not/,"I really hate sounding whiny with this post. There is after all, a few million whiny posts by players that generally know nothing of which they speak on. This is, I hope, a constructive criticism of a few elements within the game's mechanics, structure, and most importantly, SOE's interaction with its customers. The last one I would think, being very important for a company basing a product on a F2P format.

First, the following items I feel need to be adjusted for better game play:

A ) Squad / Platoon leadership stays with outfit upon disconnection.

When a Squad or Platoon leader is disconnected, control of the squad or platoon automatically shifts to someone within the same outfit. There have been numerous times while leading a full platoon in which I or my fellow outfit members, have dropped for what ever sets of reasons only to find control of the whole platoon in the hands of a non-outfit member. An while fortunately, most players are considerate and give ownership of the platoon back to our outfit, I feel this 'middle man' issue needs to be cut entirely.

B ) A MBT's Primary Weapon System

The MBT's should hold the most powerful weapons to be deployed in the game for ground combat. While a static gun might be more powerful (sacrificing mobility for armor and firepower), it however feels like it does more damage. An MBT's HE round should be given a bigger blast radius. A AP round should '1-shot' a harasser. The HEAT round should make any non-MBT deadly to toy with. Likewise, their 'little buddy' the Lightining's primary (and only...) weapon system should see an upgrade in all three mechanics.

C ) Confederates within VR

The VR Training Grounds is a nice addition to your product. Not only giving outfits the ability to train their less skilled members in how to play the game, but allow every possible gear/weapon combination. Unfortunately, trying to train those less skilled players with 'near live fire' situations that can be controlled, is not currently in the game. Allowing a group of players to don the enemy colors with basic load outs to attack as 'defenders at the tower' would go a long way in helping us trainers explain concepts. 

Teaching for example 'watching out for ambushes' is not very helpful when our guys can see their fellow players long before being in visual range. Even worst, we want to train them to shoot the guys in RED and PURPLE (Yeah, I'm in the NC...) and not BLUE. Killing the confederate player would not earn the shooter certs or experience, but simple aid in the teaching of tactics.

D ) Better Defensive Positions

D 1 ) Exit Portals

I have not seen the test server's ideas on better defensive set ups. I do however, find the current state to be simply silly. The underground tunnels, while a step in the right direction (i.e. covered and coverted movement), their exit points are easily mined and defended against. Take the typical Amp Station. One simply places four CQB MAXs, two engineers, two medics in front of the exit points of the SCU's exit portals, could kill a whole platoon! An if they are ZOE MAX's, maybe two platoons worth. Likewise the two outer wall exits are easy to camp and trap.

D 2 ) Spawn Camping

For any moron that positions themselves in such a way as to allow someone inside the spawn zone to shoot them dead; you have no complaints worth listening to. But I find many players simply 'give up' and hide in the spawn zone. Most of them are simply trying to improve their K/D ratio. I rather have someone that can follow instructions over the best K/D zealot anyday!

Give an internal timer (which is shown on the player's HUD) of 'X' seconds. Once that time is expired, all kills they make will not earn them points nor raise their K/D Ratio. Maybe have it as a setting by the outfits that are leading the squad / platoons. The outfit leader(s) set the duration before the debuff starts, so when anyone within that outfit starts a squad / platoon its debuff timer is set to the outfit's view.

D 3 ) Bio Lab

I do not like how the current mechanic for Bio Labs. Removing the tactics to make it 'one gigantic death match' feels more like Call of Duty than Planetside 2.....

The two generators (SCU and Shield) were there to force players to defend both the capture points (usually but not limited to A, B, and C) but give a good defense of the two generators. One protecting the other forced defenders to divide up their forces to maintain coverage. That required tactics and working together with others. Two concepts that I would think makes Planetside 2 different from all other FPS's on the market.

E ) Lattice System

I find this system worthless for strategy and tactics. It really does nothing but help the total morons understand the flow of battle while forcing everyone else to wear crutchs. Take for example an AMP station guarded by two platoons. My platoon may or may not win against such a fight. But being forced straight into one, rather than flank it, deprives me of mobility an the element of surprise. They KNOW we are coming and from which direction. But if the lattice system was not in place, I could draw one of those platoons out to re-take locations my platoon is taking, while a friendly platoon from another outfit suddenly attacks the AMP Station from a totally different direction.

F ) Allow for adjustable color/shape cross hairs

Last night I was using the AT Turret the Engineer class has access. I found myself squinting close to the monitor just to see the pixel of a 'crosshair' of where the hell I was aiming on. Many of you younger types may not have this problem, but for us older players....pain in the butt! The Devs adjusted the sights on vehicles, which I found very helpful and would like it to continue onto different sights. An allow players to adjust the color(s) of those crosshairs.

G ) Structured Code Alerts

Last night I experienced what many posters on this very forum (and else where) have expressed outrage about: Code Alerts that give free points for situations where one empire already holds 90% of the conditions. The TR are controlling 80% of Indar for example and a Code Alert: Control Indar comes up. Well gee whiz.....who do you think wins that Code Alert inside thirty minutes?

I feel your 'calculation' for how and when code alerts take place to be deeply flawed. Why not HIRE some interns or part timers who simply 'push a button or two' to declare a code alert to take place. Give them a set of rules as to what possible types of code alerts could take place. Maybe even a set time when one will usually happen, so outfits can plan day events around it (i.e. 'Friday Night Op Code Alert').

H ) Communicate with the Players

When I read these forums, it feels like for every million post by players there is but one post by a someone within SOE. I have found numerous good posts by players trying to give informed ideas and thoughts on a wide range of things....but....never any communication from the Devs over the material. Yes, all of us would like you to be working on the next 'latest and greatest' for the game. BUT.....having a sense you all have a pulse by making posts on you very own forum does help players feel you care about your product. Players that feel you do not have a pulse or care of your product, soon question why they play your game. An with the very wide assortment of other entertainment already there, making players feel their thoughts and ideas are heard/understood will keep them with you rather than else where.

You might even give a series of polls. State straight out that the end poll percentage would be implemented the best you can given all circumstances. An a decent/educated guess on the lead time from the end of the poll to when it might be in the game. An there will be posts on the poll itself. It is well worth your bottom line to let those posters feel welcomed and part of the process."
1h66aa,1,2013-06-27,I just don't want to go on holiday,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h66aa/i_just_dont_want_to_go_on_holiday/,"Don't worry sweetheart, it's not because I like you. Sure, we have fights, but I still love you. The problem is that I just want some rest. School's been busy this year, and so was internship. It just ate my energy, and at one point I've had a burnout for at least three days. And, well, now that the exam's done, I just want to take it easy.

It's not like I don't like holidays either. They're fun, especially with you. And, if it wasn't for the circumstances, I would've *taken* you on holiday, instead of you going with your parents. It's just that holidays for me are nothing but social interaction, having to share the space with the campers you came with all day. And it drains my energy even more. And I can't really use that right now. I'm tired as hell.

And, I guess it would've been okay that I joined you, and had two weeks rest in advance, two weeks rest after. If your parents wouldn't have planned the start of their vacation on my birthday.

Seriously, we know each other for two years now. For the past 20 years, my birthday has been on the 14th of July. Every year, with one or two exceptions related to the health of my great-grandmother. And, seriously; how hard is it to move the vacation a bit? Just one, two days? For as far as I know, we haven't even booked yet.

The way it went is just weird, and I just want some rest. A few weeks off. I know it doesn't suit your planning, but we've been keeping your planning for most of the year. Can we just, please, for God's sake, give me some rest?

I don't know. It just doesn't work this way."

Let's do this.

* Show has started. Opie is finally all in with Zimmerman's trial. Rachel Jeantel is sassy
* Poor sweet little Jeantel is thoroughly bashed. Neck pillow
* Jeantel looks like Patrice as a tranny
* She's nowhere to be found on today's paper because she's a retard who's fucking up the prosecution's case
* The news blips ""cracker"" and ""nigger"", Jim sighs
* ""Creepy ass cracker""
* The news bleeps ""cracker"" and ""nigger"" because Trayvon said it. When Zimmerman supposedly said ""fucking coons"", it was played over and over again. Good point Jimmy. [He tweets that, in realtime](https://twitter.com/JimNorton/status/350200448503922689)
* Poor Jeantel get's mad during her testimony. Jim is consumed with rage for the press
* Internet, don't make the same mistakes of the media. Don't pixelate nipples
* They sing a song to Sydney, the intern
* They review twitter posts about precious Jeantel
* **SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION, I HAD TO TAKE A DUMP**
* They are taking a call from a lawyer. He says that this comodo dragon Jeantel will be prep to show sadness today, because it's a fine line between that and rage
* They start Aaron Hernandez talk, but are going to brake any moment
* Now they seem to be all in with this. Rumors and news reports are being discussed
* It was premeditated murder, Sam! Cotton candy gum makes it so
* DOMA's decision by the Supreme Court means more weddings to attend. Jim is happy about the decision
* Sam knows all the gay bars, for some reason. Jim wants a kiss-off with him
* **FIRST BREAK** - Jennifer Hutt calls in next. Today Colin will be in (they haven't mentioned it yet, but he [confirmed yesterday on twitter] (https://twitter.com/iamcolinquinn/status/349976795543638016))

* **Colin Quinn** is in studio
* Jenny Hut phone call (who's this bitch? She's from the media, from Dr. Drew, they say). She looks very good on TV. She lasered her ass-hair
* She tries to defend Jeantel and the prosecution's case. Chip thinks Jeantel looked zooted
* Ant gives Jenny a lesson on the legal matters of the case. Even with her account of the events, it wouldn't be murder
* Oh poor Jenny, she still thinks the Police told Zimmerman to stop the pursuit
* ""Jenny, you and the rest of the media have a lot of responsibility if riots start after Zimmerman's acquittal""
* Jenny seems to be unable to counter any of the boy's points and want's to get out of the phone. Now they talk about Paula Deen, Jenny thinks she doesn't like the blacks a lot
* Jenny denies ever using the nigger-word. Phone call is ended
* **They watch this video, what a savage, what a fucking animal**:

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dvvHMM6TF50

* There was a 3 year old child on that room. This guy is still on the loose
* Colin points out that Jim said ""there was no need for that"". Bravo Jim
* Paula Deen's Matt Lauer interview is dissected. ""Are you a racist?"" - Watch out for Matt Lauer!
* Paula Deen's accent is the perfect racist accent
* Colin does an impression of Deen's black employers for some reason
* ""Never be honest about race"" - that's the lesson
* Colin looked like John Holmes 30 years ago. Hopefully he'll end up like him
* Matt Lauer is a sneaky bastard. Tries to undermine Paula Deen's gun point robbery story. ""Shut up, Oh my God! A grown man saying n-word, what a fucking country of pussies""
* Anthony says everyone thinks about the word ""nigger""
* Colin throws out a quote: ""C'mon folks, it's comedy: somebody's gonna get hurt""
* Paula Deen doesn't participate in young niggas conversations. It's very distressing for her to know that young people say ""nigger"" all the time. Poor woman, my heart is broken for her. Who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck? Well, they keep playing the clip lol
* Discussion about white guilt in general. Opie thinks this will take time to change. Brilliant observation
* Chris Hansen new show should be ""To catch a racist""
* **Bert Marcus and Penhouse girls** next
* **SECOND BREAK**

* Bert Marcus in studio to discuss his documentary ""How to Make Money Selling Drugs""
* Colin: ""let's not act like 50 Cent is Henry Ford""
* Discussion about drugs. Not much to report... it's interesting I guess
* They talk about boxing and stuff... I'm not really liking this interview too much
* More documentary talk, plugs and:
* **THIRD BREAK**
* Colin is changing is entire schedule just to be on when Lady Di and Marion return to the show
* They remember when Lady Di and Marion went to the VMAs
* They return to sweet Jeantel, who's testifying again. Opie was right, she can't read (how she could text Trayvon Martin escapes me, then)
* **Bill Burr** is on the phone! They discuss how sweet and beautiful Jeantel is really Patrice in drag
* Bill Burr starring with A-listers makes Jim physically ill. The new movie he's in, ""The Heat"", comes out tomorrow, but don't blink during it, or you'll miss him
* Hernandez talk with Burr
* Big laughs are had because Colin makes fun of Bill. Bill reminds Colin of the Crocodile Dundy episode
* They all agree how the show has made everyone jaded and fondly remember horrific bits from the good old days
* Now Ant tries to discuss the Zimmerman trial with Burr. The others stay silent and Burr almost falls for it but quickly ends the discussion. Ant's obsession is amazing 
* Bill loves Chip. Bye bye Bill
* **Penthouse girls** are in and they're already showing tits. ""Nice figures on these gals"". They're Polish, but Opie confuses that with Russian
* ""Russian? What are you? In a hurry? Tss tsss""
* These girls are good eggs. They ""lez out""
* The two sisters can't touch each other on film because it's illegal
* They start spanking each other, or was it Chip? I didn't catch that... Multiple Oh My God's can be heard
* Fuck, I barely can keep up with this... too many things happening right now. Chip takes the sexy out of the room time and time again
* Have you both sucked a penis together? -Yes. Is it weird for you? -No, not at all
* Jim touches boobs. Chip continues to bomb. Anthony loves their pussy, what a man!
* Roland is said to want a lap dance, but apparently he's in hiding, he went to get a pic with Miley Cyrus instead
* There's the possibility for everyone to take a pic with Miley Cyrus, only Jim seems interested, but doesn't go because he already has one
* Roland is offered a lap dance again, but wants Hannah Montana instead... he's a real Mo
* These girls like beer, tequila shots and vodka. They talk really dirty on polish
* Plugs for the girls. They are on the cover of Penthouse and will be at Head Quarters (?) tonight, wherever that is
* Chip ruins the mood again. Ant needs to go to the dentist, but first he and Colin do some Russian accents, the broads are liking that - ""this is funny shit"". ""It's a comedy of errors in here"", says Chip
* Plugs for Colin. Ant really needs to go. They spot Miley Cyrus and the **SHOW IS OVER**

1h64oz,379,2013-06-27,Boss can't admit he can't speak English. I gave him a little English demo to piss him off.,ahirice,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1h64oz/boss_cant_admit_he_cant_speak_english_i_gave_him/,"CONTEXT :

I'm French and I work for a French newspaper near Paris. In the next month issue, that we are currently making, we were supposed to speak about a wine maker in Argentina. So, some work had been done on this article already, but we noticed that we had no good pictures of the place plus we needed some extra info, so we needed to contact this wine maker and ask him for it. Here was the problem : nobody in the office speaks Spanish. Anyway, I speak an English ok (I hope so) so I told my boss I could call him and try to ask for what we needed in English.
He refused because he's just pissed of when he doesn't know how to do one thing and when somebody else, especially an intern know how to do it. (like for some computer stuff and so on) So we now lack some important stuff on this paper just because of him.

REVENGE :

Petty, simple, I just loved it. I had to make a few calls in the afternoon, to some wine seller in Paris. I managed to find an Irish wine seller, saw on Qype that he spoke mostly English and not much French. I waited for my boss to come back from his lunch and sit at his office just next to mine and then called guy. I had a long speech with him, in English, staring at my boss who was grumping for the whole call.

tl; dr : Boss won't admit he can't speak english properly and refuse me to help him. I just gloriously show him off my English skills and he get pissed of."
1h62bz,2,2013-06-27,"Should I wait? Or should I say something? [Huge wall with tl;dr, at least tried to make it an easy read]",DelightfulPetrichor,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h62bz/should_i_wait_or_should_i_say_something_huge_wall/,"I (21M) have a very good friend (22M). We started off as a kind of no-strings, FWB type deal. But it wasn't ever really typical, at least for me. We would watch movies together almost every time he'd come over, and I loved us sitting there holding each other. He never came over if he wasn't planning to spend the night, which touched me because the person I had previously dated would often go home after we would be intimate (of course, they lived in the same apartment complex one building over, so it wasn't much of a deal). This guy would come over on freezing-cold nights in the dead of winter, walking all the way from his place just because he wanted to see me.

One night we were very drunk, and (with one other witness) he told me that he loved me. Now, I wasn't sure how I felt. I was still very much in love with my ex and didn't know how to process new feelings (I still love that ex so much, but it's no longer interfering with my ability to seek others for companionship). Being drunk and very surprised, as I thought myself more invested than he, I didn't know how to answer. Essentially, and disappointingly, I simply thanked him and told him I liked him too (in a far less eloquent way). The next day he didn't remember saying that, and in a way he ""took it back."" But I can't help but think he might have remembered and was just embarrassed that I didn't reciprocate, or at the very least that he meant it when he said it.

Time passed and I was considering ending our FWB situation. We were both becoming very attached, but I still didn't know what to do because my judgment on my own feelings was so hazy and I was so preoccupied with the ex. We were too close; I took him to my fraternity's winter formal, he knew things about me that very few people know, and he is one of very, *very* few people who have seen me cry while sober.

Eventually I think he got tired of waiting for me, or something like that. I knew he was looking for other people, and he asked me if I was okay with it several times. In retrospect, I think he might have been hoping I would say no, that I would ask him for something more. But I didn't get that at the time, and I wasn't ready to do that anyways, although I couldn't bring myself to end what we had myself.

Eventually he found someone and hit it off incredibly. I was very happy for him, and after one date our FWB situation was over. He just knew. Head over heels. Immediately nuts about the guy. We kept in friendly contact and although I was hurting a little as I slowly came to realize what my feelings for him had meant, I was legitimately happy for him. I kept asking when I could meet the new guy. I did at this point confess to him that my feelings were strong, but that I respected his relationship. He answered that he was very attached to me too, but this guy was simply too big of an emotional opportunity. I understood, because it wasn't my intent to steal him; I just wanted everything aired out. During this period I started seeing someone else too, but it lasted only two weeks before I had to break it off (the initial click--which was big--just unfortunately wore off, and he wanted a different dynamic than I did).

A couple weeks after my new relationship got cut off (we are still friends there too, although I feel bad for a couple things I think made me an ass, even though I have since asked his forgiveness), I was chatting with one of my acquaintances, not quite a friend, and somehow the topic of my friend's new boyfriend comes up. Now, it was just a passing comment but the acquaintance asked me to clarify who I meant, because he thought he knew him. I verified with him through a picture and him giving me the name of the boyfriend's apartment complex, which I happened to remember offhand. As it turns out, the boyfriend had hooked up with this acquaintance just one or two weeks prior, which was *well* into the relationship with this friend. I mentioned that I was shocked and didn't know how to feel about this, at which point the acquaintance mentioned that he had known the boyfriend for almost a year (far longer than my friend), and has always seen him as an emotional wreck and a compulsive liar, and that he never mentioned having a boyfriend.

At this point I had a tidal wave of emotions, mostly consisting of sadness for my friend, fury and disgust at the boyfriend for doing such a thing (I still maintain that if I ever see the fuck in person I will murder him personally), and worry, because I knew I would have to tell my friend. I wouldn't be a good friend if I didn't. But I knew it would crush him, and I wasn't sure how my feelings for him would affect how he'd receive the news. I told him he needed to come over immediately. He was planning on going to his boyfriend's apartment but I insisted he come to my place first. I have never insisted on anything with this friend, so that gave the importance of what I said quite a bit of weight, and he headed over. When I told him he was understandably upset, and I don't really want to go into that because I really, really don't want to have to remember that, sitting next to him and him trying to play it as cool as he could, but I could feel heartbreak and disappointment thick in the air around him.

I dropped him off home, and on the way I made sure to emphasize that I was at his beck and call if he needed anything, and that I would have my phone with me all night if he needed to talk. He thanked me, we hugged, I made sure he got in to his apartment and then came home.

Once I got home, my friend texts me saying his boyfriend is coming over to talk it out, and wants me to send the text messages between my acquaintance and me, so he could see exactly what was said. I was reluctant because I knew it would be painful for him to read, but I sent him a series of screenshots. While his boyfriend was on the way over, I receive a picture message from my acquaintance. It's a screenshot of a text conversation he had with the boyfriend immediately after my friend called him out on it. From that screenshot it is clear that the boyfriend's first reaction was not to apologize, but to scold my acquaintance for mentioning it, and to try and secure any future infidelity against discovery. In this conversation he *still* doesn't mention a boyfriend, but instead says something along the lines of ""Don't talk about our hookups, it's causing drama with friends."" I was livid and immediately forwarded this to my friend out of disgust so he could see exactly how his boyfriend was reacting to being caught while he wasn't around to see it.

Keep in mind my friend doesn't have very good self esteem, and aside from his obvious infatuation with the guy, he probably doesn't think he deserves any better. Over the next couple days he and I kept in frequent contact, with me just making sure he was doing okay and asking him to promise me that, whether he forgives his boyfriend or not, he won't just let it slide because of a fear to stand up for himself. Despite this, two days after the whistle was blown, the boyfriend was completely forgiven (all it took was ""Well, we weren't dating that long yet so I wasn't too attached, and I was gonna tell you sometime anyways.""). I was frustrated, but it wasn't my decision to make so I respected it. However, the first time post-scandal that he sent me a Snapchat with his boyfriend in it, I (perhaps too harshly) sent him a text message saying that I never wanted to receive any pictures or anything with his boyfriend in them ever again; although he may have forgiven the guy for doing what he did, I certainly haven't, and the less I see of his face the better. Despite my harshness it was met with calm understanding.

Time goes by, and it's months later. We both graduated college; my friend is nearby working full-time, I am still in town for the summer waiting for my first year of grad school, and the boyfriend is in Maine working for the summer for some internship or whatever (I didn't really care when told). Despite us being less than an hour apart my friend and I have not seen each other all summer, and I frequently receive messages that he misses me a lot. I have sent several of my own to that effect. However, Friday night he is coming to a party I am hosting and it will be the first time I've seen him in a long time.

My question, therefore, is this: **How should I act about this?** Should I confess that I think his boyfriend is a cunt and that I would never treat him that way? That I wish it was me? Right and wrong here seems very grey. I don't want to destroy his relationship and I *refuse* to be ""the other guy"" (I think it's been made clear in here how I feel about cheating). But I know it's going to be hard to not say *anything*, especially with alcohol involved, which is why I need a game plan.

^^^^^^.

^^^^^^.

**TL;DR:** While the story provides a lot of helpful details, here's the gist:

* FWB and I get too attached, I fail to make move
* Friend finds new SO
* Friend's SO cheats on him, acts like an asshole when caught
* Friend is coming to party this weekend, his SO is far away in Maine
* Read the very last paragraph for exactly what I'm asking."

Before continuing, please tell me if this doesn't belong on this subreddit, thanks!

So, I'm pretty open to my parents about everything, but ever since my mom has found out I smoke weed, she has been convinced that I will eventually develop an uncontrollable addiction, causing my life to spiral out of control. How can I explain to her that I'll be okay?

I understand why she's concerned. With me graduating college soon, my internship on the line, and my career ahead of me, it's hard for her to see me ""throw it away for marijuana"". But we all know what it feels like to get back from a long day. You come back feeling tired and drained, and just want to take a moment to stop and escape life's day to day struggles. Some people like to watch t.v., drink, fap, whatever. I just happen to like smoking weed after a long day.

I've been told that you don't need alcohol and drugs to have fun, and I know that's true. I have fun with friends and family, whether we're sober or not. But sometimes I enjoy a good smoke session, and it's a real downer feeling guilty about something I really enjoy and don't see as a major threat/danger.

Has anyone else been in this position? Maybe offer me advice on where to go from here? I just had a talk with my mom, and told her I've still been smoking occasionally (even though I've told her in the past I'll stop). It hurts me to see her worry about me, but I really don't feel what I'm doing is wrong.

TL;DR : Mom's worried I'll become a homeless addict, I think I'm fine, although feeling guilty about causing my mom to worry, don't know what to do from here."

But I feel so cornered right now in life, I feel like I need some input from some positive people such as yourselves.

I'm 20 years old. On the outside I'm doing fairly 'well' for myself, but I think it's mostly due to the positive influence of my parents. I'm attending a top 20 University, have a great summer internship right now with a great global company, and am going to be spending this summer studying abroad.

But here's where I'm at today: I've struggled in the past with periods of heavy use of opiates, amphetamines, alcohol, and tobacco. Currently, I come home during the lunch period of work and put a huge lip of tobacco in and jerk off to porn - every day. I binge drink on most weekends with a current girlfriend that is largely unaware of my negative habits, but I drink heavily one or two nights out of the week as well. I'm putting on weight - I will go out on the evenings and stuff myself with fast food or movie popcorn, consciously aware of the hole I'm digging myself, in a futile attempt to fill some sort of hole in myself. I smoke cigarettes occasionally as well, but I hide all of this from the roommates that I live with.

I'm ashamed with all of this. I'm afraid of the habits that I'm living in, but I don't see a way out. There are periods that I establish temporary good habits (eating, exercise, diet), and I end up feeling great...but this always leads to a reversion to my old bad habits.

I feel backed into a corner here. I think I have so much potential, but I don't know what I want. I spend a lot of time studying philosophy and discussing ideas and wondering what I should be doing with my life, but I lack any sort of actual motivation to change anything around. I feel helpless.

I feel helpless, but I also feel like a piece of fucking shit because I know that I should have, and do have in me, the power to change all this shit. I know I'm doing it to myself. I hate feeling sorry for myself, but I do. And I'm ashamed of it.

I don't know if any of you can relate or anything like that, but honestly at this point I just need to put this out there in the hopes that someone has something to say to me."

I am 21 years old and started learning about filming about two years ago.  I have done a lot of research and made some short films on my own but I need to take it to the next step. So far i'm doing this on my own- with some help from close friends; but I want to work on a larger scale with more people already in the business that I can learn from.  I figured interning is the best way to build connections and, most importantly, learn/ get hands-on experience.  I want to eventually get to Bollywood where I have some connections but I need to really sharpen my experience and perfect my skills before I use those connections.

I wanted to know what the best way of finding/getting an internship is (PAID OR UNPAID -doesn't matter)? just so I can start somewhere and get in-field experience.  
Have any of you done this before? or know somebody that has? 
and if you have any tips on the best way to go about finding the right people to work with (agencies/directors/production companies/etc) - it would be really appreciated.

My main dilemma is that I don't know if it would be right for me to just email production companies or directly reach out to directors? What is the right protocol in my situation. Any input would be of great help at this point!

At the end of the car Senor Tigre sits in a lush high backed chair reading a newspaper, without looking up he gestures across from him at a similar chair.*

ST:  Hola, senorita, allow me just one moment.  Wilikins, wine.

*{The butler disappears in a flash}*

VSJ:  It makes me uncomfortable when he’s in a good mood- which begs the question:  whyis he so happy?

ST: *{Still looking at his paper}* Did ju not see him knock Larry unconscious?  That made him giddy, even if he could go no farther because I gave him specific rules about how much injury he could inflict.  Just one more moment, please.

*{Wilikins reappears with two glasses of red wine, handing one to Tigre and drinking the other}*

VSJ:  None for me?

W:  Nope.  Yer workin’.

ST:  Finished. *{Tigre folds the paper}* President Abdullah Gul has a serious problem on his hands, no?  In Hurtsville we dealt with the problems of protests and riots quickly; after the first one we informed our public that all decisions would come down to a vote.  As mi hermano could care less about telling others what to do- we decided that vote would be mine, One Man One Vote.  Any that did not like it did not have to live.  In Hurtsville or at all.  I digress, ju have asked for an interview Victoria and I have allowed it.

VSJ:  Well, how are you feeling after the grueling match this Monday with our RWF champion, Chris Steel?

ST:  Grueling?  A bit over dramatic, Miss St. James, I feel fantastic, as a matter of fact- I could do it again.  And again.  There is nothing quite like feeling a man struggle to breathe, knowing that in their head it must slowly dawn on them to **ASK** me to stop so they may live.  

VSJ:  What about Steel’s assertion that he never tapped, let alone lost?

ST:  I feel saddened by Chris’ statements.  Since joining the RWF, and as a prideful man ju know this hurts to say this: I have not been tremendously successful in the singles scene.  Just two weeks ago I lost to El Mondo Loco, and do I deny it?  No.  I embrace my losses.  I do not hide from the truth as our paper champion does.  Perhaps, if he focused more on lucha libre and less on marketing he could win a match against a man he had all but two advantages over.

VSJ:  Are you saying he had two advantages over you or vice versa?

ST:  Steel is heavier, stronger than I and almost as mean as I am.

VSJ:  So where was he at a loss?

ST:  I am faster and much, much better looking.  Not to mention that I am supremely gifted in a technical way.

VSJ:  So any plans for the RWF now?

ST:  We, that is to say mi hermano y yo, have been left off of the card this week, and the children of Hurtsville weep at this crime.  Personally, I find it an affront, I had just utterly deconstructed the champion, one week after Foiler did the same to Steel and…RJ *{the name come out as almost a growl}* Supernova.  But there is nothing to say that I won’t show up anyway.  Or maybe I go to Ibiza.  Who knows?

VSJ:  One last question:  Steel claims that your mask is selling poorly and that he is paid better- any comment?

ST:  The mask is not selling well, it’s true, but when Wilikins sees someone who is not me impersonating me, he gets... overzealous, and hospitals get full of head wounds.  As for my pay:  Ownership of Hurtsville Inc., and the Quaker Meat factory as well as being part ruler of my own country, has given me the leverage to negotiate my contract in such a way that allows RWF to hire better competition.  The Board saw fit to take the money that they saved from my negotiation and spend it on the likes of Damien Mitchell, his Congregation and Joey Knight.  None of whom are on my level, of course, but who truly is?

*{Tigre claps twice, a young man in a uniform of the Honor Guard but with a sash that says ‘intern’ places a tray in front of Tigre and Wilikins follows with a silver platter, two meals a top.  Both the intern and Wilikins leave quickly.}*

VSJ:  Was that…

ST:  Shhh…  I have very little fun.  Making his life a small amount of hell is teaching him things he needs to become more successful.  Fights are not the honorable contests he thinks they are. "
1ha4mk,6,2013-06-28,Scaring Demons,itsinyoursoul,IrrelevantStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/IrrelevantStories/comments/1ha4mk/scaring_demons/,"This one was told to me by my shrink, when I was at the crazy ward. A few rooms away from where I was staying, there was a guy that kept screaming at random intervals. They never let him out, he didn't eat with us nor joined any of the mandatory activities, so I was curious. At first my shrink didn't want to tell me about it, but I insisted and after a while he agreed to tell me. Here's what happened.

The guy was a schizofrenic, his family had him sent there because he saw demons. At first it wasn't so bad, he would scream whenever he saw a demon, and the demons would go away, and this wasn't too often so it didn't affect anyone. Then, he started seeing demons everywhere, it got more frecuent, so he screamed a lot. Every time he saw a demon, he would scream to scare them away, and he was convinced his place in this earth was to scare away the demons. He'd go out, chasing demons, screaming at random and putting himself in danger, so their family had him checked in the ward to stop him from being hurt (and probably because it would get really annoying, really).

First days, the guy stood quiet, as new interns usually are. They hit you with a huge mix of drugs for the first days, before they go to the actual treatment, and slowly leave with just the drugs you need. So at first, he was almost in a catatonic state, but as he slowly began to recover, he began to ask about the demons. The schizophrenia was under control, so the demons weren't coming anymore... But that's not the way the guy took it.

The guy is still screaming, but now he does completely at random, because he can't see the demons, so he has to be extra careful now. He still believes his job is to scream the demons away, and keeps doing it, even if everyone tells him they're not real.

To be honest, I didn't mind his screams after hearing that. The guy was trying to protect us all, even if nobody was grateful for it. 

Also, what if he was right? "

I have been together with my GF for nearly a year. She's an amazing and beautiful woman, albeit a few quirks.

Long story short - I make good money for someone my age, but I have quite a few debts too (student loans, car payment, credit card from college - etc.) and I'm wanting to get out from under it. She knows that I make good money, but I'm pretty sure that she's not certain that I do have a number of financial obligations. I'm living paycheck to paycheck and I don't have a savings or backup plan. I'm just trying to paydown all my debt ASAP. It's to the point where I'm looking to get a 2nd job. :(

Her - She's finishing up her degree - but she (literally this week) just started a solid internship with a major company and will be making decent money - fulltime. She has just her monthly expenses and has absolutely $0 in long-term debt (car payment, student loans etc) and will now have extra money which she plans on saving every month so that she doesn't have student loans when coming out of college. 

When we go out, I'm usually expected to pick up the tab. I like to pay for dates and the occasional fancy dinner. It's being nickeled and dimed though all the other times. 

When we go out with friends to a Bar, she expects me to pick up her drinks. We went out for lunch today, and she saw me pull my debit card out, and she was like ""Oh, thanks for picking up lunch!"" We're always taking my car wherever, because she's not too fond of driving - so there's gas money. When we go to a Sporting Event, I'll get the ticket, food, beer (what a joke that is... fuckin $9 a beer...) She'll want to grab ice cream during the week... etc. etc. etc.

It's my biggest complaint about our relationship. I'd like to use some of the money I make...well...for me. 

Now, I'm pretty good at communicating with her. We're very open - but I want to approach this without sounding like a cheap bastard or an asshole.

How do I approach this subject? Advice?

These 3-d models will then be converted to a 2-d sprite image and re-introduced in our 2-d isometric environment.  
  
**Where we stand in terms of developing the game**  
We're about to enter the exciting phase of unit interactions.  
Currently our code has developed to a point where we can start accommodating said building/terrain/unit assets.  We have unit pathfinding and movement working, and can generate a city with a realistic clustering of building types, roads, and bridges.
  
Likewise, we've been successful at generating a large map with a natural looking terrain.  We've reached a map resolution of 2048*2048 tiles.  
  
-To get a feel of how well we've been able to randomly generate the contours we find in natural geography, here is a close up screen-shot that details our terrain generation on a micro scale

-This is a screen-shot of our seed generated map on a macro 2048*2048 scale 
http://i.imgur.com/PS4qrJM.png   
  
You may be wondering why our game looks so bland. The fact of the matter is that our current team members need to focus on the coding and coding alone. We do not have the time, or energy to pay attention to graphics.  
We are looking for someone willing/capable to take initiative on the graphics end.  
  
**Work ethic**
This game is large commitment on everyone’s end. We're trying to move as fast as we can given our limitations on free-time and our ineptitude to compensate anyone(including ourselves).  
The coders don't a have a lick of free-time as most of it either goes to school, intern-ships, work, or the development of this game. If we can expect the same from you, you'd be a good addition to the team.  
  
**Quality of work**  
We're not expecting top notch quality models from anyone. Only their full and undivided effort.  
We're willing to accommodate novices and intermediate level graphics people as long as they're reliable and produce better content than the coding team is capable of producing.  
We value work ethic, over skill and ability. 
  
**Communication**  
We rely heavily on skype for communication and use it on a daily basis.

**Contact us**
Send a pm with you skype user ID, name, and a working email. This is our primary measure for accountability. 
We're also using this to build a private profile for graphics artists we plan to reference whenever new projects come up.  
  
Tell us a bit about yourself and your current capabilities within the field of computer graphics/animation.
  
You can also post references to your portfolio/work in this thread so that it could be shown off to other people looking for Artists.
  
**Payment**

Anyone want to talk about how similar excited and terrified can feel?,allicinlover,PolishGauntlet,https://www.reddit.com/r/PolishGauntlet/comments/1h9tad/ot_ive_got_some_major_life_change_stuff_happening/,"Sooo.... you may or may not have noticed I basically disappeared for two weeks.  This is because in the past TWO WEEKS I have:

* Had a thesis committee meeting (I'm in a PhD program)
* Gotten the official ok from said thesis committee to GRADUATE in the fall
* Discovered an internship posting that was, I swear, crafted specifically for me... at the holy grail of companies in my field
* Convinced my PI that said internship is a good idea (disappointingly difficult)
* Applied for said internship 
* Interviewed for said internship
* Been offered and accepted said internship (HOLY CRAP)
* Gotten final acceptance for my first-author paper to be published in a great journal (FINALLY)

Can I just take a moment to ask IS THIS REAL LIFE?  Don't get me wrong, I know these are all fantastic things, and I am excited.  But I don't do well with change, and since I live on campus, this means that in december while I am preparing to give my thesis defense talk and looking for a job, I also have to be moving and deciding where to live (probably before I actually know where I'll be working).  So there is a large part of me that's TERRIFIED.  

Add on to that, my live-in boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years.  We've talked about marriage for a long time, and the only thing stopping us currently is that he's not 100% sure he wants kids.  We are both scientists, and he's used a hard-core dedication to science to replace a bond with his family (long story) so he's worried that if we start a family he'll have to give up something that's a central part of his life up until now.  We decided a while ago that basically by the time I graduate he needs to decide yes or no.  I am 90% sure he'll decided he wants to have kids, it's sort of a pattern for us that he's a bit slower to get to the next level than I am, and I typically am much more in tune with his emotions than he is.  So I'm not tooooo worried.  But still.  By the time I graduate, we will likely be either engaged (unofficially perhaps) , or broken up.  

Phew.  

So that's what's up with me.  It's amazing how much excited and scared can feel alike, even down to the physical symptoms.  Can anyone relate?  How do you guys deal with change and uncertainty in what your life will look like in a couple months?  

TL;DR My life went from the grad school routine that I've lived for 6 (admittedly not terribly pleasant) years to.... I don't even know.  In two weeks.  I'm excited but freaked out.  Can anyone relate?  Please tell me I'm not crazy."

I discovered this subreddit and I realized I really wanted to tell someone the truth about me.

To begin with, there's not much about me. My whole life, I've been a constant mess, with no ambitions or goals. In highschool, I was a B- student, but i was able to graduate 4 years ago. 

I guess I can start my story from my senior year of high school. After being obsessed with a girl for nearly 4 years, I finally found a girl who liked me, I'll call her Stacy. As we started progressing into a relationship, my best friend came in and messed it up for us.
Months passed, I started seeing other friends. A few friends pointed out that Stacy would follow me in the hallways. I didn't want to be full of myself, so I asked her. She confessed that she had feelings for me, so we started taking things slow. But after a few weeks passed, she told me that she would get sexually harassed where she would intern, by my best friend.

My best friend was also obsessed with a girl for 4 years, so I tried to fix things between Stacy and him. But she really didn't want that, so I made him stop and Stacy and I started our relationship. 
It didn't last very long. The summer I was with Stacy, I only saw her 3 times in 2 months. Her parents were strict and we only communicated online, but we drifted apart. My college was starting so I arranged my whole schedule to match with hers. After my 3rd week of college, we broke things off. I guess I didn't want that and I became super obsessive. I kept spamming her about how much I missed her and other 'creepy' things. If she was more active on Reddit, I'm sure I would have ended up on /r/creepyPMS

My freshman year of college was a disaster. I became too upset with the break up and lost focus of everything. My grades fell, and I hit a personal low. And before I realized, I was on academic prohibition by the end of my freshman year.

I didn't realize what academic prohibition meant til my sophomore semester was about to start. I got an email saying that I couldn't register for classes and I had to talk to a councilor to fix my situation. Instead of doing that, I decided to pretend to go to school. My first year of faking, I would just go to the library, and work on writing few stories I had come up with. 

Another year passed and my ID card wasn't getting accepted at the entrance, so I resorted to spending my days at public areas, like parks, and libraries. 

So now I just finished my third year of faking my college experience. I told my parents/family/friends I'm a fourth year Junior, with a 3.5 GPA, studying premed, majoring in Chemistry. I know, I'm caught up in my own web of lies. It's MCAT season, and my parents are being extra hard on me. They want to put me into MCAT prep, willing to spend thousands of dollars, and I am completely lost. I feel like my time is running out and I'm losing my mind. Telling the truth isn't an option. I feel like my walls are closing in. 
This is my first time revealing my life to anyone. And any advice would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR** I let a relationship mess up my life, and I have been lying about my everything for the past 4 years, and I feel like my time is running out.

1h93bm,7,2013-06-28,I need to get something off my chest...,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1h93bm/i_need_to_get_something_off_my_chest/,"So I am finding myself becoming more and more reclusive because of people, and I hate it.  Every single time I go somewhere without a guy (and sometimes even then) I have guys acting very inappropriately towards me.  I stopped going to parties because every time I would go I had at least one (usually more than one) guy try to get me drunk/alone.

I was naive enough early in college to think nothing would happen to me, but sure enough not one party went by that didn't end in a guy molesting/taking advantage of me.  Of course I was never defended by any of my friends because a few of the times the guy was some person they were interested in.  I was also raped by a guy I was friends with throughout high school who surprise visited me one weekend because I was still stupid enough to trust him because I had turned him down years ago and thought we established we were just friends.  This guy also then harassed me after that weekend by filling my voicemail inbox and sending me all sorts of nasty messages because I wouldn't talk to him after that.  I was terrified and spiralled into a deep depression where I felt absolutely worthless and ended up sleeping around, drinking and smoking the next year because I felt if I normalized everything it wouldn't hurt anymore.  But it only made things worse... 

I eventually got myself back on my feet, entered a new relationship with a guy who wasn't very nice or even attractive but still gave me a sense of stability.  But was this the end where I could be comfortable around people again?  No. I went to one close friend's birthday party because she begged me, and after dodging guys trying to get me to drink with them the guy she was trying to date tried to get us to have a threesome with him, which upset her greatly.  I go to a Halloween party for another friend later that year, and her fiance got drunk and pinned me down and started groping and kissing me (which she walked in on and started bawling...which at least that stopped him).  I go to an anime convention the following spring, get approached by a photographer and his assistant, get convinced to take pictures away from the crowds, I think it's safe because he has an assistant with him, but he keeps asking for more provocative poses and then starts moving my costume to look certain ways and then starts feeling up my crotch.  I go grab food with coworkers after work, and end up blacking out and not being too sure what happened.  These were the only times I left my apartment besides classes/work for well over a year. 

So I'm frankly terrified of social situations now.  I'm extremely wary of every guy that talks to me who isn't a relative or my boyfriend, and girls usually aren't very nice to me either.  I even avoid shopping at stores alone.

Why I'm posting all this now, though, is I thought it had been a while and maybe I'm strong enough to try going and doing something alone again last night. My boyfriend is currently at an internship hundreds of miles away from me, so I decide to go to our climbing gym by myself last night so I'm not completely out of practice by the time he comes back. There weren't any other women around who weren't preoccupied, so when this one guy who had climbed with my friend and I before asked if I wanted him to belay me, I agreed.  It's a public place that I've been to a lot with my boyfriend.  Nothing will happen, right?  Hah. I'm terrified to go back now.  The guy who belayed me first started to try flirting with me and flattering me.  I start talking about my boyfriend, and he just criticizes him for being ""too young"" and also makes fun of the friend who was there with me the other day.  I'm annoyed but ignore his comments and try to focus on climbing, but then he starts touching me. That's when my heart started racing.  He grabbed my arm to comment on how fit I was looking, grabbed my ankle when I was on the wall, and poked at my chalk bag attached just above my butt.  To make it even worse, he had the nerve to ask me out to dinner or to ""watch movies"" at his place.  I went home.

Sorry for how long this is. I just really need to get it all off my chest and don't really have any friends who remotely sympathize with me. I don't dress provocatively.  I avoid obviously dangerous situations and barely even drink. But I'm so terrified of doing anything alone and don't know what to do.. :("

Attending an REU in Florida in the summer definitely has its benefits.  While we were expected to work hard during the week, the program planned a fair amount of excursions into the surrounding areas.  We went canoeing, took trips to springs and estuaries, and even drove down to the Florida Keyes for a long weekend trip (a future story).  One trip we had planned was for a snorkeling trip off the gulf coast of Florida, a place called Cedar Key.  Unfortunately, the Cedar Key trip overlapped with a very important date:  the midnight release of the final Harry Potter book!

I had already planned (in secret), to head out to the local Walmart with Geode and Browneye, two **huge** Harry Potter fans, in order to get ourselves a copy.  When we learned that the Keys trip would interfere with us, we needed a new plan . . .

&gt; Be me, three days before Cedar Key trip.

&gt; Read details of trip in email from chaperone – drive two hours on day 1, stop at such-and-such hotel, etc. etc.

&gt; Cross reference route with booksellers

&gt; [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Animation3.gif) Walmart *across the street* from our first hotel!

&gt; Inform Geode, Browneye of the plan:  get to hotel ~ 8pm, eat dinner, camp in Walmart to get book @ midnight.

&gt; They’re in!

&gt;  Trip is getting started, we are taking two large passenger vans.

&gt;  Beginning of trip uneventful, Browneye lets our plan be known.

&gt; No one else in our van is willing to stay out until midnight at Walmart, but one girls asks Browneye if she’ll pick her up a copy.

&gt; Pull into Sleep-Easy motel, can spy Walmart across the street.

&gt;  Location is your basic hicktown stripmall.  Grocery store, a few restaurants, Walmart, etc.

&gt;  Dinner is consumed, Geode and I head to the grocery to get snacks for the night and next day.

&gt; [orw] (http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/high_five_snl.gif) We find *Harry Potter Cupcakes*, six-pack.

&gt; We figure we have plenty of cupcakes and food, and return to the hotel to show BrownEye our terrific find.

&gt; I am carrying most food, Geode has cupcakes in the see-through tin.

&gt;  Knock on Browneye’s door.

&gt;  Knocking continues after I have stopped.

&gt; Getting faster.

&gt; And closer.

&gt; Could a jackhammer have fallen over in a bowling alley?

&gt;  Nope, just Hamhock, stampeding towards us.  It could be me, but I think she is getting heavier.  About one month into our REU, and I don’t think I’ve seen her do anything exercise excepting the futbol game.

&gt;  Hamhock:  “Ohmigawd, I thought you guys were going to leave me.  I heard about your Harry Potter plans from Fitgirl.  I wanna come too!  It’s been forever since I hung out with you, RadicalEucalyptus!”

&gt;  Fucking Fitgirl.

&gt;  Okay, fine, come sit with us.  Whatever.

&gt; Unload the food in Browneye’s room and show everyone the cupcakes.  

&gt; Each cupcake has a Harry Potter plastic ring on it, embedded in a thick frosting of two colors (Gold/Crimson for Gryffindor, and Purple/Green for Slytherin).

&gt; Hamhock has to have one now.  Argues, “It’ll be like pre-gaming the snacks!”

&gt;  Sure, whatever.  Mention to everyone not to eat the plastic ring.

&gt;  Hamhock opines, “Ha ha, RadicalEucalyptus.  You’re so funny” in between bites.

&gt;  We decide against eating the rest of the cupcakes, and will bring them to give out to someone else in line.

&gt;  Bring a few other snacks too.  I carry some, Hamhock has some, and Browneye and Geode have blankets/pillows.

&gt;Head to the Walmart.  Hamhock bringing up the rear.

&gt;  Harry Potter line is very short, we are one of the first ten people.  They even have the special edition available!

&gt;  We start chatting and munching.  Talk about predictions, which books/movies we liked the best, etc.

&gt;  I say, “Goblet of Fire was probably my favorite, but that last book sure had a great ending.  I’ve got a friend back at school who even thinks that Dumbledore isn’t actually dead . . .”

&gt;  Hamhock slaps my knee and leaves her hand there:  “OHMIGHAWD!, ME TOO! See because you never see the body and where did his ring go and why would he say this and R.E.B stands forandDumbledoreisawesomeand . . .

&gt;  Tell her to calm down, and scoot out of her meager reach.  She scoots too.

&gt; Geode gives me a queer look.  Kind of like [this] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tumblr_md5h6phUZY1rnvwt1.gif).

&gt;  I head off to the bathroom, wander around the store a little after I am done (scoping out movies and videogames and such).

&gt;  When I get back, it is only Geode waiting in line; other people have wandered off.

&gt;  Geode:  “You will not believe what Hamhock just said.”

&gt;  “Let me guess:  She’s hungry, and if off buying deep-fried something?”

&gt;  “No, close though.  She says she’s into you.”

&gt;  [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NeoNo.gif)



&gt; Why.  **BUT, WHY!!!**

&gt; Geode explains that we got off to a bad start, but since then:  1.  I defended her during soccer game, 2.  She only wanted to watch movie because I would be there, 3. Realized after getting mad that she was fucking it all up, so got much nicer.

&gt; I suspect some new horror is in store, but I am not too troubled.  Afterall, she’ll get the idea if I make it clear enough.

&gt;  Hamhock returns, sits down.  Geode and I have hatched a plan.

&gt;  Geode, “So, RadicalEucalyptus, how is your girlfriend’s summer internship going?”

&gt; Hamhock turns her head way too fast; is clearly taken aback by this.

&gt; “RadicalEucalyptus . . . you have a g/f?”

&gt; “Yes”, I explain.

&gt;  For the next half hour or so, Hamhock makes vainly subtle attempts to learn as much as she can about my relationship back home.

&gt; “Oh, that sounds interesting.  So, what kind of internship is your g/f working at?”

&gt; “She sounds nice, how’d you two meet?”

&gt; “I am trying to picture what kind of girl would be able to nab you – what’s she look like?” (**seriously?**)

&gt; I say, “Oh, she’s pretty nice.  A little shorter than I am, weighs a little more, but pretty athletic.  One time I nailed her in the eye when we were playing racquetball.  It was definitely her fault.”

&gt; “Oh, so she’s one of those exercise is life kind of girls, huh?

&gt; Not sure how to respond to that, change subject.

&gt; Some little kids (maybe 7 and 10 years old?) walk by with their mom, and they are *adorable*.  They are both dressed in robes and have hats and wands.

&gt;  I start talking to them about Harry Potter, and ask them if they are excited.  Shocker:  they are.

&gt;  I tell them, “Well, if it is okay with your mom, we have two extra *Harry Potter Cupcakes*.  Would you like them?

&gt;  They look up at their mom, who nods to them and has a very appreciative look in her eye.

&gt; Hamhock:  “But, RadicalEucalyptus, we don’t have those cupcakes anymore.”

&gt;  Me:  “Why not?”  I know the answer before I finish my question . . .

&gt;  “Well, I ate them already.”

&gt; [mfw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dean-what-gif.gif)

&gt; [little girls’ fw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/unfair.gif)

&gt; [mother’s fw] (http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/maad.gif)

&gt; Kids are crying now.  Mother says, “Thanks a lot”.  And I mumble and embarrassed apology.  They head back to their spot in line.

&gt;  I turn to Hamhock, “What.  The.  Fuck.  Why did you eat the other cupcakes?  When?”

&gt;  “I ate them on the way over, after you said you were giving them away.”

&gt;  “Yes.  **To other people**.  Not to you.  You already had one.  Then you just scarffed down two more on our way over here?  And then you didn’t even tell us?

&gt;  “I didn’t think it was a big deal  . . . my blood sugar was feeling low and I was hungry”

&gt;  “It wouldn’t have been a big deal, *if* you had told us.  Then I wouldn’t have accidentally tortured an entire family!  And how were you hungry?  We had dinner an hour earlier, and you already had one cupcake!”

&gt;  Silence.

&gt; She blurts out, “Fuck this, I am going back to the room.”

&gt; At least five separate children gasp at her outburst.

&gt;  Hamhock struggles to her feet and waddles away in huff, without a book.  Everyone in the near vicinity who witnessed the event feels terrible.  Except for Geode, who is smiling.

&gt; “What’s so funny?”

&gt;  “I wonder how hot she is for you now . . .”

&gt;  “Get bent, Geode.  Get bent.”

tl;dr – I promise cupcakes to pre-teen wizards; Hamplanet has already inhaled them.

1h8zuz,1,2013-06-28,"Long distance didnt work, we broke up, will be in the same town in two months",506999,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h8zuz/long_distance_didnt_work_we_broke_up_will_be_in/,"Ok so me and my girlfriend were together for about 9 months. We met in college, we came from seperate provinces so on holidays we were pretty much always apart, so we were no stranger to being apart from each other for a couple weeks at a time.

Although the summer came this year, she returned home, and i went to Europe for an internship. We knew long distance for 3.5 months would be very difficult, but we accepted it would be tough and decided to stick it out and stay together. I was a little more skeptical than she was about the long distance thing, and she was the one who more or less pushed for it over and over saying i could trust her and we would forsure be ok throughout the summer.

Weve had the odd fight since ive been away, but nothing serious. And afterwards weve even said how were fine and were only fighting because we miss each other and everything will be fine when were back to school.

Although last week, she informed me she was super stressed out. That me being away has confused her to no end and she basically doesnt feel the same anymore. She admitted she still has feelings for me, but doesnt feel the great connection we had when we were together. She said the whole thing was overwhelming and too stressful, so she ended it.

Through conversation afterwards she said things like ""im just so confused"", ""i dont know what to do, i still dont know what to do"". ""I need myself more than anyone right now"".

I understand how being apart is stressful, and how she needs to be happy in order for us to be happy. But this whole thing came as a surprise to me and hurts a lot to deal with. She's very adamant that this is indeed the end, and we will no longer be together. But at the same time, judging by what shes said, i think its realistic that once were back in the same town and going to the same school, her opinion might change.

Im in a very weird spot right now because i do still love this girl. I want to be with her. And i want to do whatever i can to help us get back together in September. But at the same time, if this is indeed the end, its almost impossible to try to forget about her and move on with the constant thought of seeing her everyday again come Sept.

What can I do to help myself, her and us in this situation?"
1h8vuu,35,2013-06-28,r4r Adventure: Rough a[f]ter the storm[m],[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1h8vuu/r4r_adventure_rough_after_the_stormm/,"Any good investor you need to diversify your portfolio.  When is comes to meeting women I would give the same advice.  Whatever you are looking for you shouldn’t be hesitant to check all over.  You can find quick hookups at a bar just as you can on Craigslist.  You just have to know what you want and you have to know what to look for.  I’ve got an active social life, but that doesn’t stop me from looking online for a hook up.  Inmy last adventure I told you the story of how I met a GoneWildCurvy girl on Craigslist.  Well this story is all about the time I met a crazy little 20 year old on r4r.

It started one night while browsing r4r.  Personally I feel like that area of Reddit is the worst structured to actually meet anyone.  Any girl that posts something half intelligent is going to get a flood of PMs.   Those that comment have their words out in the open.  It’s hard to seduce when everyone is watching.  However, this was when I first joined Reddit so I didn’t know about these pitfalls.  I happily and ignorantly browsed on looking for someone in my area.  After a few pages I surprisingly came across a very forward sexual ad.  “F4MM” was the title.  Inside this 20 year old girl described how she wanted two men to absolutely manhandle her – nothing between the two of them, she just wanted to be the center of attention.  Being the sexually open individual I am I messaged her and volunteered.  Since this is not the type of arrangement that most guys are looking for I’m sure my response stood out.  She messaged me back quickly and soon we exchanged pictures, numbers, and before long dirty texts.  Her name was Becky and she liked it rough.  She was curious to be between two guys and she’d never done anything like this before.   Becky was an intern for some large financial agency and all of her co-workers were white shirt and black tie types.  She needed to cut loose, she needed a cock in her mouth and a cock in her pussy, and she needed it soon.  Unfortunately, she couldn’t get out of the house that night and she had to cancel.  She said she’d text me back but I figured she’d lost her nerve and I’d never hear from her again. 

A few weeks pass and we’d just had a large storm that thankfully left no damage but was big enough to scare everyone from going into work - everyone except for me that is.  As I trudged in on my normal morning commute the lack of traffic was noticeable.  I got to work and the door was locked - no work today I guess.  Since I’d made my way in and the city was nice and quiet.  I decided to walk around and enjoy this rare occasion.  After walking for a little bit I popped into a little restaurant to grab some breakfast.  While sitting and waiting for my egg sandwich I popped open my phone and started browsing r4r.  The only post in my area was from a girl the night before looking for some company during the storm.  There weren’t many replies so I decided to see what my chances were.  Within minutes I get a reply saying, “Hi, I remember you!”  Turns out it was the Becky and she was just under a different alt.  I had long forgotten her number so she shot it over to me again.  We started texting and she apologized for not getting back to me.  I told her it was really no problem and she surprised me be asking if I was still up for some fun.  Well when opportunity comes knocking you need to grab it by the hair and shove your cock down her throat.  That’s how that saying goes right?

She asked me to give her an hour then text her since she wanted to clean and get her roommates out of the way.  I wondered why her roommates would be such a problem but I figured an hour wasn’t long at all.  I finished my breakfast, then went to the store and got some condoms.  True to her word an hour later she texted me with the address and asked me to call her when I got outside.  Her neighborhood was a pain to park in but I soon found a spot.  I parked and called her as I walked up.  Her place wasn’t a house and it wasn’t quite a dorm.  I could tell it was where these companies squished as many of the out of town interns as possible.  Right after I strolled up in front the massive main door opened and there stood little Becky. 

She was a petite girl, not larger than 5’3” and if she weighted 100 pounds that would be generous.  She stood there in an orange t-shirt and yoga pants.  She turned to make sure the door didn’t slam behind her and I saw just how well those pants fit her.  At that moment I can’t tell you how badly I want to find the person that invented yoga pants and buy them a beer.  Her legs were skinny but her ass stuck out like a shelf.  The dark material clung to her butt for dear life and was just sheer enough to give me a glance of the matching orange thong that she had underneath.  She recognized me right away and came over and gave me a hug.  She told me that once we got up to her apartment that I should go right into her room on the left and try not to make a lot of noise.  I told her that I can stay quiet but I highly doubt that she would.  She blushed and smiled; she knew inviting me over was a good idea.

I followed her up the stairs to her apartment.  The walls were narrow but I barely noticed as my eyes were glued to her ass right in front of me.  I was tempted to reach out and grab it but I had a feeling that if I did that we’d never make it to her room.  When we got to her door she opened it and ushered me to her room.  She closed the door and it was at this point that I finally realized why she had to worry about her roommates – they didn’t just share an apartment, the three of them shared a room.  The bunk beds on the right side of the room and a stand-alone bed on the left, women’s clothes were strewn everywhere and I had a quick flashback to my college days in a three-person dorm.  She slipped back in quickly with a small plank of wood that she carefully wedged behind the door “for privacy”.  I sat on the edge of the lone bed.  She smiled slyly and told me she was a little nervous.  I told her to come close to me and when she came within arms distance I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her in for a kiss.  When our lips met for the first time her nervousness melted away.  Her tongue pushed forcefully back into mine and she made an almost inaudible moan.  I stood up and grasped her perfect little ass.  She let me know how much she liked the feeling of my hands squeezing her by letting out a louder moan.  I responded by lifting her up off the ground.  Surprise by my strength she wrapped her legs around me and proceeded to grind her pussy into my stomach.  It was fun to see her so quickly lose control.  I could tell that she liked the helplessness of being in the air without control.  After keeping her up in the air for a while I tired of just making out and set her back down on her feet.  I finally broke off the kiss and sat on the bed.  She looked at me with eyes of fiery passion and I ordered her to come to me.

I took her by the wrists and brought her across my knees.  I pulled her pants down and confirmed that bright orange thong that I glimpsed earlier.  She feigned a fight to get up and once I put my left arm on her back to hold her down she relented.   I pulled her panties down around her knees with the rest of her yoga pants.  Her bare white bubble butt was now starting at me.  I ran my hand up the length of her leg from the back of her knee to the beautiful round cheeks in front of me.  I let my fingers brush and tease the outside of her pussy.  I was surprised by how wet she was already.  I didn’t check but all of that grinding on me must have soaked right through her panties.  To say she was ready is an understatement.  I rubbed her ass with a circular motion and she looked back at me.  “Are you ready?”  I asked her.  She answered better than I could have imagined with, “Please, don’t be gentle.”

With those four simple words I brought my hand down with a purpose.  The first smack against her flesh released so much force into her that immediately a perfect raised print of my hand formed.  She tried to hold it in but couldn’t – the yelp that left her lips was sure to attract the attention of her roommates if the sound of the smack hadn’t already.  I warned her that she wouldn’t be able to keep quiet.  At least the door was propped shut to prevent and intrusions to our fun.  From that point on I brought my palm down on her like a blacksmith forging steel.  Each hard rhythmic slap forged her into something stronger, something sexier, and something hungrier to get fucked.  I finally stopped when my hand became too sore to continue.  I paused and took a moment to survey the damage I had done.  Her ass wasn’t just red it was a bright glowing color.  There were lighter spots where you can see my handprints and darker spots where it looked like the flesh was about to tear.  When she turned around I saw the unmistakable mark of tears that had fallen down as well as a smile that said nothing but satisfaction.  More forcefully than the first time, I ran my hand up her leg to her pussy.  I felt her wetness somewhere in the middle of her thighs.  She was leaking and when she got up I saw the mess that was now on my lap.  At this point I didn’t need an excuse to take off my pants although the giant wet spot that she created would have sufficed.  I stood up and removed my jeans while her eyes were fixated on the sizable bulge in my underwear.

I started to remove my shirt and she responded by removing hers as well as her bra.  I remember being surprised by how big her breasts looked on her frame.  They weren’t large but looked much bigger since she was so small.  Her nipples sat erect and stared right at me.  Instinct took over and I attacked one of them.  As my mouth worked here breast over I allowed a finger to slip into her wet snatch.  Soon another joined it as I thrust my fingers deep inside of her.  Every sound she made pushed me to go further and put another inside her so I obliged.  I decided that I wanted a taste of her sweet cunt so I let my lips begin the journey from her chest to her pussy.  Since she had so much enjoyed me being in control up to this point I decided to keep her feeling that way.  As my lips made their way down I withdrew my fingers from inside her.   I reached up and grasped her wrists and held them down.  There she lay on her bed, her legs spread wide and my head in between them with her hands at her sides being held pinned down by my own.   He moans echoed in the tiny chamber that she called a room as her pussy oozed forth more wetness.   Becky’s hips started to buck uncontrollably to show that she was undoubtedly close to orgasm.  Her moans now changed to words: “Please”, ”don’t”, and “stop”, were the only sounds she could push out of her lungs before the moans overtook them once again.  Suddenly she seized up - all her muscles tightened and held tense – before finally releasing and leaving her in a heap where she lay struggling to bring conscious thought to words.

It was now my turn. I flipped over her sexy, sweaty body and mounted her from above.  I let the tip of my cock penetrate her and she eagerly tried to envelope the rest of it in the sheath of her pussy.  In this moment I was content to tease her so as the more she tried to push into me the more I would withdraw.  I finally relented when she turned around and said, “Please, can I just have some of that big cock?”  I quickly changed my approach and thrust my self deep inside her.  With her being extraordinarily wet I was able to plunge my way in and out of her with ease.  I spread her legs and took long and powerful strokes in and out of her pushing in until the limits of her body stopped me then pulling all the way out.   My hand, once placed underneath her to fondle her breasts had now made its way in front of her.  With each deep thrust that I lay into her Becky maneuvered her neck within my grip.  By the time I realized what she wanted my hand was now securely anchored around her neck.  Now in the position that she desired she whispered out, “Squeeze hard.”  Never the one to disappoint I tightened my grip on her throat and intensified my thrusts.  Both of us now sweat soaked, I found my own orgasm begging to explode forth.   Nature started to take over and I my thrusting sped up.  I couldn’t stop at this point even if I wanted to.   I told her I was close and her only response was, “Squeeze hard, don’t stop.”  I did as she asked while fulfilling my own primal urge to cum.  Soon I felt it erupt from deep within me.  I buried my cock over and over as deep as I could into her pussy.  The sensation of that orgasm was nothing short of spectacular as her pussy gripped as hard as it could onto my cock.

I’ll admit it took me a minute to pry myself off of her.  Buried deep inside I let myself bask in the afterglow of our sex.  The two of us sweaty and proud lay still for a minute still wrapped in each other, my hand still gripped loosely around her neck.  After a minute I pulled myself to my feet.  I peeled the used condom off of my cock and tossed it in the trash and looked down at her.  Becky still laid prone in the same position – head down looking to the side, ass slightly upward producing small spasms just as she lay.  An undeniable smile sat beautifully on her face matched with eyes that still stared at my shrinking cock with desire.  I grabbed her towel (or her roommates’ I never bothered to ask) off the door and wiped the sweat off my body.  Tossing it to her I grabbed my pants and put them back on.  Once dressed I walked back over to her and gave her a firm smack on her still red ass. I smiled, said “thanks” and strolled out the door.

It was now 11:00 am, what else was I going to do today?

1h8rnt,5,2013-06-28,Help with PRTG + SNMP?,Rain-dogs,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1h8rnt/help_with_prtg_snmp/,"Hi guys. I'm an intern (so I don't know that much-- yet!) and I'm trying to set up PRTG to monitor a test environment (2 laptops hooked up to a catalyst 3560 switch which is hooked up to a router). I've configured two VLANs, both have their own DHCP scope. 

What I would like to do is monitor the bandwidth/traffic on each VLAN. When I go to devices in PRTG and click on the VLAN (its IP address is listed under the devices) and try to add an SNMP sensor to it I get the following error: https://www.dropbox.com/s/heivgixttjq938b/prtgsnmp.png (note; I've disabled my firewall and there is no firewall configured on the network)


When I try to run SNMP Tester it gives me SNMP error 2007. 

Now the problem is that I don't really know how to configure SNMP correctly on the switch. I've looked up some tutorials, but I'm doing something wrong because I'm still getting the same errors. 

Can anyone help me figure this out? I'm a rookie and kind of having a hard time with this."

1h8kld,5,2013-06-28,"Hey guys, I'm almost 18 and just having a really hard time growing up",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1h8kld/hey_guys_im_almost_18_and_just_having_a_really/,"I'm just gonna kinda rant. 

Ever since junior year of high school, I've had a hard time mentally. I don't know what it is. I always looked up to my older brother, loved him, and thought that we would live in mommy and daddy's house forever and we would be kids forever. He went to college last August in New Orleans, and we are from California. At first, when he left, it didn't really hit me. I thought the change was weird but cool in a way. So I enjoyed the rest of my summer with friends, worked at batting cages (which I loved). I loved meeting people and helping out kids/parents. It was awesome. My boss was my baseball coach who I've know for years and he's one of the best people I'll ever know in life. Anyways, Around November was when I started missing my brother, he came back for thanksgiving, and it was awesome. At the time, I thought that everything was okay, he will visit and be back for summer and it will all be fun again. I wouldn't consider myself ""depressed"" at this time. Although, it was very rough times. About mid January, a solid 2-3 weeks after he left from Christmas break I realized something. I realized that he's off in college, becoming his own person, and all that... But what bothered me the most was the thought of reality. Reality hit me in the fucking face. I realized that he's in college, he's looking for internships and jobs, then He will move out in 3-4 years, and then have a family and whatnot, and then I will do the same. I felt my emotions for the first time. I lied in my room and cried for a good amount of time. One night when I was out with friends, the same vivid emotion came back to me, really hard too. When I came home, I said ""dad can we talk for a little?"" And he said yes. So we talked and I explained how I felt. Like I'm scared over the fact of growing up basically. And how death will come one day, and all we are doing as humans are working our asses off, polluting the environment, and be stressed at the same time. I hit a deep level in our conversation and we kind of connected on a spiritual level. Both of us crying. After that night it was just like a struggle. I felt like I have struggled to find motivation in anything I do. I know that it will end one day. Weather it's a sport I'm doing, game I'm playing, relationship I'm in, and the thought of my life, it will all end one day. Nothing lasts forever. I don't even know what I'm saying makes sense, but I'm fucking lost. Really, I am. I feel like  in the middle of everyone. I feel depressed, but there's people way worse than I am who are actually diagnosed and what not, and there are people who aren't depressed, they're just sad and say they are. I party, but not alot, so I feel like I'm in the middle of the partiers and the people who don't party. Basically, I feel like I don't fit in anymore. I have 2 good friends, one is a best best friend, but doesn't goto my school and the other has a girlfriend so he's always with her. It's crazy too, because everyone used to love me, and I loved everyone, I was always happy, motivated, positive, and funny. But now it's the exact opposite. I'm going to be a senior next year, but seriously, my head is in other places, like work, college, a community college class I'm taking this summer, alot of other shit. 

Basically I lack motivation, seek negative, always tired (I get above 10 hours a night), and realize that I don't have any friends really. No one calls me, other than my two friends. I convince myself that I'm just having a rough time in high school, and that's all. But it's been well over a year of this feeling and I'm sick of it. I want to live again. 

It just doesn't make sense, my whole childhood, parents always said I'm happy, gifted, and will go far in life. I always had lots of friends, always looked at the positive (there was no negative to look at really), and I was so happy. Also, all the shit that goes and has gone on in the world bug me alot. 

Idk if I made sense. But if you guys think this is real depression, what should I do? And if you think it's high school/growing up hat should I do?"
1h8iwo,5,2013-06-28,I need some serious honest dating advice,[deleted],ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/1h8iwo/i_need_some_serious_honest_dating_advice/,"I first want to say that this subreddit is a God send. It seems like everyone I turn to for advice has some sugar coated version of why I'm single or why my dating life is... well... nonexistent. It also seems that I'm being pressured into having a dating life, even if that comes at the expense of finding someone I really like and with whom I feel comfortable. I honestly would rather be single and happy than in couple and lonely. However, lonely does not always feel the best. 
Secondly, why I am here is to see if someone can give me some advice as to what I am doing wrong in my approach to others. It seems I always find someway to mess up things when they could actually be something. 
For instance, recently, a boy who lived on my dorm floor invited my friends and I over to hang out before we went to a party. I don't usually like parties. (I've been told that I have my few people and to see me with other people without them is like watching a dog walk on its hind legs...) However, I had liked this guy since the first semester of college (I'm now a junior), he was single at the moment, and I felt that this would be the only time that I would be able to talk to him. My friends and I had gone to the movies before to celebrate three of our birthdays so we arrived later. When I got there, I was nervous, so I drank more than usual without noticing (mess up step 1). We were playing cards when he started flirting. At first, I thought it was with my friend (blond, thin, beautiful, great sense of humor). Then, he started talking to me and making direct eye contact while others weren't paying attention. I'm a skeptic of men and flirting (mess up step 2) so I assumed he had too much and was just being a drunk college guy. Then, he looked me straight in the eyes and said ""I love you"". Allow to stop for a moment to say any girl who has had a crush knows that this logically is not ""love"" but has imagined at some point the words being said maybe even to a point that they accept even tipsy admissions of them. I pretended to have a phone call from a friend we were meeting at the party later and in true female fashion, pulled my friend (the blond pretty one) into the hall to freak out. She said ""um, okay... great honey!"" and I took that as a ""that's not weird"" (mess up step 3). My friends left as did his and he wanted me to stay. I did. By this time, I had completely missed the party and had gone pretty far beyond tipsy (mess up 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). The moment the door closed behind his friend, he kissed me. I was drunkity drunk drunk drunk (not my usual drunk [I swore off alcohol for a while after that hang over...]). I kissed so bad. I don't want to sound like I'm a great kisser, but I usually know my way around someone's lips (when that extremely rare situation arises). Anyways, we talked for a while. He talked about his ex which is never, ever a good sign. He tried to talk about music and bands which I spend my free time submerging in their music and all I could reply was ""I love them"". He seemed disappointed by my lack of long term or serious relationships which he himself had rather recently ended, another major warning sign I didn't notice. At some point, I offered sex (mess up step 9 through 15) which might I add is *not* something I do. At all. Ever. (I lost my virginity through a drunken offer at 14 and haven't offered or have been that drunk until that night. One of my biggest regrets.) I also shared some deeply personal things because he shared some, but mine stemmed from some emotional looseness that was more intense than his (mess up step 16). Humorous things I said (I am so proud of these drunken statements. I hope the sarcasm gets across there): ""I hope I remember this in the morning"", ""I'm not sad! I happy! My eyes are sad because want to close now"", ""I'm Jewish, that's why (no idea... )"".Long story short, by the end of the night, he did not want my number or anything, though he wanted me to stay until 5. I really think he just wanted someone to talk to. However, it was that though and that misinterpreted reading of the signals that made me avoid, stage casual run-ins, and believe that there was something more for almost a month and a half. I spent finals week thinking about how I could ask him what I did wrong and drifting off from focusing on Chemistry finals and Biology finals. Instead of applying for summer internships, I asked my friends about him. Now I look back and think ""why was I this involved"". My friends say ""at least you didn't sleep with him"" (they may believe I'm a virgin by the utter lack of dating life).
At times, I've taken pride in my singledom. I mean, I can leave parties 20 minutes in if I like without needing permission or feeling like I ruined his night. I can stay all day in my pajamas reading classic literature and creating a playlist to incorporate at different points just to reread again the same night with the finished product (seriously guys, try it if you are feeling aversion to classic works). I don't have to have my motives questioned and have time to hang out with my friends when I want during my very limited free time (school + work= no time for fun time). And, my earlier dating history has turned me off from whirlwind romances forever. I honestly would rather be alone forever than in a relationship where its only wild ups and downs. 
However, one guy has made every interaction I have a calculated decision. I felt awkward to visit friends this summer on campus just because they share a suite. OR, even worse, because he would be on campus as well. I was angry, then bargained with fate for ""us"" to happen, then depressed because I was so caught up on him, and finally, I feel clear about this. I think I was projecting my earlier dating life hopes on to him to make up for the lack of one or the fulfilling dating life that I had when I was actively seeking out relationships. I raised my standards extremely to level which I felt I was more deserving of (no more immature, controlling, selfish jerks [there was just one actually]). Honestly, I just want someone who isn't going to throw me on an emotional roller coaster multiple times. I don't want to double think my actions in a relationship and feel that I deserve to have some amount of stability and trust. Though now, I feel that this experience made me think that my standards are too high and people are just unable of being understanding. Maybe, it is actually me being incapable of being understanding of people.
In all, I think my main question is, do you guys think I am so closed mined to what's out there that I create a self fulfilling prophesy of being single? Or does it sound like I want to actually stay single? "
1h8a63,2,2013-06-28,"Being unemployed sucks, especially when everyone else around you DOESN'T GET IT.",cookofthesea,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h8a63/being_unemployed_sucks_especially_when_everyone/,"As the title states, I'm having trouble with people in general because I've been unemployed for so long. I graduated college in 3 years, (4 years ago) and in my last semester of college, I had an awesome internship that paid really well, and they had stated right before I graduated that they wanted to bring me on full time. Turns out, two weeks after graduation, the company went under. No worries, since I was still working at my retail job that was okay for the time being. 

Being a media major, I did occasional freelance video work here and there, but nothing consistent. Then the retail store that I worked at, decided they wanted to weed out all of the original staff members so they could hire new ones and pay them less. They did this by giving me only 3 hours a week, hoping I'd just quit on my own. I ended up filing for unemployment since it was a severe enough schedule cut, and received $240 every other week. I looked for jobs, obviously, and did what I could. 

Two years ago, I got chosen to work for this company that I loved, it was hard work, but it was EXACTLY what I wanted to do with my career, and I even looked into moving for that job since I had to spend weekends away, working 2 hours away from home-it was contract work, and I made $300/day (so $600 for the weekend, all gas, food, hotels comped). However, as great as the pay was for this company, since it was contract, there were a few weeks where I wasn't needed. They ended up expanding, and I somehow fell into the cracks. I contacted them every week asking if they needed me, and then kept contacting them once every few weeks-but, in working for them, Id id find them to be extremely unorganized, so I wasn't surprised. 

After having this dream job for about 2 months, and realizing I wasn't going to have it anymore, I still had some unemployment left, so I took it. Then I got a letter saying that under something Obama did, I was now eligible for ANOTHER extension. I figured, sure, why not, I'm still looking for jobs, I'd be stupid to not, because I had gotten an internship that turned out to be a scam, and just wasn't finding anything to get ahead, and here, was money basically being thrown at me. 

Retail out here hasn't even been hiring, and now my unemployment has run out for about a year now. My parents are so cool and let me live at home, rent free, and they are supportive, and know how rough it's been, and that the economy overall, just sucks. 

The issue is, it's starting to affect my relationships all around. My ex-boyfriend had issues with me not working, but I just don't think he really understood the troubles I had with the company going under, ect. He NEVER had to apply for a job, and worked the same job since he was a teenager, that was just handed to him. So, he never understood how rough it is, and how getting a job isn't as easy as it sounds. So, lots of fighting there. Even though that's obviously past me now, it's affecting everything else. 

My grandma came to visit the other week, and she asked, ""Are you working?"" and I said ""no."" She gave me the DIRTIEST look I've ever seen her give ANYONE. She then proceeded to grill me about why I don't have a job...and because it was my grandma, I'm not going to tell her to eff off. 

Then, I called my aunt to thank her for a birthday card she sent me, and she asked, ""How old are you now?"" and I said, ""25,"" and she says, ""Oh. Wow. Well, time to start doing something..."" Because she's my aunt, I'm not going to tell her to eff off. 

I've even gone as much as to delay a freaking dentist appointment, for over a YEAR now because anytime I go, they always ask if I'm in school and I say no, I graduated college 4 years ago and the response is, ""Oh! So what are you doing now?!"" And when tell them nothing, it's just this whole thing. 

I also don't like going out in groups because, I get more of the same, ""oh, what do you do?"" I hated going out with people with my ex-boyfriend, for this reason, which, was another thing that kind of caused fights. 

I'm just upset because people don't get how rough it is. I majored in television production, so people automatically in their minds say ""Oh, well don't you need to move to LA?"" Sure, but you still need MONEY to even move. It's also extremely competitive to even get enough experience to apply for such jobs. And then people have the misconception that it's so easy to ""just"" get a television production job. I get a lot of, ""Oh, well, if you're passionate about something then just DO it, follow your dreams, stop at nothing!"" 

I hate that. I hate it when people say that stuff to me. While following your dreams is nice, I want to be independent. I want to move out of my house, I want to get married someday-none of this will happen by following my dreams, because guess what, I've already TRIED that, and I'm still nowhere. I need to be realistic and make some money doing something else. 

This is why I am switching gears and am taking a test to be a substitute teacher, because it's flexible enough, to where if I did still want to search for a media job, then I could. But, I won't know if I pass the test until end of July. If I fail, I have to retake it, and the next test date is in September, past the dates I can apply to school districts. I'll still be unemployed for another stretch. But, if I like teaching, I might as well go get my credential, but that's more time down the road, so again, it'll still be awhile before everyone gets off my back about not having a job. 

It hurts having to avoid people and situations. It hurts being pissed off by people that you otherwise love, but make you feel like complete shit. It's not that I'm not trying, I AM and I HAVE been, I've just had really shitty luck. I had three interviews with promising jobs, in the last 2 or so weeks, and got NONE of them. These weren't even jobs in my major, they were sales positions and assistant positions, where I thought my experience in retail would be good. I just wish people would get it, that it's not as easy as they think! 

**TL;DR** Been unemployed for awhile now, people either judge me for not being employed, or they think it's super duper easy, and it's making me want to just not go out and do things or see people because I'm tired of talking about my working status, or lack thereof. "

Price can probably be flexible, but around $1,000 per person seems feasible.

**What this house won't be:**
 A ""startup house"" with shared bunkbed-containing rooms and nightly/weekly rates. If we can find a big enough place, I think it would be cool to keep one room open for shorter-term stays (interns, research fellows, etc.) but in general I'm hoping to find people who are willing to sign a year lease.

**What this house would be:** 
There are some really nice 3-6 br houses available for rent in MV and the surrounding areas. I would love to start a community of diversity-friendly, smart, geeky people. I lived in a house of the above description in the Boston area, and really miss it. If the idea of having your own private space in a nice home, yet also having friends with whom you can game, hack on Arduino projects, and hang out and make bad Star Trek puns sounds appealing to you, we might get along.

**Wait, what did you say about diversity?**
 If you were writing an ad looking for your own ideal roommate, would you include any caveats about ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or related factors? I can completely, 100% understand that-- I totally get why some people might feel comfortable living only with those of the same sex, or people of their same religion, etc. However, that's not my goal for this house. I want it to be a place that is legitimately cool for people from all descriptions of any of the above categories. 

**Shut up and take my money!**
 Looking at the overall prices of houses, we could absolutely do this for around $1,000 per person. However, since these are houses and not apartments, I think it makes the most sense to split things unevenly. For example, whomever gets the master suite w/bathroom would pay significantly more than people who have a smaller bedroom and shared bath. If someone would like the garage all to themselves, they can pay more and have that. Maybe we'll find a house with a room that lends itself well to being a hardware workspace, and whomever wants to partake of that can pay a bit extra, or whatever. I am certain we could work things out for people who are on a bit of a budget. Personally I am willing to pay up to $2k if necessary.

**Pets?** 
I have a small and awesome dog. If you have a dog-friendly dog, then great! I am unfortunately allergic to cats, so I'd personally prefer a catless household.

**Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess.**
 I'm looking for roommates who don't smoke (not even outside) and don't use drugs at all, including pot. I completely respect the rights of others to do those things, but it's not something I'm OK with in my living space/roommates. Please, please be honest about this fact with me/us/yourself. 

**I can't believe this username wasn't taken already!** 
I know, right?

Does the above sound appealing to you? If so, please send me a message or reply to this post!"
1hc1r1,14,2013-06-29,The Canada Story,Phlecks,IrrelevantStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/IrrelevantStories/comments/1hc1r1/the_canada_story/,"I have many many drunken tales from college, but this one is easily my best (worst?), but also probably one of the longer ones.

Last summer I had an internship with a company that allowed a significant amount of travel. Each project we were on were dealt with from start to finish, from design to installation, so naturally, we would spend a number of months on-site tuning up the machines for production. I was just an intern, but my supervisor allowed me to travel with my team, among them two guys who were very warm to the idea of tearing up the nightlife on the weekends. 

Ryan was just a couple years older then I was at the time and we had very similar personalities. Both pretty hipstery, quirky guys who really just wanted to have fun with our nights. John, however, a few years older than Ryan, was focused on getting with a girl. If he didn't end the night shacking some floozy, then it was a failure, and he would not be a happy camper. Despite our varying objectives, however, we were still good friends and enjoyed our romps around the town.

Enter Chelsea.

Chelsea was a waitress at the steakhouse we chose one Thursday night. She recognized us, as she also worked part time at the hotel where we stayed doing breakfast buffet work. After a few minutes of casual chatting, she invited us to go out with 3 or 4 of her friends the following Saturday. She gave us her phone number, address, and even said she'd be willing to pick us up if we didn't feel like driving. 

Fuck, Canadians are nice.

Saturday comes along and John comes down to the hotel lobby with a box of tall, high gravity beers for the three of us to pre-game with as we wait for Chelsea to pick us up. I'm no lightweight, but these were no light beers. We had one bottle each before Chelsea arrived. I hopped in her car, while John tosses the rest of the beer in his car with Ryan, a decision we made in case the night sucked and we needed an out.

When we arrive at the house, we're greeted by 3 stunning girls who were already cracking beers to start their night off. We start to play a few card (read: drinking) games and get to know each other, and after about 30 minutes one girl pulls out a fifth of root beer vodka from the back of a cabinet.

Root beer vodka.

The bottle is about 2/3 full, and we are encouraged to drink it, because the girl who owned it was more than ready to get it out of her house. Well, Ryan takes this as a challenge for some dumb reason, grabs the bottle, and in one go downs half of that bottle. 

Root beer vodka.

Fuck.

At this point, I was tipsy, and I was well aware that Ryan and I were similar in our habits, so in order to keep the world turning I snatched the bottle out of his hands and let the rest pour down my gullet. At this point the night starts getting a little fuzzy. Naturally, we decide that being in public is the next best course of action, so Ryan and I throw ourselves into John's car as we head downtown. Ryan is fucking with the radio and yelling shit out the window, I'm in the backseat sucking down another one of the beers from the beginning of the night, and everyone else in the world is living their lives at a proper pace so they live to see 80.

The moment we get to the bar, the girls all split off into different directions trying to see who they can talk to/what they can do. John, now seeing that all hope is lost, immediately turns around and leaves to go back to the hotel, as he and I are *supposed* to go into work again that Sunday morning. Ryan and I do not care. Ryan and I are drunk. 

Root beer vodka.

At one point I find myself talking to one of the girls when she points over my shoulder and asks ""Hey, isn't that your friend?""

I turn. Ryan is being escorted out by two bouncers. I turn back. ""Eh, he'll be all right.""

This is the last thing I remember.

I wake up on a surface that feels nothing like my hotel bed, looking at the sky when I could have sworn my room had ceilings just yesterday. I sit up and gather my bearings. To my left is a dumpster, and written on a door next to the building are the words ""Sunnyvale Daycare."" To my right is a wooden fence. On my shirt is a decent amount of blood. In my pocket are my keys, wallet, and no phone. Across the street is my phone. The time is 6:15am. 

Root beer fucking vodka.

I ask a poor innocent man watering his lawn where I am, and figure out I am a mile and a half from downtown, and two and a half miles from my hotel. During the walk back I'm wondering what my co-workers are going to say to me when I get back, if the police were called, etc. I get back to the hotel, open the elevator doors, only to see Ryan in last night's clothes.

""Hey man. Good morning. Um, quick question. **What the *fuck* happened last night?**""

Flashback. Tarantino. Fuck you. 

Ryan is escorted from the bar and is tossed onto the street, only to be helped by a group of young people headed to the bar next door. They invite him along. Ryan wakes up the next morning. Luckily for him, he was in a bed, and had a ceiling, but not his bed, and not his ceiling. He was way the fuck far away from anything. 

We sit down in the lobby wondering where the fuck our lives are going, when Chelsea walks up. Ryan and I are expecting the worst. What did we do? Did anyone cry? Did I whip my dick out? Fucking root beer vodka. 

Chelsea is all smiles, and apologizes for being a bit of a buzzkill last night, but her friends really enjoyed hanging out with us, and they'd love for us to do it again next weekend. 

I ended up gathering a few clues of what happened to me based on voicemails I left friends during my adventure, but fuck me, I was stupid wasted. 

**TL;DR, I got drunk and had a one night stand with children garbage**"

Mother Dearest 5'6/167cm 120lbs/54kg/8.5stone
Meat Loaf 6'3/191cm 505lbs/230kg/36stone

Meat loaf was a regular in the hospital due to his CUNDISHION. He was a fairly decent guy who flirted with the nurses and the doctors and most of the nurses flirted back just to make him feel better. Now Meat Loaf was single and had developed a huge crush on my mom. This story takes place right after she got married to my dad

""HEY BUTIFUL""

""Oh hey meatloaf, how's everything""

""same old! you need to get a bit of meat on ya bones, you look unhealthy""

[HFW](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/Node_Page/images/1310483866536.jpg)

My mom shrugged it off and continued doing her daily task on this elephant of a man and making sure he lived to see another day and fill his mouth again. 

His beady little eyes saw my mom's ring and he couldn't stand the fact that HOW DARE SHE LEAVE THIS MAN AND GO MARRY SOMEONE ELES, DOESN'T SHE KNOW BETTER?!

""YOU GOT MARRIED?!""

""Oh yeah! it was amazing, with iidank'sdad and he's...""

""A FAGGOT?""

""Excuse me?""

""YOU DONT NEED NO BOY, YOU NEED A MAN LIKE MUH, YOU CANNA DO THIS""

""I've been engaged for months, you knew I was, what's your problem?""

""MAH PROBLEM IS DAT YOU WANTED ALL DIS -touching his stomach- AND THEN GO OFF AND MARRY ANOTHER GUY? HOW DARE YOU WHORE?!"" 

whatintheworldisgoingonhere.doc

""Listen up, what happens in life is none of your business, I am your doctor and that's about it."" 

So my mom started to walk away and this beast of a man grabbed her arm, getting sweat and grease all over it

""what are you doing?! Leave me""

""NOT UNTIL YOU ADMIT YOU WANT ME! DONT LIE!""

""Leave my hand right now or I...""

""YOU WILL WHAT?! YOU BITCH! I DARE YOU!""

My mom yelled out for help and a nurse came in and to get his paw off my mom but her tiny self was no match for meatloaf

""Help!""

""YOU SKINNY BITCH, YOU NEED A MAN LIKE ME! LEAVE US ALONE! YOU'RE SCARING HER!""

A couple of interns and a security guard came in and got his hand off. My mom was furious and shaking in shock. Police were called and she pressed charged for assault against MeatLoaf and he was transferred to another hospital and was ordered to stay away from my mom at all times.

TL;DR Beast falls in love with a doctor and refuses to believe that she can marry someone that's less of a man than he is.

1hbuhf,0,2013-06-29,Shift Worker Seeking Advice,SuperRicktastic,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hbuhf/shift_worker_seeking_advice/,"Quick question...

I've been trying to work at this since about March, and I've had very little success. After completely falling off the wagon and *gaining* weight, I'm back down to 2.5 lbs under my starting weight.

... Woo-hoo?

Anyway, I want to really dig into this, but I've hit a new wall.

Night shifts.

I work in construction now for my internship, and I spend 5 days out of the week sleeping all day and working all night, usually averaging 10-12 hours a shift. Also, with being on a road in the middle of the night, guess what my only meal options are? That's right, fast food. I've tried  packing food but almost never get to eat it, usually we're on the road and the only place my lunch box fits is in the back of the truck, so if I want to eat, I've got to take whatever drive-through window we pull up to.

Also, I'm finding almost no time to work out. Because of the work schedule, despite my best efforts, I sleep most of the day on the weekends, meaning I can't go see my trainer like I want.

My question is this, to any fellow night-shift or shift workers... what do I do??? I'm at a loss here and I don't want to go back to school without some kind of progress.

**TL;DR - Night shifts screwing up attempts to get serious, advice?**"

* 27/Bachelor in business,marketing - mediocre grades (never really interested me)

* Started Master -&gt; dropped out because I hated the subject 

* Internship at a big media company the last 6 months and chances are good that I get a trainee-ship at a  start-up (marketing)

* I do not like marketing at all and I cannot see myself doing it for the rest of my life 

About the university:

* Last week I found out I could get accepted to computer science at a very good university (only this year because of loophole/politics)

* University is free where I live, I would only need to pay for appartment / cost of living / books

* Comp. Science always fascinated me and I  wanted to learn to code for quite some time (I am doing different online courses: coursera, udacity, codeacademy etc.)

* Had a look at the curriculum and it seems to be very hard as expected (I think with the right motivation/attitude I could make it)

Why am I struggling with the decision?

* I already am 27 and I would be 31 when finished (with no work-experience except internships)

* I mentioned it to my parents and they do not seem to be happy with the decision (we have a very good relationship and I don't want to jeopardize it)

* So far I have not worked besides internships and side-jobs

* If I decide to do it, it will be a huge respnsibility. I CANNOT drop out again or I would never find another job again.

Right now I am torn between going or not... 

I would have to sign up next week (next week I also will find out whether I will get the trainee-ship)

1hbq4z,0,2013-06-29,Reddit Please Take Care Of a Fellow FriEnt. This Prohibition on Marijuana Needs to End.,FindingFreedom,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1hbq4z/reddit_please_take_care_of_a_fellow_frient_this/,"A while ago I shared a story about the legal troubles I have faced. Much more has happened and I feel it's now time to share my entire story. I hope that in someway my story can help push the legalization of marijuana across this nation. 
So up front I will admit that I am a Stoner. A Stoner for those of you would don't know is a person or persons who huddle together indoors with the curtains closed partaking in the seriously criminal behavior of smoking marijuana. I ask that if you didn't read the above line with a heavy does of sarcasm please read it again with a healthy dose. But then read it again because its the truth in many states. 
In addition to being a Stoner I am also an Eagle Scout and very proud of that fact. I was very active in my school, community, and summer camp. I graduated high school and continued onto college where I was very active in my department. I was even employed by the college to work with many outside visiting guests. 
The sorry gets sad when I reached my junior year when I was suspended from college, my car was seized causing me to loose my job, and facing two felony charges all because I sold a plant. I say plant now instead of marijuana because we so often associated the word Marijuana with bad. But if you look at that sentence you can see how I feel about this situation. 
I could spit out all the facts and figures of why I believe marijuana should be legal but for me I feel that the fact we have to is ridiculous. Marijuana has been illegal only 1% of the time its been in use in human history. My ancestors, your ancestors had access to this plant and many other plants and substances that caused altered mindsets. Their cultures built pyramids, made great civilizations, believed in gods and spirits and monsters. So please tell me how, how any why in a ""Free Country"" I am restricted the natural right of putting whatever substance I choose into my own body. I am only allow to put what the government says is ok? No this is just plane wrong. 
I ramble and argue because in the past 8 months my life has been in crumbles and I have been forced to attended religious based courses or face jailtime despite the fact that I am an atheist. These religious based courses I refer to are the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Courses. Now before I go on I would like to say that I do believe these courses have there purpose however they should be purely voluntary. Throughout my time in these courses I have had to admit that I am addicted to marijuana, buy into a higher power, and believe that we as human need to face ""life on lifes terms."" Meaning we need to exist purely in this material world. That is where I have gotten into trouble.
Now I have been in these courses for the past eighth month because despite the District Attorney agreeing to a deal reducing my charges he never sent over the paperwork. Every month at least I would go to court to be told they don't have the paperwork court adjourned another month. I have been holding down a job living in my college town. Not able to leave the county unless i get permission. And the best part...having to turn down fantastic career and internship opportunities in my field that could have taken me all over the world. Last month I finally plead guilty to one count of criminal sale of marijuana and I have sentencing on July 30. I was given a promise of no jailtime however I now feel like I may have ruined that because ....well I am a Stoner. 
Throughout these eighth month I have continually been failing urine screens. I would go in and talk to my councilor. I would argue Marijuanas legality and the fact that the vast majority of America wants it legal. The sad part is that he would agree and tell me that I was one of the smartest people he's ever had come through and the only one to ever really question it. I would promise to be good they would change the classes I was in (boy were some of them great) and give me another chance. Sad part is I just last week failed my ""last chance"" urine screen. (Opps) So now I'm expecting that when I tell my pre-trail probation officer she will have a warrant issued for my arrest and this peaceful, never harmed anyone, stoner will get to explore the inner workings of a prison. (ooo we should do an AMA before and after) 
So now I got about a week before my PO finds out and I'm screwed. I hope this story can shed some light on why this legalization movement needs to happen soon. As an American and as A Human Being I am being denied my rights and the ability to pursue my dreams because I use and sold a plant.

I have to go to work but I will be home by 1 AM and can respond to any questions or clarifications as I said I'm a stoner so Edit grammer and stuff whatever.

Did the networking help land a job/internship? I assume you have to be very active and search for jobs.

Is it possible to land an internship summer of freshman year? 

Also, what kind of jobs do most CS undergrads at USC usually go into (startups or big companies like Apple, Google, IBM)? I understand that this question varies for different people, but I'm just a little concerned that USC's CS reputation is still on the rise, but hasn't quite gotten to a powerhouse level in the industry (correct me if I'm wrong). 

I turned down the University of Illinois (UIUC) which has a reputed CS program to come to USC and some people have been giving me some flack, so I'm just feeling a little paranoid. Any advice/stories would help me out!"
1hbai9,17,2013-06-29,What kinds of experiences have you had as an INFP job seeker? Are there any INFP teachers/former teachers out there?,yolo_ipso_facto,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1hbai9/what_kinds_of_experiences_have_you_had_as_an_infp/,"I am 25 years old--I just finished my first year as a high school English teacher and I want out! I feel like an inauthentic asshole every day because I have to ""teach to the test"" and I feel emotionally exhausted all the time. I am a decent teacher and my students and coworkers like me, but I just can't do it anymore.  

I have been on several interviews for non-teaching jobs in the past 4 months, but nothing has come of it. Part of the problem is that I have a masters of teaching, which seems to disqualify me for every other job in this type of economy. In each of my past three interviews, I have been asked, ""Now, *why* would you want to *leave teaching*?"" in the most antagonistic manner and I didn't have any idea how to respond! In one interview, an interviewer commented snidely, ""Wow, you have had a lot of *different* work experiences."" How do y'all deal with interviews? I am at the point where I don't get nervous anymore, but I have a hard time dealing with these two issues in particular when looking for jobs. It also seems like I get interviewed by a lot of SJs.  


Prior to this, like many INFPs, I held an odd assortment of of part-time jobs throughout high school and college. I've never been fired or anything like that--I just seem to get bored and move on, or the position gets cut. I have been working since I was 15, but I've never had a full time position. The job that gave me the most satisfaction was working as an intern at my college's art gallery, but jobs like that are pretty hard to come by these days.  


Are there any INFP teachers or former teachers out there who could give me guidance? I don't know what I want to do as a career and I feel like I never will. I also feel like I will never get a decent job unless I straight-up lie about my work experiences/degrees.  


In general, how have you INFPs fared in job searching and do you have any pointers?  


**TL;DR** - I an INFP first-year teacher and desperately want to find another job. Can you offer any advice or describe your travails as a job-seeker?"
1hb50s,1,2013-06-29,"[F21], Him[21M] - Never had a mutual breakup, not really sure how to handle one after 1.5 years together...",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hb50s/f21_him21m_never_had_a_mutual_breakup_not_really/,"Our breakup was completely mutual and massively overdue. 6 months ago we broke up for one day because we were having problems (stupid fights, incompatible schedules, distance, problems with friend circles, etc.) During that day I cried for the entire 12 hours we were broken up, panicked at the thought of not being with him and we immediately got back together. Obviously, this was a death sentence. We were happy for maybe a month and then the same problems kept coming back.

The problem was that it was both of our first serious relationships and we didn't know how and when to let go of the comfort and regularity of being with the same person. He had never actually loved a girl before me and so felt that it was worth holding onto despite the trouble. For my part, we were best friends for 4 years before dating and I was terrified of losing that.

Well, a month ago he tells me he applied to an internship that takes him out of the country for 4 months. He needed to apply to internships due to his program and I understood that despite being peeved he had applied to one so far away without telling me. He said he would never get it, not to worry, etc. etc. Well, he gets the internship. It then forces us to think about the future of our relationship and we agree we were both unhappy and it was time to end it. 

So here's my problem. Despite being unhappy the past six months dating him and despite both of us knowing we needed this, I've never had a mutual break up and I'm not sure how to handle it. It's only been a few days and I know that this time we are not getting back together and that however shitty I feel it still feels better than the weird vibes we had trying to make a failing relationship work. 

But our group of friends is pretty much the same group. And it's not that seeing him will hurt, I just don't know how I'm supposed to be. And of course I will miss him despite everything - he was my first, he was my best friend before that, and even though we were incompatible, he is an amazing person. Our relationship didn't fail because we didn't try hard enough, we wanted so bad to make it work. 

The first night I messaged him and told him this was harder than I expected. Now I realize this is a mistake. I want to be his friend but I am now thinking I need to cut all contact with him. Maybe we can talk in two months when he's gone on his internship but for now I need to learn to stop going to talk to him every time I feel uncertain about something. I need to lose him as the metaphorical safety cushion...

I just don't know how. I feel drawn to him for comfort and reassurance and it feels so contradictory to ignore him when our breakup was so mutual. In previous breakups, it was easy to cut them out and move on because they had broken my heart or I had ended things and they had handled it poorly.

I guess I'm hoping anyone who has gone through a similar situation has managed to read through this novel and can offer some sage advice. 

**tl;dr: Boyfriend and I were having lots of troubles, he got an internship far away for one semester, we decide it's for the better if we end it now (2 months before he leaves). Breakup was extremely mutual and I'm unsure how to act around him - my gut says cut all contact, but the weaker side of me still wants us to be friends and wants to keep talking to him. Advice?**"
1havdr,3,2013-06-29,I just want to get out,ColTime,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1havdr/i_just_want_to_get_out/,"These past couple months have been rough on my family and me. I'm currently living at home going to a local university while my siblings are at out of state colleges which are considerably more expensive. My parents are slowly working themselves to death trying to pay for multiple kids. Since i stay at home, i hear about our financial problems every day. 

I have very little friends, despite my efforts at being outgoing and friendly i can never seem to connect to anyone. Even with my family, i feel like i can't even go to them with my issues. I constantly have this overbearing thought that everyone is judging me. In public places i constantly wish i was home, back in the safety of my room. 

This leads to another problem that i have realized recently, that i have spent a majority of my life in this room. Even when i am hundreds of miles away, it seems like it drags me back. I have to spend multiple hours a day on my computer doing some work for my internship. I also study in my room, which results in countless hours spent slowly dying in this place. But even when i get away, i long for my home, my sanctuary. I love and loathe this place.

I long for something different, something far from this place, but i also scares me. I have a huge stress problem which seems to amplify my depression. This is currently my 5th breakdown this past 2 weeks, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down. I get stressed at mediocre things, which leads to me stressing about the future. These are fucking ridiculous  things to get stressed about, but what's going to happen when i have real problems. The thought of this scares me the most, everything i have done to this point has been in preparation for this next stage in my life. I can't do it alone, but i'm scared to ask for help and i'm scared that people may not accept what i want in life. I've constantly done what others expect of me, pushed into a lifestyle i don't enjoy. My dreams are ridiculed and judged.

I don't feel comfortable with talking to anyone about my issue, i would either get the ""wanting attention"" speech or i just fear of how people would think of me. I have 1 more year left of school and just want to get out. I hate this place and i just want to get out."
1hap2m,0,2013-06-29,FNM results?,Shakraka,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1hap2m/fnm_results/,"So how did you guys do at FNM today? I didn't see a post about how everyone did, and well, I really want to share my experience with drafting MMA for the first (and probably last) time. 

A little backstory: I first started playing Magic in December of last year during school. I really got into it all throughout my second semester, but when it was time to come back home, I couldn't really find a LGS nearby and with a 9-5:30 internship, I found that I really couldn't put much time into Magic as I used to. I decided that, as a Magic player, I should draft MMA while I still had the opportunity, so I found a great little Game Store about 20 minutes from home and work and managed to squeeze the MMA draft for the FNM today (well technically yesterday). So after we get seated, we crack open the packs and cracked a Keiga, the Tide Star. Not the best dragon, but fuck it I'll take it. After picking up Keiga, I really wanted to play blue so I could use him, so I started snatching cheap faeries including Latchkey Faerie, Spellstutter Sprite, Pestermite, and a Mothdust Changeling that really helped playing the Latchkeys for their prowl cost. I was getting a little bit worried since I was looking heavily mono-blue, but I saw a lot of Lava Spikes and other Arcane and Splice cards being passed around. I saw my chance after I picked up an Electrolyze and a Glacial Ray, and managed to pick up 2 Dampen Thoughts and a Torrent of Stone. Picking up some Lava Spikes and Reach Through Mists, among other Arcane spells, I managed to build a very smooth U/R Fliers and Arcane deck. I also cracked a Bob on P3P1! 

With this deck, I managed to get 2nd place going 3-1, and had an incredible match 3 in game 4. I was up against a very well-drafted U/W Artifacts/Affinity deck, and match 1 I was able to play 3 Lava Spikes and 1 or 2 Reach Through Mists, while Splicing Glacial Ray on each one of them, burning him in a rather handy match 1. Match 2, I kept a 4 lander with Keiga, but not much else, a very poor decision on not mulling on my part. He raced me faster than I could stabilize, and he won match 2 just as handily. Match 3 was a *fantastic* game and it made me so glad even though I lost. I took the play and lead with a very strong Turn 1 Mothdust Changeling (seriously that card did WORK whenever I managed to play him turn 1). He responds with a T1 Arcbound Worker. I manage to ping him with the Changeling and casted my Latchkey Faerie for its prowl cost. After playing 2 Arcbound Stingers, he played a Frogmite and started the beatdown. I had a Lava Spike, a Glacial Ray, and 2 Dampen Thoughts in hand, but I was waiting for a red source, which I finally got turn 4-ish.  After pushing out a Riftwing Cloudskate, I started acclimating some mana and had to deal with his insane board pressure. He Thirst for Knowledge'd twice, and that's when I realized I couldn't beat him by taking his life down to 0--I had to Dampen Thought Splice like crazy to mill him down. I play Glacial Ray and splice Dampen Thought twice, bringing him down to a library count of **7.** With only my Dampen Thoughts in Hand, I thought to myself, ""I've got him, I can Dampen Thought and Splice Dampen Thought no.2 to deck him out, I've WON"" but I shouldn't have counted my chickens before they hatched. He draws a **VERY** important card, swings for 12 bringing me down to 3 life with no blockers on my side of the field. This was the last turn. Untap, upkeep, draw, PRAYING for an Arcane spell. Instead I got a Stutterspell Sprite with no faeries (or anything really) on board. ""Oh well, I can still deck him out this turn,"" I thought. I play Dampen Thought, tap 2 Islands and Splice Dampen Thought no.2. The very important card he topdecked? A motherfuckin' LOGIC KNOT that delved for like 30-something. I look with despair as I realize how close I had gotten and how cruel that Stutterspell Sprite draw was, and extend the handshake. What a great game. Man I wish MMA wasn't on such a limited run--I wish I had more time to draft it again before it runs out.

If you're interested in what I drafted, here is a tapped out link: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/deck-from-paste-29-06-13-1/"
1haj8i,1,2013-06-28,Just need to share,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1haj8i/just_need_to_share/,"Hey, I've never been on this subreddit nor am I subscribed, but I just wanted to share how I feel because I don't have anywhere or anyone I want to share anything with because I feel uncomfortable or like I'd be judged.
The past year I guess, I've felt symptoms of depression but I have never claimed to be, partially because I have the impression of being ""labelled"" if I do, etc etc... 
I can see how I've changed through the past year, for the worse maybe. I'm still always a cheery and happy guy on the surface if I'm around friends, or people I like, but when I'm alone or around strangers who I have zero connection to, or people I dislike, then I'm very to myself, quiet, and sour. 

A few years back I've been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, so this has been really tough and life changing, because literally everything about my routine somehow revolves around it. And I've heard that type 1 diabetics are prone to depression. But I've always thought ""that would never be me"". 

This past year I realized that the college program I'm in, is leading to a career that I have zero desire or ambition to pursue, because the people in my class are very ""hardcore"" about it, and I don't see myself becoming who they aspire to be, nor do I share any interest with them currently, except for a few who I enjoy talking to, about things that are not school related. Because they're pretty cool! 
If anyone is interested, I just completed my 3rd year out of a 4 year program for a Bachelor degree in Creative Advertising. My only current goal is to complete this program so I can get that degree and continue on with school to get a masters or something. But the problem is that I need to do a paid internship to graduate, so I'm obviously dreading this. 

Switching gears a little bit, I've had 2 girlfriends now. So I'm not a guy who ""gets lots of girls"", so this makes me feel incredibly lonely and miserable when I'm single. My first relationship was a very good one, and lasted 2 years, but during it I have still felt my mood be very low occasionally, and miserable. 
Second relationship ended probably a month ago, and was only for about 6 months, and it was good. Got dumped out of the blue. 

For the past year or so, whenever I wait for my subway train, I imagine someone jumping. It's never me in my imagination, it's always from a third person perspective. So it could be me, but I have no desire to do such a thing. And whenever I'm on a bridge, I imagine what it would be like if someone jumped off. 

Lately, I've probably had alcohol every single day, only skipping a few days. It can range from just a single beer at some time in the day or evening, to drinking a whole bottle of wine and going to sleep drunk, or going on a long walk drunk. Sometimes I go to my bar, always alone though. Because I don't really have anyone to hang out with. 
I consider myself to have not very many friends, just 3, only one of which is a ""best friend"" who I would love to see at any time, and hang out anywhere with, or talk to anytime. 
The other 2 friends are more of a situational type of friendships, because one of them is someone I go to electronic music shows with all the time because we share the same music taste, and the other is someone who I go on photography outings and urban exploring with because we share these same interests. 

My best friend lives a town away and works a lot so I see him maybe once or twice every 2 weeks, and the other friends are situational as you can see, and I wouldn't call them up to just chill, I'd only wanna do these hobbies that we share. 

Recently, I went to my family doctor to talk a bit, so I got a bit off my chest about how I wake up not excited for my day, because I know it'll be uneventful and end boring, and the cycle repeats. I don't know what my goals/dreams are either. 


I know this post is TLDR, but I didn't wanna keep posting depressing tweets. "
1hafyr,6,2013-06-28,Goodbye Audiotica (App being discontinue in August),Zumicts,AudioticaWP,https://www.reddit.com/r/AudioticaWP/comments/1hafyr/goodbye_audiotica_app_being_discontinue_in_august/,"Hey, my fellow sexy ear time users!

Most of you know me as Danny, the guy behind Audiotica.  Before we continue along let me reveal my real name: Harold.  Danny was just a pseudonym when it comes to app development.  As Audiotica is entering a new level, just as Zumicts, I wanted to reveal my real name.  Now for the sad news.

Now in July Audiotica is going to be 10 months old, 2 months away for its first birthday.  It has is up and down.  The worst being the first week of May when the servers went down for the whole week and the best when Zumicts introduced a WP8 edition allowing media library syncing.  Sadly, all good things have an end.  Audiotica will be discontinue in August or sooner.

""Why?!  Why will you take down such an amazing service?  Are you nuts?!""
Well, no, I'm not nuts.  the thing is... I want to kill Audiotica and reincarnate it!  It's not the end but a new beginning.  The problem with the current Audiotica is that it's core is based on one of my indie projects when I started to program around 2.5 years ago.  It was a very simple mp3 downloader named **musicDownload**.  When mango came out it was updated to **musicDownload 2**, that added background downloads and background audio player.

Here is a pic of Audiotica as a baby: **[PIC HERE](http://cdn.marketplaceimages.windowsphone.com/v8/images/ae94be1a-b477-4d79-b8df-97f8e888555b?imageType=ws_screenshot_large&amp;rotation=0)**
 
What happen to that app was that it got removed for copyright infringement.  Thank you, RIAA.  A year later while in a internship at Microsoft I found out that some employees knew about my app.  Long story short,  I got mad at how the app could have grown more.  I planned my revenge by updating it to something much better!  After a month of research, and a few weeks of tweaking with the source code of **musicDownload 2**, **musicDownload FS** was made (later rename to **MusicDwnld FS** and finally **Audiotica**).

Cool,  recycling is good (Y).  Wrong, specifically when the source code was from an amateur programmer with no experience (plus an app this cheap: **[PIC HERE](http://cdn.marketplaceimages.windowsphone.com/v8/images/928fd978-9015-45cd-ba6c-a1f1c7d442d4?imageType=ws_screenshot_large&amp;rotation=0)**).  This lead to many bugs you all love and hate in Audiotica and made it very limiting to update but the reason why I took that road was that I didn't expected Audiotica to be so big.

The brand new app, reincarnation, will be called Audiotica.FM just like the website (FM = Free Music).  It will feature a WHOLE new design (including logo), cloud integration, commenting and voting, messaging, recommendations, history, disable in-app library (straight to the Music+Video app) and more.  Something I can definitely promise is that you won't recognize it and you will fall in love with it.  This won't be an update but a new app in the Windows Phone Store.  For all Audiotica users there will be a last update adding a Sync+Download button for Audiotica.FM so you don't have to lose all your music.  This new platform will require user registration.  Audiotica will still be in the Store for those who want a more simple approach and don't mind the bugs but it won't be supported by Zumicts anymore.

Audiotica.FM will be release by August or sooner.  Beta will be publish in July to all users who requested to be beta testers for Zumicts.  There is still free space for more beta tester.  PM this account for more info.


* The website will be relaunch also for the release of Audiotica.FM in July, so you can start registering for an account and building your library ASAP.

Currently I have a temporary situation in Mission Hill in which I would move out on 8/31, so I am in dire need to look for a place to live come September.

**My lease obligations is only until the end of this year as I will be returning home in 2014**

If anyone knows someone who may be studying abroad for the fall semester and needs someone to fill out their spot please direct their attention towards me.

I'm very easy going and respectful of everyone's property and lifestyles. I want to have fun and go out while I'm living here but I also balance it out with staying in and just relaxing at home. I'm also a really good cook.

Not too picky on locations and hopefully trying to find a place ~$800/month

My name is Joseph and I am a graduate of the BFA film production program at the University of Central Florida. Utilizing a background in sales I have made it my goal to make the dreams of my colleagues and clients come true in the most literal way I know how – by helping to bring their films to life.
            
As a producer, I have created economical sales packages to entice the interest of local actors to participate as extras, with perks ranging from free professional modeling photos to free hair and cosmetic makeovers with to no additional cost to the production.  As an editor, I have experience in cutting together films, documentary styled shorts, and promotional trailers in addition to helping out other professionals with color correction, equalizing sound levels, and with the creation of soundscapes.    
              
I have directed films with as many as 70 people involved and have gained invaluable knowledge under “The Last of the Mohicans” prop master Vern Crofoot while serving as an intern on a professional film set.  At UCF I was trained by industry professionals such as Barry Sandler, Ula Stoeckl, and Jesse Wolfe in all manners of production.

I currently reside in Orlando, Florida.  However, both my girlfriend and I are looking to relocate.  

I believe I could of great service to your company and would love to have an opportunity to discuss with you any ideas for the position you may have available.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

1he0fu,16,2013-06-30,Making a printable p226 mag,Psychocide,SigSauer,https://www.reddit.com/r/SigSauer/comments/1he0fu/making_a_printable_p226_mag/,"So in my wonderful state of CT anything above 10 round mags have been banned. Which in turn means that I cannot have a 15 round mag with any amount of bullets in it anywhere except my house, at range, and in the car from my house to the range. I am also a mechanical engineering student, one without an internship that needs a project for the summer. So I decided I am going to attempt to make a 3D printable 10 round p226 mag. I am posting this here because I have a few considerations for people who know more about Sigs and firearms than I do. 

First is, am i breaching any copyrights with this?

Second, I was thinking of making this a single stack mag so that it can be printed out of plastic and the walls will remain durable and rigid. Do you think this will cause any feeding problems?

Third, does anyone know where I can get all of the dimensions on sig mags? the spring tension and/or spring coeff of the mag spring would be wonderful as well.

Fourth, has anyone attempted something similar in the past? If so did it work?
Finally, any thoughts on the process in general and anything i should watch out for?"
1hdpc9,6,2013-06-30,"How long will the Blade 14 last, and would it be suitable for college/business world use?",[deleted],razer,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1hdpc9/how_long_will_the_blade_14_last_and_would_it_be/,"I am very interested in the Blade 14 but am not sure if it makes the most sense for me. I think it looks very sleek and the portability plus the performance is fantastic. But, I am not a hardcore gamer. I play LoL often and that obviously doesn't need the power of the Blade 14. I could possibly get into more intensive games down the road but I'm not sure. 

My question is, do you think the Blade 14 would be suitable for college classes and business world? I am thinking it would be alright in college, I would probably get some looks and some ""ooh nice laptop"" from people. But, I am thinking it wouldn't really be acceptable in the business world? Say at a meeting or just at a function with other professionals. I ask because I am in business right now in college and will be looking for internships, meeting with companies, etc...and I am looking for a laptop to last me the next 4-5 years. What do you guys think about this?

Also, do you expect your Blade 14 to last you 4-5 years? Or will it probably be replaced in 2 years? 

I think the specs are much more than I need, but I would still be happy to purchase because of its form factor. It's just that I don't know if it makes the most sense for me because I may feel uneasy using it in the professional field (once I'm there), and also I'm unsure if it will last as long as I want it to (4-5 years). 

Thoughts?"
1hdot3,2,2013-06-30,[help] homesick. Long story.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hdot3/help_homesick_long_story/,"Background: I go to school about 5 hours away from home. In the beginning of last semester (spring of 2013), a man I was talking to, lets call him Tom, went away for basic training. The first night he was gone, I got news that my planned roommate, my very close friend with whom I had roomed the previous year, was not allowed to return because of suicidal thoughts. I had to deal with Tom being away by myself, but him being in training gave me motivation. Around Valentine's day, 6 weeks after he had left, I started to suspect that something was up with Tom. I called Ft. Benning, where he had said he was going for training, and they said they had nobody under his name. He lied about everything- he was never in training, and actually ran away an hour and change from where I was in school. I later found out that the school he had lied about attending school the previous semester (Fall of 2012). He lied about being in class, taking finals, etc. My roommate is gone during all of this and I am basically on my own. 

This summer I am doing a prestigous journalism internship. I started May 11 and am here until Aug 3, then back to school on Aug 20. However, after everything that happened last semester, I feel like I need to go home, stay home, and take some time to deal with what happened to me. I have grown increasingly homesick, especially since my internship doesn't really interest me (its a political journalism job). I need advice, please, and I can answer any clarifying questions about my story, etc. "

1hdgz7,14,2013-06-30,Making a checklist of all the things necessary for financial independence from the parents. Can someone more knowledgeable check/critique what I have so far?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1hdgz7/making_a_checklist_of_all_the_things_necessary/,"*Apologies if this has already been posted before; I tried a few different searches but couldn't really find what I was looking for.*

Basically I am a list-maniac and am making as complete a checklist as possible of all the things I need to do to be completely independent from my parents - financially, legally, etc. I need to get the money thing sorted out by August, as I will be responsible for all expenses come August 1st. During the first few weeks of August, I will be taking over total ownership of my car (currently in my dad's name and under his insurance) as well as cell phone.

A little bit more about my situation. I am currently a part-time summer student and will be full-time in the fall semester. My summer tuition is being covered by my parents, but I will be responsible for my tuition in the fall. I am currently in an unpaid internship, with that transitioning into a full-time position in 2-3 months (they like me but my actual skills are lacking a bit so this is basically training). Right now I'm working one part-time job, with a promising second, and possibly third, part-time job on the horizon. I know that I'll probably get some criticism for taking an unpaid internship but I am entirely serious when I say that this was my only option, as in I have not gotten a single other job offer and I've been searching for 3 months non-stop with an engineering degree. The job market apparently really sucks, and my parents don't actually believe that the job market sucks, which is why they're cutting off support in August despite my being more or less jobless. But for my own sanity and safety, it's better this way. I'd rather be broke as fuck (within reason) than deal with them anymore. Long story as to why.

I've figured out that if I am extra frugal this next month, between the last money my parents give me plus saving everything from my current job, I will have enough to cover my first month of expenses (including rough estimates for phone, car registration, and car insurance).

I do have student loans (about 12K right now, with an estimated 3-4K for the fall semester, if I don't save anything for school costs) but, since I'm not actually graduating until December, I fortunately have some leeway as far as those payments go. But by that time, I will have an actual full-time position and that won't be as much of a concern, I hope. At least not for the very near future.

I also have a credit card with a balance that I have paid off in full each month. I'm not doing that this month though, only paying the minimum, because I can deal with a month or two of interest as opposed to dealing with being really, really broke and bad off.

So to sum up my initial costs for the next month or so in a clearer list:

* Apartment move-in costs
* Apartment rent and utilities (monthly)
* Car registration (one time cost)
* Car insurance (monthly)
* Cell phone (monthly)

So anyway, I'm pretty open to any suggestions/comments (even if you say that I'm batshit crazy), as I'm going into this fairly clueless and would really appreciate some help from people who know more about what they're doing and what I can expect. Thanks!"
1hdbw5,1,2013-06-30,I [21/m] am out of town for a few months after spending almost every day with my gf [21/f] and can't shake some doubts. Am I crazy?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hdbw5/i_21m_am_out_of_town_for_a_few_months_after/,"We've been together for almost 10 months without any really huge issues.  We would see each other 4-5 times a week at least during uni, and we are 100% comfortable around each other.  But I had to move to another area for four months for an internship, and it's been a difficult adjustment suddenly not seeing her even just for short periods of time.  We do text and call a lot, though.


Here's the deal. She's had a history of lots of partying and drinking (she's toned it down a bit but still drinks once or twice a week). Even though I'm not big on alcohol, I was fine with that.  It's something that I accepted in order to be with her (and yeah yeah, not a great idea, but I started drinking much more too just to hang out with her, but that was a huge personal sacrifice that I was willing to make).  In my opinion, she's extremely attractive, so naturally, guys are always hitting on her whenever she goes out.  It took me awhile to get used to this, and I even opened up to her about how it made me uncomfortable, but something like that isn't her fault or her choice.  She assured me that she likes only me and there's reasons she chose me over everyone else.

That being said, there are some things that happened recently just don't sit right with me. They are as follows.



**Topic 1: Dancing with other guys** (partially resolved)

I know that this has been a hotly discussed topic here on R-A.  She's gone out and danced with other guys on a couple occasions during our relationship and I've told her how it makes me uncomfortable.  She said she only knows how to grind and it's something she sees as ""just having fun"" and has constantly told me that ""it doesn't mean anything"" and ""I don't let it go anywhere.""  **At first, I told her it was fine, do whatever you want, and I wanted to give her that freedom. But I think that was a mistake and thought about it more, and about a week later I told her that it makes me very uncomfortable when some random guy's dick rubs up on her ass.** I told her I preferred if she didn't. I thought I was being reasonable since this seems like a small thing to ask her not to do. Just dance with her friends or something. She had a lot of trouble hearing this, telling me that she didn't want to have to constantly worry about things like this when she goes out. Eventually she told me, ""If it makes you happy, I won't dance with other people."" Her tone was a little hard to comprehend, but I knew she meant it. **But I still think about it from time to time...am I unreasonable?**



**Topic 2: Random guys invites**

A few weeks ago, my gf was out at a bar (without me, but with some mutual friends of ours, one of which is a fairly good friend of mine, Dave, who has a girlfriend himself).  Some random older guy at the bar named Travis met both Dave and my gf and they exchanged contact information.  I'm not sure how it was disclosed to him, but Travis found out that she was dating me and immediately apologized and said to her that he was not intending at all to get in between me and her. But they text every so often.


He's apparently been inviting her to numerous parties and such that he sets up, and she accepted one of them, which was out on a boat that he owned.  She was honest and told me that she would be going out on Travis' boat for a party.  For obvious reasons, this didn't feel right to me. She's known the guy for a few weeks, tops, but she never really says no to these kinds of things.  I talked about it to her afterwards and told her how I felt, asked her ""isn't that a little weird that he invites you to these things, it makes me uncomfortable, etc."" but she told me that Travis has also been inviting Dave, he just couldn't make it to the boat thing.  Travis and Dave have been hanging out too every so often, so my gf assured me that Travis doesn't mean anything and that he just wants to make friends because he thinks Dave and my gf are cool people.  I posed it from my point of view asking ""Well, if I were invited to go out on some random girl's boat to drink and hang out with her friends, and you don't know her, or anyone else, wouldn't that bother you?"" To which she replied ""Only if she was just inviting you, yeah, I would see why that's a bit off."" **She's right at that point, but it bothers me. I talked to some friends and they told me I was in the right to worry, but after her explanation of how Dave was also invited, I feel like she is in the right. But I'm struggling. Any advice?** 

I told her that I wasn't going to say that she can't hang out with guys, that's ridiculous. But it bothers me. It really does. I feel like I was pushing the 'controlling bf' character when I told her it made me uncomfortable when she grinds with people. And I feel even more controlling with this issue. Help please! We both really don't know how to make this situation better for ourselves. Was I right to worry about her going out?


**TL;DR: Away for an internship for awhile. GF of about ~10 months sees boundaries differently than I do.**  "
1hd0tj,0,2013-06-30,[SPOILERS] Season 8 of Dexter is gonna play out like this (MY FAN THEORY),the_backtracer,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1hd0tj/spoilers_season_8_of_dexter_is_gonna_play_out/,"*NOTE: I haven't really read or seen anything about Season 8 other than a couple of the trailers/teaser clips (the ones of Dex/Deb's faces). These are just my completely (un)educated guesses based on watching seasons 1 &amp; 2 over the course of a week one summer and then watching each episode week-to-week since then, skimming the wikipedia articles on some of the books during this period of time, and also just what I would like to see happen.*

Old Lady Serial Killer Brain Analyst (they will actually refer to her by the title 'Serial Killer Brain Analyst' or 'S.K.B.A.' (pronounced 'Skeeba')) was studying Doakes' brain when she discovered it didn't have whatever anomaly serial killer brains happen to have. She couldn't accept the evidence as a flaw in her brain theory, so she calls up Miami Metro and asks to embed w/the Homicide Department to gather some first-hand accounts (if they let a Videogame Maker Guy intern there then certainly a Serial Killer Brain Analyst can get in no problem). She gathers pretty quickly that they had determined the Bay Harbor Butcher had to be someone in Miami Metro Homicide, but the only ones who saw signs pointing to Dex were Doakes (dead) Lundy(? i don't really remember but he's dead too so it doesn't matter) Laguerta (dead) Deb (who transferred back to vice &amp; is undercover / throwing her life away on drugs, sex, alcohol, etc cleans up every once in awhile to report in but is p much unavailable to talk to Skeeba) and Matthews (who's now doing some digging of his own, or more likely, completely oblivious), so she decides to brain scan everyone in the department, and Morgan is pretty far down the list. Dexter piddles around keeping an eye on her for at least the first half of the season, all the while they're playing mind games back and forth in passing. Dex finds himself fucking up major on his kills and even commits one or two out of pure rage, before finally freaking out on Skeeba when he can't avoid getting his brain scanned any longer.

Dex had been tracking Deb with a bug he planted on her in the first episode and hadn't seen her since, so just before he flees he goes to her. He finds her strung out on heroin in a drug den on a mattress on the floor with no sheets. Dex pleads that she comes with him, but Deb refuses, and blames everything that has happened on him. He apologizes to her and she tells him to just go away before passing out so he leaves an Eiffel Tower keychain on her nightstand, grabs his bug out bag (Harrison isn't coming with because he's been living with Astor, Cody, &amp; Grandma &amp; Grandpa, no kids in the way this season finally) and this time he actually makes it out of the country (Paris (Rita and Dex move to Paris and became art dealers or some shit in one of the books I think)). But there's one thing Dex didn't account for in his escape plan: if Doakes' brain didn't have the serial killer anomaly, what did Skeeba do with it??

Sgt. James Doakes was obviously a phenomenal law enforcement officer, in addition to having some pretty serious secret forces military experience, making his brain a perfect candidate for a top-secret Robocop government experiment (don't believe me? Why don't you check out Stan Liddy from season 5 on imdb :) ever hear of a little thing called 'foreshadowing?') The first thing RoboDoakes says when he comes online is 'Morgan' and when he gets his strength up he unleashes some serious Hell, trashing the lab and breaking free. The first thing he does is seek out his co-worker, friend, and confidant - Maria LaGuerta. when he discovers she was murdered in a shipping container and sees on the news that Dexter is a wanted man, he quickly deduces what had happened and puts his detective skills to work to find Deb. When Robodoakes does find Deb, she thinks he is a hallucination and confesses everything that had happened. 

Rather than murder Deb for revenge, he convinces her through her drug haze that the only possibility for redemption is to turn herself in to the police. She agrees with him, and before he goes he asks if she had seen or heard from Dexter of if she has any idea where he might have gone. She says he had come to ask her to run away with him, but she didn't know where he had gone. Robodoakes says that's fine, and he forgives her for what she did, sets her at ease, but grabs the Eiffel Tower keychain off the desk as he leaves. Robodoakes calls in a favor with one of his old special ops buddies, they shrug off the reports of his death/crimes with a laugh while glaring at the keychain between his fingertips. They both know how the government can be. They meet up in the parking garage beneath the airport and together they head for Paris on a private jet. 

Only a week or so has passed by the time Robodoakes gets a line on Dexter, but Dex has already settled in to his new routine in Paris. Robodoakes shadows Dexter one morning, following him from his apartment to a cafe. Dex grabs a cup of espresso and a croissant (no doughnuts in France) and sits out on the patio, lights a cigarette, and pulls up the Miami Herald on his iPhone 5. He sees Deb has turned herself in and has confessed to everything, he says some stuff in his head about how bad he should feel but he doesn't and maybe he never really has, puts out his cig, stands up, turns around, only to find himself face-to-face with Robodoakes. Surprise Motherfucker!

There's some kind of shitty chase/fighting scene that Dexter has always been bad at, it ends with Robodoakes injecting Dex and knocking him out, or maybe it ends on top of the Eiffel Tower and Dex tries to jump off and suicide, but Robodoakes like gets under him in midair and breaks his fall and they both survive, the point is Robodoakes has the opportunity to kill Dexter but chooses not to, driving home the point that there's a right and wrong when it comes to prosecution in the criminal justice system. Robodoakes takes Dexter in on his own back to Miami, and when they land the feds are on the runway waiting for both of them. Robodoakes basically says 'my bad fellas, I had some unfinished business to take care of from another life' and goes with them, Dex gets hauled off to jail.

The last episode is basically the trial, thank god they confine it to one episode because holy shit can you imagine those people writing a trial. At the end of the trial, Dexter explains to the jury the trauma he had suffered as a very young child, how he witnessed his mother get hacked up by gangsters with a chainsaw in a shipping container down by the docks, how his brother saw the same thing and grew up to be the Ice Truck Killer, how Harry had given him 'The Code,' how instead of murdering innocent girls he murdered the most horrible criminals that had slipped through the cracks of the legal system. Dex is sentenced by the judge to death by lethal injection, there's a close-up of dexter's horrified face and his inner-monologue just goes 'shit.' There's that little Dexter 'ding' from the intro and then the song from the intro plays as he's walked through the jailhouse, down death row, and then locked in his cell. The door slams and it cuts to black. Season nine motherfuckers!

Just kidding, that's how the next to last episode plays out. The last episode is Dexter's last day on Earth, he's just contemplating shit in jail, everyone he worked with just getting over the shock of finding out who Dexter really is. This sort of thing actually makes up a good portion of both the last episode &amp; the trial episode before it, how he ended up affecting everyone he personally knew and they would all have been better off not knowing him at all. His last words before his execution are just him saying that he's sorry to all of those people that he knew for hurting them like this, and it sounds kind of half hearted and unsure but that's how you know it's one of the few genuine things Dexter has ever said. He's always been most uncomfortable revealing himself and his actual intentions to the world, so this act of sincerity kind of brings him peace. He gets laid out on a table for his lethal injection even though that's not how they do lethal injections, and ghost dad cuts his cheek and takes his sample as he gets the injection and then it fades to red.

---

Notes:

* I didn't really mention ghost dad because he's really never had anything to do with the plot besides giving Dexter 'The Code,' but don't worry he'll be there every step of the way. Only he'll be constantly apologizing to Dex because the major theme of this season will be repentance and they're really going to beat you over the head with it in obvious ways so fucking brace yourself.

* Harrison is a high school senior by the end of the last episode, they'll speak for the first time ever just before Dexter's execution. Harrison despises everything his father has become and plans on following in his Aunt's footsteps (as far as his career is concerned at least).

* Deb ends up getting out of jail by the time Dex is executed for her confession and cooperation. She ends up hanging herself in a crappy little beach apartment with her brother's execution being broadcast on television in the background.

* Quinn tries to extract Deb from the gang she's embedded with undercover, thinking she's in too deep. She ends up killing him and realizes she's just completely broken.

* Batista feels like he failed Dexter, Deborah, and Maria for what happened, but ultimately moves on ok. He actually might end up getting back with his wife and his little girl.

* Masuka thinks everything Dexter did was 'sweet,' is impressed that he never had a clue, and says 'I hated that bitch' and does his little laugh re: LaGuerta getting murdered.

* Matthews ends up being forced into early retirement for all of this happening right under his nose, gets a fattie pension plan on the taxpayers of Miami County's dime.

* This season will have the least amount of kills for Dexter (3).

* Hannah is Dexter's last kill, he kills her in Paris.

* There's no Big Bad distracting MMH or Skeeba, this season all eyes are on Dexter it's really gonna heat things up.

* Erik King might even get asked by Showtime to do a Robodoakes spin-off, it'd be pure action."
1hcoie,3,2013-06-30,Just looking to bounce my concerns off of you guys [Help] [Rant],Discobiscuts,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hcoie/just_looking_to_bounce_my_concerns_off_of_you/,"Hey guys. I'm a 19 year old dude who self-diagnosed himself with some sort of anxiety disorder, and I just want to bounce the way I feel (it actually helps when dealing with it) and see what you guys make of it. The reason I can't see anyone yet is because A) my work schedule takes up a lot of time B) I';m 2,000 away from home working in a new city for the summer (an internship) and C) I go to a university that provides these sorts of services for free.

Before I start, some personal details. I'm currently entering my second year of university ( a top 5 Canadian university) in an Arts program. I'm interning at a think-tank for the summer. I come from a rural area in Canada and am adjusting to Central Canadians (for you Muricans think really politically correct, 'mannered' people from the cities. Compare a rural american to their city counterparts and its the same.


I'm confident, know I'm intelligent, know I'm lucky, I'm funny, charming, witty, don't have any social anxiety what soever, I'm good with people. Which is why these seemingly random anxiety problems exist.

The first time I ever had a panic attack was smoking weed. I was a big stoner for  6 months and I took a one month break because I had to do a lot of readings for high school. The weekend I had a chance to smoke again I did, and I had a panic attack. I felt a burning in the back of my head, my heart was racing, I thought I was dying.  It was a straight up panic attack.

After this I've smoked some weed and was fine, but more and more often I was having panic attacks after smoking. I think this led up to where I psyched myself into a panic attack. I completely stopped smoking. This was over a year ago. Then this year, I would periodically smoke when drunk or whatever and not have panic attacks, other times I would. I think this is worth pointing out because you guys may wanna know about it.

Now, the panic attacks for no reason and anxiety issues started when I started dating this girl, lets call her Jill. I was treated badly (not too badly, just kind of neglected emotionally). There would be times where she was extremely loving and compassionate, and others where she wouldn't know what she would want, and it would break my heart. There would be days where she'd ignore me all day so she could 'decide' whether or not she wanted to be with me. I always thought it was a sick game where I had to do 'the right thing' to keep her. She broke up with me a total of 3 times, and the third time was the last. 

When she was out with other dudes I'd be really worked out, when she was out period I'd be worked up over what's going to happen etc. When she wouldn't talk to me I'd be anxious about what she was thinking. This is hard to explain without the background between me and her and our friends, but anyway.... everytime she said seriously 'we need to talk;' my mind would start running down what she wanted, whats going to happen etc. We broke up this past March, and although I'm mostly over her, whenever I think about her I get headaches, nauseous and feel sick. 

This also extends beyond my ex. when my parents text or call me I always ask 'what they want', is there a reason they are calling me, am I in 'trouble' did something bad happen etc. In high school, I had problems with a teacher who took me to court for essentially no reason. Although the court ended up throwing it out and she was reprimanded by the school board, I always think about how shit can bite me in the ass. Whenever my mum calls I think somebody else is trying to do something to me.

When I think about being knocked out (for a root canal or falling asleep) I get anxious about losing control of my body. It seems that my anxiety may be about control. IT fits with the girlfriend stuff, not knowing what my parents want, and the physical nature stuff. It also fits into my hypochondriac tendencies; where I think every pain is cause for some fatal disease.

Reflecting on what I'm typing makes me think more and more this anxiety may be some sort of control anxiety. 

I also get random panic attacks at work for no reason. I think I'm scared of failing, because there is always a worry in the back of my head about not making it, running out of luck, having my contacts (which is important in the Arts) being cut off etc. I know that this is irrational too because I got a prestigious internship out of first year where I'm already connected to important people in what I want to do.

I've wanted to post about this for the past little while now, but when I'm not experiencing a bout of anxiety its actually hard to explain. Hell, it may not be anxiety problems it could be some legit medical problem.

Also, is it true that anxiety can manifest into physical symptoms like pain,nausea headaches etc?

Any advice you guys can give me is so appreciated. Comforting words from a stranger can mean a lot more than some people realize. Hell, even if you guys come here and say ""ya you got control anxiety disorder, go to a shrink and get some meds, you aren't dying of some fatal disease, its anxiety manifesting physically"" it would do a world of wonders for me.

I should also point out a lot of my reasoning and rationale here is guessing. A few (2) months ago, I thought this may just be random anxiety just from fucked up chemistry in my brain. I told my friend's mom about it and she told me to go tell a doctor and take meds; if I'm anxious for no reason its a chemical problem.

Anyway, if you guys want more info just ask for it, any help you can give me is much appreciated. Sorry for the rant.
