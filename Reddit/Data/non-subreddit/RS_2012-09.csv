z7dlz,12,2012-09-01,Effects of Sleep and Stress on Weight Gain/Loss,redtouchyellow,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/z7dlz/effects_of_sleep_and_stress_on_weight_gainloss/,"I have been trying to lose weight, primarily by counting calories, eating healthier foods and following C25K (will begin week 6 soon!).  We went to a biking event today and I noticed how horrible i look in the full body pictures.  

So, although I have been trying to lose weight it does not look like it.  I recently started my last year of grad school, began a new internship and started a new job working night shift in the dorms leading to a lack of sleep until I get used to falling asleep sooner.

My question is, how much does stress (not the eating effects like overeating) and lack of sleep effect weight loss?  This is definitely something I will read some articles about soon, but in the mean time, what are your thoughts?"
z7a1n,190,2012-09-01,"Detroit, you didn't live up to my expectations.",beachesatnormandy,Detroit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/z7a1n/detroit_you_didnt_live_up_to_my_expectations/,"This summer, I was given the opportunity to intern in Detroit. Being from Florida, I knew nothing about the city. I heard from everyone that it was dangerous and vile. Every time I mentioned I would be spending my summer there I was told to ""have fun, bring a gun"". I tried not to build these expectations in my head, and to just go to Detroit with an open mind, but it was inevitable. 

I arrived on a really gloomy Michigan day, not only was the city entirely empty as it was the weekend but the sun did not come out for a full 2 days. It was looking like Detroit was going to meet all these expectations I tried not to set. But after spending 3 months exploring, submersing and involving myself in downtown/surrounding areas and their culture I was blown away. The history, the beautiful stories the buildings tell, the intriguing people you meet, the establishments that have just popped up in midtown to the restaurants that have been on Michigan Ave for decades. I did not even know what to do with all of it. 

No one had told me about these things, just that I shouldn't drive a foreign car and I should never speak to anyone. 

Detroit is thriving in a way people don't understand. But I am absolutely thankful that I had the chance to experience it first hand. 

Detroit did not meet my expectations, because it wasn't disgusting nor did I ever feel in danger. I was not afraid to walk around on my own, or talk to random people. I saw abandoned buildings/houses but they taught me about the past. 

Detroit is everything I wasn't expecting. It taught me about myself and about others. It showed me that simple ideas can be manifested into endeavors. It taught me to never give it. It also taught me that Northerners can't make good chicken and waffles, but damn the rest of the food y'all make is delicious. It showed me some of the most stunning architecture I have ever been privileged to witness.

That being said, I'd like to thank everyone in the area for being so welcoming and cordial. I can't wait to return next summer. 

Edit: I lived in downtown Detroit for the 3 months I spent there. I plan on returning for another 3 months next summer to live in the same place. "

Self-taught background in web design, but currently feeling like I'm a bit in over my head. I have a few general questions about getting started.",riorio88,PHP,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/z6x35/hopeful_php_newb_here_new_gig_abroad_is_requiring/,"Background: I'm an informal multimedia intern at a high-end resort in Costa Rica. Once the owner learned I dabbled in web design, he immediately started throwing work at me with cash incentives. He wants me to copy-edit / redesign an app his web-designers created for birdwatching on the property — the did it all in Symfony.

I've been meaning to branch out from HTML/CSS and thought learning PHP would be a breeze ... that being said, I can't even seem to get off the ground.

I use my new macbook for everything work-related as it's better than the computers they have here on site. I managed to [set up](http://macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2001/12/07/apache.html) my Apache server (easy) but can't seem to figure out how to download / install [Symfony], [let alone PHP](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.bundled.php).

I guess my questions are:

* HOW CAN I PREP MY MAC FOR WORKING IN PHP?
* WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SYMFONY?

I've been reading the directions online, but I think I need them explained in slightly less *jargony* terms. If anyone has the time to hold my hand and help me get off the ground, it'd mean a lot. 

Please and thanks!"

I've floated between internships, part-time jobs, and freelance work to keep myself afloat. During this time, I've taught myself iOS coding and have been involved in updating a few apps for startups. In college, I majored in Economics. I have an innate ability to sell and explain complex ideas in a simply way. I am a creative thinker and relish a challenge. I'm usually the one sleeping in the office to get a project done.

I love the DC Tech scene and really want to be apart of it. I also am passionate about politics and wouldn't mind acquiring a government job or one with a contractor. I have been trying like crazy to make it, but I'm running out of money and reaching the end of the line.

I am a great catch to the Big 4 (great GPA, in a lot of organizations, great personality, etc) so I have no doubt I will get an internship to Audit or Tax. I'm also a Information Technology/ Finance major so that is something that sets me apart. But anyway I would love to hear how you like working in Advising and what kind of projects you work on. If you work for the Big 4 that is definitely a plus.  Thanks for your insight. "

z8hf8,1,2012-09-02,[25M/22F] Possible future or waste of my time?,butthurtexbf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/z8hf8/25m22f_possible_future_or_waste_of_my_time/,"Throwaway here. Me[25/m] I apologize this is gonna be a long one but i really need some advice. I graduated from college a few years ago and during that time I had a ,for the most part, awesome relationship with a girl i have known for almost ten years. We had an instant connection when we met as young teens, and when we wound up going to the same college together things blossomed in ways i have never experienced with another person. We dated for about 2 years, we had our issues like every other couple, but for the most part things where good.I worked at one of the few popular bars in town and oftentimes would grab a drink with coworkers after work. At the end of my senior year i drunkenly went to a co-workers house (who is a known lesbian and i had no intentions with her) to try to sober up a bit as she lived right nextdoor to the bar. Honestly the details are vague but i ended up hooking up with her that night, that much i remember. After realizing what i had done, I couldnt come to terms with it, was afraid to tell her, and decided to break up with her without ever mentioning what happened, and basically used our impending separation after grad. and me wanting to find myself as an excuse. 

Fast forward a year, im living in our hometown, she has a semester to go and doing an internship somewhere else in the state. We run into eachother randomly during this summer, agree to meetup later on, sparks flew old feelings were dug up, and all i wanted was her. Weeks pass and i see the direction things are going and she is reciprocating those feelings but i knew i could never be with her again unless i came clean. I confessed what happened, of course she was hurt, I gave her a little bit of space but things didnt change drastically or so i thought. Our birthdays pass we get each other gifts, i actually invited her around my family for mine, a few i love you's where exchanged over the course of a few months. 

I let her stay at my place while i was away on vacation, by the time i come home she has returned to her internship.My laptop battery is shitty and takes less than an hour to die. When i plug it in and turn it on her fb is logged in and i see a message from a guy i noticed earlier that has been blowing her up lately on fb. Turns out hes a guy she had hooked up with during the year we were not together and she has been flirting with him, and saw that he had asked her if he liked the pic he sent her etc. , this was a few days prior to my bday and weeks after hers. Im hurt i ask her about it she says its just flirting, she likes the attention, we arent together right now, etc. 

So i was cool with it, tried to not let it get in the way of what I thought we where building, even though we def had a few arguments about the guy. Even though we established we werent going to commit to one another it still hurt to know i wasnt the only guy she was talking to. He lives in our old college town in which she has one semester left. So my thinking is as soon as she goes there its gonna be on with the two of them. She insists its not like that, and spends every night with me in the 5 days leading up to her going back. I notice she is being standoffish her last day or so in town, something was up for sure. so i  check her phone to night before she leaves while she is asleep in my bed and see she has been sexting this guy all day and planning to hookup with him the following night. So i wake her up, ask her what her deal is, and basically ask her to leave without telling her i saw the messages. Not knowing ive seen the messages she goes on this rant about how im assuming too much, and making her out to be a bad guy, and that it's not like that with him. As she is leaving  i throw a few things i read in her face, letting her know i saw it all. She was shocked disgusted angry, we have a text argument the next day and now we arent speaking. 

I guess you could say she got her revenge, im not sure if there was a definite motive there. And because of my previous infidelity i guess i am not allowed to feel any certain way about it. I know i broke her heart when we broke up before, and after the fiasco this summer with me being a nosey asshole she said she doesnt know if she can trust me again. I dont blame her, but it is all i can think about. I love her so much and have always seen her in my future. We havent spoken in weeks. My question is, Do you all think too much has transpired and i should move on? I really do love her, and i want to fix it, im leaving her alone to give her some space, but i honestly have hopes for the future as foolish as that may or may not sound.

I started ""eating healthier"" around the end of April. I'm guessing I was 310+ at that point. After poking around /r/loseit, I found a link to /r/keto and decided to give that a try (start date: May 2). I went home from college about a week into May, finally got my scale on May 11 and officially weighed in at 301.6. Today's weigh-in: 251.2!

I don't really go out of my way to exercise, mainly because I'm too lazy and am still nervous about being the fat guy at the gym :P

I do, however, walk quite a bit (since I'm on a college campus) and I had an internship over the summer where I was on my feet for a large part of the day and consistently registered around 10k steps a day (according to my fitbit). 

For my diet, I stick mainly keto, though I don't limit myself from a dessert or drink here or there and try to stick to around 1500-1600 kcal a day. I've been averaging about .44 lbs/day lost, so I think it's working for me :)

She had been pursuing her degree, and she was enrolled in an internship course. She was excellent on the internship, but the teacher would not pass her in this course because of 15 minute power point. She needed this class to get her degree, and could not afford to retake it because she had given up her job and used all of her savings to drive to the internship.
In efforts to fix the situation, my friend made one last attempt to reach out to the professor before going to the dean of the school. She sent an eloquent email stating the problems she had, and telling the teacher that if she did not pass her in this course, she felt like she had wasted that last few years of her life and all over a 15 minute power point presentation that had no expectations made by the teacher, only to show pictures and talk about what she had learned. 
Many other students have come forward and said they have had very similar problems with this professor.

The teacher wrote back with an email ranting that my friend was being immature, and had in fact been wasting the last two years of her life.

We believe it was at this moment my friend had felt as if all of her dreams had been ripped away from her, she was home alone, and had a access to a weapon. It was shortly after this email we believe she committed suicide. 

My friend was 20 years old. "
z7lkx,4,2012-09-01,Feel really empty in new situations,alecbenzer,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/z7lkx/feel_really_empty_in_new_situations/,"Short history:

1. Be a bit depressed throughout high school
2. Go to college, things get worse (though in slightly different ways)
3. Start taking Prozac after a not-so-great first semester
4. Second semester much better

So after my second semester, I started working at as an intern. The job was ostensibly really awesome, and it was working for a cool company that I've always wanted to end up working for, but despite all of this, I felt sort of empty and sad at work a lot. I'd find myself almost on the verge of tears on my way home, and I was sometimes even borderline suicidal, not because anything was really all that wrong, but because I just didn't find much to enjoy.

After a while, though, things got better. I started to feel like I belonged more and the job, got a bit closer to some of the people, and began enjoying my work more. By the end, it was really fun, and in fact in the few weeks before I left the internship, I probably felt better about my general situation than I had for a long, long time. That being said, I was still looking forward to being back at school.

Then, I went back to school, and I feel like I'm feeling the same kinds of things I was at the beginning of my internship. Even though I'm around friends and taking classes I enjoy for the most part, I still feel that same kind of emptiness, and it's bothersome.

Does anyone else feel like this at times? What do you do to feel better?

I've smoked out of Bongs, Vaps, joints, Pipes ect. Just about anything you can think of. By far the best way to smoke weed is out of a hookah. I've done side by side comparisons with my extream Q vape and my weedsha and the weedsha wins hands down. I get higher and the high lasts longer and the flavor profile of the weed really comes through well too. Not Quite to the extent of as the vape but cloes. Also one bowl of weedsha will last for at least an hour.  It's just magic. Anyway, I made an album showing how to make it. Its dead simple just mix a little glycerin with your ground bud. pack it into a bowl and smoke it up. http://imgur.com/a/kHZVz
 in the album it was about a tablespoon of weed and a half teaspoon of glycerin. 

Also you can even smoke the leaves with this. So if you have alot of thoses grind them up add some glycerin and honey. Tates pretty good and you will get pretty toasty with them. 


Sorry about the grammer and spelling errors I wrote this while high. 
Your welcome internet ;)

P.S. This is my Hypothesis on how this works as well as it does. This isn't my field but I am a scientist (Computer Science and Physics). The glycerin has a boiling point of 290 °C all of the cannabinoids vaporize from 180c - 212c. Glycerin is a non-polar solvent and has been used as a replacement for ethanol for making of Botanical extracts. What I think is going on is that the THC CBN and CBD cannabinoids are dissolving into the solution of hot glycerin and part of that will intern get boiled off when you take a hookah rip.  The Glycerin may also be helping in keeping the cannabinoids from breaking down ""Burning"" when you smoke this might also account for why it works so well.

I believe before cheif destroyed installation 04, guilty spark duplicated himself and shot his duplicate into space (later to be found by the heretics in halo 2) and the original was damaged in his flee from the exploding ring. this means that in halo 3, cheif kills the duplicate, and the infinity picks up the original monitor. If the storm factions are trying to complete the covenants original goal of destroying humanity (before the sidetrack of the great journey/great schism), and seeking the didacts help, then perhaps we are their biggest threat and with us out of the way, they could possibly overthrow the didact, take control of the promethean army and become what they always wanted to be: the keepers of the mantle. Maybe guilty spark wants the force of the infinty to back up the cheif in making sure the didact is protected and with the storm faction defeated, the didact could resume his power and put humanity back in its place. without guilty spak in a monitor casing (residing only in the infinty infastructure) it will be up to cortana to eliminate his presence. this could intern temorarily heal cortana, for i believe halsey is not capable of doing so. there is also mention of surviving precursors, so if the didact lives through halo 4, his priority will be capturing the remaining precursors."
z9pfx,2,2012-09-03,Post break up troubles,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/z9pfx/post_break_up_troubles/,"My ex-bf [23m] broke up with me [23f] roughly 6 months ago.  He had moved across the country pre-break up, which obviously put a strain on the relationship, but also made the break up slightly easier for me.   Post break up we went through a long patch of not talking because I was traveling and he made little effort to respond to my emails.  When I returned we started talking a bit and eventually he tells me he's seeing someone.  Of course my heart drops a little bit because it hits home, but he's single, so I just tell him he's free to do what he likes.  A couple days later he tells me he broke up with this girl, implying it was because of me, and that the relationship wasn't serious anyway.  We start casually talking more and he begins to sound more and more like a completely different person.  He starts saying superficial things about women he meets, telling me about hot girls at bars and women he's having sex with.  Of course these things bother me, but I just deal with them cause I know he needs to get it out of his system, and hey, it's pretty normal post-break up.  All the while I hadn't been seeing or interested in any men, but when I do finally mention a friend I was interested in (roughly 4 months) he goes crazy.  He gets mad at me because this guy is my friend and says there's more emotional commitment than what he's been doing, which is purely physical.  Then he tells me that he feels like our relationship of 1.5 years meant nothing to me.  I still think this was really unfair of him to say.  I went on one or two dates with said friend, and nothing more. 



All of this culminates into an argument that ends in me essentially yelling at him via fb chat and him blocking me from fb and gchat.  So after a month of no talking, I try to add him on fb and he doesnt respond.  Almost a month after that I send him an email of an article I think he'd be interested in and just say that I hope he's doing well.  He responds, and we share a couple emails back and forth and then it ends.  Then he adds me back on fb.  Then a couple nights ago he ims me and we talk for 3 hours or so.  And it's a really nice conversation, but during the course of it, he asks me if I'm seeing anyone.  I just say no, I'm not, and I change the topic.  I'm not interested in hearing more about his exploits.  Later he goes back to the subject and I say that I went on a couple of dates, but I'm just not ready to be with anybody yet.  That I need some time to be single.  The truth is I'm not completely over my ex, and I don't want to burden other men with that.  Completely unsolicited he tells me about the women he's been seeing and the great sex he's been having.  Honestly this doesn't bother me much at first.  He tells me about this girl he was dating and how they broke up because he was cheating on her.  Then he tells me how he's done with his wild streak and is looking for a nice girl to settle down with.  And I think that's when it started to bother me.  I still remained diplomatic throughout the night, though I was super erked.  The next morning I did something I shouldn't have and I messaged him telling him I didn't ask about the women in his life because I didnt want to know.  And I apologized if it came off dickish sounding, but that was just how I felt.  Of course he didn't respond.  



Today I had something happen with my father and was anxious, worried, in tears, and alone.  I don't have a phone right now, otherwise I would've tried to text or call a friend, so I email him asking if he would talk to me for a bit cause I was feeling frazzled.  He responds right as my mom comes home, though I don't see his response.  I end up talking to my mom for an hour and feel better, but I respond to him anyway and tell him what happened and why I had wanted to talk.  He doesnt respond much and says he has to run to a friend's soon.  After I'm done explaining everything he says that he's hopes everything works out and that he's heading to his friends.  


I was literally in complete shock at this point.  Maybe I shouldn't have been, but I was.  Not even a ""sorry"" or a remote sense of empathy.  Then being fueled up I did another thing I shouldn't have: I said fine, fuck you too.  I can't believe I don't get an ounce of empathy from you.  

It was dumb and it probably satisfied him, but oh well it felt good in the moment.  


Anyway I'm trying to avoid communication, but I feel obligated to check up on him because of his depression and counseling, which few, if any, of his friends know about. I still love him, but I'm not trying to get back together.  We live thousands of miles away from each other and are at different places in our lives, but I still care about him and want to be able to talk casually once in a while.  I just can't understand why he's being so cold and aggressive towards me despite the fact that he's the one getting laid, getting dates, living on his own in a cool city with a super awesome and well paying job and his dream internship.  Honestly anyone looking at the two of us right now would say that he got the better deal.  I still live with my parents, work at a restaurant, and am trying to ""figure out"" the rest of my life.  Also, like I said, less than a hand full of dates and absolutely no hook ups post-break up.  So I can't understand why my ex is being so hostile, especially considering he's usually a very placid man.  Do I really have to completely cut off all contact with him permanently? And HOW do I do that. I think it's been extraordinarily difficult for me because our break up came at a very strange and critical point in my life.  My coworkers are all a bit older, and I'm not really into the part scene so it's difficult for me to meet new people (I made an Okcupid account but have met very very few people from there, and nothing lasting).   

baaagh, I hope this isn't completely stupid. I guess I just need some outside perspective.

zcm5u,2,2012-09-04,[22/m] A couple of girls have been driving me crazy over the last few years...,Shtuff_N_Such,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zcm5u/22m_a_couple_of_girls_have_been_driving_me_crazy/,"So here's the story... Bear with me, it's pretty long. TL;DR at the bottom.

In my last year of highschool, I started going out with the girl of my dreams. Short red hair, athletic frame, rabid curiosity, loves learning new things, ... on and on about all the things I love in a girl. She ended it as I was about to go to college and she had another year left. We had both said that we believed we were in love with one another, and I at the very least really truly meant it. 
 
A couple of months later, she was dating another guy. I felt betrayed by her and so I went about proving to myself that I could find a replacement for her. In about 2 months, I had something like 30 girl's phone numbers that I had never called (and later felt like a jerk for it) and yet felt no better about the situation. 

In October of that year, I met a pretty cool girl who I got along really well with. At this point, I just wanted to move on and so another relationship felt like a way to do that. Me and this new girl, henceforth known as October, started dating in January. We dated for a few months, but me coming ""out of the closet"", so to speak, as an atheist really hurt our relationship (as she was Catholic) and almost caused it to end at that moment.

That summer I did end it, because she is actually a very needy soul. (Wants boyfriend time, all the time) I wanted to spend time with my family and working, not four hours a day on a cellphone talking about some coworking being dumb and saying ""I wuv u"" back and forth. During the summer, I went on a mission trip with DreamGirl (who had become single) and her church. Aside from all the awkward Jesus Camp moments, it was a really awesome trip and I got really close to her again. After the trip, she would come over to my place and we would lay on the ground and talk as we pointed out cloud shapes. I was falling head over heels for her again and I knew it. Anyday, I was going to ask her back out. About that time, October called.

Her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and I was the only person she could talk to about it. Though I'm not the most empathetic soul, I tried to console her as her life was seemingly falling apart. I didn't know what to do. She was still after me, her mother was at stage four, and I just wanted DreamGirl. I thought I'd decide this when I got back to college.

Only that didn't happen. October comes over to my new apartment, and out of weakness I am seduced into kissing her. I fall right back into the same pit that I had clawed my way out of earlier in the year. DreamGirl falls away as I am trying to deal with October in a way that lets everyone win. Problem is, there isn't one. After a couple of months of badgering, crying, and begging to get back with me... I consent. DreamGirl falls away as I allow October to shut her out of my life and gets a new boyfriend. Even so, I occasionally text DreamGirl for hours at a time about anything and everything. October finds out, and bars me from talking to her. I do it anyways behind her back. 

A few months later, October's sister is diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer. She is distraught, sometimes says things about self-harm, but refuses to talk to a professional because ""I'm not crazy"". I turn 21. One night she stays over, we lose our virginity together. Puritanical upbringing of taking a girl's/losing one's own virginity creates cycle self-loathing/feelings of responsibility to her. Give October a promise ring out of those feelings, knowing it's a bad idea for both of us. DreamGirl is still with the guy she met last year.

Over the course of the next year. October refuses to have sex again because ""she is scared of a condom breaking"" (Catholic and doesn't use any form of birth control) and her family members with cancer have varied results with chemo. I am depressed, because my GPA dropped/lost my scholarships, I was stuck in a relationship I didn't want, and the girl I'm actually in love with is still with another guy, and I didn't see an end to any of it. 

Using my people skills, I land an awesome internship for that summer. A lot of verbal abuse, lack of appreciation, and differences in lifestyle leads me to break up with October. I finally explode on her about all the shit she's put me through and how I was sick of being treated that way. I resolved myself to staying away from her. I blocked her number from my phone. Would still get 20 calls a day for a couple of weeks. Worked my hours, lived life. Over the course of the summer, I wrote DreamGirl a long letter telling her how she was the girl who got away. She sends a response saying that she is sure that I will find a girl that will be able to fulfill all my needs like she couldn't. How can I tell her that she was, is, and will be more than I could ever want? 

October and I are heavily involved in the same orgainization. I'm the Treasurer, she's the President. Business necessitates us talking. She talks about how she's changed, how this summer was a eureka moment for her. Moments of self-awareness blah blah blah. The comfort of a woman's body and the promise of a changed soul draws me back into the arms of October, but my eyes still look and see my DreamGirl. I run into her on campus, we flirt, I want to think something is there. I don't know if there is for her, however. I want to tell her that I still love her, but ruining the fragile friendship we currently have would be almost too much for me to bear right now. Hope keeps me going. But at some point, hope must give way to reality. Only reality involves her boyfriend of almost two years...

Should I give up on them both?
Should I chase Dream Girl?
Should I trust October?

What's a guy to do in this sort of situation?


TL;DR: I'm a dumbass who let the girl of his dreams walk away on multiple different occasions and is constantly being sucked into a relationship with someone who probably is no good for me no matter how much I want/try to leave it. I don't know if I should just walk away from both of them, chase Dream Girl (who currently has a boyfriend), or trust that the girl who says that she has changed has, indeed, changed.

I moved away from new jersey to complete an internship in florida a few months ago. I have a long term (3 years) boyfriend [24] in NJ; we both decided that an open relationship would be the best for us while I was away for a year.

I started dating another guy [25] about a month after I moved here. I like being in a relationship more than just sleeping around. My boyfriend from home knew I started seeing this guy.

After about a month of dating this new guy, he turned into a stage 5 clinger. If I didn't answer his phone call, he would call me literally 10 more times, text me another 40 times, etc, and wouldn't stop until I called him back. If I texted him back, he would just blow up my phone until I called him. He was emotionally abusive with this, accusing me of cheating on him when I didn't answer, calling me a bitch, slut, whore etc, threatening to break up with me unless I called him.

I could put up with all of that. It was stressful, but I could just roll my eyes and forget about it. Now hes physically abusive. My long-term boyfriend doesn't know about the abuse, my roommates are starting to catch on.

I don't want to be in this relationship, but I'm terrified and I just don't know how to even go about getting out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. My long-term boyfriend and parents are coming to visit me in a month and I'm afraid what will happen if I'm still stuck in this relationship when they come.

Reddit, I ask for your help! I don't know anyone here other than my roommates, co-workers, and my abusive boyfriend. I have no one else to turn to. I do live in a gated apartment complex with security, so I do have some sort of safe-haven to turn to. But, I often find my boyfriend waiting for me outside my complex when I walk to the bus stop to go to work if I don't answer his calls.

That worries me, because I've been hearing that for most internships in ad agencies, an intern should go above and beyond what is expected of him or her and always make sure they have things to do. I really want to be kept busy and prove that I'm a hardworker, but I'm afraid that there just might not be a lot for me to do and I may end up a nuisance.

I guess my question is, how can I make the most out of this internship without becoming a burden? Should I volunteer to get coffees for everyone, clean up the break room, etc. when there's no copywriting stuff to be done? Or would that be too weird?"

The downsides to my situation are that I live at home with my grandma, I hit a rough patch bouncing between a few different jobs this past month so I don't have much money, I do not have any close friends that live near me, I have no girlfriend, there are no men in my family so I am constantly surrounded by women who hen peck me because I am the only guy, my Dad is super busy with two businesses so we rarely get time to hang out, my mom moved to 200 miles away when I was a kid.

So whenever I go out, and I try to meet a girl that is my age, I do not attract the attention that I want. The girls that I think could be interested in me are not, and it bums me out. It would be great to have the support of a significant other that is my age and has the same struggles. Unfortunately what seems to keep happening, is that I keep attracting older women, and not by choice. 

When I was younger and in college, I was enticed by the idea of a ""cougar"" but I am really not anymore, and I want to have a meaningful relationship. I had girlfriends in college, but now all I can seem to get is casual sex with cougars. Not all of them are great looking, or good in bed (many have this idea that these older women are awesome in bed and more experienced, hate to burst the bubble, but people are the same no matter what the age). 

I am working hard to get my money right and get my own place, but I feel like that is not really the problem. I feel like it is more the way I carry myself, I don't know why girls my age are not as into me, even when I go out and cold approach women, I feel like I am largely ignored. Maybe living with my grandma has aged my soul a little bit, and the hen pecking has hurt my confidence...maybe moving out will be better for me to get in touch with my young self again. 

 have been looking at other things like /r/confidence and /r/getmotivated which have helped, and I have been trying really hard to get it together.

I know this isn't the place to ask for advice, but this is a place for long rants....so I figured I could come here to get this off my chest.

I have received my placement for my internship and it is at an all black community center. When I went for my interview I asked if being white was a problem. The director said no, of course not.

Two days ago was my first day, and the director (who is a bit...eccentric) re-realized I was white, and had tattoos, and half my head shaved and piercings, which I had in my interview. He then looked at me and said my look is a big problem, and being white is going to bring me a lot of issues. Not just from the cliental but from staff as well, and it will be a miracle if they accept me. 

So, any advice? I am trying so hard to research a lot about black culture and really be able to integrate myself. My supervisor told me that my being there is ground breaking as I am the first white person ever on staff and especially one as ""alternative"" one as me. 
Any advice or general words of wisdom?

tl;dr white girl gets hired at all black community center, told she won't fit in. "
zf378,6,2012-09-05,Possible API patch: Batch GET command by_id?,MrFanzyPanz,redditdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/zf378/possible_api_patch_batch_get_command_by_id/,"Hello, Dev!

I'm an intern for CenSoC (The Center for the Study of Choice) at the University of Technology, Sydney. We are currently doing a project involving various structures that implement ""Follow the Leader"" type dynamics. We look to see if the choices that people make are dependent on the influence of ""leaders"" in their community, and try to analyze why this is/is not an attribute of the community.

We would like to do some simple data mining through the Reddit API, since Reddit is already effectually a simple choice experiment (upvotes/downvotes). We were planning on collecting content and user data to see how they influence each other, however, we hit a snag:

If we try to request user info one at a time, with a 2 second delay between each, the time taken to collect all of the data would be overdrawn. We have been considering restructuring the data mining approach, but we also wanted to know if a patch would be simple enough to allow GET requests by_id. Something of this nature:
    


in the file which implements GET username about API:    

    /r2/r2/controllers/listingcontroller.py, line ~679

to go from something like this:
    

    def GET_about(self, vuser):

        ...

        return Reddit(content = Wrapped(vuser)).render()

        ...

to something like the following, where the username(s) url portion is split using regex (much like in the 'by_id' api code):

    reddit.com/user/userA,userB,userC/about.json

... and then looped on the server-side appending to the returned http response without having to re-initiate the http request/response every time:

    def GET_about(self, usernames):

        ...    
        splitter = re.compile('[ ,]+')    
        return Reddit(content = [Wrapped(x) for x in in splitter.split(usernames)]).render()    
        ...
    

obviously, the correct Python-syntax and various variable-validation in reddit arch. will be necessary, but the logic of the above, albeit incorrect Python-syntax-wise, remains.

    

Would something like this be feasible? We currently don't have any team members who are well-versed in Python, and we also don't know how things look on Reddit's end.

Thanks, Reddit! :D"
zekxj,25,2012-09-05,Career Dilemma: I don't want to do Graphic Design anymore. What now?,abqcub,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/zekxj/career_dilemma_i_dont_want_to_do_graphic_design/,"So here’s my dilemma and a little background. I received my Associates Degree in Graphic Design (emphasis in print) in ‘09 and was on the track to pursuing Graphic Design as a career and eventually work my way up the ranks to Creative Director or something similar. I knew how to use the software and was usually at the top of my class in terms of design skill. I wanted to pursue my education further so I’m currently working on my Bachelors in Advertising and Studio Art (Double Major) to fill in the holes that my Associates left out. I had it set in stone that this was going to be my life, and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about it.

I’ve done the freelance thing, and also worked as an in-house Designer/Prepress for a local print shop, and now currently work as a Marketing Intern at the University. All this “real world” experience has taught me that I don’t think I’m cut out to be a designer, or rather it’s something I no longer wish to pursue because its taken a negative impact on my life.

This idea is mostly due to the fact that dealing with clients and my boss in regards to designing has left me feeling incredibly frustrated everyday. I know dealing with said people is part of the job and there’s no way to get around it, and that as designers we just suck it up and learn to deal with frustrating people while at the same time working on our communication skills to convince the client that as an experienced professional we know what's best and thats why we were hired. 

What's happened now is that all the creativity and inspiration has just been sucked out of me. Designing has become a chore, and I find myself blatantly ripping off others designs just to churn out work and get the project over with. There’s no more enthusiasm, no more sense of accomplishment, just an empty feeling that leaves me staring at a blank InDesign document.

So I graduate in December and I’ve come to the conclusion that what I enjoyed was the innovation, thinking outside the box, and fitting all the puzzle pieces together in a design. The more artistic part has just been something I don’t care to pursue anymore. 

Now the big question is what do I do with all this education and training? How can I transition from Graphic Designer to something else? How do I market these skills to take my career in a different direction? I ask you wonderful people of reddit if you have any experience or advice that could send me in a new direction. Any ideas for jobs or areas of interest that I can focus on? I know no job is perfect, and there's always going to be bad days and bad people to work with, but I think I can do a little better than the rut I’m in now. So please save the negativity and criticism I see so much on here, I’m really facing a daunting life change.


**tl;dr** - Spent six years wanting to be a Graphic Designer, but no longer feel the same. Now I don't know what I want to be when I grow up, and I graduate in four months and want to hit the ground running. What do I do with all my experience? 

***update*** -  I appreciate all the outpouring of support, I really do, but I would like to discuss more alternatives to a career in design. I know my employers suck and that it's not all like that, and that I just need to find inspiration to keep me going. I just don't feel like this is the right path for me, but I don't want to waste all the time and money I sank into school and jobs

***Update 02/07/2013***
*Apparently people are still finding this, so I'm posting my latest response to user clydefrogforever which I think wraps up this post:*

Wow, I'm surprised people are still finding and replying to this.

Thanks for all the support and kind words, but as you can probably see from the rest of the post I've made up my mind. Recent developments since this post have been that I did graduate and had to resign my position as the Marketing Intern since I'm no longer a student. I've spent 2 months job searching and living off savings. I applied for many positions, mostly marketing but a few design positions as well. The design positions were more light work, such as doing book layout and cover illustration, real easy stuff.

I received nothing besides ""we regret to inform you"" messages, had a grand total of three portfolio views, granted my portfolio was thrown together and doesn't have nearly enough examples which is completely my fault. There's no market in my area, and my state (New Mexico) is ranked among the highest for unemployment, and ranks lowest in new job creation. I've applied to jobs in other states but with no luck because I figure most are trying to hire local and quickly. I also have the added disadvantage of looking like some 21-22 yr old kid who just graduated, because I indeed did just graduate. What doesn't carry through is that I'm 27, which may not seem like a big deal but it can work in my advantage that I'm older and possibly have more experience than a typical recent grad, and indeed I do have more experience than most of my graduating class in the same fields.

**End of story now;** I ran out of savings to live off of and just need to pay bills, so yesterday I interviewed to be a Barista at Starbucks. I figure its pretty much a given job right now because my partner is a well respected employee at the hotel the Starbucks is licensed and housed in. The company is really big on promoting from within and so far just from the interviews I impressed everyone with my knowledge and drive for furthering my career. While this hotel does not have a marketing department due to budget constraints, I hope to work my way into the small amount of marketing they have and eventually move to another hotel that does have a better marketing department.

Is this what I had in mind when I set out to push myself in school? No, not at all. It took some time to realize that this may be the best way to start a career. Start out in the mail room if you catch that old saying. This economy and job market is awful. I had high and unrealistic expectations. My lack of desire to keep designing bled out into a desire to not want to do anything anymore and made my life and dreams crumble. I picked my ass up though and reprioritized what was important. In a few days I'll hopefully have a job, I have a partner who cares for me, friends who care for me, I realized I'm in the same situation as many of my peers and people with much more skill than me. I think if I just work hard, show people what I can do, open my mind to different possibilities as far as a career, then I'll be fine. I'm optimistic about the future, even if its not my dream job.

Sometimes you just need to move on, and maybe that thing you thought you wanted so bad was just getting in the way of something better. "
zek8v,8,2012-09-05,I never thought I would be this mad at you.,pissinthewind,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zek8v/i_never_thought_i_would_be_this_mad_at_you/,"Now that it's over its easy to chastise myself for making the mistake of getting back together. You struggled with distance before, but you never betrayed me. You know my history, the last time I was in a serious relationship I was engaged, and when times got rough she gave me an ultimatum I couldn't accept. It wasn't cheating, but I thought of that as a betrayal. When we started you knew I was a forgiving person. I wasn't mad at my ex, but I told you that I have no tolerance for betrayal.

But you convinced me. We've known each other for two years now, and you said you hated denying what we were to each other. I loved you, you loved me,  and you were confident that after so much time thinking this way, that you could handle distance again. 

Then two nights ago happened. You go back to College, one closer to me, that I would be able to visit semi-regularly, at least. Things were looking good, you were away from the people that gave you so many problems, I have internship opportunities coming up soon, money coming in, we could have made it work. Instead you chose to spread your legs wide open on the very first goddamn night.

I'm not usually a mad person. I harbor no ill-will towards any of my exes. Except you, now. You were the first one to cheat on me, and that it was so easy for you. Or that you were so easy. Never in any other break-up in my life have I wanted to say so much more than ""Its all over"". I couldn't believe you had the gall to ask me where we stood, saying you and he both felt terrible. 

I have to admit, I thought I was prepared for this, not that you knew I was thinking that. Maybe that was part of the problem, maybe it would have just ended sooner if I had admitted a couple weeks ago that I was still worried you would succumb to temptation while you were away. But even I didn't think it would happen on the first night. 

I thought I could handle this, if it happened. I would just immediately move on, after all, there are plenty of good looking, nice girls in my classes at my own college, and this is my last year where it will really be this easy to meet new women. You've made me madder at a single person than I've ever been before. I never thought I could really think of someone as a lying cheating whore before, like I think of you. 

Whenever I do a voice in my head says that there are good things there, the same things I saw before. And most of them are still there, but I'll be damned if there worth anything now that you have ruined yourself. Sometimes I just hope you fuck all the guys on your floor, so they all know how easy you are, and that they should stay the fuck away. 

Why the hell am I so fucking mad at you?"
zejjr,0,2012-09-05,22F moving in with 23M. How do I avoid making current roommates and parents angry about my decision? ,roseangela13,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zejjr/22f_moving_in_with_23m_how_do_i_avoid_making/,"I [22F] have been dating my [23M] boyfriend for almost 3 years. We both graduated college in May. I've been living in a house my parents own and bought for me to live in while attending school. Since I graduated, I've been paying rent. I have two roommates: one ex-best friend turned acquaintance for unrelated reasons and one current best friend who both also pay rent. 

Boyfriend was supposed to be away at an internship from July to October. Ended up finding a paid job so he came back early and just moved into his own place. He and I had planned on moving in together in December, but with the way things have changed, we'd like to move in together in October (he's going to have a tough time affording the place alone and I'm going to be starting a new well paying plus benefits job). 

Problem: I had told my parents and roommates I'd be living in the house until December. I don't want to piss anyone off. Pros for living with boyfriend: boyfriend's new place would be cheaper than what I pay now plus it's closer to my office. I also have been having a really tough time living with this ex-bestie turned acquaintance and my parents are extremely overbearing and I've been ready for a while to move out. I also have been ready to live with my boyfriend for a while. We have plans to get engaged within the next few months. However, I know my roommates feel that I have betrayed them and I have yet to talk to my parents about this change, and am not ready for their wrath. 

Extra info: I have a sister who will be moving in in December with her own roommates, so me moving out in December was inevitable anyways. Both current roommates are moving out in December. Parents don't make a profit on the house, so roommates' rent won't go up.

Any suggestions? I also don't want to make my boyfriend's life harder or make him feel shoved aside by not moving in with him now (as he wants). 

TL;DR: Moving out of house earlier than planned to move in with boyfriend. How do I not piss off roommates and parents (homeowners)? "
zeefl,1,2012-09-05,For-Profit School Bounceback?,Envoke,ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/zeefl/forprofit_school_bounceback/,"So, /r/ITdept, I was the unfortunate victim of a bad experience at a state university, and ended up at a for-profit school, which will remain unnamed. Let me give you guys a little backstory.

I went to the state college and attempted a comp-sci degree. Unfortunately, they focused on the programming and software engineering aspect of comp. sci, and offered little to no lab or hands on courses that let you delve into the networking or actual physical aspect of IT. It was extremely math-heavy on the front end, and after speaking with the chair of that department, was told that any hands-on or physical classes took place senior year as internships only.

I was hurt, because I'm not a programmer, and really find myself hitting a brick wall when it comes to the stuff, and ended up changing to a different major, then having to pull out of school a year later due to financial issues.

Cut to 2 years ago. I enrolled in a local for-profit university, mainly because I was guaranteed financial aid, and 2 years later graduated top of my class with an associates, and a+ cert. My teachers all worked in the field, and I got a great education from the place; I got a job working the help desk at a massachusetts based healthcare organization, and couldn't be happier. Sure, I'm in an assload of debt, but it got me to where I wanted with the knowledge I need.

Now though, I find myself at this crossroad. I really want to go back to school, and after calling a couple colleges and investigating online, found that none of my associates credits will transfer, and theres nothing I can do about it. I can go back to the for-profit school and deal with the fact that I'll be facing Harvard-like financial burden for a bachelors degree, or I can start over at a state or private university in MA.

What do you, the IT professions of Reddit recommend for someone like me? I love the hands on, troubleshooting aspect, and server management, but when it comes to general software engineering, I could never be a script monkey. I know I will eventually need to learn code to do basic functions, and I'm willing to accept that, but I can't do that for a living. What programs do you guys recommend? Do I just suck it up and go straight comp-sci and be unhappy doing the programming for the 4 years while I get my shit together, but have an applicable degree, go back to the for-profit and learn the hands-on lab stuff I want, or are there alternate programs available that I'm just not seeing?

Thanks for any help :)"

Shaniqua and I met a few months ago, we really hit it off great. We get along well, laugh together all the time, and we have about 95% of the same interests. In an ideal world, we would have been dating, but about two weeks into knowing Shaniqua, I found out she had a boyfriend of three years.

Often times we would spend 10-12 hours a day together. For a while, we would always hang out, but her boyfriend would always be around too. It's not that her boyfriend made me uncomfortable, he's a decent human being...but it really sucked because of how I felt about her. It was almost like I was getting teased. I mean...wouldn't you guys hate being around the person you're crushing hard on, as well as their SO? It's just sucky.

Because it was harder to keep it in than it would be to face the consequences of telling her, I told her how I felt. I also told her that I felt as if I was getting some mixed signals. I stressed that I was expecting nothing, I just needed to get it off my chest. I also told her fully well knowing that this might be the end of my friendship, and was willing to accept that if need be.

She wasn't upset at all...she was very understanding, and said that she wouldn't let anything get in the way of our current relationship. She also immediately told her boyfriend. The eerie thing is that neither of them were upset. Her boyfriend was like, ""yea it's cool dude I would have told her too...wanna hang out?"" Like, wat? Is this guy even a guy? I'm not really friends with him in the first place. Anyway, I digress...

She had told me in a different world things would be different between us, but she just can't drop her boyfriend for someone she recently met. I understand that. I get it, really, I do. I wouldn't want her to, because then it would make me paranoid.

Anyway, since she stopped being an intern at where I work, I have seen her a lot less. We text and chat once in a while, but it's not the same, which is probably for the best. I've been happy about things for a while now after a brief really sucky period, but just the other day she texted me wanting to go out for some dinner and hang out time later this week. 

Without even thinking, I said I would love to and setup a date and time. I haven't seen her in two weeks, but as much as I want to, I know I shouldn't. I know it's disrespectful to her, her boyfriend, as well as myself for seeing her when I know I still have feelings for her. I know that, in a relationship, **we would never be compatible** because she values religion so much, and I could honestly give two fucks. I know all this, yet the burning desire is there and it's hard to handle.

Now I know that the right thing for me to do would be to call this off, because I've already made it clear that being ""just friends"" with this woman is just going to be too difficult.

Women of reddit, why is the right thing to do so hard?

**TL;DR: Met amazing girl, girl has boyfriend, get mixed signals, tell her how I felt not expecting anything, we distance a little while then she keeps asking me to hang out...I reluctantly say yes but know I should have said no and need to stop contact**"

We went into it together and absolutely in love with each other. About a quarter of the way through she told me that she was interested in taking a break because she felt as though she wasn't in the moment enough. A few weeks later I went on a pre-planned trip to see her. Things were absolutely amazing for both of us. After the trip, we started the break. The summer was great for her. She met a ton of new friends and started dating a guy out there. We had planned on getting back together from the conception of the idea. Now, two-months after I visited her, she has returned. She's unsure if she wants to pick things back up because she felt something for someone else and because she's interested in taking a year LOA from school to travel abroad.

I should say that when we were together, everything was perfect. We never fought and everyday was full of laughs and interesting conversation.

I think that since what we had was so great that we should finish off this semester strong. I want her to be happy and I want her to adventure and explore but I really think that we should end things between us right.

Should I fight for us or should I just shrug off the best relationship of my life?

zd9vu,2,2012-09-04,I'm unhappy in my relationship. But I'm not throwing in the towel yet. (Wall of Text incoming!),badjellydawitch,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/zd9vu/im_unhappy_in_my_relationship_but_im_not_throwing/,"We've been going out for two years, one of which was in a long-distance relationship. She has some pretty big insecurities physically, which were not helped by me looking up porn, saying that I check out other girls etc. (The latter was when I was unaware of these issues, the former has happened several times.)

Call it a hunch, but I believe 90% of the issues we have stem from this. She gets really worked up over small things (leaving a few crumbs on the counter, for example), has called me a ""fucking idiot"", as well as ""disgusting"", ""untrustworthy"", and other similar terms (the last two related to busted-watching-porn issues.) She got angry with me when I told her that I was loving my intern job back home, and that I might take them up on the offer if they gave me a full-time job. (Dream job.) She was adamant that I'd move to her since she was going to apply for her dream job, but she wouldn't do the same for me. She didn't get her dream job in the end; I was offered mine but I turned it down to live with her. Something I kick myself over way too fucking much.

I help her out at her work every morning before I go to mine. I don't get paid a dime, and it's often here where she gets really mad at me over little things.

Granted, I'm not perfect. When she came back from a flight in the weekend, I was absent-minded, and didn't offer to take her bags for her. Not only that, but I left my wallet in the car, so she had to pay for that. (I paid her back, but that seems to be beside the point). I kept getting busted with the porn thing - and although I believe it's not a big deal personally, I gave it up. (/r/nofap was the lynchpin to this, the potential of an improved relationship was more of a plus than a driving factor. I simply wanted to make the most of my time instead of fap. To each their own.)

Having said that, we've both done some awesome things for each other. I brought her to tears when I gave her her first Valentine's Day gift, and her parents were kind enough to fly me overseas with her family for a holiday. She's supportive of my goals (I'm guessing, provided I don't move away). If you're actually reading this, you're a fucking champion. I feel like you care, and that makes me happy. I do my best to bring her up emotionally, although I'm struggling in that department.

But it's more bad than good at the moment. She doesn't listen when I mention something she's doing when she's bugging me - she keeps going, like a naughty kid until I have to really put the foot down. Although she gets frustrated with me over little things, when I (jokingly) rib her over something she does, which is not often, she gets mad and insults me. Since she last caught me with porn, there's been no sex. She says she's not ready (which could well be honest, but it still makes it hard (*heh*), especially with nofap).

And I'm falling into not caring. I've been fantasizing over a mutual friend for the last week and a half. When she's nice to me, all I'm thinking about is when the next big episode is going to happen. I'm legitimately happier when she's not around. I want to break up with her, but I feel like I'd be that guy who destroyed her self-image with porn, then said later. And I hate myself for it.



But you know what? I'm not ready to quit yet. The way I see it, is I've been letting her step on me all this time. No, she shouldn't be doing it in the first place, but I should also have the power to firmly say, ""I'm not cool with that."" I should be able to calmly state my issue and listen to what she has to say in response (provided it's mature), as opposed to weakly telling her to stop. I should be able to walk away when I think she's truly being disrespectful.

So here's my plan. I am going to find out if the change lies in me or in her. I'm going to be the guy she fell in love with again. (Luckily, nofap has already helped in this somewhat.) I'm going to be more sociable all-round, I'm going to be kind to my girlfriend (because **I do love her**), and I'm also going to stand my ground when I think she's acting muffed up.

If I can successfully do that, and she becomes the girl I fell in love with again, then that's AWESOME. I'll be a happy man.
If she doesn't change, or if she gets worse, I'll know I didn't walk away at the first sign of struggle. I'll know I gave it as much effort as I was willing to give, and that it wasn't enough. And I'll be able to walk away with a clear mind.

**WHEW**. I feel good now. By the way, I'm happy to talk about whatever. :P"
zgsfm,467,2012-09-06,"As a former recruiter of interns, I want to inform/remind college students that we usually hire next summer's interns between now and Novemer",timmytimtimshabadu,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/zgsfm/as_a_former_recruiter_of_interns_i_want_to/,"November, obviously.


The point of this post is: Don't go looking for jobs in March, because the positions get filled **NOW**


Most companies that I worked for, would post their campus recruitment adds in early september, interview in late sept/early october and send out offers by the end of october.


These would be STEM type jobs, but nearly any summer corporate internship type job likely does the same.  Most of the interviews were behavioral based.  We weren't looking for people who actually KNEW very much - we were looking for people with the right attitude who were progressing through programs which would eventually yield enough knowledge to work with.

Generally, if you're a student, applying for your first office/profession job expect mostly behavioural questsion. Have prepared examples and answers for questions regarding:

- when you've shown initiative
- when you've dealt with conflict
- when you've worked in a team, and your role
- what courses you enjoy/do not enjoy in school
- how you keep yourself organized at work/school
- what helps you unwind, what you do to relax
- what do you want out of a company, what do you see as a good work environment
- what do you know about my company/my industry
- why are you interested in pursuing a carreer

Try not to relate EVERYTHING back to a class project, or a group presentation.  Try to vary your responses over some volunteer work, or a previous job even if it was unrelated to the field.  Don't try and sound like you ONLY go to school.

A ""good"" interview, from my end anyway, is one in which these questions do not actually get asked. A good interview is one where it turns into a conversation with some back and forth, around these topics and the result is that they all get answered. Communication skills are key, so try and not be nervous.

TL:DR **start checking your campus recruitment office's website daily for jobs in your field, not getting an internship will really hurt your chances finding a full time job after you graduate, and lots of people dont know that most jobs, which start next summer, are POSTED VERY SOON**

basically I interned at a company over the summer (I am currently in college). My report to manager wants me to work every summer and eventually full time, but he doesn't allocate the budget (It is a big corporate company). My internship has ended, and I would like to email the VP of the department in the company to ask him if I can work for the next 3 years of my college career (during the summer as an intern). I would also like to make it clear in the email that I am not sure about working full time yet. I have met with the VP before, and had small discussion about it, and he seemed interested. But he is a busy man, and I couldn't meet with with him before leaving so we can discuss this issue. 


Here is the email I have so far:

Derp (his name),

Would you be interested in having me working as a part time employee for the next 3 years of my college career; However, I am not sure if I would like to pursue this full time yet.

Is this formal enough?"
zg02h,41,2012-09-06,I'm seriously frustrated.,grrarghlisten,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zg02h/im_seriously_frustrated/,"So I have always known that I do not want to go through pregnancy. I can't explain it, I've just always known. I have always wanted to adopt only. My mother was adopted, so at the very least I feel like I'd be honoring my grandmother. I have nightmares about being pregnant. I literally wake up screaming and clawing at my stomach. I can't look at pregnant people without getting nauseous. I refuse to watch movies/shows with pregnant people. It's disgusting to me.

When I was 16, I collapsed at work. I was a grocery bagger, and I lifted one of those 50lb dog bags and just collapsed in pain. My mom was luckily in that line and rushed me to the hospital. After a couple MRIs, I was diagnosed with severe PCOS. Seriously, my ovaries looked like raspberries. 

I was sent to follow up with a gynecologist in a few days. It was a male, and he forced me to do a transvaginal ultrasound. I was screaming in pain (I hadn't even masturbated, let alone had sex so it was super painful). He told me to shut the fuck up and that I was a weak bitch. Of course this just makes me start crying on top of being in pain. He told my mother I had a cyst burst and still had some fluid in my abdomen and it would pass. I was put on the patch, which made me absolutely crazy depressed and suicidal but my mother refused to take me to a different gynecologist and I was not going to go back to that one. The moment I got to college, I stopped taking the patch and just let my body try to regulate itself. 

Flash forward four years, and I met a wonderful guy. I finally felt comfortable with him to want to have sex, but I wanted to get on birth control because I absolutely do not want to be pregnant. I went to one of the two gynos my insurance covers in my tiny Texas town, and she told me she wouldn't give me birth control because I wasn't married and she refused to help a slut. Yeah, little me who was finally going to have sex with her first partner after about a year of dating.

So I went to the other gyno. She was slightly more understanding, but was hesitant. I had to bring in my boyfriend before she finally relented and said she would give me an IUD, but also said she would've felt more comfortable if I was married because then she wouldn't have to give me the IUD because I would need to make babies for Jesus. I kid you not, this is what she told us. But she at least was going to give me the IUD, so I just ignored her comments.

For the IUD, she gave me a pill that normally would kickstart labor as it widens the cervix opening. It was the weirdest feeling ever, and even typing this makes me shiver with dread. I hated it. I had contractions. It was just another nail in the already sealed coffin of no pregnancy for me. I got the IUD in, even though it was super painful.

Let's just say Mirena and I aren't friends. Two weeks after I got it in, I had a 5.5 month long period. Not just light spotting, but full on changing pads several times a day flow. I had two days off before another 2 month long period. And then, nothing. It was several months later when having sex that suddenly I felt a lot of pain, and noticed I was gushing blood. I was in terrible pain. I went to the doctor first thing in the morning and their conclusion was an ill timed period. Several months later, I got another horrible period. My gyno decided to put me on the pill on top of Mirena to try and regulate it, but all it did was give me 3 week long periods (and yes, the dummy pill weeks I didn't bleed) and depression. I stopped after 3 months, and just gave up. I still have the Mirena, but I still deal with 3-4 week long periods with about a week off. I should also mention that same boyfriend is now my husband, and we are both each other's only sexual partners.

I've always had this hope of California being this awesome place where I could finally get sterilized. My field of work meant at some point I would end up in California, and sure enough, here I am for a few short months on an internship. I saw a post in 2X a few months ago where I read you can't be turned away from sterilization in California for age/number of kids/etc. which was what was preventing me in Texas (my gyno said it was clinic policy to not do it until 30 or have 2 kids, and I simply can't drive to a big city easily enough to get it done there). So I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood, but they told me they didn't take my insurances (I have two) and it would be $250 for the consultation and $2700 for the procedure. There is just no way I can afford that, and I don't qualify for the grants because I'm not a state resident. So I got a list from my insurance and started calling. I made an appointment and went. My husband isn't with me, he's back in Texas. I was alone. And now, instead of being told they won't sterilize me because I should have babies for Jesus, I'm now told I have a mental illness and should see a therapist because I should want to be pregnant and have kids by now. I started sobbing while the doctor talked to me. I collected myself enough to leave and walk to few blocks to my car. Then I just lost it. All my hopes and dreams were crushed. A little old lady knocked on my car window and patted my head until I had calmed down enough to breathe and talk. She felt so sorry for me and I was thankful I had at least someone, even if it was a random stranger, to help me calm down. I went home and cried more to my husband on Skype.

I just can't help but think I would've gotten it had my husband been there with me. We both agree for 2-3 kids, and he doesn't care if they're adopted or biological and that it's my choice. He told me to make another appointment at a different doctor, but I don't know if I can handle that rejection again. A very close, trusted male friend who I know here has offered to pretend to be my husband and go with me to the doctor. But I simply don't know. I'm so upset.

Why can't I just control my uterus?!"
zfkuu,1,2012-09-05,My best friend's mother passed away last week.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zfkuu/my_best_friends_mother_passed_away_last_week/,"I wanted to post this here because... well, while I understand that it may not be the same for everybody, there's just something about losing your mother that I feel hits a girl, especially considering my friend is a mere 21 years old. I apologize for the wall of text in advance.

Her mother passed away after battling stage IV colon cancer for a long and torturous five years. She had previously had colon cancer that had gone into remission, and in between, she even had breast cancer. This woman was as tough as a woman and mother could be, her biggest concern was that her battle with cancer was causing pain and sadness all around her.

Very few people make it past five years of colon cancer, in fact, [only about 8% do](http://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/guide/treatment-stage?page=2).

Five years passed, she was deemed unoperable, and it was only a matter of time.

Now, I want to tell you a little about my friend. She is a strong, stubborn, passionate young woman whose life goal is to save the world through animal conservation. During these daunting and scary five years, she went to college in the next state over where I had the luck to meet her, went to Africa for a study abroad, and we started an extraordinarily successful animal conservation club at our university that took up a significant amount of time and weekends to accomplish. After she graduated, she moved across the country to study snakes for a summer internship. Once she was done, she moved in with her long term boyfriend that had found a position not far from her internship. Basically, she was a long ways from home.

She then had to decide when she had to go home. When she would spend the last moments with her mother. She thought at this point that her mother would still have at least a few months left, but the doctor told my friend that her mother's heart could fail at anytime. Not willing to take the risk however small, she went home as soon as she could. 

Her mother passed away two weeks later.

I could make this whole post about her mother and how strong she was, but that isn't what I want to talk about. My friend and I sat down a day after her mother's funeral and she confided to me that she always knew that this would be it, that the cancer was what was going to kill her mother. But, then she said something that really hit home.

**""I couldn't live like my mother was dying.""**

And that is entirely true. Her mother fought and battled a disease that could have taken her within the first year of having it, much less the full five years that it did take. Was my friend to stop living her life during some of her most pivotal and defining years in case her mother was to pass away the next day? I feel as though her mother was much happier watching her daughter progress and strive in life than she would have been had my friend been holding her hand every second of the day, with nothing new to add to the otherwise daunting conversation.

People often say to live like you were dying, but in another sense... live as though the people closest to you were dying. Because it's true, we are getting closer to dying everyday. Enjoy and take full advantage of the moments you have with them, be kind and respectful and a decent human being. And live your life, because that makes a better conversation.

Girls, always remember your mother, your best friend, or even your neighbor could die tomorrow. Don't stop living because of it."

So, here goes: It's been about two and a half years since we broke up. I loved him, thought he loved me, one day he told me he didn't love me any more, later found out he cheated. Awesome. Not the point. 

Two years later, I find myself in Florida for an internship. Keep in mind, I haven't spoken to the kid in about eight months. Out of no where, he texts me. I found the timing odd since my internship was going to end in two months and I would be returning home. During this time frame, we text every other day about just stuff. It felt like how we used to talk and it was nice. I return home, he invites me over to show me his new place, I accept the invitation. The first time I go over there, nothing happens, but he flirts and drops hints saying things like, I would give you gas money if you came and visited more often, I could help you study if you needed it, etc. Whatever. I go over there again to watch a movie we've been meaning to watch together for awhile. Let's just say things quickly escalated and bad decisions were made. I caved. 

Now, he hasn't said a word to me. My current plan of action is to not talk to him and wait until I run into him again (it's inevitable, we have a class together) to see how he acts. My question is this: Are we friends? Are we fucking? Are you pursuing me? Are we starting over?Did I just become a two-month-old booty call?What is the best way to ask him this? I just want all of this craziness to be over because a part of me still loves him, but I'm not about to be led on again and frankly, I'm goddamn sick of playing this game. I want an answer and I want to be done with it. 

TL;DR My ex and I hooked up after a month or so of talking and now I'm confused. What's the best way to approach this situation without coming off as clingy or creepy?

zj2n9,0,2012-09-07,"I went at least a year and a half w/o PMO, and now have fallen back into old habits. I want to share how much of a difference it makes, and also get out of these habits once again. (long-post)",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/zj2n9/i_went_at_least_a_year_and_a_half_wo_pmo_and_now/,"First off, I found this subreddit today, and I'd like to say that this is awesome. It's so cool to see a community that's striving to eliminate the most sick, and most prominent things in today's society out of their lives. Like come on, that is awesome.

So I as I typed this out, I was trying to make it short, but I had too much I wanted to say, so it's a long post, my apologies. 

I was 16 when I started at stopping my PMO. And lasted from about April 2010 to about October 2011; so about a year and a half. It was awesome. I was free from all that crap and I just wanted nothing to do with it, it was an amazing feeling, especially at 16&amp;17, no one does that at that age (not trying to sound braggy). I was definitely very much involved in the church, I lived for God, and for others, and that's what kept me going. I had an amazing girlfriend and yeah, life was sweet. So come October 2011, I start kind of drifting away from the church (it was my senior year you know, can't let the church hold me down; yes I was a stupid teenager) and I relapse for the first time in over a year and a half, over 450 days of being free of PMO, gone. And from there it just got worse and now brings me to today.

I am glad I found people who actually want to rid themselves of this crap. Let me tell you though, it makes a HUGE difference in your lifestyle.

So as I say all this, keep in mind I'm not trying to talk myself up, or brag, but I'm just being real and speaking from experience. So as I was free of PMO, I was a really enjoyable person. I got along with everyone, I was very social, and people really seemed to like me as a person. Also communication with girls was easy for me, and who doesn't want that? Since I relapsed into it, I'm much more anti-social, I get more agitated, and most of all I feel A LOT more self-conscious and worry what others think of me way too much. I find it hard to talk to girls, and not be nervous around them. It sucks. I can't give you an explanation of why this happens, but it does. I am just not the same person I was, and I don't like that.

Also things were WAY different with the two relationships I was in. When I was with a girl and without PMO (we will call her girl#1) my relationship flourished. We had so much fun and were always happy it seemed. I always wanted to hang out with her, and visa versa, no matter what we were doing. We enjoyed each other's time a lot, without the physical side of it. But with the girl I was dating and self PMO was also involved things were nowhere near as good, (and we'll call her girl#2). With girl#2 I was not always wanting to hangout with her, I got annoyed with her easily, I looked at her in the wrong way too often (not that I looked at her as a sex object 24/7, I really did treat her well, but I was kind of corrupted in my thoughts) and it was just not as good as girl#1. Also in comparison, I was with girl#1 for around 9months, and girl#2 for less than 2 months. 

That being said, I ended things with girl#2 because I am doing an Internship at my church soon and want my full focus to be on that and growing with God, and learning more about myself. Even if I wasn't doing the internship though, I would have been with her for the wrong reasons, and it would have been not okay.

But to summarize everything, life is a lot better without PMO being involved. You have more confidence, you're relationships improve, you aren't comparing your significant other to what you see on the computer screen, and you feel so much better about life and yourself, you can't hide from experience, and that's what I'm speaking from. I know this is all kind of thrown together and not really well explained or written, but if you have any questions or want me to elaborate or offer advice, message me or leave a comment (I'll notice comments more so on my mobile app than messages).

And as I said before, I am not trying to brag of my 450+ days, or say ""Look at me, I'm great,"" trust me I'm no where near great or perfect, I just wanted to share encouragement. I'm stuck in the same place as most of us here, I'm on day one again today, but that brought me here. Support for each other is definitely the greatest thing we can provide here. You all are awesome."

ziqsq,1,2012-09-07,I'm afraid to improve my life because I'll have nothing to blame this feeling on.,deeperanddown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ziqsq/im_afraid_to_improve_my_life_because_ill_have/,"I have been very fortunate in my life. I was born into a comfortable middle class family in one of the richest countries in the world, my parents never struggled for money and were never to strict on me.
I'm now 23 years old and am just about to complete a year long internship before returning to study for a year. I am 99% sure that I will be offered a permanent job once I complete my study with the company I've been working for for the last year. I've earned enough money this year to life independently of my parents, but I know that if I was stuck my parents would let me access money left to me by my grandparents, if that ran out I know my parents would support me in what ever I do. I also have good health (apart from a bit of weight issues which I'll come to in a bit) and a set of friends who are there for me if I need them.

All of this is great, however I have a paralysing fear ingrained into my brain. I feel incredibly lonely and it is only exacerbated by being in the company of others. I have never had a relationship and I blame it on being overweight although I know that's not the whole truth. I have zero self confidence when it comes to meeting strangers and a paralysing fear that I am doing something wrong in any situation.

In my mind if I hit the gym, cut down the calories and went out more I could find someone to share my time with easily. Despite being a virgin it's not just sex I want, I want someone to come home to; to cook and eat dinner with, to share the washing up and lean against while watching TV. If someone asks about what I did at the weekend I want to be able to say '*we* went to the park', '*we* went to the theatre' or '*we* just stayed home and did nothing' rather than '*I* just sat and moped' or '*I* went to the cinema by myself again'.

My fear is that if I find this magic person who puts up with me and smiles when she sees me come home everyday, I'll still be depressed. Now I have this thing which I know is missing, I can blame that for my misery and depression and know that it could happen one day and I should look forward to it, that's what keeps me going.

I'm terrified that in 20 years time I'm living in a nice house, with a brilliant partner and awesome kids I'll still feel like this. I'll have nothing to blame for the depression and have to acknowledge that I just have a brain that makes me feel miserable and worthless and leaves me spending an entire day curled up crying in bed when I know that friends have invited me to go do something fun.

I haven't been diagnosed with any form of clinical depression. I'm too scared of going to a doctor and being told that there is nothing wrong and I should cheer up. My doctors surgery is in a small town and all the staff know all my family. I know about doctor patient confidentiality but I just can't get this though out of my head. I have and will happily go and see a doctor about my swollen balls or anything physically embarrassing, but the though of someone going 'Did you hear about deeperanddown? He thinks he's got depression!'

Does anyone else have this kind of attitude?


P.S. I hope this makes sense as typing it has been a struggle and I just can't face proof reading it."

zho37,12,2012-09-07,"My rational physician mom is voting for Romney because she thinks the Repubs have the right idea about ""not giving more money to trash"". How the hell do you combat this worldview? Can it be argued with?",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zho37/my_rational_physician_mom_is_voting_for_romney/,"My mother does not look like your stereotypical Reddit-approved Republican voter. She is a minority who is well-educated, with a science background, staunchly atheist, and anti-patriotic. She is racist and classist, but I believe no more so than many Americans in the privacy of their own homes. 

The reason she votes for Romney is because she thinks it's fair for rich people to dodge taxes because ""I wouldn't want to give more money to the poor either"". She wants to get rid of Medicaid and welfare *completely* and thinks that the poor are all lazy drug addicts who refuse to work and cheat the system, thanks to her experience as a doctor in a low-income community. Essentially, her entire reason for voting Republican is to de-fund Medicaid, and everyone in her physicians' circles feels the same way.

I don't get it. The only reason she could go to medical school in the first place was thanks to a (communist) government funding her entire education. When she arrived in America she was poor in terms of money, but not in human capital because *she had a medical degree*. In fact, the only reason she got to come to America in the first place was due to a PUBLIC university with PUBLIC science funding paying for her salary. 

She has it in her head that the only reason she's reasonably well-off now was because she worked harder than other people, so she deserves lower taxes and shouldn't have to ""help"" lazy people. But the only reason she had these opportunities in the first place was *due to other people's taxes.* I'm proud of her for taking advantage of these opportunities, but she can't see that other people don't have the same opportunities, or that other people can work their ass off and never become upper-middle-class, or that quite frankly not everyone is born with the brain capacity to become engineers and computer scientists and *it's not just a matter of laziness*. 

I do think that sometimes culture is the problem, as much as systematic issues and the death of blue-collar and manufacturing jobs that has created a gap between ""unemployment"" and ""white collar jobs that require internships poor people can't afford"". I think that too often American parents do not push their kids to work hard in school and succeed in math and science and academics, and that is a problem as much as education funding and poor teaching methodology. But I also think that we are demanding that our poor be Supermen who can overcome the culture they grow up in - the drugs, the gangs, the lack of parental support, the need to work while others are developing their human capital through studying and internships - while being satisfied that people like Mitt Romney aren't *too* evil, even though they're spectacularly greedy because ""hey, I'd be greedy too if I were rich"". 

Most of all, I don't believe the answer is punishment. The reason I don't count on the existence of Supermen (if you starve them enough) is because I am a pragmatist, not an idealist. I don't know what the answer is, but I know it's not depriving someone of access to basic needs. I can understand many traditional fiscal Conservative desires like small government, but I just don't understand this urge to punish, or this notion that most of our taxes are going to welfare queens and Medicaid cheats. 

I see a lot of moderate people claiming that both parties have the same fundamental vision, but different ideas on how best to get there. From personal experience, I have to disagree - I think my mom and I fundamentally prioritize different principles, where she cares more about ""personal freedom"" and ""fair taxes"" while I care more about ""personal responsibility"", ""fair opportunities"", and equal access to this freedom. So my question is: with the kind of argument she and the Republicans make, is it a matter of personal ethics, or of being lied to about the real world? Can it be combated with logic, reasoning, and real numbers; or are we simply too different in values, such that we're not even working towards the same vision?

**tl;dr: I don't believe Republicans are crazy or evil, but I cannot accept this kind of moralism. How can we address it with reasoning, logic, and real-world data? Can someone help me construct an argument, or can this worldview not be reasoned with?**"

4) We're living with his dad at the moment so that I can save up and go on an international internship next year - logistical nightmare.
5) I love his mum and little sisters to death. 
6) He is the most important person in the world to me.

Earlier this year I cheated on him with a girl i had been pursuing (I'm bisexual). I felt absolutely awful for it and eventually he forgave me. I can't help still feeling like I want to be with other people. I dream about being with others every night and I don't even feel guilty about wanting to be with someone else (though I won't cheat again). It was at the beginning of the year that I told him I would want to take a break over summer (Sth hemisphere), where we would both be free to pursue other people and I would have a chance to get my independence back. He's been up and down ever since, sometimes being very understanding and other times being incredibly cold. He can be negative and pessimistic, anti-social and unrealistic. He is also incredibly un-ambitious. I try to be positive and am very ambitious. When we met he was at uni but the next year he just started working full time, everyday talking about how much he hated his job. 

For the first year of our relationship we were both just loved up, living together and smoking weed too much. I realised that that was not the way I wanted to live my life and toned it down. Last year it became harder for us to source but then ""legal cannabis"" came onto the market. We went from buying a pack every other week to him buying a pack every other day. This year he would smoke it before work and constantly in the evenings. I would have one cone and be done but he would just smoke sooo much. A few months ago I was looking for a packet I had bought the day before. He swore black and white that he had no idea where it was, i even found the empty pack in the bin and he denied everything. We went for a walk and he admitted his lie, saying that he has been smoking before work every day when I've accused him. --Basically I would accuse him of smoking it (i can smell it), he would deny it, I would put on the pressure and he would get very, very nasty calling me a control freak and a nazi. --The fact that he'd been lying the entire time really took its toll on me emotionally. he promised he would never lie again and then a week ago he lied to my face - again, then quickly told the truth.

One more thing that really hurt me was when I opened up about my depression, the catalyst being my estranged father's death 2 years ago. He said ""I don't think you're depressed, I think you want to be depressed"" Here I was, feeling suicidal, trying to open up to my soulmate and he was just shutting me down. I said it was the nastiest thing anyone has ever said to me.

But he also is so loving, caring, funny, sweet. We still laugh and cuddle and kiss and fuck but I feel like this isn't where I want to be anymore. 

I don't know if I should stay and fix this or leave it now.

If I wait until November when i go overseas, I'll want to do it before I leave so that I can just be single and enjoy myself over there. I'm only going for 2 months and I don't know how I'll feel at the end of it.

Long post I'm sorry, this is my first on Reddit.

zhhgc,5,2012-09-06,I quit,ElCapitanoMojo,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/zhhgc/i_quit/,"Hey guys,

couple months ago, I was looking for an internship and I found this one where I would be working for a big mining company. Which is 1000km away from home. 

I applied and got it. But then I took a closer look and the work I would have to do wasn't interesting, that would be a boring internship. I said might as well try it. 

Then 1 month before the start of the intership, I was begining to make these panic attacks more and more often, I was really scared of what it would be and how could I make it. 

I started two days ago and I just realized that I would not make it through the four months that I have to do here. So I took the decision to quit. Tomorow I'm flying back home and I have to call the company to tell them they are not going to see me again. 

Just wanted to share my story.

Edit : I'm home... my school is going to give me a huge sack of shit for pulling something like that.... but It feels good"
zh97k,17,2012-09-06,"My wife (25) was supposed to move to Austin with me (28) for my new job, but she went back instead.",rafmonster,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zh97k/my_wife_25_was_supposed_to_move_to_austin_with_me/,"My wife and I started dating exactly 3 years ago today.

We met at work in Chicago, and pretty soon, we were spending 24 hours a day together. We would awake in her place or mine, get ready for work, and take the bus to our job. Spent the evenings together, and repeat the next day. This went on for 2+ years.

We were independent too. She had her passions and friends, and I had mine. So we would also go our separate ways for entertainment. But since we spent so much time together, we REALLY got to know each other.

I proposed after 9 months, and we got married in May last year. Great marriage, great relationship. Simply put, we were each others favorite person. 

In May of this year, I got offered a job in Austin. It was as close to a dream job as I could get in my career. They were going to allow me to work long distance, but through the encouragement of my wife, I accepted the job, and we planned our move. 

I was nervous the entire time, and was saddened to leave our condo, friends, and in-laws. She comforted me, and motivated me to move as we were ""young and adventurous"". 

She was going to have to stay behind for a month to finish up the summer semester of college where she is studying Justice Studies. Her last semester just required her to finish an internship, which she got permission to finish in Austin. She was so close to being done. So I moved at the end of July, and she was supposed to join me 8/22.

She got here, and then everything changed.

She acted semi-normal, but I could tell she wasn't happy. Not as happy as I was to see her. I was pretty lonely here, as I don't have a way to get around really. (She kept the car in Chicago, and I bought a bike down here to get around in 100 degree weather). Distance made my heart grow fonder. It wasn't the same for her.

She opened up and told me that she was really sad, and didn't really know why. We sort of chalked it up to homesickness. But she went on about all the opportunities she is leaving behind in Chicago; the classmates that she'll miss, the professors that are championing her career. She started to show signs of depression, and it was obvious she didn't want to be in Austin. She was barely affectionate, and wasn't the same loving wife that I knew so well. She basically did not want to be here.

After a few talks, I suggested that she go back to Chicago to finish the semester. If it was the only way that she was going to shake the sadness, it was all I could do. She agreed, and suddenly everything seemed fine. Once she knew she could go back, she saw light at the end of the tunnel.

I started to question if something happened in that month apart. She denied it, and did a mediocre job of convincing me that she still cared deeply for me. But I did start to question if she still cared about me. I mean, how could she leave me here in Austin for months while she tries to shake the sadness?

She went back on Monday, and honestly, I'm 100% miserable. I feel abandoned. I don't know anyone here, and I only have a bike so going to bars means showing up drenched in sweat. We can't afford another car (that she took back to Chicago since she needs it a bit more than me), since we are a single income family as she finishes her degree. We talk, and all I can try to do is support her and hope that she shakes the depression and wants to come back.

Bottom line, it's not the loneliness. It's the feeling of abandonment.  

I'm cracking. (signed up for therapy and everything)

But what do I do, guys? How can I get through this? Was I right to try to help her figure it out?

tl;dr Wife was supposed to move with me to Austin. She came, got depressed, and went back ""temporarily"""

A few words about me: I'm German, male, turning 18 this month, finished my Abitur this summer and I'm starting an internship in October. I don't live in Berlin yet, the room/flat should hence be available a few days before the start of the internship. I'm quite tolerant and as long as I get my personal space, any roommate should be fine.

My budget is ~400€ max. for warmmiete and the place should at least have a small kitchen included. Work is in Mitte near Wedding and I'd like to live somewhere nearby (Prenzlauer Berg, Tiergarten, Pankow, Moabit, Friedrichshain etc. - you get the picture).

I'm a 20F involved with a 26M; it's still pretty new, been together about a month.

Here is the context of this relationship: I interned at the company he works for (a very big company-- however, within a tight-knit industry) this summer. I'm no longer employed there, but hope to return; he works in an entirely different department than I did and holds a senior, but non-management position (emphatically: he was not my boss and wouldn't be if I returned). 

We struck up a relationship at the end of my internship and kept it quiet. My internship is now over, we continue to keep it quiet. 

I never flirted or entertained advances from anyone else at this company, and starting talking to him in a 'romantic' way only after getting to know him.

I really care about him, and the feelings are reciprocated. He's probably the best guy I've ever met, and I want to see where this goes. 

However, clouded as my judgment is -- is this a good idea, given the workplace connection we have, and particularly my position as a (now former) intern?

TL;DR: I got involved with a ""real employee"" who worked in a different department than mine while on an internship. Now that the internship's over, is it appropriate if I date him? I'm looking for outside input here. 

So, specific question: Is this relationship appropriate?"

Utterly confusing and stressful situation, help me.",IAMATrappedThrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zm9cg/i_23m_am_stuck_in_a_relationship_with_so_22f/,"Okay, I have been in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years now and we have been living together for about a year and a half. 

The beginning of our relationship was amazing, with some rocky parts (but what relationship doesn't have these?). However, since she first moved in with me she had conflict with my best-friend/roommate and my other roommate and essentially seperated me from them and a few other of my friends who she has had arguments or fights with. She is loving and cares about me for the most part but she can easily turn into a monster, especially after drinking. 

I work full-time at a hospital after having graduated last year, while she is a senior in college, works part time, and does an internship so she has little in the ways of income which results in me buying literally every meal/drink for her for the most part; she also pays about a 1/3rd of what I pay for rent (we currently share a 2BR apartment with another couple). 

For about a year my friends have said this or that about how I deserve better than her and how she's an awful person... during this time I have had to walk a very thin line to please both parties and try to compromise things between them.

Sex has literally dwindled to nothing as since the beginning of our relationship she has always had pain during intercourse and it almost turns me off that she gets basically no satisfaction (just the opposite) out of it. This isn't a huge problem, but it's obviously an issue of frustration.

There are many times I tell myself that I continue the relationship strictly because I am too lonely and would rather suffer these problems with her rather than suffer alone... I hate an empty bed.

Now this is where things get a little more complicated, an extremely attractive girl [20F] came into my hospital the other day... While she waited around we exchanged glances across the room the entire time... I left without saying a word to her, but I don't know what it was... but I went home and went on craigslist and made a missed connection regarding her. Now I honestly didn't expect anything to come of it but lo and behold, the next day I look at my emails and she replied, saying ""I hope I had caught your glance!"" I was floored to say the least.

Now this is where my stress starts... she asked for my number and we have been texting back and forth... hasn't asked me if I'm in a relationship and wants to get together for coffee or a meal and now I feel uneasy and almost ashamed that I am either A) emotionally cheating on my girlfriend, or B) leading this other girl on. 

The situation wouldn't be so hard for me if I didn't just get around to moving into a new apartment with my girlfriend the beginning of this month. She is not on the lease, but I don't think I can afford the extra $300 with her not there, nor do I think I would have the heart to tell my girlfriend to find a place on her own with absolutely no money or other options as far as her continuing her education/internship/job out here. I truly feel stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no idea what to do, I haven't told anyone else and it's literally eating me up.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I am desperate for help.

zlf6g,0,2012-09-09,Half-Asian 25m having difficulties getting over father issues.  Biological father appeared back in my life after 2 decades and wants me to help him.,asterysk,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/zlf6g/halfasian_25m_having_difficulties_getting_over/,"Hi /relationships, wondering if you might have some advice for me.  My father left me when I was very young and I'm still having trouble getting over his absence.  Also it's complicated by the fact that he is from a foreign country, which has caused... racial identity issues for me as well.

Background, I'll try to condense this as much as possible:

- American mother (white) travelled overseas to work as an English teacher in...lets say, China.  (Close enough.)

- Met my soon-to-be father (Asian) who was relatively well off at the time.  Had a 3yo daughter from a previous marriage, son of an affluent, well-respected doctor in his town.  

- Decided they wanted to get married, moved back to US, mom's family **freaked**.  Maternal grandmother and aunt on my mother's side gradually turned mother against him, started trying to indoctrinate and kidnap my older half-sister.  Temporarily cut off contact between father and my older sis esp as he was working long hours trying to make a paycheck...difficult for a foreigner with no degree.

- During this time I was born.

- 2 weeks later situation was so bad, dad decided to ""cut his losses"" and take his older daughter back to China.

**TL;DR - Mom brought home a ""foreigner"", her family freaked out, dad left 2 weeks after I was born.**

**Childhood:**

- Mother remarried when I was three, mother and stepfather had a daughter when I was six.  Growing up, my sister and I fought a lot, I wasn't too close to my stepfather, but these have both improved over time.  I'm on good terms with mom, stepfather, and younger sister today.  (The four of us are essentially ""the family"".  I call my stepfather ""dad"" nowadays.)

- Predominantly white (&gt;90%) public school in a socially conservative small town in the deep south was difficult for me.  I was strong academically but had difficulty making friends from middle school onwards.  I always felt ""different"" and that I didn't belong because I was Asian (compared to everyone else I might as well have been 100% Asian, they couldn't tell any difference).  Was not as well off as everyone else.  Wealth equated to social status in the town I grew up in.  I used my mom's last name but even that was weird.  European name, but not common.  I was teased a lot for being: 1. Asian. 2. Poor.  3. Weird last name. 4. Nerdy, overly concerned about studies.  One the one hand, everyone identified me as **the Asian kid**, yet on the other hand I didn't know much beyond just a little bit from what my mother had told me about China, what I read in news/books, a few words.

- Mom and stepfather divorced when I started high school.  Turned out to be not as traumatizing, both my younger sis and I have gotten over it decently.

- I basically hated living in Small Town, had only a few friends (but I still keep up with them loosely today).  I doubled down on my studies knowing I was at least intelligent and could go to college and GTFO of Small Town.  

- Looking back at high school it's actually painfully obvious to me now that I had several good opportunities to have a relationship with girls in school.  I guess I always second-guessed myself thinking that I was too poor (and didn't want them to know) and that no one would be legitimately interested in me because I was this nerdy Asian kid.  I felt also that I didn't really know how to talk to them and reciprocate as it was something a ""dad"" was supposed to teach, and my stepfather and I weren't too close growing up.  I was too nervous to ever make a move and ask them out, even though it's obvious now they *were* interested.

- Mom and sis moved to a different state when I was a senior in high school.  Stayed with my stepdad to finish HS, he was cool.  Family pressured me to go to school in the new state, and I wanted to get as far away as possible so I went ahead.  

**TL;DR - I was a nerdy half-Asian kid growing up, no connection to Asian side of family.  Difficulty with social interactions in general.  No biological dad to talk to which bothered me frequently to the point of crying.**

**College:**

- I basically took a ton of courses and double-engineering-majored which basically killed social life beyond classmates I did projects with.  During college (and even today, still) I had difficulty with social interactions in general.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do (doctor, optometrist, work in private industry, grad school?) so I basically hunkered down hoping that something good would come.  I was also concerned about not getting a job out of college in this economy, so I tried my best in school.  (Have a good job now, at least.)

- Sometimes I would still wake up in the middle of the night freaking out about not knowing my biological father.  Spoke with several counselors in college trying to get over issues with father's absence but nothing really helped.  Still had difficulties with friendships and relationships.

- 3rd year of college, Christmas break, this girl Facebook PM's me out of the blue claiming to be the daughter of my father's best friend (lets call him Bob).  **Verified legit.**  Turns out in the last 21 years my biological father has amounted to basically nothing.  His father kept bugging him to find me, he ignored.  Tried to forget about his first son completely with a third marriage.  3rd wife conned the entire family out of nearly all of their savings.  Works as a cab driver now, and wastes whatever he does manage to save gambling in commodities markets (like stocks, basically).  I worked at an internship the following summer so *I* could pay for a plane ticket to see him the *next* Christmas break.  

- I've seen my dad twice now in China, and once when he visited for my college graduation in the US.  Roughly a total of a 3-4 month period.  He says he's proud of me, but it seems superficial.  He and Bob want me to put my financial ass on the line and sponsor him to obtain a work visa so he can work all the way across the country, in CA (I'm in northern US).  My dad has basically spent the last 2+ decades turing to waste what was once a pretty damn good living situation.  He's irresponsible, is a stimpleton that I really can't relate to, has poor manners, **essentially abandoned me**, and now wants me to lift him out of his shitty situation that he is 100% responsible for.  

**TL;DR I busted my ass from before I walked into grade school until I stepped out of college with a diploma so that I would have a better life than I grew up with.  BioDad basically erased me from his memory, turned his life into a shit hole, appears out of thin air, and now wants a successful son he's suddenly discovered to put his ass on the line for him**

**So, questions:**

1.  What can I do to get my self past having ""father"" issues, and this feeling that I don't belong... that I'm a foreigner in my own country?  I've tried just ignoring it when growing up, but it seems to come back repeatedly, contaminating my confidence in work, social interactions, relationships, and sense of self-worth.  Should I just try to man up, ignore that this ever happened, and get over it? (Hasn't worked for the last 2 decades.)  Or, is there something else I can do?
2.  Should I try extending a hand this stranger, or tell him to F-off and solve his own problems that he brought upon himself?

Thanks you guys!  End of rant.  I won't likely get around to checking back on this post until Sunday evening after work."
zl8mh,3,2012-09-09,Playing out all the mistakes. Slightly self destructive life story of how I got to where I am.,Anonimityforcourange,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/zl8mh/playing_out_all_the_mistakes_slightly_self/,"TL;DR at the bottom

Well I don't want to bother people to much but am just getting this off of my chest and looking for some kind of shared connection since I will never talk to people I know about this.

I over think things a lot and have just ended my longest relationship to date (2 years)

I know it is not long at all but I seem to be really bad at keeping girls around. I will give a quick background on everything and what situation I am in now.

I am a 23yo male and only started having relationships since I was 18.

 I had slept with a girl right after grad(first time and while I was a bit large). It went bad since I had no idea what to do and it just turned into a one night stand essentially. Three months later her friend told me she was pregnant and I began freaking out. This led on for another few months before I found out it was a joke (ha...ha...ha.......) So this made me take a step back from women for a while and focus on myself and losing weight. I lost a lot of weight quickly and gained a lot of self confidence that I lacked before. About 6 months later I met an older girl (22) then me (18) and she pursued me. I had no idea what was going on really and just ran with it. It was nice and a learned a lot about sex but nothing really matured me emotionally regarding relationships.

During this time I had met a girl at my summer job and couldn't believe how much I liked her. I ended it with the 22yo girl I was seeing for a few months and told her that I liked this other girl. I really pursued this girl from work who was 2 years younger then me and still in highschool (going Gr12) I felt something intense for her and never wanted anything so badly. I scared her off in the beggining and after 5 months of back and forth I finally asked her out and she said yes.

This was the most emotionally intense relationship I have ever had. Looking back I don't think it was real, and more of a build up of wanting her so bad and finally getting her after so much work and obsession. She was the first girl I ""loved""(Not sure anymore) and it only lasted 4 months. These were not great months and I was always getting hurt and struggling to keep her. She ended up breaking it off before grad due to many reasons, but the main one being her growing feelings for her friend. She ended it and ended up with this other guy who she is still with (but not happy)

This destroyed me. I did some really bad things for a few weeks. Contemplated suicide, listened to sad music all the time, cried a LOT, played it out in my head, harassed friends by asking about it all the time and complaining about it, etc. I started my summer job up again with her there again which made us argue a lot when working together, and make me even worse seeing her all the time.

Only a few weeks into the summer job I met a gorgeous and very happy girl who worked on contract at the facility. Being lonely and sad, I went for a rebound. I was in no emotional state to get connected again, so it just turned into sex and hanging out all the time. By the end of the summer I grew feelings for her, but she was moving across the country for school. I never told her I really liked her and even felt love developing.

I was lonely again once this new girl left for school and tried to stay in contact but it didn't seem she was very interested in me as anything more then we were.

I cycled through a few more girls over the next year and just never grew attached. I kept distance from them and made sure not to get attached. looking back I can see I sabotaged many of the relationships once I felt them getting attached.

Now when I turned 21 I was back at the same summer job but as a supervisor. I met another girl and kept my distance due to me being her boss. At the end of the summer we dated and it was going well. In the beginning I knew I was just dating her cause I knew she was interested and I just went with it. Once again I distanced and ended it once I saw her get attached. We were apart for around a month then I became lonely and got back together with her.

I only had my memory of my short intense relationship being what ""love"" is for me. So I didn't say it for a long time. I said it too soon and because the relationship was going down hill. The relationship got better but there were always bumps. Now we dated for just over two years and it just recently ended. I ended up running the summer job as the head boss for the last two years and it put a huge stress on the relationship during the months I was her boss. 

The relationship has gotten to the point where we were always fighting and just generally unhappy with each other. I began thinking of other women and wishing that she could just be like them. Things began getting awkward for me around her. For someone I loved I had no idea how to behave around her and began to doubt all my actions and interactions I had with her. She just ended the relationship and I felt nothing for the first 3-4 days. I was more happy it was over, because I can relax and not have to feel so stressed.

Now I am feeling really down and thinking about how great she was. I have matured a lot since I was 18 and realize that even though I miss her now, we won't work together. It is sad because I just can't see it working and I know I can't be what she needs, and she will be happier with someone else.

Right now I am feeling less need for the recent relationship to be back, and I am finding myself going over old footage and pictures of the happy gorgeous girl I met after my first bad break.

She is amazing and I never got a chance to tell her I liked her so much. But once again I don't know if it would work even if she lived here (she is living across the country doing an internship after her grad from university)

I really just want to have someone where it will work, and who I can trust without destroying the relationship before it even starts. I seem to have a lot of trust issues. I over think almost all of my interactions with people and have a hard time being real with someone, in fear of the outcome of what I share, and having them think differently towards me. I have a hard time dealing with rejection and even an acquaintance relationship is worth holding then letting someone I know my feelings and being rejected.

I just don't know what to do right now. I am going to focus on hobbies and getting back into shape now that I am single but as far as getting back out there I don't know if I can for a while.

If you read the entire thing, then sorry it was so long haha. I just wanted to share where I am. I am not looking for answers and suggestions but do appreciate them and want to read others input. I wish I had someone I could be honest with like this but I just feel I am a burden to them and no one wants to deal with it more then one day.

TL;DR
Just dated when I was 18. Lost virginity to a one night stand. She faked pregnancy, so I avoided girls for a bit. Dated an older woman and learned lots of sex but not emotional. met a girl at work who I was very attracted to. pursued her and ending up dating for 4 months really intensely. she fucked me up after the break. Almost right after the break met a gorgeous girl who I started to grow feelings for at the end of the summer. She moved for school. I cycled through a bunch of women over the next year. Met my last girlfriend and dated for two years. Didnt work and know it wont work between us. Have second thoughts on never telling the gorgeous girl how I felt and find myself caring more about that relationship now. Dont know what to do, or feel. I am really bad at relationships.

zl4uv,1,2012-09-08,"Isolated, alone and feeling pretty down... all for a job",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/zl4uv/isolated_alone_and_feeling_pretty_down_all_for_a/,"From February to June, I was desperately trying to find a student internship. As a civil engineering student from UoT, I realized had no almost job experience let alone one relevant to my degree. So to my luck I got an offer before my senior year. Problem is, it's for a small civil firm in the middle of nowhere in Saskatchewan with low pay and mostly office work.


Because of the necessity to actually have something on my resume before graduating, I immediately accepted the offer. The people at the office are great people, but I'm becoming extremely depressed. I had to break up with my boyfriend as he was going back to school and I was moving a province away (we both can't do long distance). Not only that but he's planning to move to the States for grad so I wouldn't even see him for another couple of years.


I'm so used to sleeping with him beside me that now I sleep on one side and can never sleep well anymore. I keep waking up, expecting him to be beside me but, no, just me by myself. I really miss him but when we saw each other for the last time (he had to go home for a month and that was when we semi-officially ended it), we were like strangers and he was acting so distant that I ended up trying to block him out of my life/avoid him completely (even though we had mutual friends and get-togethers before I left) as I was always on the verge of crying whenever I saw him acting like we never had anything.


I'm away from all my friends who are graduating this year and I'm in the middle of nowhere (there isn't even an ATM without 40 minutes of walking). I can't talk to any of my friends because they're all partying it up right now before classes start and then they'll be shut-ins working on final year projects. If I do manage to survive the year, I'm going to go back to my uni with no friends there, hardly any money to show for it and an enormous sense of loneliness.


This emptiness I'm feeling is starting to kill me inside I've only been working for 2 weeks but I'm terrified it's going to start making me a horrible employee, which would entirely defeat the purpose.


I feel so pathetic and sad."

I did an internship in the city last summer and want to move back in a few years and would love for her to enjoy the city as much as I do. Help me sell her on the city, AskNYC.

We're both working entry-level jobs but we'll be splitting the cost of the vacation. We're talking about doing a long weekend away (we live in Ohio) some time this fall, but I'm finding airfare and hotels to be fairly (and expectedly) expensive. 

Any hotel recommendations? I've looked into Sohotel, the Gershwin Hotel and quite a few others that I've stayed in before. I considered a hostel, but the idea of a romantic weekend with 5 other people in our room isn't attractive. 
Romantic, good, inexpensive things to do?

I have a few ideas, ranging from the High Line to going up into the ESB, depending on how cold it is by the time we go. I've never taken a girl out in NYC though so I don't know the good romantic spots, but I do know the city well enough to get around.

I'm trying to do this for around $600/person including airfare, hotel, food and entertainment. Hard to do, I know, but I'm pretty good at being frugal.

I figure (per person):
$150 airfare
$200 for hotel room
$40 for trains/taxis
$100 for food
$110 for entertainment/sight-seeing

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"
zohrm,8,2012-09-10,"21[M] went on two great dates with 21[F], then a series of increasingly shitty ones. ",throwaway215T,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zohrm/21m_went_on_two_great_dates_with_21f_then_a/,"Hey r/relationships, I know you give good advice and I could use some myself. I was dating a girl for a couple months, and it just fell apart. I need some help looking for answers.

I'm a 21 year old man in college, and I have no experience with women. This past spring, I met a girl in one of my classes and hit it off immediately with her. After a couple months, I asked her to hang out and smoke with me(I'm a big pot smoker) and she said sure. I texted her asking to smoke for several weekends in a row, and each time she would say she was busy, but she'd always make a rain date and she would act genuinely disappointed. 

Then one weekend, before we got a chance to smoke together, she asked me to be her date to her formal(she's in a sorority) which was a week before the semester ended. I went and we had a good time. I got pretty shitfaced(which I didn't intend to) but it wasn't like she was babysitting me or anything. We kept touching and flirting all night, and went to an afterparty together. We went back to her place, but she was falling asleep on the couch and I was hammered, so I decided to not push my luck and left for the night, especially since she kept telling me all night she wasn't a 'typical sorority slut'. I only got a hug on the way out. 

We went out once more before classes ended for the summer, the smoking date I asked her on a month ago, which went well. She completely did herself up for the date too, she had her hair done and everything. I tried apologizing for getting too drunk at her formal, but she wouldn't hear of it, so I know that wasn't the problem. She ended up inviting herself back to my place to meet my roommates, but had other plans later that night and left after like an hour(She told me that she had those plans when I picked her up earlier that night). The entire time she was at my place, I was sitting on my bed but she sat right down at my desk and didn't move. 

Then classes ended and she went home for two months. I kept up with her through texts and everything. When she got back she was starting an internship, taking online classes and going to the beach every weekend, so she was super busy. I only went out with her every couple weeks throughout the summer though. Something changed from the time classes got out to the summer starting. First, she bailed on the first date I asked her on when she got back(but I think it was cuz I picked a shitty movie). All our dates felt like first dates though, it never really went anywhere. We went out about 5 or 6 more times. I even told her that I really liked her, but couldn't tell if she was trying to nicely tell me she wasn't interested or if she was legitimately busy. Not that I thought she was lying about being busy, I wanted to make sure I wasn't bothering a girl who wasn't into me. She didn't directly tell me she liked me, but said she actually was always busy, and had never had so much to do in her life. Also, I should mention that I borrowed a textbook from her over the summer.

I always wanted to ask her back to my place after one of our dates, but she'd always throw up a roadblock at the last minute, like how she had some massive form to fill out for her boss that night, or that she had more homework or something. She'd also always find a way to avoid me walking her to her door, so I never got a chance to try and kiss her at the end of a date. Once, I took her out for dinner and then drove back to her place. She had my door open when my car was still moving and practically jumped out of my car. I figured Fuck it, she doesn't want to be with me, and I stopped talking to her.

She kept texting me and stuff though. One night she texts me asking if I wanted to hang out, and telling me she wanted to smoke too(I don't think she had in months b/c of work). When I got there, she told me that her roommates weren't there, so I had a good idea of what was going down. The entire time though, I sat in the middle of her couch, and she sat sideways on one side, resting her back on the armrest and facing me, but she kept her legs between us the entire time. I even got up to get water just so I could sit back down with my arm out to put it around her, and she sat as far away from my arm as she possibly could. We made small talk for like an hour after that, then I left.

After that, I'd texted her to hang out once or twice, and she wouldn't text me back, or text me a one word response. I think once I asked to hang out, and she didn't text me back, so I texted her again saying 'I guess not hahaha'. Pretty sure that was a mistake. A couple days later, I asked her if something was wrong and she said that we needed to talk, I was being crazy and creeping her out, and that it was hard to like me. I offered to meet up with her at a neutral, public place and she declined. She said she didn't have time for a relationship, and needed space. This was at the end of the summer, and at the time I was angry because I felt like she led me on all summer and dumped me right at the end. I assumed she was really busy and stressed out all summer, and didn't want to start a relationship at that time, but I had it in the back of my head that classes would start again in the fall and she'd have time for me. 

Last week, she asked me for that textbook back, which was strange because it was a useless textbook for a class she already passed and didn't need. I thought she would have let the book go to avoid seeing me again. I tried not to make conversation when I dropped the book off, trying to give her the space she said she wanted, and left without saying much past 'thanks for letting me use the book'. I realized though that I wasn't over her and still wanted to be with her. 
I texted her today, first asking if it was alright for me to ask her something and then I asked if she really thought I was a creep and what did I do wrong. She told me she didn't want to have that conversation. 

I really don't know what to make of this whole thing. I'm pretty sure she was in to me at some point at least, but beyond that I'm pretty much lost. I think one of a couple things happened: either it was slowly going bad the whole time but she was into me and let it slide until it was just too many little things going wrong, or I was an idiot and should have been more sexually aggressive and eventually she gave up, or it was going fine and I did something seriously wrong. Or maybe it wasn't my fault at all, but I doubt it. I could tell that the last few dates weren't going well, but I didn't know what to do to fix it because I didn't know what was going wrong. Where did I go wrong with this? I'd like to avoid making the same mistakes I did with this girl.

tl;dr I dated a girl for a couple months, she broke it off without much warning or indication. What did I do?"

I'm a 23 y.o. male born and raised here in Minnesota. I just started my last semester studying Information Technology. I'm also finishing up an internship over the next few weeks. I'm ready to be done with school and move on with the next part of my life. I can be pretty quiet until I get to know people and I've been working on that lately, this being just another step in that process. Other things you'll learn as you get to know me:

 -Love music, almost always have something playing. I lean more toward the metally/punkish/hardcore stuff, but there is also the part of me that listens to acoustic, rock, and even a bit of pop. I really need a concert buddy too. I also began trying to learn guitar this summer. 

-I do enjoy the occasional night out on the town with friends and would like to increase the frequency of that. 

-I play my share of games, and the other things that could be considered 'nerdy'.

 If you're still reading this, thanks. And if you want to know anymore I'd love to hear from you."
zna04,3,2012-09-10,I [m24] think my recently-exed girl[f21]riend is going to seriously mess up her life.,2f1090,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zna04/i_m24_think_my_recentlyexed_girlf21riend_is_going/,"We dated for around 7 months and it was fine. I wouldn't call it awesome, because she's pretty moody and very very immature.

She has this very strange habit of getting really close to guys. Even when she's dating people. She did it with her previous ex as well. No, she doesn't make out/get physical with them, but she gets EXTREMELY emotionally attached. It gets to the point where most of her conversations revolve around The Guy, and they're constantly texting. Her life starts to revolve around that person, and she starts ignoring her boyfriend.

This happened three times with her ex before me (in a span of 2 years) and then it happened thrice with me (in 7 months). Every single time, after being told what she's doing, she has broken down severely, regretted about it and been confused about WHY she can never understand when she crosses lines. Her ex was VERY cooperative in trying to make her understand, and I was even more understanding... but she's understood NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. Her behavior is EXACTLY the same, still.

She was in a different city for an internship for 2 months. In those 2 months, she got really close to a guy [24m], made out with him once, and then completely dropped him. She told me about it and I guess it happened because she craved something physical, and then she dropped him because of the intense guilt. This is the only time she got physical with someone not her boyfriend. I'm sure of that.

A few weeks later, she got really close to another guy [27m] at her workplace. Here's the serious bit -- this guy is married (been married for a year only). He has a very troubled marriage, his wife seems to not give any shits about him, apparently doesn't come home a lot of nights etc. Again, my gf got REALLY close to him. It doesn't take much to guess that the troubled married guy got an outlet for everything. They text all day, video chat on Skype countless number of times. I happened to read an email she sent to him, and it made it very clear that they were having an affair.

More than being shattered, I was and am shit scared out of my wits. OK, she cheated on me twice. OK, we're done. But I know her inside out. She's a kid. She's immature, she's under-confident, she's very very unsure of what she's doing, and has no idea where her life is going. I can decide to forget her, which will take very little effort, but I can't bring myself to do it. Anything could happen with the married guy. If word gets out, if Guy goes for divorce, the affair could spill out and it would destroy her. She comes from a normal family and it would end up destroying her family as well. Already, people around her suspect something strange is going on. And considering how ""soft"" her personality is, I wouldn't count out self-physical-harm either. She has no ""best friends"" that she can take advice/help from. Really, she's broken in every manner possible.

Note: I am the only one who knows the full story. No other friend or family member does. I haven't shared this with anyone either.

Reddit, I don't know what to do. I really don't. If there's anything that will make her understand or realise what she's doing, I'd be willing to try it. I don't care if she hates me for her entire life, but I'll be happier with her hating me and having an OKAY life, than having NO life at all.

**tl;dr: Ex-girlfriend has crazy habit of getting emotionally attached to random guys, is now having an secret affair with a guy who is in a troubled marriage. She's an ex, but I want to, if possible, drill sense in her head and not see her destroy her and her family's life.**"
zn9gr,1,2012-09-10,I.T. certification,[deleted],universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/zn9gr/it_certification/,"Hi guys,
so here's a deal , i graduated from UoA a few months ago, degree in CompSci.

Been applying for jobs ever since. Got 1-2 interviews,  ..one being recently , still waiting for news , but it's been a week so i'm guessing that's off the table.  (they had me sit a test, 3 questions on web services and array/loops ..i got 2/3 correct)


I'm interested in web dev /programming ( C# , .NET , JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, HTML/CSS , ASP.NET , Web Services).
Right now i'm also doing some self learning, but it's hard to find good material with clear precise instructions online on stuff like ASP.NET...and MVC.

Books in library are even more outdated.

So 2012 for me will most likely be a bust year, but there's still 3 months left of it ....and i don't wanna waste it too much .

I've been discussing with my parents and they suggested getting a certification.

But i've looked around geekzone, and people are saying getting certs like MCTS  or MCICTP  etc etc doesn't help if you're just getting ""your foot in the door"" and that it's more suitable for people who's already working in IT and their employers want them to get a certificate.

Can you guys experienced (and seasoned dare i say) IT people give me advice ?

As far as NCEA LV3 (graduated high school)  and a Bachelor of CompSci from UoA.....i have Zero work experience ...i never had a part time job in high school or uni (subway etc etc) ........and i don't even have a referee. I feel like hs dip and Bach degree is nothing without those exp.

Should i get a random ""flippin burgers"" PT jobs to help my CV ?   i doubt it tho ...i dunno, confused right now.

Last night i went to the AMES IT website , and looked at their certs,
The only one i'm kinda interested in is  "" MCTS - ASP.NET &amp; Web application  (microsoft certified tech specialist)   ...it's 12 weeks , ends in december-ish , cost  ...$5300 ..( Ughhh)    , teaches asp.net, javascript ...and gets you the certification test.

what i wanna ask is , is it useful ? is ames any good or as **** as people "" say""  ? .....   Microsoft's USA site says "" MCTS has ended development, but those with the certificates are still recognized ""  ......i don't wanna be getting a cerfiticate from a program that has been discontinued ....why are ames stil offering it ?
The test itself is like a written-exam right ?  i did that alot in UNI,  very little practical stuff .....employers prefer practical exp vs written knowledge right.

I don't even know how to get a java certification in NZ ...who offers it.

I know some people just learn on their own from various sources and just book a test at that ""pro.somethingsomething"" test center in Auckland .... $100 or something as opposed to 5K .......but i can't find a thorough step by step tutorial on ASP.NET , MVC, javascript online that's decently good.
And no way of knowing what's in the test..........


I""m more than willing to work for free for 2 weeks or as part of an internship on any company in Auck if need be.  at this point, the experience is more important than $$ ....i'm not focused on that at all right now.

so,  ...help a brother out ?"

zn5cb,3,2012-09-10,Has anything like this happened anywhere else?,xistag,Staples,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staples/comments/zn5cb/has_anything_like_this_happened_anywhere_else/,"Well, I've been snooping around this subreddit quite a bit tonight but I figured I might as well add this to the stack.

I am a CP Associate that started at my store in May of this year. I told them up front that I have an internship I would be leaving for five weeks after my hire date but that once I was back I would plan on being there for a while. (the internship was 8 weeks). Even with this, they hired me on and put me in front of a computer for training the next week.But once the computer training was over, I pretty much got slaped behind the counter and told good luck.
I was so confused. The computer modules only cover so much of the job. As far as customer service, I am used to it. I've worked in customer service related positions for about 5 years now, not to mention Disney for nine of those. Naturally I had questions most of the day, but any time I had a question I was ridiculed for how I dealt with the customer or how unprofessional I was. I didn't know how to take this because it's not like I don't know how to be professional. I am simply not trained as much as I would like to be. So I started asking co-workers instead of managers. That only made matters worse. It turns out the way they have been doing things is /also/ the wrong way to do it, only leading to more riddicule and when I tried to say that it was how someone else was doing it, they did not believe me. So all in all I felt stuck.

About a week before I left for my internship, I had a day this is difficult to shake from memory. The events leading up to this are hazy, but I was completing an order of 50 full sheet letter size laminations when my manager came up and said they wanted to have a discussion with me. At this point I knew they were going to tell me yet again how I've done something wrong, but it was different. They were now telling me that they don't think I am a very good fit for Staples and that I should consider whether or not I want to continue working here. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and it grit a deep hole inside of me that day. 
A bit of background info would be that my major is related to what is done inside the department. I took the job (and the pay cut hopping over to this job) in order to better myself and gain experience with the terminology involved. The equipment and the functions involved are second nature to me, but I feel that my manager has become the source of a lot of judgementalism and any time they are around me now I tense up and get nervous, because it is in that moment that everything I am doing is wrong. Sometimes as far as undoing anything I had learned in college relating to print.

Well regardless of that day, I worked there a couple more days and then went to my internship. I came back to find my nametag had been taken off of my apron. I inquired about it and the managers there had no clue about it but gave me what seemed like a ready made nametag, but this was different. This one no longer said ""Copy Print Associate"" it now read ""Sales Associate"". To make a long story short, since that time (about a month now), i have been doing small jobs around the store, not even allowed to go anywhere near copy and print. Anytime I try to help minimize a line or even print a job I am told to go back to what I was doing. I feel like I'm being corralled like a retard and this has made my job that much more of a hell for me. I can't tell you guys how much I feel out of my element now. 

So I must ask, if there are any tips you guys might have for my situation or anything. I've been asking my GM for an explanation but all he is telling me are unspecific remarks about ""cross-training"". But they sound more like dodgey answers than anything real. I've gone as far as asking if I will be back in copy and print anytime soon. I have yet to get a yes or a no. :/"

""Potential Girlfriend"" problem.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zmu3y/i_need_advice_from_you_potential_girlfriend/,"So the story is that i [M/22] met a girl  [F/22] this summer whom i've known for a while we went on 2 dates and it went amazingly good like we hit off directly and we have so much in common it is driving me crazy!

Now the problem is that this girl happens to live about 400 miles away form me and she is probably going away maybe even further for an internship for the next 6 months... 

When she got back to school after we had our dates and such we continued to chat and it was all happy and dandy untill she started school again and we started talking a little bit less everyday and she got more and more work on her shoulders although we still chat almost everyday.

but the last weeks has been hell for me emotionally because i may have fallen completley in love with this girl and i think she knows and she has been a little off and i really wanted to know how she felt about me since i felt so stupid writing to her all the time with me being the one to always write her and not vice-versa made me feel desperate and unsecure... So anyway we have a good friend in common and i asked him to talk with her to kinda get a grip of how she felt about me ( i didnt ask myself because i did not want to put any emotional pressure on her, since she is already fed up with the workload and is stressed out) he then told me she had said ""i really like him but maybe not in the same way right now ( basically he is awesome and i like him but for now i just want to be friends with him"") and that made me really sad and confused... ""right now""? what does that mean? i understand the circumstances for a possible relationship is horrible but if the feelings are there form both parties its still possible..

So what i got out from that was that she likes me and there may be potential between us but under these circumstances with the long distance and her internship and workload she dosnt really have time for a relationship!?  

My questions are: Should i just chat with her and ""stay friends"" or should i just give it up and try to forget about her for the moment being?

If i stay friends with her i fear that she would just start seeing me as a friend and the romance we had would never come to be again (friend-zoned?) or if i stop talking to her and try to be more passive maybe to the spring when she gets back home ( where i live ) i could ask her out again? (and start ""fresh"")?

I'm a 23 y.o. male born and raised here in Minnesota. I just started my last semester studying Information Technology. I'm also finishing up an internship over the next few weeks. I'm ready to be done with school and move on with the next part of my life. I can be pretty quiet until I get to know people and I've been working on that lately, this being just another step in that process. 

Other things you'll learn as you get to know me:

-Love music, almost always have something playing. I lean more toward the metally/punkish/hardcore stuff, but there is also the part of me that listens to acoustic, rock, and even a bit of pop. I really need a concert buddy too. I also began trying to learn guitar this summer. 

-I do enjoy the occasional night out on the town with friends and would like to increase the frequency of that.

-I play my share of games, and the other things that could be considered 'nerdy'. 

If you're still reading this, thanks. And if you want to know anymore I'd love to hear from you.

zmm82,13,2012-09-09,Will I ever find a job that I enjoy?,searchinbrownie,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/zmm82/will_i_ever_find_a_job_that_i_enjoy/,"I'm a recent grad from an average city school in the Midwest. I majored in Econ and Political Science and graduated Cum Laude with a 3.5 GPA. I've taken some challenging econ courses (econometrics, forecasting) but I feel like a BA hasn't gotten me anywhere. I come from a low to middle class background. When I first started college, my first two years consisted of going to the gym and going to parties. I never got involved in any clubs, volunteering, or internships. 

The summer after my sophomore year, I did a study abroad in Africa studying history. The summer after my junior year, I volunteered tutoring poor, uneducated people who were trying to get their GED and as a counselor for urban youth in the inner city. During my last year, I was a development intern at a non profit for two days a week for an entire year. Although I met some cool people, I feel like I didn't really do much with this stuff and didn't learn any important skills. 

Now I'm stuck at home with my parents and I can't find a full-time salaried job. 
I want to work in Research/Public Policy but I can't get any of those kinds of jobs. After months of searching, mostly on idealist, I landed two research related internships in Washington D.C. They were both really awesome, but were unpaid and I couldn't afford to spend anymore money. 

I hate when people ask me what I'm doing all the time, especially my extended family. I feel like I've fucked up because most of my friends and cousins are already making bank. I don't want to work in corporate because its not me and I don't have the experience. I also can't afford to go back to school. I didn't go to an ivy league school and my resume is not that exciting. People have told me to join the peace corps or the marines but I want to stay and help my parents with the mortgage and car loans.

Can I find a job with the skills I have? What can I do? Will I ever get an actual salary doing something I really enjoy? I've tried networking, finding unpaid stuff near me, and learning more skills online, but it all seems pointless. I can't focus, i'm not motivated, and I wish I was in grade school again. I'm frustrated and sometimes depressed. Is there any hope? HELP!

We share a genetic condition so we see each other every two years at the national convention for this specific condition. This year I find out that she thinks I am very cute and I start to look at her less as a friend I see every once in a while at these things, and instead as a possible fuck buddy. We bang at the con and it was a fantastic time, and then spend the next month trading texts and phone calls. At the time I knew it was infatuation, and I was also just getting out of a relationship so I was really just looking for someone to have fun with not a serious relationship. A few weeks after the convention I spend the weekend at her place and after starting to actually get to know her I realize that this girl is a great fit for what I am looking for in a relationship, and start developing feelings for her. We continue to talk and text and it seems that she is developing similar feelings for me. Fast forward a bit and she is starting grad school, we both knew that realistically because of the distance between us and the amount of time she was going to need to spend focused on school a relationship wouldn't be a good idea because one of us would start to feel neglected or feel like they were neglecting the other person and it would go down hill and as we both want a relationship between us to actually work long term we weren't willing to try distance and fail. So we continue being FWB and things are good right? 

Well the last visit was a strange one. The last couple times I have been to visit her, we are very couple-y and almost acting as if we are dating, yet this time she would swing from acting like that to 5 minutes later being very firm about the fact that she can't date me right now, and that she isn't perfect for me, and I should go out and try to date other people to make sure that I find exactly what I want, and not just her because this is easy and fun. Every time I reassured her that I understand the boundaries and expectations of the relationship, and that yes I would love to eventually get together with her because even though she isn't perfect (but honestly who is) she is a much better match than any other girl I have been with, and with us both having the same genetic condition we both completely understand a big part of eachother's life that no one on the ""outside"" will ever be able to fully understand. It just feels like when I am not there it is easy to put me and her feeling for me aside, but then the moment I show up it all comes rushing back and she is almost trying to talk herself out of liking me because she doesn't want to get hurt / hurt me. And to complicate things even more, I have managed to fall completely head over heels in love with this girl (though I haven't told her that much yet). 

It is just hard because I am trying to be easy and put no pressure on her, yet at the same time maintain some presence (for instance every morning when I wake up I text her good morning beautiful because I know that if I can make her smile first thing in the morning the stress of the day will be just bit less) but trying to be careful because I don't want to smother her and then get pushed away completely. In the long run I can deal with her not loving me back, I can deal with us giving a relationship a shot and it not working out, but I just don't want to lose her in my life. In one month I managed to get into 2 serious accidents (neither were my fault, but that is another story), and breakup with someone I had been dating for 4 years, not to mention a few other personal issues and she was there through all of it being the one thing I could completely count on. Seeing texts from her or hearing her ringtone could instantly pull me out of the worst mood and put me into an amazing one. I guess I am just worried that if I continue to be easy and put no pressure on this that there is the possibility that a classmate or fellow intern could swoop in and steal this girl from me, but if I put pressure on it to do distance (even though I would spend basically every weekend at her place because it is a 45 minute plane ride and financially I can afford that) until my lease is up and I can move closer to her I am scared that I could loose her that way too. 

**TL:DR** 
Became FWB with girl I have known for a long time. Between distance and school she doesn't want a relationship but even though she has feeling for me. I fell head over heels in love with her, and am now worried that if I continue to be laid back that I will lose her to someone else, but if I put pressure on it I will lose her because she will push me away completely.

About two weeks ago, I applied to an internship for a finance oriented magazine. The managing editor got in touch with me within three days of sending my resume, and we had a phone interview and she asked me to write a sample, pitching a couple stories and whatnot. After that, I had another phone interview with the editor of the markets/wall street division and that went pretty well, and he asked me to write another writing sample, summarizing three, long, analyst reports. I sent it to him sunday and haven't heard back. I guess my question is, is the interviewing process usually this long for a fall internship? Also, to get an internship with a magazine, do they usually need so many writing samples? Sorry if I sound impatient, I'm just really nervous and I really want that job! Any advice would be great.

zqf9b,7,2012-09-11,MD Independent Senate Candidate could spice up the  race,FGGF,baltimore,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/zqf9b/md_independent_senate_candidate_could_spice_up/,"Hello fellow Marylanders

While watching TV the other day I saw an ad for Rob Sobhani, an independent running for senate. I didn't really care much for the senate race, Cardin and Bongino are both run of the mill democrats and republicans, and Cardin is favored to win by a long shot. Cardin has voted with his party around 97% of the time, been in politics for 40 years, and Bongino who's funding is dwarfed by Cardin's was recently endorsed by Sarah Palin. So I started looking into Sobhani and have been pleasantly surprised that he seems to be a really serious candidate with resources and decently thought out plans. I'm disappointed too that there is little coverage of his candidacy from the local mainstream media, though you'd think they would find it would add a bit of excitement to the race. So I did a bit of research myself to get people a bit more excited for their senate race

- He's an academic, taught at Georgetown, writes lots of op eds, is a Middle East expert, and owns a company specialized in infrastructure, green energy, and consulting.
- His 5 point plan is to marry Maryland to the international market by seeking private funds in the billions for roads and bridges, reconstruction of homes in Baltimore, cancer/alzheimer research, exports, and internships for low-income students. 
- He's big on promises: won't seek more than 2 terms and promises to not run for a 2nd term if he doesn't keep his promises.

His plans raise a lot of questions so I hope that they will release more information soon and that other media will pick up so we can learn more. 

Looking at the pitiful state of Congress, we need to support independent candidates even in states like Maryland. He looks to be moderate, a lot less focused on social issues and much more on economic/business ones. If somehow he can bring in all that money from private funds rather than increasing further our debt, why not ?

Thoughts ? I've included a blog right under which provides a pleasant read.

A lot of the books that I read aren’t worth mentioning; most get caught in the sieve. Some, however, make it through, and a few of these selections I've had the [mis]fortune of reading. One of my colleagues saw Danson’s novel advertised in the July issue of Mother Jones (which was my first red-flag) and recognized the endorsees, so he asked me to take a look.

I am not exactly sure about what passes for literature up in Canada, but I know, with great certainty, that something like Faultline 49 will be shot down in the United States of America. Whether you’re a lawyer in New York or a rancher in Texas or a member of the Hollywood intelligentsia, you know that some things are best left untouched. 9/11 is one of them. From the pitch letter, I gathered that Faultline 49’s apparently off to a hot start in sales, in Canada, anyway. This makes this an urgent matter.

You don’t want this poisoning the minds and dispositions of our youth and those not inoculated against the Left’s hateful propaganda. 

David Danson says he is trying to better understand the ramifications of OUR tragedy, but what’s there left to understand? And who understands better than we true Americans? He’s not even really American, I don’t think. And he may well have lived in the US, but that doesn’t reserve for him the right to spew this filth. It now makes sense that his original publisher dropped him for “differences of opinion.”

Recontextualizing our history for whatever purpose – well-intentioned or nay – can be informative, but here it's simply a heinous act. World War Z was fine and fun: that was zombies. The West Wing had Sheen in the White House. Not bad. It is bad, however, to mislead our children, challenge our global aspirations, and question our politics in a time of economic dithering and international strife. It’s an entirely different thing to dig up the past in order to throw dirt on the present.
Why go to lengths to band together to boycott a book, when, as 
Americans, we should value free speech, regardless of the content? 

Chomsky, though “reflexively anti-American” isn’t a threat, nor is Buren or this Danson fellow, right? And even if they were, their message is less hate speech, and more revisionist history and misdirection. Why get fussed? A book is just a book. If people are feeble minded enough to be bent or misguided by ink and paper, then they can be manipulated by anybody or anything… 

Mein Kampf. Mao’s little red book. The Anarchist’s Cookbook. Books are capable of more than entertainment and passing the time. 
To ban is to violate the positive liberties of the writer and the would-be audience. To permit violent, regressive ideologies to prevail, on the other hand, is to threaten America with the imposition of foreign restrictions. 

A boycott – the willing and formal avoidance of a particular title seems the best course of action. We have a special role as citizens of a country with a moral conscience. Faultline 49, like the other books on our list, is more than immoral – it’s anti-American. I don’t give a damn if Danson means well. He’s gone about it all wrong. As a just and moral JUDEO-CHRISTIAN nation, it is our job NOT TO SUPPORT this book. 

MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA If you didn’t encounter it, fantastic. If you do, ignore it. IF the filth’s not permeated the border, then forget this old soothsayer’s warnings. Don’t buy Faultline 49. Spend your money on patriotic American literature. In these trying times, the last thing we need is more inane criticism. God bless America.

zpv5s,11,2012-09-11,To those applying for the College Program in Spring: Some tips and advice for the phone interview.,puapsyche,wdwcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wdwcp/comments/zpv5s/to_those_applying_for_the_college_program_in/,"Put together from stuff DIS people and I wrote on college program. I did my CP Spring Advantage 2011 and applied, interviewed for, and am now on a Professional Internship.

**HOW TO MAKE A LIST OF THINGS TO SAY IN THE INTERVIEW**
1. Think of the roles you want to apply for. Doesn't matter what it is, just think of the roles.

2. Identify what makes someone THE BEST at that role. Not just good, the best. What does the picture perfect cast member look like? If you want to be a Fairy Godmother in training, what in your mind is a perfect FGiT?

3. Think of that list of traits and qualities, and then think of how many of those you exemplify or that experience has given you. For example, if you're applying for Concierge and you know Concierge folk have to be friendly and welcoming, and you've gotten lots of experience and were told you were definitely friendly and welcoming, that's a good thing. Write it down.

4. Now you have a list of things YOU'RE good at that match what the PICTURE PERFECT CAST MEMBER is good at. It may not match completely, but that's OK. You now want to remember stories of your experiences- what was one EXCEPTIONAL time that you displayed the traits you know you're good at? If you're having trouble, try thinking back to times you had to deal with difficult Guests/customers, and situations like those where you handled it well. Remember several of these stories, and write them down. The more the better.

5. Practice recalling these stories out loud until they are natural. 

6. You're all set. Now all you have to do is, whenever they ask a question of you, see if you can answer the question by steering the conversation in the direction of your experiences. 

**QUESTIONS SOMEONE WAS ASKED DURING THEIR INTERVIEW**

1. We talked about my past work experience and she asked which job that I’ve had has been my favorite. 

2. The ever important why you want to work for Disney and if I’d ever consider working full time with Disney. This is definitely something you’re going to want to have an answer prepared for as it is always asked. I was also asked if I had a favorite park or attraction. 

3. Would you rather work in groups or independently? 

4. How would you describe your work pace?

5. She of course asked what my top 3 roles were and asked if I would be interested in adding custodial or housekeeping. She made a comment about how I had a good long list of roles at the beginning of the interview. This really made me nervous even though she said there was no right or wrong answer and after I said no, she just said ok and we moved on. It’s quite common for interviewers to ask if you’re willing to add roles such as QSFB or housekeeping to your checklist as these are roles that require a lot of people but not many people want. If you really don’t want to do them, don’t be afraid to say no. I said my top 3 were Attractions, Merchandise, and Character Attendant. 

6. Why do you want to be a character attendant?

7. What have you done in your past jobs where you’ve made a guest feel special?

8. How would I instill Disney magic from beginning to end at the entrances? Or something like that. This was a question directed towards Main Entrance Operations.

9. Do you have any cash handling experience? I mentioned working at a fast food restaurant at the beginning and after asking this she was like, “Oh at Culvers’, right?” 

10. She asked about my experience speaking in front of groups and how it makes me feel. I mentioned most of my experience was from presentations in class so she asked what the longest speech I’ve had to memorize was. 

11. She also asked how I’d feel about doing a job that was repetitive. Then she asked what I’d do if I was interrupted while giving a speech or something."

Recently, in one of the administration meetings I have attended to with my supervisor, I heard a lot of talk about the waiver Obama recently approved for certain states that were considered at risk for not meeting the unrealistic academic standards outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act. There was a lot of talk about the repercussions that would have ensued if the waiver had not been granted, one of them being that the principal would have been replaced despite the fact that he has literally put all of his efforts into obtaining better testing results. It seemed to me that the pressure of reaching the results outweighed the teacher’s concerns of attending to each student and their individual needs. I read the NCLB act this last weekend, and still feel like I don’t fully understand/have all the info....so, I would love to hear thoughts about the pros, cons, or whatever anyone feels may be helpful to me to better understand this policy.

Never really wanted to have a family or anything, I've had other boyfriends but never had the urge to ""start"" anything...
My current boyfriend is everything I've ever wanted in a guy and more and a senior in engineering at the same school. The very moment I met him (online) we clicked and are both democrats and atheists. We have late night talks on quantum physics and he has helped me kill a lot of the demons of my past. He treats me really well and gave me flowers and running supplies for my birthday (I'm an avid runner). Never forces me into anything, waited a good two months just to have sex. He supports me in everything and over the summer I supported him a lot through his summer internship. We've been ""involved"" for six months, seriously dating for four. 
My dreams used to be pretty much solely getting a job at Google and/or a beach house but now those are mixed with marrying him/getting pregnant.. which freaks me out to no end. I'm not ready for these urges :( Especially since he already has a career and I'm just starting out.
Is this a life stage I am entering, or is it just something I'm going through after finally finding a partner that I really get along with... will it go away? anyone here gone through the same thing?

From 2009 to 2011 I had a very busy job abroad, resulting into very little time/energy to play and improve in SC2. I was low silver back then. Moved back to the US early 2012, took 4 months off from work and played SC2 a lot! Went from low Silver to Top 8 Platinum in 2 months.

Went back to work in May and played my first SC2 game since then a few weeks ago. Dropped to Gold League yesterday. Now I'm sluggish, forgetful and making stupid mistakes that I wasn't back in May.

I work 40-45hrs/week at my day job, 8-16hrs/week at my internship and 20+hrs/week on film sets/editing. I get about 5-10hrs/week of SC2 time, but I'm so tired and out of practice, my performance is just really bad now. What do you guys suggest I do to get back up to par and continue to improve? My ultimate goal is to get into Diamond.

TL; DR: How do I keep improving at SC2 with a busy work schedule?"

I have good reason to believe that I have the potential to become an excellent developer, but I have little means to prove it at present. I imagine that in an ideal world I would have a GitHub full of completed personal projects to show off, but having Asperger's syndrome makes it hard for me to motivate myself to invent and complete a project in an unstructured environment. The same traits that hinder me when trying to code in my spare time will prove desirable to an employer, such as my desire to work under pressure.

What I would love would be for a London employer to ""adopt"" me by giving me a reasonably structured project to complete for them for free in order to demonstrate my potential, with a look to subsequently being offered an internship (though if that weren't possible I'd still be happy for the boost that the project would provide to my CV).

If any representative of a London employer is reading this (I figure you must be pretty open-minded anyway if you're browsing this part of Reddit), then please consider sending me a PM to talk about this. I am eager to realise my potential with you."

But the past 3 weeks I've been very strict with my diet and have successfully been 100% paleo! And although I'm seeing the benefits such as weight loss, more energy, and less toilet time, I have been experiencing the worst stomach issues. I feel nauseous way more frequently, go through dizzy spells, and such severe stomach cramps that I need to lie down.

I was just wondering if anyone else has gone through this? I really hope it's temporary. I'm getting at least 1200 calories a day, and since beginning my internship that is from 9-5 everyday, my diet is essentially the same each day:

Breakfast = piece of fruit paired with almonds

Lunch = large salad with tomatoes, onions, peppers, cucumbers, and a hard boiled egg

a stir fry containing chicken sausage with peppers and onions

Dinner = piece of fruit paired with baked chicken breast

Any advice or stories of the same issue would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

We were speaking about whats good here and out of everything I mentioned Opie and Anthony. To me it is that important as I have been listening since I was ten. I compiled a list of links so that he can enjoy the show and not get confused with who is who, and to ease his learning the many personalities on the O&amp;A show.

[Anthony Cumia](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Anthony)- One half of the Duo. Hilarious gun advocate and ""Racist""


[Greg ""Opie"" Hughes](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Opie) AKA ""Opie the Destroyer""- The other half of the Duo. Father with another on the way, he is the more radio savvy host. Many hate him for his complaining about the industry. But he serves a pivotal role on the show.



[Jim ""Yimmy"" Norton-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Jimmy) Stand up comic and lovable third wheel. This Tranny loving mush brings many characters to the show such as Chip Chipperson and Paul Hargis the pedophile old man.


[Primetime Sam Roberts-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Primetime_Sam_Roberts) Corporate good guy and cheapskate. He remains one of the few people working at XM that are good at their job. When opie and anthony are gone and dead, this man will rise and wear the XM radio crown. This much he is destined for.


[DJ Troy Quan-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Troy_Quan) You know that guys that is WAY too old to be living the clubbing lifestyle, drinking, partying out and fucking all the ladies, but does it any way? That's Troy Quan in a nutshell.


[Danny Ross-](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Danny) My personal favorite guy working with Opie and Anthony. He is a heavy drinker, porn lover, flesh light duel-wielding fella. He is a frequent drinking buddy for Anthony Cumia. He is superior to Sam Roberts when it comes to finding pictures and videos for O&amp;A to talk about, but sadly works more in technical and production. He occasionally comes around.


[Eric ""EROCK"" Nagel](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Erock) AKA Sex Bagel, AKA Hawk, AKA Hogey Boy, AKA Lazy- This self destructive but lovable oaf is a Senior producer for O&amp;A. He is also the ass of every joke under the son as he ""Is a fat lazy mess"" Not much to say, but I pity the man.


[Travis](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Travis) AKA ""Doctor Gay""- Travis is a former intern and now permanent staff member of The Opie and Anthony Show. He often makes homosexual statements in various show promos and is goofed on for being a little too feminine in nature. That was copied from the wiki... as I could not come up with much to say about him myself. He is consistent, and helpful. I'd be sad if he died in a car crash. His wife is also gorgeous... why can't I find one like that.

[Club Soda Kenny](http://www.oapedia.com/index.php/Club_Soda_Kenny)- Ex-cop and current security for O&amp;A. He is a big man, who is very set in his way of doing things. He wears vomit colored suits and looks like he has a tiny doberman head.

This is most if not all of the crew on Opie and Anthony. Feel free to comment if i missed anything important. Hope you guys enjoy!"
zr03r,5,2012-09-12,"Needing to raise rates, but finding myself in a wonderful situation",[deleted],videography,https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/zr03r/needing_to_raise_rates_but_finding_myself_in_a/,"Allow me to present to you the story of a college videographer who found himself working with people that he could only dream about...

He started out his sophomore year with nothing but a cheap camcorder, limited knowledge, and embarrassingly low rates. As a matter of fact, he only charged $150 for his first few videos! 

Here's the catch: those videos were made for a song-writer and producer who's a major player in the country music business, his wife who just got signed to a major Christian label, and a song-writer for a few famous names that just opened his own publishing company. 

This led him to a point where he landed among some of the greats, and he went on to spend his summer as an ""intern"" at a record label in exchange for the chance to produce videos with some major artists (which he actually listens to on a regular basis). Granted, this wasn't all he earned – he got a full three-hour credit and marvelous resume material as well.

Time went on that summer, and he began charging $500 per video. During this time, he got a chance to work with one of the industry's best stylists and an artist from The Voice. Now he's a junior, and he's set to shoot an artist from Sony next week. He also just got done producing an $8000 music video for a country artist, and even though that is low-budget in the big picture, it's still pretty awesome.

His dilemma:

He discovered that in the grand scheme, $500 per video doesn't cut it. 20% of it goes to his yearly business expenses... 30% of what's left needs to go to taxes... In the end, he would be left with very little per video.

Worst of all, he's not getting a ton of work yet. However, his name is getting out there, and he's already got a few good gigs under his belt. He's at a point where he can hire if the money is available, so just bear in mind that this isn't the typical college scenario where he makes about $50 for shooting a video of his friend's band...  

Most individuals his age only work as PAs with these kinds of artists. In his case, he's producing and directing them at age 20. (Well, he turns 21 in about an hour.) It's a wonderful opportunity, but yes, he's aware that he's being slightly taken advantage of.

However, he's stuck in this situation: he doesn't charge hourly for his editing, his flat rate isn't enough to live on right now, and he knows that artists realistically do not have the budget to spend on sporadic video content like he offers. (After working at a record label, he saw the actual budget for some things.)

He plans on starting an LLC in the next two months, but his future looks bleak since there is not super consistent work right now. That's maybe two to three big projects a month, so that's only $700ish income for a month. If he raises his rates, he may lose the bigger name clients. If he keeps his rates like they are, he will be taking a huge risk. If things go well, he graduates with a harem of even bigger clients under his belt that are willing to pay more. If things go bad, he graduates with a few cool things to his name, semi-consistent work, but a low income.

With that said, I'm tired of referring to myself in the third person. I'd really like to raise my rates, but I don't know if I should while I'm at this stage. What would you do in my situation (age 20, naïve, and apprehensive about everything)?

By the way, I've no longer got the cheap camcorder... Up to a Canon 60D, Canon T4i, and a Panasonic AC130. Woo-hoo.

As a note, I'm aware that I am no-where near where I would like to be as far as talent and technical knowledge goes. I learn from whoever I can however I can. Most of my peers know more than me. I just may have found myself in a decent situation.

A lot of this also stems from the ignorance of how video rates work. Not mine. Mostly clients."

please help. what is the best way through which i can move to canada?

from the research i have done it seems like my two options are obtaining a study permit and enrolling in an academic program for two years so i can qualify for the experience class immigration program or be sponsored for employment by a canadian employer. I have a B.A in English Language and Literature from U.Va and have 2 years worth of solid internship experience in some of the best NGOs and Think Tanks in Washington, DC.

No idea how to approach this, really need input.",dreamsofastronomy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ztzz3/heading_into_long_distance_again_with_many/,"Hey everyone,

So my girlfriend and I have been togerther 1.5 years now. Out this 11 months were long distance where she was away on internships and travelling.
We´ve always had our problems in the past since the setup was really difficult to begin with. But we were both determined to pull through. She was in a different city for 6 months where I visited her every 2 weeks for long weekends. we talked on the phone everyday and got into small fights which eventually ended in us agreeing that the problem was that one thought he/she was more in love than the other. 
My family was often a problem in that i get along with her family really well but sort of shielded her from my family because my father is an egocentric alcoholic and my mother can be reall ydifficult although I hold a decent relationship with her.

From February until June my gf was home for almost 4 months. it took some adjusting but we ended up in a really good spot before she went to south america for 2.5 months. This is where things went really out of hand. At the airport she had cried her eyes out because she dreaded leaving me again and going onto the plane. I told her that I loved her and was sure she would have a great time. She was scared I was going to forget her or cheat (I have never ever given her any reason to believe this, have always been very faithful and loyal, justz talked too much about my ex the first 2 months which I stopped once we talked about how it annoyed her). When she went away to travel I was feeling really secure about our relationship and was just genuinely happy for her. While she was away I spent quite some time with friends and went on weekend trips. But I made sure to write her an email every day. We skyped twice but it was really difficult to understand her so I was not incredibly keen on doing that regularily. But I did enjoy seeing her. 

Things went okay for the first few weeks. Or so I thought. Messages with kisses and sweetly written. taling about missing each other and so forth.
however when she went on to Ecuador after one month things went bad. she stopped responding and just wrote 4 liners without any form of sincerity. Also there were pictures of here partying almost every night and in the arms of different guys. I got extremely sad and jealous and didnt know how to react. I didnt want to escalate into a fight so far away so I just really didnt say much, which I regret now.

Anyway she comes back 3 weeks ago and is a) really sick (coughing that turned into pneumonia) and b) very very distant and cold, harsh even.
She told me how she met all these inspirational people nad had so much fun time with them. I had just been here writing my masters thesis and didnt have much new to tell. Seh told how she met all these super muscular guys (I am somewhat skinny). she also mentioned how she had the feeling some of the people she met now knew her better than I do. She was also much more annoyed of me not being able to remember details of her stories or my clumsiness (has been an issue before and I´m trying to do better but its difficult). Eventually I had lost almost all of my self-esteem and security and cried many times in front of her. She said I am not as fascinating as I used to be and am pressuring her way too much and that it´s stressing her.
And I have been too quick to bring everything back to normal before even discussing what had really gone wrong.
She eventually even had to go to the hospital for a week. And I left her in peace due to her request for a few days. I did however send flowers and cupcakes to her which she really appreciated.


Eventually we had a big fight and talked about it all.
She said she missed me so incredibly much in the first weeks aways and thought i didnt care. Seh was also really disappointed that I didnt want to skype and said that many others she knew skyped with their SOs on daily basis. She also said that she was so pissedat me after one month that she just decided to go do her own thing and not care about it so much. Obviously showing me the cold shoulder.

and although some may think she might have cheated, I do not think so and didn´t ask. i do think she was quite attracted to some of the guys she met. i always try to make a point to leave her to her freedom and not become too jealous. But this was really upsetting. I feel betrayed but still dont think she cheated.

I told her I was really mad for her bahving so shitty towards me and she appologized. i agreed to talk about when something is bothering me. We were ok for 2 days and had good sex, cuddling and so forth. 

However we quickly got into a fight again when I was so ""unattentive"" and forgot to dispose the condom wrapper in her room before I left and her mom saw it  (how old are we?!). 
Arrgh she just gets annoyed at so many things I say. In my head i always think about what i say next so that she ownt make a snide remark.

She left this tuesday to go study in France (We live in germany) for 9 months. I made it super clear that I want to stay together and would come and see ehr 5 days a month (I have a really great well paying job which lets me allocate my holidays flexibly). I told her I still loved her very much. She however says she doesn´t understand why I only just now love her so much now and not earlier. She herself says she isn´t sure of her feelings towards me anymore at this point. Saying she had always said that I was her one big love and outshone anything before (true, she did say this often) and she was always disappointed that I couldn´t make this statement too (I have been in 2 3-year long relationships before and dont like comparing).

Anyway she is gone now. We are not seperated. But in a ways it feels that way. the last day was weird. In a way she showed affection in that she wanted to be hugged often. but then again she didnt want me to stay the night and thought it would have been better to say goodbye the day before. I ended up staying anyway and we hugged long in the morning and she didnt really want me to go and held on. I started crying again. ughh..

Well so she left. I have not been myself lately and realize that I couldnt have been very attractive in these past few weeks. I also despise how she treated me. I still love her very much and want us to return to normal state. I would still love to have a future together. But the way things are now i cant have a relationship with her.
We agreed that i would try to calm down and she would need some space to see how her emotions develop.

She texted me in the night when she arrived: ""arrived well.. Hope you are ok. Luckily there is no more time-difference :* "" (as in compared to south america... 

Now...  I have no fucking clue!! I love her and want to do this. But I have a stupid habbit of holding on to long and romanticising. I do believe in fairy-tales though as in love is not rational sometimes and I will do anything for the woman I love. I dont know how to approach this situation...  do I just leave her alone and let her contact me? Am I betraying myself since the relationship seems somewhat broken already? I really want to visit her for her birthday next month and wold have to buy the tickets soon but I dont think now is a good time surprises. Do I try to be relaxed and slowly ease back to communicating without pressuring? Or do i tell her how I feel and tell her: either you love me and we try it or you dont and we break up! I also really dont want her to just stay together with me out of pitty.

i want to make this work...  I hope its not lost... but am I being stupid?!
I really really dont know. I have never been so emotional about anything in my life before. i must have cried at least 15 times in the past 3 weeks.


Any input would be so welcome! 

**TLDR: Gf and I have been in LDR for quite some time. Everything worked out and were really in love just recently. but she went to south america for 2.5 months and things have gone really bad from then on mostly due to major communication problems. We didnt manage to get better in the 3 weeks she was here and is now off studying in France for 9 months. I want to make things better but dont know how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated**

However, we're moving in May for my internship, and we've got a three week break before we have to be in Fort Worth.  We're starting to think that it would be better to get married before we move - I'll have time for a honeymoon (I'll be starting a new job in October, so probably no honeymoon), I'll be able to come a few days before the wedding to start decorating, and when we move to Fort Worth into our house where we're planning to stay and start a family, we'll already be married.  I think there is significance to that, even though we've already lived together for 7 months or so. 

We've been engaged a month, and I've been planning the wedding since.  I've got a venue, a caterer, and my mom is coming in from Colorado to go dress shopping in October.  Am I bonkers to think we can do this by May?  Even with graduate school?

Thanks!

Well I haven't really done a personal post like this, ever!

Some of you know and some of you don't know. But I failed my summer exams, quite badly. In my college we are allowed sit repeats (suplementals).
The result for these repeat exams come out tomorrow and being honest here, I am petrified. I bite my naiils and they have currently been chewed down 
to the point on non existence. Between now and then, I wouldn't be suprised if I lost all my hair (melodramatic I know but sue me!). Some people would
say "" Ah sure John, if you didn't pass that just means that you didn't put the work in"" but thats the thing, I did! I put countless hours into studying,
to reading over college notes and looking up online for extra explinations. Exams...well exams just are not my thing. Continous assessment is where my 
strong point it. Heck, I've gotten best in my coarse in a good few assingments and projects, I've become project leader (and actually got the work done) and 
done so well that i was even offered a internship by my course director. That clearly shows i've put in the work during the year, that I'm a lazy asshat who 
just sat there at the back of lecturees ( besides Maths 2, but that shit was easy) and done nothing. I went to my lectures, I done the work. I was even personally
noted a few times by lectures. The BIG end of year project , we had to assemble a mangonel (a roman catapult) and redesign a new arm to get the projectile to 
travel further. My group basically left the re-designing of the new arm to me fully. The ammount of effort and calculations that were put into it and while it 
didn't look like much, there was a shit ton of maths behind it (well, maths to my best capabilities). One of our experiment co-ordinators came over and was 
talking to me about it, even he said it was interesting and offered a last minute suggestion to make it better. When the module lecturer came over, he commented
on how it was a highly ambitious design but a very well and the most creative design there. 



So it's clear that my work during the year is good and it's not laziness. I just don't do well under exams. I don't know what it is, if it's the pressure that 
gets to me or what. i mean I did repeat my leaving cert so I'm already a year behind and now if I don't get true that's going to put me another year behind 
people and I'm not so sure I'd be able to handle that. I find out tomorrow what's going to happen, and all of this worry might be in vain, but right now, I 
just don't think I'm good enough, that I deserve this coarse.



This year has been a combination of high and low, forced myself to realise a lot of things about myself, that I needed to adress me confidence issuues, that 
my father is a part of me no matter how much a try turn it away, that sometimes the wicked go unpunished. But I can easily say that this summer was the accumilation
of these highs and lows. I failed my exams [bad]. I found someone who made me smile in a way not many can [good - I don't like people. I've ever had a thing for one other person]. 
My close uncle was diagnosed with cancer[bad].
I put my self on the kidney transfer list to save a close family friends life [good]. I found out that me and my brother might have a genetic problem that might
cause us to randomly have strokes whwn we're older and would stop me from donating said kidney [bad]. Went to Arcadecon and the following event [Good, easily 
the best memories from the year are from this,  Thank you again Declan for putting all of thart time and effect into making arcade as amazing it is]. Close uncle 
who had heart attack gets worse and gets a heart attack, Bells paulsie, a stroke and blood clots [bad]. Mammy getting depressed and not being able to do anything
about it [bad]. Finally get the courage to ask someone out, get's rejected [bad - I know this ain't major but it was not long ago so the sting is still fresh]. 
Such a flux of feelings and experiences and on top of that, exams to worry about.



One person that did make this summer was Mark. I was able to like him, and he liked him. For the first time ever, I allowed myself to date someone. Getting close
 to him felt good. Things were going well until his athritus kicked in. After that things neer really were the same. Good but not the same. I asked him out on
monday and while I knew it deep down what his answer was going to be, I didn't want to believe it. It was a no. He gave the reason that he doesn't think he's
boyfriend material and that just means I failed. I failed to make him feel as good about himself as he made me feel good about me. I should have been able to
make him see that he is a truly fantastic person in so many ways, that he'd be worth any struggle that might happen.



My heads just all over the place right now.



I'm sorry for the lenght.



But thank you let me get that off my chest.

Honestly."

I've always wanted to be on the giving end, but never thought I would have to ask for help. Here's my situation. I am a mechanical engineering student with just two quarters to go to finish my degree. I pay for my own school, I pay for everything on my own. I was working an internship at a chemical plant in Joliet and it was supposed to go until November 21st which is the week I return to school. Well they ran out of money to pay me and I've been laid off. I just bought a car, it's not much but it gets me around. And boy am I glad I have it as it's also my apartment right now. I had a nice place that I was renting in Joliet, but I couldn't afford the rent and I lost my apartment. I've exhausted my savings and pretty much have nothing left. I've been driving around applying everywhere and got a call back to deliver pizzas. However, I can't make ends meet with this as I am paying $200/MONTH on my truck. I've been applying to pretty much every Craigslist gig in the area to no avail. I got taken advantage of once after working a 12 hour day and the people refused to pay me. I applied for unemployment and was told I will receive $51/week. Not much but it helps. Today I found out my truck needs new brakes and I'm looking at $550 to replace them. Oh well, I guess I will just have to live with them at the moment. I'm done crying, I feel like that's how I've fallen asleep the past week. I came here because I need help. If anyone could give me a job in mechanical engineering as an intern I promise you will not regret it. Or if someone needs yard work done. Or really anything. I am a very hard worker, I am reliable, I am motivated. I wanted to return to school this winter to finish my degree but now that I have no savings to do so that seems like an impossibility. I hope there is someone out there that can help. I don't know what else to do. I never thought I would find myself in this situation. I guess no one does. 


UPDATE:
So I met up with 420is404 and he is an incredibly awesome guy. The kindness he has shown me brought tears to my eyes. He is one of the most genuine, kind, awesome, generous, and epically incredible people I have ever met in my life. The repair ended up being a little more involved than either one of us could've imagined when we embarked on our journey to repairdom. Being that the truck is almost 20 years old, there were several parts that needed to be replaced in addition to the pads and rotor. Needed new wheel bearings, new caliper, new cam assembly, grease, and some specialized tools. 420is404 purchased all of this for me. Not only did he do that and spend his day off helping me, he also let me borrow his truck so that I could work. I have never before in my 22 years on this earth experienced such kindness and genorosity from a complete stranger. But stranger no more is he - I think I've made a friend for life. And when I graduate and get a full time engineering job I'm going to pay him back for everything. Also, I hope that I can do something like this for someone when they need it the most. This experience has completely changed my outlook on life. Never again will I take what I have for granted because I know how quickly it can all be gone. Also, It has taught me that people are an inherently good species. I feel so so SO fortunate for someone to have done all of this for me. Another good development - I was approved for emergency food stamps so starting Tuesday I will receive more than enough benefits to take care of my food needs. SOOOOOO many thanks to 420is404 for everything he has done for me. Words alone cannot express the monumental depth of my gratitude. 

Now all I need is a full time job that pays in the neighborhood of $12-15/hr and I'll be set. If anyone has connections that could land me an engineering internship let me know and I'll shoot you my resumè. Thank you to everyone for the advice and kind words, I really appreciate the uplifting comments. Of anyone needs some help around the house or office let me know l; I'm a hard worker!! 

Reddit is truly an amazing place full of wonderful people. Like I told 420is404, 20 years from now when I hopefully have a son of my own I can't wait to recount this experience to him and tell him about the time his dad was down on his luck and he was pulled up out of it by a truly wonderful person. 

I'll finish this book length update with one of my favorite quotes of all time.

zsve5,1,2012-09-12,[21/m] Is my girlfriend (20/f) trying to break up with me? Or am I just paranoid? I need serious help.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zsve5/21m_is_my_girlfriend_20f_trying_to_break_up_with/,"I wrote a lengthy letter to my girlfriend to call her out for dragging me along a break, when I somewhat know she is just using it as a way to break up with me so that I am not offended. I'm a journalism major, sometimes words are necessary.


I just need to know if my points are valid/reasonable, and if I have any reason to be upset. 

tl;dr I think my girlfriend is going to break up with me, and has used some really weird tactics lately. please read below to understand more.
 
ARTICLE START---- APOLOGIES FOR WEIRD FORMATTING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO FIX IT! 

	Jennifer, the last few weeks have been indescribable. This will be very hard to get through, so excuse me while I try to. I’ve never come into a serious talk with a prepared statement. I have so many things flying through my mind at a million miles an hour that it seemed like the best option. I can’t think of any other way to address all the things on my mind without forgetting something, without rambling, or making myself unclear.
---
	I will start with what scares me the most: That you are such a kind and gentle person, that you are afraid to hurt me in any way.  When we started this relationship, and we sat down, I asked that we communicate with each other and be honest. I have a sneaking suspicion, that I will add I really hope isn’t true, that you have known for quite some time that you didn’t want to be with me any more.

----
	I fear that you may have used the supposed break that I never really agreed to as a vehicle to break up with me so that I would see it coming and take it easier. I don’t know if this were just I being paranoid and terrified, it certainly wouldn’t be the first time this has happened. 
	 All I know is that if you did this in any way, I would be angry. I am not accusing you of this – I am simply saying that I am worried that it might be the case, due to your word choice over the last few weeks, and due to your friends, whom I know you confer with and get advice from.
	I have a few reasons to believe that this might be the case, or they might just be coincidental.
	When you first sat me down in tears, back when you first visited me at my Allston house, you broke down crying. What you told me that day has completely changed how I looked at our relationship. There was no way it couldn’t change things: That night you had told me that I had been too stressed out with my life, and that we simply weren’t having fun anymore. 
You said that I was going through a hard time, and that it was carrying over to our relationship, and had been doing so for over a month. You told me I had certain characteristics that weren’t ever going to be compatible with you, and you stressed that you were worried that I wasn’t the right one for you. I am deeply sorry for that, and that night, I felt absolutely crushed. But I knew I had to change if I wanted to save us. I had no fucking choice. I had to buckle down.
	Of course, the fact of the matter is, you broke a rule of our relationship. You were supposed to tell me, stop me, before things got bad. You were supposed to communicate. And so by the time it was too realized, I realized that I was the one that needed to change anyway.
	And then an odd thing happened, just 12 hours after you cried and cried and cried about all of this, right on my shoulder. And then, the VERY NEXT DAY, it happened. You did EXACTLY what you had critisized me for doing, and then cried about. 
 You spend an entire afternoon texting me about things that, quite honestly, paled in comparison to what I had been dealing with over the last month, and what you are dealing with currently. Hear me out Jennifer, you’ve put up with some horrible stuff lately. You’ve had TONS of stress in your life, and a brother leaving for college, and other things I don’t need to mention. But that day, it was just petty things, and you were out of control with rage. 
Personally, I was absolutely livid at what I saw and heard from you, just HOURS after you had emptied your heart to me in a last ditch effort to save our relationship. How dare you cry on my shoulder and tell me that I need to change how I handle my stress because it was dragging me down, cry on my shoulder for thirty minutes, like it means the world to you, and then the next day, you do that same thing to me. I just don’t see how you could have done that. And that’s when I began to worry that you were going to break up with me.
Why wouldn’t I think that? How can the girl I love cry to me over something so exact, saying how painful it was for me to throw all that stress on you, and how it was dragging us down, and then you do that very painful thing to me the very next day!	It seemed so bizarre. At the very least, if that was the only thing bothering you at the time, then you owe me an apology for your actions the next day. 
The only thing I could think after you did that to me was that there was something much bigger pulling at your strings, something more important that was drawing you apart from me, and that you just didn’t have the will to continue with me. There’s just no other way I could explain you doing that to me hours after you claimed it was so hard to deal with. So pardon me if I am wrong, but I had reason to think so because of what you did.
	Just to clarify things, let me read of the texts you sent me, so you can remember:

“My mom is so frustrating I could cry cant wait to move out of here”

“And to top it all off I lost the cord to my iPhone so I need to order a new one ugh I am so annoyed right now”

“I can’t even get a response about this internship because the professor is a moron and doesn’t want to do his job

“I’m not going to relax until my life is finally settled I can’t deal with all these pending things.”

That last quote, my jaw dropped. Jennifer. You had nearly broken up with me, you had given me an ultimatum (e.g. “fix this, or it won’t work out”) You looked me squarely in the eye, cried to me for over a half an hour about how I had put so much stress on you, while you shook and sobbed. This conversation in my room had directly altered one of the most Important things in my life, and I realized needed to overcome the stress in my life to treat you better. 
Once your texts started to trickle in 12 hours later, I sat there in my room, confused, texting back encouraging things as you absolutely stunned me with your lack of consideration for what you had just done. You challenged who I was as a person, to my very core, and then you spent a good 5 hours complaining about an iPhone cord and a situation you literally could not control under any means at that point. You said I wasn’t relaxing and dealing with the pressures of my life well enough, and said I needed to fix it for us to be happy. The very next day, you said that you weren’t going to relax until your life settled down.
Just days later, you acted like everything was completely normal around me at 10 Carmel.

For sake of not making things awkward, I appreciated you holding yourself together. I appreciate that you didn’t walk out, break down or act awkward. But there wasn’t even anything close to a middlegroudn that entire night. You acted completely normal, hardly acknowledged me, and had absolutely flawless, normal conversations with everyone as if nothing was amiss. I shot glances over at you, wanting to see if you had any sign of discomfort or sadness. You laughed loudly dozens of time, joked with everyone, and in general, not once showed ANY sign of hurt THE ENTIRE NIGHT I WAS THERE. That devastated me beyond words; I couldn’t bear to see you that normal after a situation so devastating to me. I didn’t understand how you could do it. 
	
I had so much pain in my heart and all I wanted to do was cry, but the girl I loved was 5 feet away, acting as if our relationship wasn’t on pins and needles. While I appreciate your composure in a certain sense, it was so hard. I can imagine (or at least hope) you felt a lot of strain in your heart that night, but you put on an absolutely FLAWLESS image that everything was 100% ok. I honestly don’t think I could have ever done that. As much as it probably makes me a horrible person to wish you were a bit sad, I really wished I saw a sign of sadness in you that night. I saw nothing. 

Once again, I will get back to the subject of all of this. Ultimately, my biggest fear has been that you have already made up your mind that you no longer wish to be with me, and that you are simply using this break as a means to cut to an easier break up. It would be so hard just to break up with me flat out, but If we took a few weeks off, then you could just play the “this isn’t ever going to work again” card, and because of our basic mini-break up slash break, it wouldn’t be as devastating to me.  You don’t want to see me sad, so I can understand that, but I would still be furious.

In the days that preceded the 10 Carmel run in, life got a little better. I started to see my friends at school, and it really took my mind of things. Your grandmother died, and I tried to be there for you. It was around this time that I started picking up on language that indicated that you didn’t want to be anything but friends. 

You said things like, “You will always be an important person to me,” which implies that I will always be important to you, even if we break up. To me, you don’t say that to someone in a situation like this unless you intend to break up with him or her. 

Then, you removed your relationship status from facebook. I can’t even claim that was a step towards breaking up with me, that just hurt for whatever reason.
	
And then, when you asked for a hug, you said “you needed a friend right now.”

Anyway, by no means are those few texts proof that you just want to be friends.

But then, that day, I started to panic a little, because I saw the trend coming back. I saw that you started to treat me like a friend, so I texted Mary and Sammie. What Mary said to me was really hurtful, not because of anything insulting, but because it sounded like a prepared statement that went through you first.
	Mary said that you needed to figure out what you needed and wanted.
What else could that mean? Clearly, she had at some point, figured out that you had a decision to make. Why was it that Mary thought that you needed to decide on something? What did you need to decide on? What did you need and want? From what I understood at our last talk in your new room, you just wanted a break and were strictly against breaking up. When I said that I wouldn’t do breaks, you kept asking why not.
	So what lead Mary to believe that you had to figure out what you wanted to do? I thought we had just agreed but not really agreed to take a break…
	To me, it sounds like you’ve been telling Mary things that you haven’t had the courage to tell me, which is that you want to break up with me, but might not be 100% sure. 
	Let me put it to you this way. Let’s say that I’m just completely scared out of my mind and that none of this is true. Let’s say that all you’ve told Mary is that you want a break to let things heal and see how they go.
	Why then, would Mary suggest to me that you need time to figure out what you want and need? Supposedly, you know what you want and need, and that is a break. It sounded to me that Mary had some extra knowledge, and that you were once again using the break, which started weeks ago, as a means to break up with me without hurting me.
	If that is the case, All I can say is this. You broke the trust of this relationship. You failed to communicate with me, and you deceived me into thinking that I had a standing chance to fix our relationship through hours of personal reflection and thought. 
	If this is the case, I don’t think we can be friends. If this is the case, we haven’t broken up because of inseparable differences; we haven’t broken up due to stress in our lives. If this entire entire essay was the case, you just don’t like me anymore and want out. Anyone that throws me to the curb because I’m supposedly not good enough for them doesn’t deserve to be my friend. To me, this sounds like a normal break up that you’ve been putting off due to your own fear, and if it is, I don’t think I’ll be speaking to you for a long, long time. If this is because you don’t think I’m a good enough person to make you happy, I can’t wait to prove you wrong.

	Like I said, there was really no way for me to come into a conversation and throw this all on a table. Any missed piece here or there, and what I’m saying sounds like a bunch of insecurity.

zwisn,8,2012-09-14,"Girlfriend [28] moves in after 5 year relationship, last 2 years long distance, moves out after 11 days. [27 M] What happened?",thebigl58,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zwisn/girlfriend_28_moves_in_after_5_year_relationship/,"Hi reddit. I’ve been a lurker for a little while now, and this is my first post. I need some help figuring out my first real break-up after a long distance relationship. This is probably like the longest post ever, like a freaking novel. I hope that someone will take the time to read about the last few years of my life. I’ve spent a lot of hours gathering my thoughts. What I really hope is that getting this all out of my system will be cathartic in some way. Any advice that any of you could give would help me sleep better. So here we go.

A little back story on me. I played football in college for 2 years before I sustained a pretty devastating knee injury (pretty much the way of the offensive lineman). I was torn about whether or not to hang it up after the injury, but with the rigor of school (and the chance of further injury), I decided to quit. All of that is to say that I put on a considerable amount of weight before I started work in the real world after school because I continued my eating and drinking habits, but not any exercise.

I met my now ex at our first job out of school (We can call her Riley). I was hooking up with a former fling (nothing serious) from high school when I came back to my hometown to work, and I didn’t look at Riley as girlfriend material. I was just trying to figure out my new job. We became really fast friends. She played college soccer and was really athletic, and also a huge football fan so we fell right in. We seriously were inseparable. People at work were starting rumors about a relationship between us. We both shrugged them off as ridiculous, although I was beginning to have some feelings. I knew she didn’t reciprocate because of my appearance at the time. We started running together on a regular basis, and she pushed me hard. I started working out on my own and eating properly and lost a lot of the weight. Went from 290 to about 245.

So after about 3 months into our friendship, we decide to go to a UGA game together on our company tickets. We hang out with some of my friends who were still in school there, and proceed to get sloshed beforehand like any good SEC fan. She ran off to find some of her friends at another tailgate spot, and I stayed with mine. Well, she gets lost coming back in the mass of humanity, and cell reception is terrible. I eventually leave to go seek her out and she runs up grabs my hand and hugs me and says “Don’t ever lose me again”. That was it for me, seriously like a lightning bolt. I was in love, and I had to have her.
At the time, she lived with 2 of her soccer teammates from college (Aside: these girls were super hot and fun; which was totally awesome) in a house. I was living at my parents like a fucking loser, but she always invited me to stay at her house on weekends so I didn’t have to drive drunk back out of the city. I slept on the couch.

 I started becoming really good friends with her one roommate and confided my feelings to her about Riley. I was too much of a pussy to come out and ask her feelings about me myself, but I also didn’t want to ruin my relationship with the person who had turned into my best friend (and not to mention a coworker). Her roommate kept my secret. Eventually I made my move at the bar one night, and she denied me. She whispered that she didn’t want to have any PDA with work people around (which there were), we went back to her place and I was in.

We didn’t have sex for a few weeks after that but were definitely fooling around. Before we slept together, she did tell me this “I wish I had met you 4 years from now”, meaning she wasn’t sure if she was ready for a relationship. I told her I was here now, and that’s how it happened so let’s just go with it. We started sleeping together and everything was great like it always is at the beginning of a relationship. I don’t know if I’ve ever been happier. I had gotten out of the friend zone. I finally moved out of my parents and got my own place down the street from her and she was spending 3 or 4 nights a week at my place. 
Then the recession happened. We had taken an entry level job at a real estate finance firm in the investor services dept (read: answering the phone and listening to irate investors). IT WAS HORRIBLE. We were chained to our desks and working long hours, with no foreseeable advancement in that dept. Riley actually began to put on some weight because we were both so unhappy with our jobs and we had stopped working out because of the long hours. We felt like things would turn around soon so we stuck with it and didn’t look for other jobs (mostly because there weren’t any)

We both started studying for the CFA which is an extremely rigorous financial exam that takes about 3 years to complete to try and make ourselves more marketable. That took up a lot of time as well and added to the stress in our lives. Riley began having more body issues, constantly saying she was fat, and we kind of went in a slight downward spiral. During this time she also changed birth control because she felt it was too expensive on our medical plan. I believe it changed her mood for the worse. She never confided in me any feelings of true depression or extreme body issues, other than the occasional “I feel fat”. She was still initiating sex. You’ll see why I mentioned that later.

One night at her house, her roommate and her boyfriend were in another one of their typical knock-down, drag-outs so we go into her room so they can scream their heads off. Riley looks at me and she said “What we have is so much more special than anyone else I know, you’re the person I want to marry, I want to be with you for the rest of my life”. I told her I felt the same way.

So we’re now a little over 2 years into the relationship and Riley decides that she’s had enough of work and she wants to get her MBA. She applies to schools in a few different places, but the key is that she applied to Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, and SMU, in Dallas (where she’s from along with the last 4 generations of her family, everyone still lives there). She called me sobbing the day didn’t get in to Tech, but she got into SMU. I had just (finally) been promoted at work, and wanted to ride it out for a little while longer to get the work experience. I thought of it as diversifying our career risk. She goes to school, I get work experience. We talked about it this way, which honestly for a couple of 25 year olds is pretty mature. We were taking a long term view of our life together.

We decided that she would move to Dallas, and that I would continue to work at our company to get work experience before changing jobs. The goal was that I would try to move in a year. The day she moved to Dallas was, at the time, was the worst day of my life. We told each other that we would get through it, and we’d be better off in the end.

Things were tough (obviously), but we managed. I saw her maybe once every month on average, i.e 2 trips in 4 weeks then a 6 week stint. At her Christmas that year, she came and stayed with me in my new rental house for 5 weeks. I had to work some of that time while she was off for winter break, but we had a great time. It was really great. We went on a trip to the North Georgia mountains and had one of the best weekends of our relationship, and had tons of sex. 

After our trip to the mountains, she had to go back to school. We were going to be apart for about 3 months. We decided that for her spring break we’d go on a cruise. I made it a goal of mine to lose 20 more pounds before the trip. I started doing Crossfit (Riley was too) and lost the weight I wanted. I was in the best shape of my life, probably around 230 lbs. We had an incredible cruise, met some great people, and just laughed.

So at this point, while I don’t have a body like Matthew McConaughey, but I’ve taken great strides towards getting in shape so I can have a better sex life. 

At the end of her first year, the MBA students were required to go on a trip abroad. She chose South America. She ends up making out with a Brazilian guy while she’s down there. She doesn’t tell me until she gets back, but she had emailed her sister about it when she was there. I guess she wanted to tell me over the phone rather that email me about it. This was the week before one of my CFA exams and was horribly stressful and I wanted to die, but I forgave her because I honestly don’t know what I would have done if I got wrecked in a foreign country like Brazil and a hot chick tried to make out with me. I truly believe that she only made out with someone because her sister told me privately that was the case. I also hacked her email (which I’m ashamed of) and saw the email to her sister. I had lost some trust.

After that trip abroad for her, things were NOT that different. She got an internship in Dallas over the summer and we saw each other along the same schedule. I decided to stay at work until the end of her MBA program to give her the flexibility to search for a job where she wanted and we would move to that city together. I think it upset her slightly that I wasn’t moving out there when we had originally planned, but we were thinking about a move to a new city like San Fran or NYC after she graduated, and I didn’t want to jump ship from 2 jobs in one year.

 Things were starting to slow down in our sex life. She had stopped initiating. She was also denying a lot of my advances. I figured it was just the rigor of the long distance relationship, a 4 year lull, or the contrived nature of our intimacy because we only had a few days every 6 weeks to do it. It was like scheduled sexy time. Sometime she was on her period when I saw her and nothing could happen.  Once we were actually living together again, things would pick back up. I was sure of it. I spoke to her about it maybe once or twice and she just said that she didn’t have the sex drive that she used to. I asked her about birth control and she said that she couldn’t afford any other type on her schools’ med plan. I tried to try some different things like porn and a toy, but she didn’t really respond. She didn’t deny, just didn’t get excited about it.

Riley was nearing the end of her MBA program and I started asking questions about where she was looking for jobs, and what she wanted to do. She NEVER wanted to have this conversation. She would get really pissed. She started going out to the bars more and more because school was easy for her. I kept trying to press her gently for some direction on the next phase of our life but she just kept shrugging it off. I can’t tell you how frustrating this was for me. She had all of the control over my life AND her life because I had committed to her that I would move where she wanted to go. I was working rigorous hours, and she was going out on Wednesdays. I never confronted her about how unfair I felt she was being, and I wish I had now. 

Finally in May (after I did some assisting in her job search), she started gaining traction in the job market. I had been looking for jobs as well, just to see what was out there in case she wanted to move back to Atlanta. I was actively being headhunted by a firm in Atlanta. 

For the 4th of July, we went on a trip to Key West, which she suggested, to celebrate my taking of the 3rd and final Level of the CFA. We flew into Ft. Lauderdale to take the scenic drive down. I decided to splurge and get a convertible rental for the trip. She didn’t want me to spend any more money on her, she said. I wanted to do this, this was for me. She was adamant for me not to spend the extra money, but I did it anyway.  We had a great trip, and had sex twice, but she refused my other advances and said she wasn’t in the mood. I was disappointed because we hadn’t seen each other for 2 months, but I let it go.

During our trip she got an email request to go to a final interview for a firm in Dallas where she actually wanted the job. I was excited for her, but she just seemed down. I asked her what she was going to do if she got offered the job. Was she going to take it? Or move back to Atlanta with me? Or continue looking in other cities? She said that she couldn’t make a decision until she had the offer. I pressed her with a hypothetical situation, and she shut down like she did the previous few months. Didn’t want to talk about it. I again shrugged it off, and chalked it up to the fact that no one wants to talk about work on vacation. 
So vacation over, and we drive (4 HOURS BACK TO THE FLL AIRPORT). Her flight is before mine. I see her off at the gate and she tells me that she had an incredible time, loves me, and kisses me goodbye. I tell her good luck on her interview.

Her interview was 3 days after our trip. I waited to call her about the result until my drive home from work. She says that she got the job. GREAT! Before I can say “what’s next” she continues talking and says that she’s going to take the job in Dallas and she wants me to stay in Atlanta….whoa. WHAT? That doesn’t compute. Are you breaking up with me? To this day she has never said that she was breaking up with me when I’ve asked her directly. 

She goes on to describe that for a long time now, maybe a year; that she hasn’t felt sexually attracted to me. She said initially she wasn’t sure. She said that she thought her feelings would change but they haven’t. She also said that she’s been unhappy and very depressed for the last 6 months and she thinks that it’s because she couldn’t tell me these things. She was hysterically crying through all of this over the phone. I was in a living hell, this was not how the end of our time apart was supposed to be.

I asked her after all of this time, this effort, why couldn’t she tell me this in person when we were driving back to the airport not 3 days before? Or at any time? I couldn’t believe that she was hiding this from me for so long. That she felt so ashamed of her feelings that she couldn’t tell her best friend what was on her mind  (She still maintained that I was her best friend). She said she had been talking to her mom about her feelings and that she thought that she should end it now before we moved in together (our plan the since the day she left) She didn’t want me to move out to Dallas, uproot my life, and then she still feel the same way a few months from now and I’d be screwed.

I suggested to her that because she had never told me about her feelings before, that maybe she needed to take some time on it and see how she felt, now that it was in the open. Our conversation at that point was not being any more productive anyways. I told her goodbye.
I was hoping to let her think about it for at least 3 or 4 days. But she texted me at 11pm that night saying that she felt like she was making the biggest mistake of her life to give up on someone that she loved so much. I was so incredibly confused. I didn’t respond to her, and felt so sick that I didn’t go into work the next day. 

She called me the next day and I answered, stupidly. She said that she still felt the same way; that she needed to end it. First I told her that wasn’t really taking the time to think, but I made my case. 
I told her that our intimacy had been totally contrived for the last 2 years. That we could never be spontaneous as a couple because we had to plan our visits to see each other, and every time we went to each other’s city, we had an agenda. People who were friends with us wanted to hang out with us together. We also always tried to plan trips around a concert or event, so we were always scrambling to do things like a normal couple. I also told her that she had her own body image issues (which she expressed to me before), and that she was projecting her own image of her sexuality on me. I told her she hadn’t changed her birth control, nor consulted anyone about it to see if that was affecting her sex drive. I also implored to her that if she was really depressed, that she needed to talk to a professional. I couldn’t help her with that. I also told her that there was a serious communication issue between us that she internalized and never allowed us to work on together. She agreed with me, and that she would work on getting therapy set up so she could work on herself. 

I told her to take some real time to figure it out. I would wait. Please Riley, think about how much effort we’ve put in to this relationship to make it this far, and now you want to throw it all away before you even give it a chance again.

So she then proceeds to call me the next day and say “I’m not taking the job, and I want to move in with you in Atlanta” YES! I was so ecstatic that she was at least going to take me back that I didn’t think about the implications of her flip-flopping so much on her decisions. “Are you sure?”- I asked. “I can always find a job in a city, but I don’t want to regret the rest of my life losing something with you.”
I told her that we could start over when she moved in, clean slate. I was living in a 3-bedroom house at that point and I told her that we could sleep in separate rooms to start. That was the last of the discussions that we had about our relationship until after she moved in. Her sister drove her U-Haul over from Dallas, while Riley followed her in her car. Her sister had never been to Atlanta before, so I took 2 days off work to go do touristy things and help her move in. She brought everything with her. I mean EVERYTHING. She had a lot of crap. It made me feel really good that she going to be making a home with me. I was still scared though.

One night we went out to a bar and Riley went to the bathroom, her sister grabbed me aside and told me this: “I told Riley that she needs to get over her indecision and commitment issues with you. You are a great guy, and you’ve treated her, me, and the rest of my family so well. If this somehow doesn’t work out for you two, then you deserve someone much better.” I hate that this was a foreshadowing of what was to come. 

I failed to mention before that I had put in my 2 weeks’ notice at my firm of 5 years and I was offered 2 weeks of free time before my new employer needed me to start. This was perfect! Riley and I could take some time to figure out what’s gone wrong over the past few years, and figure the next step in our lives. Just take a vacation like we did a year before to the mountains and go hiking. Oh, and that same firm that offered her a job in Dallas? Well, guess what. They have an office in the building that I’m going to be working in, and that she can start with the Atlanta group in October!!!

So here we go. The Monday after my last day of work, her sister has left, and I have NOTHING to do.  It was like the most glorious morning of my life. I woke up, I had no obligations, and the love of my life was making breakfast for me and she had a job. But I knew that everything was too perfect. I knew that this feeling I had couldn’t last, somehow, I knew. We went to Crossfit that morning together and had a great workout and we decided we were going to go to this great sandwich spot that served Jack and Coke slushies and get hammered. I was putting my shoes on to leave and she said “I need to talk to you, do you want to talk now or after lunch?” ……Ummmmm.. how about now? Mind you, this girl has been moved into my house for 11 days. She’s put up her pictures on the wall. That’s about as far as she’s gotten. We’ve kissed a few times, but nothing else and have been sleeping in separate rooms.

“I still feel the same way. I’m just not sexually attracted to you anymore. I mean, you don’t have the greatest body, and neither do I, but I just don’t know how this is going to work if I can’t be intimate with you anymore. I love you, but I’m not in love with you and I don’t want to get married any time soon. I don’t even know if I’m the marrying type. I’ve changed over the last year. I want to be single again.”
I was in every sense of the word, dumbfounded. I told her that you didn’t even look into therapy, you didn’t try to express what you’d been feeling to me, in short, you did nothing! The very definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results! This was not making an effort to restart a relationship. She said that she couldn’t afford therapy and she didn’t want to take my money for it, she didn’t want to feel indebted to me any more than she already did (See the parallel for the convertible rental in Key West). I had paid for half of her U-Haul and the gas for the last leg of her drive out to my house. And her Crossfit membership. She didn’t say anything then. Her parents had divorced when she was 14, and since then had always had trouble with money. I think the control over her own finances was a deep-seated issue for her. She felt I was giving her charity, but I just wanted us to work. I was putting in the effort.

So I told her that I wasn’t going to try to change her mind anymore, and that if she wanted it this way, she could have it. She proceeded to ask me if she could stay at the house until a wedding that we were both invited to in October. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? Um, no. “I know, I don’t know why I asked because I know that it was selfish.” Whoa…Followed up with “Can you help me move out?” Um….no. I cried a little bit, was generally a bit pathetic, but I packed my bag to stay with my parents that night. I couldn’t look at ther. I hugged her and said goodbye on the front porch of my house and turned and didn’t look back as I drove away. That’s the last I’ve spoken to her. Her dad bought a ticket for the same sister to fly out on that Wednesday to Atlanta to rent a U-Haul and drive back. Her sister was pissed.

Those two nights at my parents I was in total shock/denial. It was so fucking weird that she was in MY house while I was at my parents. She texted me a few logistical things, and I wrote her an extremely long rambling e-mail (not unlike this post ) on Tuesday night basically chronicling the best times I had with her. I ended the e-mail by saying, I don’t know why I just wrote that, I guess I was hoping that I might say something that would change your mind. I guess I was all over the map. 

She wrote me back saying that she loved me and she missed me, but she need to do this. She wanted to see me before she left. That she knew she needed help at that she was going to get it. She said that I was the best part of her life over the past 5 years. WTF?!? I’m still lost to this day. She wrote me another handwritten letter and left it for me when I returned on Wednesday. It basically the same thing except with the addition that “Maybe we’ll find each other again someday” I think that’s way too out of the movies. Also, she said that she would still like it if I came to the wedding I discussed earlier, so she’ll be back in Atlanta in a few weeks.

Just a little bit of irony as I wind this down. My new company’s headquarters are in Dallas (A part of the reason I chose to leave my old company, in case she wanted to move back to Dallas to start a family in the future). That Thursday morning I had to fly out to HQ for their annual meeting so I could meet some people before I started work. So Riley had stayed in my house without me as she packed her things Monday through Wednesday. And then I flew to her hometown, literally over her head, on Thursday, as she was driving back. That flight was fucking terrible.

So now here I am. I haven’t texted or spoken to her for about 3 weeks. I unfriended her from facebook so I didn’t see any posts she may make. Her mom wrote me an email saying how sorry she was about everything, that she thinks the world of me and wished me the best. That hurt, I already thought of her as Mom. Her sister reiterated her feelings about her sister being a dumbass. It’s embarrassing for me to have to tell everyone that she moved out after I told everyone that she moved in. I had even planned a surprise party for her that I had to cancel. It hurts every time I have to have that conversation.

I’m depressed, and I’m thinking about seeking help. I want to get established in my job over the next week or so, and then I’ll start looking in to it. I don’t know what the next step in my life is, and I don’t like it. I feel like someone stole my best friend, and that my best friend betrayed me all at the same time. Riley and I have so much in common. She’s the only girl I know that will go to a Phish concert, a Tool concert, Bonnaroo, kick the soccer ball in the park after drinking scotch and water, and take all of Sunday to sit down and watch the RedZone channel all day while talking Fantasy Football shit. Oh, and she’s hot.

Reddit, what have I done for the past 4 years? Am I doing the right thing now? Will she ever come back? When should I call her, or should I let her call me? I want to get over her and I don’t. Any comments? Thank you all so much if you could stand my incredibly self-centered post. I think that getting this all down on paper has helped me.

**TL;DR** Guy meets girl at work. Guy is fat, girl is not. Guy starts losing weight when girl kicks his but into gear. Guy falls in love, but girl keeps him in the friend zone. Guy and girl become best friends. Guy gets out of the friend zone. Girl says she may not be ready for a relationship. Guy and girl get into a great relationship anyways. Girl gains some weight. Girl says she wants to marry the guy, and guy feels the same. Guy and girl hate their job, and girl decides to get an MBA in a different city. Guy stays at job after promotion. Girl moves away. Guy loses more weight. Girl kisses a foreign guy, guy forgives her. Girl starts becoming more distant towards the end of her schooling. Girl can’t make a decision on where she wants to work or live. Guy presses her for this, and she gets more distant. Girl gets a job in her hometown. Girl wants to end it. Guy asks her to try to make it work and get counseling. Girl moves to guys hometown. Girl moves out after 11 days.

I'd like to thank everyone again for putting up with me when I just started out.  I'm now up to 2 pistols and a .22 rifle, and am looking to go a little bigger.

For ""serious"" rifle calibers, from my limited research it seems that an AR15 would be great from a budget perspective due to 5.56 and .223 being rather cheap.  This would most likely NOT be a hunting gun, so I'd be fine with that caliber.  Seems like it's sort of the 9mm of rifle cartridges, would that be an adequate comparison?

On the other hand, there's the Mosin, which I could pick up at a gun show next month.  Seems like it's a no-brainer, and I've quite enjoyed shooting my friend's.  Are there any other, lesser-known ""great buys"" that I should be aware of?

I'm a college student, so ammo costs are of concern (it's the main reason I'll have to skip getting a 1911 for now, since 9mm exists...).  That's where the AR platform seems to have its drawbacks.

Lastly, can anyone link me to some great reading material or even forums regarding rifles?  I'm sort of getting lost with all the calibers/manufacturers etc., which didn't seem to be a problem when I first started looking into handguns.  I currently read The Firing Line and The High Road.

As always, thank you gunnit!

Oh, I almost forgot.  I'm currently working a programming/research internship, and decided to live at home until the Spring semester to save up as much money as possible to get me the rest of the way through college.  Now my mother only allows me to have my .22 rifle in the house, she doesn't even know that I carry (I guess that's why they call it concealed carry ;)).  It's a stupid situation to get myself into in the first place, but do any of you have any advice on how to deal with it?  I somewhat recently started introducing my father to shooting and he loves it, but my mother wears the pants rather decisively, so he probably won't be much help.


Thanks, and sorry for the novel.

**TL;DR: college student, what ""real"" rifle to buy?  Also, living at home  until spring with ""no guns allowed"".  What do?**"
zvm8e,18,2012-09-14,For all you job hunters out there...,petraman,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/zvm8e/for_all_you_job_hunters_out_there/,"I've had multiple posts in this sub about the pains of finding a job as a recent graduate, which has really brought me down in the past couple months.  It almost seemed like I'd never get a job, especially in this economy...  However, a trip to a job fair last week gave me a ton of insight on how to get a job as a recent grad.  This would probably apply to others as well.

Positivity goes SUCH a long ways when it comes to getting a job.  An employer can easily see the lack of self confidence and negativity present in a prospective employee.  If you don't have self confidence, you'll never be able to defend and sell yourself to your full potential.  So, maybe you're thinking ""well screw you, I'm not a positive guy, how am I supposed to do that?""  Well, we are a pony sub after all...  Go watch ponies!  Listen to happy music before a job fair!  Dream about all the great interviews you'll get and pump yourself up!  Go into it thinking that the world is your oyster and you're just about to open it up and find the pearl inside.

Look at your weaknesses and find a way to twist them into positives.  For example, I don't have an internship, which in engineering is a big no-no and is hard to get around.  However, I've gotten around it twice at the job fair yesterday, and it was pretty easy to do so.  Instead of focusing on the internship, I focused on my other strengths.  How my leadership experiences running clubs and forums have helped shape me not just for the short-term, but for the long-term as well.  Also, think about why the employers are worried about a weakness and what you can substitute as a defense for that weakness which will make you stand out.  Have a bad GPA?  Instead of focusing on that, focus on the courses you did well in and how that would apply to the company.

Also, makes sure you look at the SMALLER companies.  Sure, they may not be dream jobs, but they can certainly lead to them.  They're more accepting and personal and, from the people I've talked to, a lot of them are much better to work for just starting out.  A lot of larger companies treat you like a number just starting out...  and smaller companies would be much more willing to learn about YOU instead of just your GPA and internship work.

Look into the companies you're looking at and do some research.  Mention that research in your cover letters or when you're talking to them at career fairs so that you seem interested.  Also, ask a LOT of questions about the position.  Interest in the position perks the ears of HR up, since they know you're serious about working there.

You can do it.  I have faith in you.  All you need is positivity and a new outlook on your job search.  Sure, I might not have a job yet, but I'm now confident that I can find something in the near future because I know what I can provide to a company.  Good luck!"

OK, enough people (even personal emails) asked me to come by. I'll take any excuse to procrastinate from writing.

1. Nope. Unless you count that the last season I started dating one of the show's production assistants (the showbiz equivalent of an intern). We were together for 7 years.
Although, I will say that when she was guest starring on the show, I was in love with Linda Cardellini. She thought I was too young for her. Boo.

2. Bill Daniels. Jesus, I'm joking. No one was an asshole.

3. ABC and the show runners decided that there were too many other shows in our demographic with ""nerd"" characters (Urkel, etc.). So they went a different direction.

4. Yep. We got to the point where we barely had to rehearse -- acting with Ben became like having a psychic twin.

5. Maybe, but I guess I don't think there's much point in dwelling on it.
But you're kind of perpetuating the assumption behind your question by not asking what we're up to nowadays.
I'll tell you anyway. ;)

Okay, got a lot of requests for this from twitter! Rider and I are going to start a thread together later but for now, I thought I'd answer these questions.

1. I dated Matthew Lawrence for a little bit when we worked together but other than that, we all felt like family. I did have a crush on every single one of those boys at one time or another though. How could I not?!

2. Honestly no one was an asshole. Even all of the guest stars we had were fun, cool, easy to get along with people. If there was any ""asshole drama,"" I wasn't aware of it.

3. I don't know for sure but I think they just wanted to get away from the classic nerdy character thing we had going. Topanga also became more and more mainstream as time went by.

4. Rider and Ben were always good friends. Watching them act in scenes together is one of my favorite memories. Seeing them put together the boy band dance they used to do every week for the live audience was even better! ""Backstreets back, alright!!"" I laugh just thinking about it.

5. I don't think my career has suffered, per se. I wouldn't have a career w/o BMW and Topanga so I won't ever complain. Do I think it's hard for people to accept us as anything other than the roles we played on the show? Yes. But I'm just happy people even care after all these years. :)

zusfb,2,2012-09-13,"Girlfriend (19) left for Australia, and dumped me (22) two weeks later. Need advice. ",Saius418,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zusfb/girlfriend_19_left_for_australia_and_dumped_me_22/,"My girlfriend (19, now 20) and I (22) had been in a relationship for over 8 months. It was somewhat unexpected; we both just fell in love with each other. We had met at college last August, the both of us being on the crew team. I was on my way out - I graduated this May. She was just starting, although she was already ahead - she had tested out of her first year (academically) of college. 

A few months into our relationship, she was accepted into our college's study abroad program at the University of Newcastle in Australia. I was very excited for her - I had been on a study abroad program at the same age and time she was going on hers. I had gone to Germany for mine, and it seemed so amazing that she was taking the extra leap and going even further!

We knew that this trip would mean that we would be far apart from each other. However, we weren't too worried about that. We had already spent some time in a long distance relationship. Although we met and went to college in Kentucky, I am from New Jersey, and she is from Washington (the state). We had spent our breaks/holidays apart, which went very smoothly, and without issue. We missed each other a lot, but it didn't stop the love we had for each other. 

I graduated in May, and then moved up to Washington DC for my internship. Our relationship continued, even through that. Before she left in July, she came to DC and visited. We spent about a week together, and then two days later, she boarded the plane to Australia. 

We didn't talk for a few days. Her computer wouldn't connect to the Internet, so I didn't hear from her until she got her phone. She was fine, and it turned out she was the only one from our college there. She was starting to meet other Americans, and of course, Australians. 

But then the partying started. At first, this didn’t bother me. We partied at college, we both drank, and we were both pretty social people. But then she started telling me about what she was doing. She took part in a wet t-shirt contest, which she won, but in the process was humiliated by four drunken men who pour their drinks on her. She took part in a jelly-wrestling contest. The University had “zero week” which is a weeks worth of university sanctioned partying and drinking (unheard of in the US) which involved drinking every night, and on one night, a lockdown in her dorm which involved naked drinking games. 

I asked her the basic question: why? She summed it up like this – if you aren’t drinking, no one will talk to you. I told her that I thought that idea was ridiculous, telling her that she is an individual and should have to bow down to peer pressure. I should add that we did not raise our voices or argue. 

The following day, she called and said we needed to break up. She said that she didn’t “want to hurt me.” I was absolutely devastated. We talked about it the following two days after. Through those conversations, we established we would still be friends and still talk to each other. This was also confirmed via Facebook message. 

We’ve been broken up since July 20th. The first week was incredibly rough. I missed a day of work, didn’t sleep and barely ate. It’s gotten a little better over time. The advice my friends and family gave me has helped. But, I still love her. I still want to be with her. Even through all of this, I still would never have a second thought about her. 

We’ve talked occasionally since the break up, but we haven’t talked in a few weeks. Word has reached me through her sister that she is now considering dual citizenship in Australia after two months. This hurts even more. 
I’m at my breaking point with all of this. I don’t know what to do. 

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend went to Australia, got caught up in the party scene, and dumped me because of it. This leads me to the following questions:
1: Is the University of Newcastle like this all the time? Does anybody know anything about this place? Should I have expected this at this university from the beginning? 
2: Should I remain committed to this? It seems like all that happened is that she got caught in the wrong crowd.
I’m more than willing to answer any questions if this doesn’t paint a clear enough picture.

Edit 1: Formatting and Grammar

**Update:** We finally talked again. It took about a month, but she finally picked up the phone and explained why she would not call. She is no longer interested in me. She felt that my actions during the break up and prior to it (during the relationship) resulted in her losing interest. Apparently this loss of interest started in late April. 

So, on my end, I'm living with two opposite mindsets at the moment. One side of me still strongly desires to be with her and repair the relationship. She meant the world to me, and losing he is one of the worst feelings in the world. But, the other side of me is very excited about the future. I've realized that someone who would wait until she was on the other side of the world to dump me, instead of in person, is *not* someone I want to be with. I've realized that I made mistakes during the relationship, but I'm glad that I know those mistakes now, and that I can work to correct them.

Thank you all so much for your help, and a really big thank you to all the Redditors either from or have been to Australia. I'm not typically one to hate on people because of their nationality, but if it wasn't for you all, my anger over the situation would certainly have brought me to that point. Thank you so much for bringing me back down to Earth and helping me realize that it's not the people around her, *it's her*. "

I feel like I’m going crazy, and I need someone to tell me that I’m either a) over reacting /being a pansy and need to man the fuck up and am too damn needy or b) have every right to be worried. 

My girlfriend was a foreign exchange student studying English that I met here (we’re both the same nationality and I’m fluent in both languages so there isn’t any miscommunication in language). She had a boyfriend when she first moved here but she broke it off with him a few months in. She told me she felt nothing when breaking it off with him, but he obviously still had feelings for her. We’ve been together for 8 months, we got together about 2 months after she broke up with her ex.  Right off the bat I know some of you might say “oh, you were a rebound.” But the things she left with me, the gifts she personally made me, and the things she said to me make me feel that she did everything with sincerity. There’s also a possibility that she used me to be shown around the city, taken to places etc, but if she did, she deserves an award for best actress.  Another important note - she tells me that her mother cannot know that she had/is in a relationship with someone in the States if she ever wants to come back here. There are no picture of us together or even a single picture of me on her Facebook. She asked if I wanted the pictures uploaded, I said no. I still feel like I'm being hidden for reasons unknown....

She returned back home to her country 6 weeks ago. I thought she was going to go home and never return so I just wanted to treat it as a fling, but before she left she kept telling me she was going to come back and find a job here as after graduating school(this December) and asked me to wait for her. So the relationship continues…. 

We are on an 18 hour time difference so it makes things somewhat difficult. For the first 4 weeks after she returned, she didn’t have school so we talked/texted a lot, from when I finished work until I went to sleep(around 5-6 hours a day).  She would text me when she would be on the subway/bus, while she was walking on the street, call me when she would get home from going out with her friends etc etc. 3 weeks ago her grandfather got deathly ill, as in the doctors tell her and her family everyday, “he might pass today” ill.  She is, to this day, by his side every moment she’s not studying or in school (from what she says).

One week into her grandfather’s illness, the texting didn’t exactly stop, she was able to text me/call me even though she was by his side, but sometimes the messages would pause because people would come visit or she had to be with her family etc, and she then started to respond to messages the following day. Then school started two weeks ago and the contact dropped off a cliff. Within the past two weeks there were days when we’ve exchanged a message just once. This past week there was a time when she couldn’t respond, it turns out her mom was so stressed out about the grandfathers illness that even she had to be omitted to the hospital. She apologizes profusely, saying she’s extremely busy taking care of her grandfather, going to school, studying for tests (work related, and school related), and busy writing her resume and applying for internships so she can gather experience and come back here. She’s busy, I understand that. But a handful of times and yesterday she had time to comment on Facebook pictures and post a status update saying she was sick of studying. She didn’t do this before; she would contact me first before anything else. 

Her and her ex have the same best friends, they’re in the same social circle. Sidenote *She never told me his name but when she was still in a relationship she put up a facebook link regarding her boyfriend with her boyfriend tagged in it. So I know his name. * She was worried about going back home because she told me before school started that it would be quite awkward around her ex, that she didn’t really want to talk/see him. Also her ex is in one of her classes and the same film club (she told me this before hand). On the first day of school she told me that around 100 of their friends/classmates got together and made the two of them promise to “get along.” I have no problem with her spending time with her ex (as long as other friends are there) and it’s pretty much inevitable since they share the same friends. 
Here’s why I’m a little worried. A week before school  began she told me she went drinking with her “Bestest Friends,”  and her ex was tagged at the location on Facebook. I find it weird that SHE TAGGED HIM after telling me countless time how awkward seeing him would be. Maybe her other friends brought him along and she felt bad tagging them and not him. I don’t know. 

She obviously doesn’t know I know his name, so we talked on the phone the day after and she told me she went drinking with her best friends. She never mentioned her ex being there. I tried to give her a chance to let me know he was by saying, “you’re going to see your ex at school soon, aren’t you nervous about seeing him?” she said that HER FRIENDS said that, “he’s okay now,” and that “there would be no more problems.” I just threw out there, “so this is the first time you’ve seen your ex since you got back right?” She replied “yeah.” I understand some girls keep things like this from guys, with the reason usually being, “I thought you would be angry,” but it irks me a little. Side note *My best friend broke up with his girlfriend of a year because she didn’t tell him a male friend that liked her was hanging out with her and I told this story to my girlfriend when she went back to her country. A very similar situation to mine at the moment so I understand that my girlfriend might have been a little scared to tell me after that story.*

Anyway, there were a few more times when she and her ex were tagged(not her update) in the same location but she swears she was at the hospital, that her friends tagged her in spirit because she’s always stuck there and feel sorry for her that she can’t go out. It does seem somewhat true as there are never pictures of her at the location but pictures of others. A few days ago, she uploaded a picture with 3 busted cell phones (her iphone looks like a truck ran over it, it’s been like this for months) and one of cell phones was her ex’s (he was tagged on it, SHE tagged HIM). She still tells me she doesn’t hang out with her ex and again, she’s too busy to contact me. 

The messaging system we use lets us know if the other has read a message, before she wouldn’t read them if she wasn’t able to respond but would respond after reading them. For about the past week or so, she’s been reading them but not responding until the next day saying again, “I was sooo busy.”  I asked her to call me two days ago when she had time, she said “okay!!!” but has yet to do so. 

I guess here’s my question, am I being too needy? She’s extremely busy, I can see that, but if she has an hour time on public transport everyday going to school, if she has time to check facebook and look at pictures and comment on them, if she has time to take pictures and tag her ex, if she has 4 hour breaks in between classes some days, am I being too needy in wanting a “hello?” during those times instead of an “I’m so sorry I was busy” the next day or a couple of days later? And then wait another day for the same ""I'm so sorry I was busy,"" response? I've never had a time where there has been this little communication with a girlfriend, then again, I’ve never been in a long distance relationship with such distance.  

What should I do? I see two ways in going on about this, 1) ask her what has changed, i.e. you still ride the subway/bus to school for an hour, stay next to your grandfather with your phone in hand, have hour long breaks in between classes, have time to upload photos  and update status on Facebook, why no contact? 2) Just laugh it off, she’s stressed enough as it is, and respond with “don’t worry, I know you’re busy.” 

Thanks folks, I need to get this off my chest.  My friends tell me to just “talk to her,” but it’s difficult to communicate with someone that I literally can’t get in contact with.  

TL;DR - girlfriend is saying she is too busy to contact me with school,work,taking care of a deathly ill grandfather after returning home to her country but has time to be on Facebook and tag her ex boyfriend who she still tells me she doesn't hang out with because she doesn't know I know his name. Facebook ruins relationships.

Edit - TL;DR

zx2pu,2,2012-09-15,Mother is Physically and Verbally Abusive,xx5xx10,familysupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/familysupport/comments/zx2pu/mother_is_physically_and_verbally_abusive/,"Hopefully I explain myself properly, but here goes..

For the past 3 years my mother has grown more and more abusive towards me. All my siblings have moved out of the house and my father is always working; Leaving just me and my mother home most of the day. She is 59, i'm 19. I'm a full time pre-med student who commutes to school, i also have a job along with an internship. My mother spends her free time bullying me to no end. Her goal from morning till night is to convince me I'm: Dumb, wimpy, lazy, a ""sissy"", pathetic, ""i sleep too much"", and i'm a failure. Shes a small old lady with bad arthritis, yet she constantly slaps me in my face, kicks me in my shins, hits me various objects, throws various objects, and pounds on the door to my room. 

Basically my mom is a malicious bully who 24/7 is in attack mode. I've pleaded with her to stop treating me this way. She rationalizes her extreme behavior by saying ""This is the way you deserve to be treated"", because of my mothers age she constantly needs my assistance to do basic tasks (work the tv, use the computer, carry groceries out of her car) She takes advantage of this by demeaning me the entire time i'm helping her, and because of guilt, i have to carry on helping her and take it. 

My mom has bad arthritis and knows i would never hurt her physically, she takes advantage of this by constantly getting in my face, (then she'll slap me or kick me, even try to punch me in my man parts *creepy i know*)

Backstory: My mother has been sick her entire life, but has always been very lucky, and always had an amazing attitude about it. She first got breast cancer, but she received a double mastectomy immediately and was fine. 5 years later she gets ovarian cancer, has her ovaries removed and was completely fine and completely happy. 4 years later her kidneys begin to fail (caused by doctors malpractice) She began dialysis (still happy and loving as ever). But then she received a kidney transplant and everything changed. 

Upon coming home from her kidney transplant my mother had developed this evil rotten attitude. Since the surgery her personality has changed. She is on a ton of meds and I'm afraid these have changed her brain chemistry. (just assuming but whatever). 

My mother has had an amazing life, wealthy upbringing, loving successful children, loving grandkids (she has 6 little ones). She spends most of her days shopping. and doing whatever she wants. my father is very loving towards her. (he has always worked ridiculous hours, so this hasnt negatively affected their long 40 yr relationship)

Additional info: I've noticed my mother only bullies me and my grandmother (her mother). the first 2 years she desperately tried to hide her crazy tendencies from the rest of the family, and would only lashout in private. Now she can't really control herself and the cats out of the bag. No one really cares to fix her probelm because no one has to deal with it except me, and occasionally my grandmother. everyone just kinda shrugs it off, blaming her age. everyone just tells me to be strong and not to let her bother me. 

Also, this has been happening for 3 years, but it has gotten worse this past year, only because we have moved into a new home, our old home had many stairs and it was easy for me to keep my distance from her. Also sound didnt travel far in our old house. In our new home, there are less stairs and sound carries much easier throughout the house.

SHe takes advantage of this by coming and pounding on my door when ever she feels. ""Just to see what i'm up too"", she'll also talk badly about me, to herself, knowing i'll be able to hear her.

She also comforts herself using projection. she's beginning to lose her hearing, so her new thing is that she's trying to convince me i'm deaf. 

when she first came home from her kidney transplant, her short term memory and vocabulary became absolutely terrible. I didnt mind because i know she's been through alot, but she began doing everything in her power to convince me i'm an idiot. 


I'm desperate for help, hope all this is coherent. Thanks in advance!

zwz0u,0,2012-09-15,IAMA PhD Student in Structural Engineering...have gained some decent insight of the program and the field. ,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zwz0u/iama_phd_student_in_structural_engineeringhave/,"I have been in the PhD program for SE for about 1.5-2 years now. I feel like I have an idea of what the program is like, and a vague idea of what to expect from here on out. I also have internship experience. I believe that I have an idea of how one should approach their time as an undergraduate engineering/CS student and beyond, and I would like to share my experiences with anyone who is interested. Feel free to AMA.

When I first started, I had NO idea what to expect or what I eventually wanted to do. My current research is radically different from anything I ever expected to do. That being said, I think it has been a great experience so far, and now it all seems to be coming together.

All this aside, I honestly feel that my education is incomplete. Although I am learning great things and delving deeply into my field, I feel that my knowledge in other fields (economics, biology, history, philosophy, english/literature) remains underdeveloped. I am currently trying to find a way to ""bring balance to the force"", if you will, and try to learn as much as I can beyond what my degree can offer. If anyone has some opinion on that, please feel free to share that as well :)

I don't know how I can prove that I am who I say I am (is it really needed in this case?). If you have any suggestions as to how I can provide proof, please let me know. I'd rather keep my name/location/institution/research a secret, if you don't mind."
zwxxu,1,2012-09-15,Need help resisting,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/zwxxu/need_help_resisting/,"Hi.  I need help resisting, and I'd appreciate any material to help motivate me to resist (drug addiction documents or adverse effects of smoking, stories, etc.)

If I get caught smoking marijuana I'll be kicked out of the house, with no means of providing for myself.  I am completely dependent on my parents for the time being and I just can't afford for that to happen.  My sister is currently ""kicked out of the family"" and my family means just that: no house, no financial support, nothing.  My family will at times be suspicious, it can be anything and sometimes not even substantial, like me being irritated and my uncle threatens to drug test.  The last time this happened was two months ago.  I was playing too much Diablo3 so my uncle suspected I'm smoking weed. I confessed to having smoked a spliff,  and my uncle hasn't mentioned it to my father, but if the suspicion arises again and I can't pass a drug test, my life will be over.  So the consequences of smoking are severe for me.

I find that on my own, I'm completely able to resist.  The temptation comes from time to time but I just ignore it.  On my own, I'd already be two or three months clean.  

The problem is when my brother is around.  He's more of an addict than I am.  At times he says he's done with it, or when I tell him I regret having done it, he says he's going to stop as well, but he never does.  When it's available just one door down from me, when it's right there, accessible and everything, I have a hard time resisting.  After that last incident with my uncle, I went three weeks without smoking until my brother and I went on a trip together.  First thing he did was get more weed and I joined him in it, thinking ""one more week of this won't hurt.""  We were both planning on quitting after the week was done, and called it our last shabang.  He is going to go to a medical internship in October, and he wants to end the habit before that happens.  

But then when we got back in town, he wanted to get more.  I had a hard time stopping as well, but then I stopped when he left town.  Then he came back in town and there it was again.  He left on Wednesday to go do some things out of town, and I haven't smoked since then.  Today he returned, with 5g of herb.  I'm sitting in my room, actively resisting.

The better part of me knows I can't be engaged in that kind of thing.  The consequences are too high to warrant the high that weed gives me, and I'm fine without it.  The sooner I can test clean on a drug test, the better.  When I'm independent again, I can reassess it.  However, I end up justifying it each time in the past, and I don't want it to happen again...thinking ""ok, one more dance with mary jane and then I'm going to stop..."" or ""...my uncle hasn't brought it up in some time, I can probably get away with it"" or ""if I do it just for two nights, it should be out of my system within two weeks...I probably won't get tested in two weeks"" or my best one: ""He's never actually taken me to get a drug test...I've just confessed each time he wanted me to go do it (and got in a load of shit).  Maybe if I don't confess, he won't actually test me..maybe it'd be hard for him to...his daughter smokes all the time and he has threatened to test her but he never has and she keeps on smoking.""  But that's a lot of risk to take, and I can't afford to be kicked out of my family.  It'd just be a lot easier if everyone around me didn't smoke, but that's not going to happen.

So, please, anything that can encourage me to resist while amidst it would be of great help.  Thanks.

EDIT:  TL;DR: Need help resisting weed when it's easily available every day."
zzrn8,2,2012-09-16,[19/M]How to get a girl back? You can't make up stuff like this(20/F)?[[Pretty Long]],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zzrn8/19mhow_to_get_a_girl_back_you_cant_make_up_stuff/,"This is a TL;DR Post, sorry for not putting it in the title. It's my first reddit post.

Just a quick disclaimer. This is a very long story and I think some of the details are important. If you stick with it and finish it, thank you. If not, I understand.

Last summer I went to another state with my family to aid with a domestic disaster relief effort. We stayed with another family for a week or so, and they were very hospitable. We are both of the Muslim faith, and similar in our degree of practice. They had a daughter, who is 1 year older than me, who I thought was very beautiful from the first moment I saw her. However, we did not get to talk much as we were mostly in a parentally supervised environment. Before I left I was able to get to be friends with her on Facebook. At this point, my feelings for her were just a crush, and I realized that.

Back in my home state, I decided to message her and thank her for her families' hospitality. We ended up talking over fb message, ironically, for about a month. At that point I cut it off and became absorbed in a new semester at my university. Roughly a middle of the way through, she messages me and we begin to talk again. This time, however, I am caught up in other girl issues and am just talking to her normally as if I would any girl. 

As it turns out, the side girl issues fade. But as her and my mom kept in close touch, they invite me back to their home(by myself) for an internship opportunity in their area. So I go their at the beginning of the next year for two weeks.

The first week, nothing happens. Then starting the next week, as the situation would have it, we end up hanging out with each other until the early morning hours watching movies, talking, etc. Each night it seems things get a bit more physical between her and I(I would say she initiated it mostly). I'm talking serious physical, like wrestling and other things, not dinky stuff. The last night before I leave, things get a bit heated and we make out. This is a crucial detail. As a Muslim(not going to debate about whether it was right or wrong) with a more or less traditional mindset and with not too much exposure to women, for me this seems to be a big thing. For her, she had previously been in a relationship for 2 years. However as Muslims we cannot engage in premarital sexual activities, so I don't know how far they got. I talked to her about afterwards, as there would be a large distance between us(multiple states) and we eventually we ""decide"" to keep in touch over facebook so our rents don't find out and banish us to Siberia. 

Mistake #1 --&gt; I should've talked to her about whether or not we were, I suppose, ""together"" or not and expressed what I wanted. However, I didn't and that's what we came up with. fail

I come back and I am completely at a loss as to the status quo. Whether or not we are together, etc as we failed to work that out. As the days go by, she texts me and we talk. However, I never am the aggressor and I do not call her or hit her up as much as she did to me. The texting and calling seems to slow down. Whether she was busy with school or anything else, I have no way of knowing for sure. I talk to my dad (and friends) and tell him everything. He tells me that I should tell her that we can be friends and see where it takes us, as we can't do anything right now(b/c distance &amp; life goals). Some of my friends say similar things. 

Mistake #2 --&gt; should've shown more interest(call, etc)

Valentines day comes along, and I send her flowers with a nice message and some chocolate(most I can do working with the distance). However, that same night I talk to her. I say that I don't know what to do about the distance and about us. She agrees and says shes not ""looking"" for anything right now. However, there is no distinct cut off. No one says that we are not going to talk to each other anymore. I apologize for making out with her the last night b/c of our Islamic restrictions. She says we both share the blame. My feeling for her are the same though. 

Mistake 3 --&gt; Shouldn't have shown uncertainty/followed everyone else's advice

It is interesting to note that when I was with her in person, I was confident, in character, etc. When I came back, I found it hard to display those same things through text or phone call. I'm better in physical interpersonal relations. 

Still feeling the same way I text her, and get more and more pressed, as I realize that she is not exactly showing the same amount of interest as she was earlier. I'd say I text her every 2-3 days. sometimes every day, sometimes every other day. I don't want to crowd her. In a last ditch attempt I invite her to a trip abroad with a humanitarian mission that would be a great opportunity for her and I. I tell her I like her in the message and want to get to know her better, however, I hear nothing back regarding that. 

Eventually I call her and tell her that I still like her and want to make sure we are on the same page. She says she ""likes me as a friend"". Basically I get friend-zoned. 

Against other people's wishes I maintain the invitation to the trip, I'm not a douchebag.Turns out she can come with me for the trip. I'm skeptical as to her motives; it would be a great opportunity and look good on a resume. I cut off communications with her unless absolutely necessary(i.e. pertaining to the trip). She hits me up a few times to talk, mainly about the trip, sometimes not. 

The trip happens, and I'm guilty of still thinking that maybe something will happen. However, I seem to have lost all my confidence that I displayed previously and instead come of as tense. We have an alright time, sometimes she invites me over to watch movies. I don't push the boundary, I stick to what she said/wanted and keep it friendly. We go out on the last night before she leaves. She dresses up, saying that her mom wants her to dress more like a lady. Friends say that it was a sign she thought it was a date. Either way I'm oblivious, dinner goes well but without crazy event. I give her a bracelet I bought at the market earlier as a memento for her for the trip. She says she doesnt want it but I give it to her anyways. I wish her well in her future endeavors, thinking that this will likely be the last time I see her in my life. She leaves the next day. I text her every night afterwards and describe her what I did to make her not feel left out. Eventually I come back to the states.

Mistake #4 --&gt; Tense when I was with her alone; showed lack of confidence. Didn't perhaps make a move. But I wanted to be respectful of her and her wishes. I didn't want to come off as a douchebag. 

I come back home. For some reason she maintains contact. She texts me maybe 1-3 times a month and asks some general questions about me and my life. I don't respond very well as I don't know what to make of it. As time goes on, however, I see the things that happened in an objective light and realize that I still do have some feelings for her. I remember our time together before the intl trip very often. Many times a day in fact. It seems to be bordering on obsession. 

I ask her for the photos she took from the trip for a school report. A friend takes my phone one day and texts her that he wants one of the photos to be of her. she replies with just a what and I save face after retrieving my phone and say it was my high friend. She asks if he is my wingman. I confirm but also point out that he is high. Regardless, this weekend I text her again and she seems to be very friendly. Against my surrounding peers wishes, I chose to end the conversation and not throw any flirtatious bombs at her. 

The problem is, I still have feelings for her. However, shes so far away now and I've botched my chances. Not clearly botched them, but relatively botched. I know getting a girl back via text messaging is stupid, but I don't know how to approach this. I'm not sure if I'm obsessed or what. 

I guess what I want is neutral opinions on what happened. What do you make of it? 

And if I were to continue ""pursuit"" how should I go about it? I'm not a good texter or phone caller. It's just not how I interact well. Is it still even possible with the distance between us? I've heard girls are selective with their time; how does that fit in here?

Or should I just try and let it go? If so, how? I seemingly have not been able to do it for 8 months over a ""small thing"" like making out, but it is what it is. I'm not going to fool myself. 

Thanks reddit for reading. I wont mind any tl;dr comments, because it is lol. I know I'm still a young guy, but I just don't know what to do.

zzkpo,40,2012-09-16,"A Tale of Woe, as Told by the Other Woman",KellyRebecca,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/zzkpo/a_tale_of_woe_as_told_by_the_other_woman/,"Before we start, I would like to admit that my actions and choices throughout the duration of this story are not always the right ones. At times they are downright selfish. I am deeply sorry for any pain I have caused to the people involved. I have learned from my mistakes on a level that is profound and truly heartbreaking to myself as well as to others. Please do not down-vote or lecture me on the errors I have made out of niavity, selfishness or shame, I have already paid (and continue to pay) the price for the consequences of my actions in the real world, as I hope you will understand as you read the story...I'll try to make this as short as possible:


About a year ago I (22/F) moved to a new city with my boyfriend (24/M whom we shall call Brad). We had been together for about 2.5 years and living together in Phoenix. We acted as a team, and hoped to be together for the long haul. But money was constantly an issue, and he resented me for it. I was an intern and worked 80 hours a week, so for over a year and a half we didn't spend much time together. Just before the move, I learned of his (failed) attempts to cheat on me while he was out of town. But regardless of our hardships, we still remained together. I quit my internship and we moved to Austin.


Brad and I quickly made friends with our new neighbors. One particularly caught my attention. We'll call him Aaron (37/M). He first interested me because he was an artist, as am I. He began to teach me things about painting, and we would sketch together frequently. 


One night, when Brad had passed out in a drunken stupor, Aaron and I stayed up until the early morning, partying with the neighbors. As the sun began to rise we found ourselves alone, and he began to hit on me. Naively I tried to ignore it, until finally he made a move. At this point I told him no, that Brad was good to me and that I couldn't betray him. The next day Aaron and I talked about it, and agreed that it was just a drunken mistake, and that there was no reason to acknowledge that it had ever occured. I had Brad, and Aaron started a complicated relationship with a girl that lived in Mexico. But the more I thought about it, and the more time I spent with Aaron the more irresistable he became to me. Eventually we began an affair.


The relationship between Brad and I steadily and quickly deteriorated as I began to realize all the reasons we were wrong for each other, and as I became distant, he became suspicious and clingy. Meanwhile the relationship beteween Aaron and I began to grow. In short I had only known him for two months before he called me, saying that he wasn't sure what to do, because he felt like he was falling in love with both the girl in Mexico, and me. Of course, I had been realizing that I was quicking falling for him as well.


About a month after that, Brad and I broke up, and I moved out. But despite not being able to come around, Aaron and I spent the next 6 months nearly attached to the hip. There were many instances in which we decided we couldn't see each other any more, because his relationship with the girl in Mexico continued. On many occasions, he would become suspicious that I was sleeping with other people (I haven't been with anyone else since Brad and I broke up). We tried just being ""just friends"", but found that it was impossible.


We mostly kept our relationship a secret from the people we knew because many of our friends knew Brad, and because some of them knew the girl in Mexico. He rarely talked to me about his relationship with her, but I knew there were arguments, and she even broke up with him for a short time. Then, he told me he was planning on visiting her. He would be going to Mexico for two months. We both knew that when he did, it would be over between the two of us. He wouldn't have a phone, we wouldn't be able to talk. I wouldn't be able to stand knowing he was there with her. But I was in love with him, and I believed he loved me. I can't explain why I believed him. Anyone reading this has probably assumed I'm just a silly girl, and that he was using me. If I were you, that's what I would think. But there's a look and a feeling that can't be faked. And there's months of evidence that there's no way to put into words.


So, when he left for Mexico, I was heartbroken. I cried for days. I only got out of bed to go to work. I ate very little. And then, he messaged me. He told me that he couldn't get me out of his head. And (although most of our conversations revolved either around the fact that no matter how much we love each other, we can't be together so long as she is a part of his life, or about how much we missed each other) we continued to talk for the rest of his stay there. And when he came back, we were back together as if he had never left.


For the last three months we've been inseperable. We spend every minute we can together, to the point of absurdity. We've worked together, we go to the store together, we go to sleep, and wake up together. We have this beautiful relationship, we work on art, play tag in the middle of downtown, we go to galleries and have wonderful discussions, we cook and clean together, we've been accused of knowing each other too well when we began to finish each other's sentences. Our close friends know about and accept our being together, and really, everything is perfect.


Except that, I am the other woman. His girlfriend doesn't know about me. And soon, she is moving to Austin. Their plan is to live together. His plan is to stop seeing me. In fact he's tried to call it off with a increasing frequency since he's come back, and I've tried to respect that (but we can't seem to stay apart). He tells me that he loves me, but that he loves her as well. And I have to give him props for his honesty, as much as it hurts. Personally, I'm appalled that I find myself in this position. I'm not a cheater, and before I would NEVER have been ""the other woman"". I'm ashamed of myself, and I feel a soul crushing guilt for what I've done, both to the girl in Mexico, and to Brad. Her living a thousand miles away seemed to offer me just enough of an excuse to continue, but I know that my conscious and my jealousy won't allow me to continue to see Aaron when she is actually here. But more than this I know that I love Aaron with all of my heart, and that my heart simply cannot let him go. 


I know that he loves me, and that this isn't just some fling he's using to pass the time. I know that he's conflicted about leaving me. I know that he's afraid of losing me, and also afraid of losing her. I know he's torn in two. These are things I KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt. There isn't any way to explain how I know. What I don't know, is what I should do. How do you give up on someone you love? How hard to you try, how much do you give and how long do you wait, before you do?


**TLDR**: I started having an affair with an older man who had a long distance relationship. We fell for each other, but he also loves her. I truly believe that he loves us both. Soon she will be moving here to live with him. Has anyone out there ever been the ""other woman (or man)"" and it worked out? Does any have any advice?


EDIT: Spell Check.

**Update**: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has offered me advice and *constructive* criticism. I never expected so many people would respond. I appreciate those of you who have offered your opinions without judging me...I do that enough for myself. It appears that the majority of you hold no hope for this twisted relationship, and perhaps you're right."

(mini snack/food-exchange?),thoriginal,Switzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/zyq0p/looking_to_have_some_tea_sent_from_switzerland_to/,"Hello from /r/Ottawa! My wife was in Switzerland a few years ago for Christmas, visiting her sister who was doing an internship there. When she came back, she brought some tea from Coop which was some of the best tea either of us had ever had. On the website, it is called: 

&gt;""Coop Früchtetee aromatisiert assortiert 4 Sorten 20 Portionen 50g""/""Coop Assorted Flavoured Fruit Tea 4 Sampler 20 Tea Bags 50g""

[and this is what the box looks like](http://imgur.com/BZmnN).

I've looked high and low online and in town here but no such luck. There's even a Swiss store here that sells a lot of Swiss national brands, but I can't find this stuff anywhere, likely due to it being a in-house brand from a grocery store.

Anyway, I'd love to send some stuff from here (we're pretty well known for maple syrup) in exchange for a large case full of the teas I spoke of and linked above. My wife is pregnant now, and I would love to surprise her with a box of this stuff. Please feel free to contact me! Thanks!"
zyo4n,5,2012-09-16,"I'm an engineering student, how much is too much student loans debt?",Naxili,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zyo4n/im_an_engineering_student_how_much_is_too_much/,"Hi, I'm a third year astronautical engineering student in a five year program at my school. I recently decided to get serious about my financies, so I'm here to talk about student loans. So, here are my numbers:

**Financial Information**

My mother is unemployed, and has no money to assist me with. None. She's last year she made $16,000 (idk how), and she has 4 kids (including me).

The degree program I'm in gives guaranteed jobs in your field, so long as you have your shit together while your in classes. I do in fact have my shit together, so I'll have a guaranteed job at NASA when I graduate, which pays $60,000/year

I'm currently living with my grandparents, and do not own a car.

I'm currently projected to have $75,000 (high estimate) in loans when I graduate.

I am actively pursing all job opportunities open to me, from minimum wage part time jobs, to work study on campus jobs, to summer internships at NASA.

Now, here is my question. Would it be reasonable for me to take out another $30,000 - $35,000 in loans (total) in order to live on my own? 

On the one hand, that would put my monthly loan payments at roughly 25% of my monthly income, up from about 17%. And most places I've seen say don't exceed 10%.

By the way, a good percentage of my loans are private, so income based repayment will only help me but so much.

**Personal Information**

On the other hand, living at home is stressful, to say that least. It comes down to three things, really. First, I'm in a really bad neighborhood (one of the more ghetto parts of Washington DC) and sometimes I don't get back from classes until 10pm. I haven't been mugged or anything similar for 3 years, but as I take more advanced classes I'm starting to get home later and later so I don't know how long that will last. Second, my commute is roughly 3 hours, round trip, which should speak for itself. Third, I'm an LGBT person. Whether or not that disgusts you is irrelevant. It's important to my financial situation in that if my grandparents find out, I'd say there is a 40% chance they kick me out, 60% chance they add an unbearable amount of stress to my life. Both cases would lead to me having to move out before I graduated anyways. It's unlikely that they will find out, but the danger is still there.

Anyway, all of those issues would go away if I could rent an apartment. Now the question is, would that apartment be which the significant loan cost? Clearly I would prefer to move out, but I am unsure as to whether or not loans eating up an extra 25% of my income (or rather, an extra 8%) for 10 years would leave me so unstable financially that I wouldn't be able to live. I think it won't, since...

**Calculations ($/month)**

+$5,000: Income

-$1,200: Loans

-$1,200: Taxes

-$900: Apartment

-$200: Medical

-$200: Transit

-$200: Food

-$200: Misc

= $900"
zyk2m,12,2012-09-16,"Hey Ladies, I need some ""real world"" advice.",domin007,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zyk2m/hey_ladies_i_need_some_real_world_advice/,"So, I'm a commuting college student who still lives with her parents.  I just recently started working for Jumpstart, a program that goes into lower-income preschools and helps provide a quality education for those kids.  Because I'm going to have around 12 hours a week with this job, I asked to only be put on during the holidays at my cashiering job.  However, my parents aren't happy with this and think that I'm not going to get a job during the summer because of this.  

For some background:

*  I'm a Neuroscience major who is taking 3 fairly intensive classes right now, one stupidly easy one and one that unfortunately requires a bit of effort.  I also want some time to see my boyfriend who I don't often see during the week.  I know people can work 30 hours a week and go to school but I'm have a strong need for some non-stressful social interaction.

*  Jumpstart and Big Lots pay the same (I thought my Jumpstart income wasn't taxed but they said it was).  However, Jumpstart is an Americorp program so at the end of my term, I will get a $1175 education award as well as be part of this alumni network.  Heck, I already got a free American Eagle hoodie from there (our team won our pre-job recruitment and I'm not gonna lie, this is the softest hoodie I own).  

*  When I talked to my manager about possibly being on the schedule just one day a week, he said he didn't like that and it would either be no days or two days.  Although 10 hours isn't too bad by itself, you also have to put into account commuting time (which is pretty hefty coming from my college) and that drain of unfulfilling work.  

*  I'm also applying to be a Peer Educator, where I educate people at my college about sexual abuse and rape.  This would cause the same problem as JS with my parents but I want to do this and want to focus on Neuropsych (possibly being a double-major in neuro and psych).  I'd get a stipend and honestly, BOTH of these jobs seem like a much better resume builder than Big Lots.

*  I also realize that I need to talk with our internship office to see if I can get an internship for the summer (plus our college started this guaranteed internship program so I'm theoretically more likely to get one)

What do you guys think?  Should I have ""given up"" my cashiering job or was it impractical of me to do so?  "
zyihp,0,2012-09-16,Move across the country and she sent me home,addedpulp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zyihp/move_across_the_country_and_she_sent_me_home/,"This story is mind-numbing, and I hate writing it out... if I leave things out, my apologies. I've talked to friends, and they just say ""what a bitch,"" but this is a brand new side of her. Prior to this, we dated a year and a half and never had so much as an argument. I'm 26, she's 22.

She graduated college and I'm a freelancer. She got a post-college internship at a place... let's just say it's the happiest place on earth. She asked me to come with her, so I found an apartment I could afford, sold the majority of my unneeded stuff, and started applying to gigs in that area. It's about 1000 miles away. She lived 15 minutes away in the resort's ""housing,"" basically dorms with 6 people per apartment, all the same gender (very family directed resort).

It wasn't long after I got there that I got irritated by how little I saw her, maybe two or three times a week, usually nights, and often times she'd fall right asleep. They work them like crazy, so whatever. Then she started dividing her time between me and her new friends. Irritating, but whatever. I saw her less, which only bothered me because she couldn't incorporate me with her friends. I was there 2 months and only met a few in passing when I was at her apartment... which I wasn't allowed at. She said they ""just don't have boyfriends or boys they like over.""

One week, I saw her very little, and on my way back from a gig, I felt nice, well dressed, and decided to surprise her. She said she was just eating dinner. I knocked on the door and she answered, and seemed very startled. She quickly rushed me back to the car, and when I asked to use the bathroom (several hour drive from the shoot), she told me to pee outside, which she would normally not permit. When I left, she texted me ""sorry for being weird, don't think anything of it.""

She had told me about this pushy, douchey guy from work who liked her because she was the only girl with a boyfriend that wasn't infatuated with him, and he got her number from the employee roster and started texting her. She told me as if it were funny, laughable. Well, at the end of the week where I visited and was ushered out, she came over late and fell right asleep, all her stuff on the bed. She keeps getting texts, and I looked. It was a guy's name I didn't recognize. I proceeded to do two shitty things: I skimmed her texts with him. I was looking for a few things. There was no incriminating language, no real flirting, just bullshitting. However, I was never mentioned, which is what a girl typically does when she wants an aggressive guy to go away. And, the biggest issue, they had hung out every night that week, when she was too busy for me. They also hung out at her place, where I wasn't allowed. This included eating dinner, the night I stopped by.

I confronted her. She was half awake and thought I was being silly. She told me he's just a guy from work. I asked what the guy that liked her was named. It was the same guy. I asked if they had hung out all that week. She said she hung out with friends. I asked if he was included. She said sometimes. She repeatedly told me they were never alone (they both have 5 roommates, so no shit), and that they were just friends. I asked why she needed to keep it from me, and she said simply that she thought it'd upset me to know she wasn't spending her free time with me. Fine.

I then noticed a few days later she was logged in on her FB on my computer. I looked at it a few times in the next month. I didn't read her messages, but I did notice a trend. She spent most of her free time with her roommate. There were several occasions where she told me she was with her roommate, and her roommate had posted photos. I could see the ones of the two of them. However, in three different instances, there were other photos where this guy in question was present. I couldn't see those from my account, only hers. They were never in the same photo together. However, if I asked who she was with, she just said her roommates, or, in one instance where she went to the beach, ""6 people"" (which, judging from the photos, was actually her roommate, the guy her roommate liked, and the afformentioned guy).

I tried a half dozen times to talk to her about why she would lie, why she kept things from me, why I never met her friends. She rarely said a word; that's how she is, and I know that from the few instances where her friends back home got upset with her, but had never experienced it.

Over those conversations, all I got is what I already mentioned, and that her coworkers didn't accept outsiders; when she first started, one of her coworkers brought her boyfriend, and they ousted her and the boyfriend completely. I asked if he moved 1000 miles, and she said ""I don't know, no one talked to him."" Fucking children.

She also said that the whole situation, and being in a position where she now has to worry about the real world, makes her have ""doubts."" She couldn't explain them, but she did say that she ""wondered if this relationship was forever,"" which I said was absolutely moronic, because there's no way to tell, especially when you're so royally failing at ""right now."" I asked her repeatedly if she wanted to end it, she said no. She just hated that I was so dependent on her, which I told her she should have expected asking me to move somewhere where I know no one.

So, I came back home. The night before the last night I was there, she told me she was at her place with her roommate, when I had glanced over at her texting earlier that day and saw her roommate's name, the guy's name, and the name of a bar (she's not a bar person, at all). The next morning, she maintained she was just watching TV when I went to bed, but I looked on her facebook the next morning (from her account, isn't visible from mine) and her roommate had posted a picture of them in dresses that said ""before we go out tonight."" I confronted her about it, claiming I noticed the dress in her room, and she said she didn't wear the dress out, and that she never LIED, she just didn't tell me what she did after I went to bed. She almost seemed proud of it, like it was cute. She since changed her fb password, so her fb activity has appeared as if she hasn't been tagged in anything to me since.


I visited from friends. They gave me awful ideas, namely about that guy, or that she intended to send me home so she wouldn't have to end it in person, like a coward. I got furious. I got in the car and drove back to talk to her. About halfway, I realized it was insane, and texted her saying I did a crazy thing that day that I'd tell her about that night. I still had (and have) and apartment there. I showed up, expecting to catch her hanging out with that guy. She wasn't, she said he ""confronted"" her about his ""feelings,"" she said no, and he told her they couldn't be friends. I asked her why she felt building that relationship was acceptable, and she said she thought it was harmless if he didn't get the wrong idea. I told her he must have, and he must have thought I was pretty insignificant, if he thought his plan would work. I later spoke to her best friend about it, and she said she just can't let people down; she tries to make friends out of boys that are after her and it always ends up with a pissed off guy.

I thought that my showing up would shock her into honesty, or at least make her give me some time. Nothing. I spent more time at the coffee shop that weekend using the internet than with her; she went out with her friends several times (granted, she had plans, but I would drop mine if she showed up on my doorstep), and we only ended up actually talking for a few hours. The last night I was there, I took her to dinner, and after she tried to go home. I straight ahead told her that was absolutely unfair, and she made me take her to coffee shop to use the internet because I had mine uninstalled. Absolutely childish stuff; I guess avoidance can go to crazy lengths, or she really felt it insignificant.

I asked her repeatedly if she was intending to break up with me, and sending me home to make it easier. She said no, she just wanted me to have people to hang out with. She then told me she wanted to ""Wait for her"" until her internship was over. I told her I would, but considering all I did and how she treated me, I found it incredibly unfair. All she had to say was she must have only been thinking about the fun we'd have there (which we had little of, since her friends got all her free time) and not the commitment it meant.

So I came back. I've been back about 2 weeks and every day I get upset about something else. We text, that's about it. Lots of texts, but considering she avoids talking about issues, and she's vague about what she's doing socially, there's little to talk about. Every time I get upset (generally because she's out socializing and it reminds me that I had to come home for her to do that without guilt, or because I try to coax out something romantic or sweet and get little back), she tries to tell me she does care, and she is trying, but I tell her words mean little when actions are scarce. Granted, we didn't talk much the month or two before we individually moved down there, but I was moving out of my apartment of 3 years, finishing up work, selling my belongings, etc... and worry makes time go much slower, or I wouldn't be typing this.

I don't even really know what advice I expect. I just had to tell someone that wasn't a friend who says ""what a bitch"" and then gets high. I felt like I was taking a big step in my life and now I'm on a friend's couch. I don't want to split up, but she's really fucked up my trust in her. I hate that, now, every time she goes out, I get angry because I think she might be lying or telling half truths. I get angry that that did nothing and get her in person and I gave everything and get texts. I have the apartment still, and considered asking if she wants me to come back and try fresh now that she's settled, but she keeps telling me to ""build my career"" here, which is one of her ""doubts,"" that I'm 26 and freelancing... but that just infuriates me that she asked me to drop my clients here and then expects me to get them back again that the season is over. I don't know why she's trying to keep it going if she doesn't want me, which she says she does, that she wants to ""miss me."" I have no clue.

TL;DR: Fuck."

Also, I'm a candidate for Beta Alpha Psi (accounting frat) but I'm not a member, should I include that on the resume?

I also studied computer/electrical engineering for two years at uni. I can program a bit in Java/C++ (and yes, more than just ""Hello world!"", and I'm OK with JavaScript (and HTML/CSS), is there any place for that on the resume?

What sort of numbers should I put on the resume to stand out?

I know the ""Objective"" section is controversial, but if I do keep it, should I repeat the job I'm applying for as in this example, or specify it down to ""Obtain tax internship with accounting firm"".

I had struggled with porn and faping since I was 12 and the longest I ever went before was a week and that was because I was at a youth camp. Porn had destroyed so many opportunities. I constantly struggled with social anxiety. I was never in control of my emotions and would direct my outbursts at those that I love the most. So I took up the challenge and I lasted 21 days! I could think better, I was in control, I was the man I always wanted to be.

Then I came home. Lasted about a week before I went back to my old habits. And now I'am back where I was before the summer. My motivation is gone even worse than before. I can't talk to people. The only good thing is that I have been able to keep my workout regiment. 

I'am back where I was. I will rise and damn it this time I will not fall. And if I do fall I will not lay in my misery of self pity. I will rise a new with my teeth and claws covered in the blood of the old me."

But I still don't know the reason for how I feel and was hoping I can get some input on how to deal with it.

I just got back from a 6-month internship in Chicago for work about 2 weeks ago and will be living with my mom for a while until I save up enough money to move out. Last night, I get home earlier than expected from a friend's house and decide to go to my room upstairs and watch some tv for a bit. As I walked by my mom's room, I heard her talking to someone whose voice sounded really familiar. I have no freaking clue why but my dumbass decided to look through the crack in the door. When I did, I saw my mom and her friend's son fully naked walking into her bedroom shower together.  I know, stupid move on my part but I wasn't thinking when I decided to look.

Right there, I felt sick to my stomach. I went into my room where I began to hear faint sex noises coming from my mom's bathroom. I felt like shit, was upset, and a little bit jealous in an over-protective way. Again, I have no weird feelings like that for my  mom whatsoever but I don't know why I was feeling the way I was. Anyway, I hid in my room until he left, I began to feel sick about what I just found out. 

My mom's friend's son and I went to the same high school and were in the same grade. But we were never friends (not in the same social circle) but we weren't enemies either. But finding out that he is screwing my mom pissed me off and makes me dislike him. As childish as this sounds, it makes me want to screw his mom as payback. I only told my really close female friend about this and she said that my ""jealousy"" and anger might stem from the same over-protective feeling any guy has when someone says a ""your mama"" joke to him. Like I feel like the guy is using or ""defiling"" my mom's body for his pleasure. I know, sounds stupid but she may have had a point.

Should I confront my mom about me knowing? Should I confront the guy without getting into any physical altercations? Do I have a right to feel upset about this? How do I deal with this? If anyone has an idea, let me know. Feel free to PM me too if you're afraid you'll get downvoted to oblivion I guess. I just need some input. Thanks.

zy9p8,81,2012-09-15,A thank you to nurses (VERY long but I want to thank you for changing our lives.),giraffeplusahalf,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/zy9p8/a_thank_you_to_nurses_very_long_but_i_want_to/,"Two years ago on September 11th, I was called at 4:30 am by my boyfriend's roommate, he told me that my boyfriend was drunk and he needed help.  I got out of bed and drove to my boyfriends house to find him on the floor having a fit of seizures, throwing up, and basically emptying every possible bodily fluid on the floor of his room- and immediately called an ambulance (I was furious at his drunk idiot roommate for not calling an ambulance before calling me, and for somehow mistaking this for 'drunk').  There was blood in his ears and nose.  I was terrified.  I had no idea what was going on, seeing as at this point in my life I was finishing my last semester as an art student and preparing to head out to California for an internship at an animation studio.  My boyfriend was passing in an out of death, and becoming increasing more unresponsive as time went on.  I did what I could remember of CPR from when I was forced into CPR certification classes when I Was in girl scouts as a child.  It felt like an eternity went by while waiting for the ambulance.  The paramedics came in, took him and left into the ambulance.  Four more ambulances showed up over the next ten minutes, and each pair of people piled into the one ambulance, every time the door opened I could see him being defibrillated, intibated, and fussed over.

He was life flighted immediately to a bigger hospital, and one again to an even bigger one, and yet another, eventually ending him in Pittsburgh's UPMC presby.  I followed him in my car across Pennsylvania, crying and completely unaware of what was going on. I heard everything from doctors claiming that he must have been using heavy drugs (I would tell them he wouldn't touch drugs, but no one believed me), to a stroke, to an aneurism- but no one knew.  When he arrived at UPMC I was informed quickly that my boyfriend had been born with an AVM, and had never suffered any symptoms, so when it ruptured it came out of nowhere. 

Over the next week I lived out of the waiting room, and eventually a hotel room waiting to hear what would happen.  My boyfriend couldn't talk clearly, and was experiencing living memories in his room from our previous trips to Pittsburgh, such as giraffes and elephants. (Before all this) He was very confused, and only slept when I was there with him holding his hands.  He lived in UPMC's ICU for a full week waiting to have a massive soft ball sized blood clot removed from his skull so he could beginning attempting to heal.  No one attempted to even pretend he would make it, some of the nurses couldn't even look me in the eye while I sat for hours next to his bed (he wouldn't let them place, or remove IV's without me there, insisting that he would die if I were to leave).  His vital signs faded in and out, as he was pumped full of drugs all day, every day.  After a week he had become as stable as anyone could have hoped, so they took him in for surgery.  I was so scared that the last time I would ever see him was now, him with tubes in his skull, tubes in his throat, tubes in his nose, and me with my head on his lap trying not to cry, while I told him I loved him and would be there the whole time.  He told me he loved me, and they rolled his bed down the hall.

There were no complications, and he came out of surgery, and was returned to his room in a drug induced coma.  The nurses told me he was sleeping and he would be for a while, so I sat quietly at his bed side and talked to him.  He woke up saying my name, and his nurses came rushing in to help him and do their inspections of him.  His blood clot was removed, the trouble zones cauterized, and his skull stapled and stitched.  

Over the next three days, my boyfriend's nurses tried to teach him how to do simple movements again.  He was left with full paralysis on his left side, to the extent that he couldn't move his face, see out of his left eye, or even release his arm from a clenched fist.  He could talk, and he remembered everyone, but was still fully confused about where he was.  All of his nurses were more than either of us cold have ever asked for.  They talked to him, they laughed with him, they talked to me even.  I remember one time I got so upset I went out and sat in the hallway on the floor by the bathroom and cried.  One of his nurses came out and sat next to me, put her arm around me and told me how much he needed me, and told me how important it was for me to be strong for him, so he could be strong for me sometime when I needed him.  I dried my eyes and re entered my boyfriend's room to find him laughing and joking with one of his male nurses, as the nurse was using a mirror to show my boyfriend his stitches and staples on his head and asking if he knew what they came from.  My boyfriend told the nurse that it was from a helicopter blade that sliced his head open in 'Nam.  (my boyfriend was 25 at the time- and was not in any wars- he works as a cook.) The male nurse laughed, as the two of them made up fake stories about the war, and talked as if they were best buds.  This nurse was so amazing with my boyfriend, laughing and talking, asking about life, sharing dog stories and pictures (they both had dogs), he asked my boyfriend every time he entered the room if he remembered what happened, and why he was there (probably close to fifty times a day for three days straight) until he finally could remember why he was there.  Another one of his nurses had a fabulous sense of humor, she understood how embarrassing it was for my boyfriend to be incapable of helping himself do anything, and went out of her way to make sure he felt comfortable.  I remember one time she came into his room and asked him if she could get him anything and he replied by touching my face with his functioning arm and saying no.  He then proceeded to get a full on erection, and then turned red and apologized- she laughed and said cheerfully to us ""well at least we know that still works!!"" Her fabulous sense of humor for things that otherwise would have been hugely embarrassing for someone made it possible for my boyfriend to feel okay about the things happening to him.

 There were four nurses specifically that went WAY out of their way to be great to my boyfriend, not only by providing amazing medical help, but also by being his friend- they didn't treat him like a problem they wanted to get away from, but instead they treated him like a person, with family, friends, thoughts, and emotions.  After about a week and a half (it seemed like months) my boyfriend was moved to a physical therapy rehab hospital in our home town.  When he left we was carted out on a bed, unable to move his left side still. (not even a finger wiggle.)  

The paramedics saved my boyfriend's life, and the nurses kept him alive and through their care, and hard work made it possible for him to be who he is today.  He since, has regained full movement, is finishing his final year at college, working at his job full time again, and is now acting strong for me while I go through nursing school (that nurse was right).  These nurses (at UPMC and Health South, his rehab facility) not only helped my boyfriend but they made me realize that I had made the wrong career path choice when I initially went to college.  I am now enrolled in nursing school and am on my way to becoming an RN.  I have hopes of one day being able to provide even HALF of the support, knowledge, kindness, and expertise of these nurses who changed both my life, and life of my boyfriend.  

On the off chance that even one of his nurses is not only on this website, but is able to identify with, and remembers this situation and my boyfriend and I, from both of us we would like to say Thank you.  He is unable to remember you, or any of his stay at UPMC, but I will remember you for the rest of my life.  You changed two lives for the better, and I want you to know how grateful and appreciative of you, and your hard work we both are.  We recently made a visit to the hospital, hoping that we might find some of you to say thank you in person, but we failed.  

If you are by some chance one of his nurses, I wanted to write this to say thank you, and to let you know that all of your hard work helped my boyfriend to regain movement, and he is living a normal life two years and four days later.  All of you nurses are some of the most amazing people on Earth, and even if you didn't have anything to do with my boyfriend's brush with death and recovery, I want to thank you too for every little thing you do at work every day- even if you think it goes unnoticed, just remember-  there may be someone like me who notices it, and appreciates it more than you may ever know.

For the bottom of my heart, Thank you."
101rxz,4,2012-09-17,My boyfriend [20M] and I [20F] were long distance this summer and I made some stupid decisions involving another guy - how should I deal with this?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/101rxz/my_boyfriend_20m_and_i_20f_were_long_distance/,"Let me preface this by saying that I can be extremely naïve and I trust people more than I probably should. I am also exceptionally verbose.

I [20F] have been with my boyfriend [20M] for almost two years. He is beyond wonderful and we love each other very much. We spent this past summer on opposite sides of the country (US) due to our respective internships. 

I met someone at my workplace this summer, we’ll call him John [25M], who I hit it off with right away. And when I say hit it off, I just mean that it was easy for us to talk and we became friends. Eventually John asked if I wanted to hang out outside of work. He had been getting a little flirtier and, upon some reflection, some of the things I said could have been taken as flirty as well. That night I went home and called my boyfriend and told him about John asking to hang out. My boyfriend said he was fine with it as long as I promised to be careful.

The next night John and I ended up at the beach after work. We swam for a long time and then sat on the beach talking until it got dark. I was planning to head home but John asked if I wanted to grab dinner first. I saw no harm in it since all we had done was talk and agreed. We had a great conversation at dinner but at the end he asked if I wanted to go back to his place. I was taken aback but managed to get out that no, it was time for me to head home. I told my boyfriend about the whole evening and he said that John saw all of it as a date and that he was trying to get me into bed. Understandable conclusion.

I went to the beach by myself the next night and got a text from John asking where I was. I told him the same spot and a little while later he showed up with two friends (a guy and a girl) who were staying with him. They brought alcohol and offered me some but I said no. Note that it was about a half hour drive back to my place. I hit it off with his friends and they ended up asking if I wanted to head back to John’s place. We were having a lot of fun so I went.
When we got there, they convinced me to drink and around midnight/one everyone was getting sleepy. By this point I was a relatively drunk and knew I couldn’t drive home that night so I had to stay at John’s. His friends had already taken up the couch and blow-up mattress so I offered to sleep on the floor. John said he had somewhere else and led me upstairs. Thinking there was a guest room, I followed. He took me to his room, pointed to his bed and said I could have half. Here’s where I’m completely at fault.
I told John I’d be fine with the floor but he said “No, c’mon this is easier.” Naïve me said okay. I climbed into bed staying as far to one side as I could, thinking I’d actually get half the bed. He climbed in after me but got really close to me so we were on the same side. After a minute he said “You’re really timid aren’t you?” At this point I was drunk and sleepy and didn’t bother making sense of that. Then he slid his hands up my skirt and started groping me. I kept saying no but I’m pretty sure it came out a pretty weak, sleepy, “noooooo” instead of “NO!” He stopped but ended up trying again a couple more times. He ultimately got the message and didn’t touch me again. The next morning we both got up and I said thanks for letting me stay over and then left.

My boyfriend had called multiple times the night before and left me a bunch of texts. I felt awful. He assumed I’d gone to bed early and was asleep. I called him, planning to tell him everything but he was so worried and upset that I’d put myself in that situation that I couldn’t bring myself to tell him the worst part. He knows everything up to me being in the same bed with John but I couldn’t bear to tell him that over the phone. 

My boyfriend and I finally got to see one another yesterday for the first time in three months and we had a beautiful day together. I had been planning to tell him the rest of what happened that night but couldn’t get it out. I’ve been sick about this since it happened a month ago and I don’t know what to do. John and I stayed friends at work but we’re not keeping in touch or anything now that my internship is over. I wasn’t upset with John because, to be fair, he didn’t know I had a boyfriend. I’m, again, at massive fault for never telling him. It just never came up naturally though that’s a horrible excuse. I should have told John I was in a relationship. 

I’ve told a couple people really close to me what happened and all of them have said not to tell my boyfriend because it would just make things complicated. I feel like I cheated even though I never kissed John or responded to his advances, but my friends said that I didn’t cheat. I’m not sure what to do. Should I tell him? I see him again tomorrow but I don’t know if I should bring it up. At one point this summer he told me not to tell him anything that happened between me and other guys (he was jealous that I spent a long time on the phone with one of my best friends, who is a guy), but this is different.

I’m so sorry for the bloody novel I’ve written you and I applaud all of you who made it through. Actually, I applaud anyone who made it past the first couple sentences. Any advice would be very much appreciated. And I won’t be offended if you just came here to tell me I’m an idiot. I truly deserve it.

TL;DR  My boyfriend and I spent the summer on opposite sides of the country because of our internships. I hung out with a guy I worked with and ultimately got drunk at his house and spent the night in the same bed (though I didn’t let anything happen). Should I tell my boyfriend?

101qa8,10,2012-09-17,My thoughts on the industry (reporter since 2007),lsmucker,RealJournalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealJournalism/comments/101qa8/my_thoughts_on_the_industry_reporter_since_2007/,"When I started reporting, it really wasn't my first idea. Prior to writing in college, I had started out as a mass communication major, a film major and then an audio major before my parents, in an effort to get me to graduate, told me I had only two more years to graduate. My junior year, I was on staff for the Columbia Chronical, Columbia College Chicago's school newspaper. 

After graduating, I sent out my resume all over the US in hopes of getting a position and finally received an offer as a paid internship at a small daily in Amsterdam, NY. They offered me $12 an hour and I basically got fill out my own time card and was paid for mileage. It was a good job, but I realized after a while the nothing my teachers taught me really applied to the position. They didn't teach me about covering board meetings. I never really learned how to use a camera and I never realized how my stories would be chopped and up and rearranged by the editor without my consent. 

After about a year, my job was cut and I was left with a decision of whether to stay in New York and work a low paying job or look once more for a job. I found a promising position at another small newspaper in Sutton Nebraska. I went expediting a young staff and a great paper and found a place where people were trying to get out as soon as possible. I found out why after many empty promises to pay me for milage and a paycheck that bounced. From there, I was just about ready to give up. I moved back home in effort to get my life back together and eventually found a position at a newspaper in Clinton, IL. The manager was great, the pay was generous and I was covering sports. He eventually left the paper during my first year and I was promoted to managing editor only to have it snatched away from me and my sports position eliminated by a scumbag publisher. I then moved out to Pontiac, IL where I have been working for a year and a few months. Already, there are talks about positions getting cut. 

So, what you can take out of this is what you want. I am not a bad worker, I always worked what I was given and was willing to learn. I think what I have learned is that print journalism is more of a lifestyle and less of a job. You have to be able to work hours outside of the 9-5 schedule. You have to be willing to go above and beyond the call of duty. You have to be willing to stick with it, no matter what the outcome. You have to be able to learn and absolutely have no fear of talking to people. 

There is good stuff too. I can't even tell you how many times people have thanked me for what I wrote. How many people have told me they got calls from friends they hadn't heard from in years. How many people I have talked with about serious loss or about serious hope with me. How many people I have inspired and that's only the ones who have contacted me. 

The love this job is to love constant change. To be able to take the good with the bad and to be happy and upbeat through it all. :-) 

I wish for each of you to have at least one good editor who pushes you to do better and who believes in you. I love this job and can't imagine doing anything else. Even after all that. "

100t0a,3,2012-09-17,Should I tell my neurologist that I smoke?,KaminaMaximus,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/100t0a/should_i_tell_my_neurologist_that_i_smoke/,"So here's the thing. I was diagnosed with Tourette's when I was about 8 or 9. I'm 20 now. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD. I've always had trouble focusing and remembering things, I'm pretty much constantly in motion. I have to make a conscious effort to stay still. Anyway, I've had these symptoms pretty much my whole life, but I never really thought about it too much. After losing my financial aide at school, I realized I need to do something about it.
I've only been smoking about 2 years, the first year of which I probably smoked less than 10 times. This year I pretty much smoke everyday. It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep and have even a little focus on anything. Anyway I recently switched doctors and during the initial interview I said that I have smoked before. I said that I started 2 years ago and smoked very little last year, and a little more this year. It was an intern or something filling out a paper and she didn't seem to care much, but I don't know how my doctor would react. My doctor referred me to a neurologist and I was wondering if I should tell her that I smoke. I'm really worried that it will affect my diagnosis even though I've had these symptoms my whole life and started smoking recently. I could really use some help"
100rsn,6,2012-09-17,"Just found you guys, this is my story...",[deleted],Trichsters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trichsters/comments/100rsn/just_found_you_guys_this_is_my_story/,"* I'm 22. 

* When I was 15, in 9th grade, I went through an Emo Angst phase and grew out my hair (it had always been cropped short). Lame. And it got me pulling from the top of my head, I don't know why or how it started.

* Grew out of the emo phase by the start of 10th grade, but I kept pulling my hair a bit. It's a long time ago, so I forget.

* Eventually, I transitioned to eyelashes. For the remainder of high school, my notebooks would be full of them when you'd flip through the pages.

* Then, I went to the pubic hair. After some close calls getting caught with my hands down my pants, I stopped. 

* University started, and that's when the eyebrows got bad. When studying, reading, etc, it's just such a natural position to rest my right arm close to my right eyebrow, and pluck. It's not too bad, though, some of my friends see me do it and mention it but I don't do it hardcore, so my eyebrows aren't that thin.

* 3rd year university, HUGELY stressful exam, it gets bad. Studying for almost a day straight, the lateral half of my right eyebrow was just a few hairs. It was bad enough for people to notice. My brother's friends asked me: ""Dude, wtf is up with your eyebrow?"" and that was embarassing.

* 4th year university, I had internships and a research thesis - very, very little stress and barely didn't pull, but I still get the urge when I'm reading and my hand defaults to that position.

* Grad school, today, I'm not that bad. I really, really try to keep my hands busy and my girlfriend always reminds me when I'm doing it, but my eyebrows are still much thinner than I'd like them to be. Often, when I'm alone and can't control it, I ""pet"" my eyebrows, rubbing the hairs, and really try to resist pulling. I often end up with a lot less pulled hairs than before.

**So, /r/Trichsters:**

* Do the eyebrows grow back, in your experience? Will 100% of the hairs grow back or did I likely kill a few roots and my eyebrows will be thinner than normal forever?

* Does stress commonly affect pulling?"

3) If they were NOT to renew, would the trio continue working together? And would it be in Anthony's Compound?

4) Is there any interaction between O&amp;A and HooHoo behind the scenes? The tension seems to have subsided a bit over the last couple years but there are still a few jabs every now and then (mainly from Opie).

5) How much of the tension with Management is real and how much is just for the show?

100j1d,1,2012-09-17,"Life past high school, I may have grown apart[18m][18f]",Ak5nowman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/100j1d/life_past_high_school_i_may_have_grown_apart18m18f/,"Good evening. I have been thinking about this for a few months now and have come here for advice. My gf and I have been dating for roughly 5 years. For the past year, senior year of high school, she was living with me and my family because she was kicked out. She really have no communication with her mother or father, but has a great relationship with her grandma. I always thought living with her would be amazing and we would have the greatest time. Man, does living with someone show who they are. It's not that anything big was a red flag but the littlest things would really bug me. Like not picking up dropped stuff in the shower(soap, razor, etc) to leaving her stuff all of my desk.

Anyway, this last summer I did a program to help me transition to college life, took a few classes, did an internship at the largest oil producing company in my home state, etc. During those 2 months I had the chance to meet some really great people, non of which are dating material. Regardless It still opened my eyes to the people out there. I have been dating the same girl since 8th grade, I haven't seen what else is out there. Did i mention that she is my first girlfriend. This summer program made me realize that we really don't enjoy many of the same things. I mean sure, we may like a couple things but she doesn't enjoy the thing I live for. I Live to ride a snowmachine(snowmobile for you southern folk). She never wants to go and she hates the snow, while i love it.

I was able to drive home 50 miles to see my family. When I would get there she wouldn't say hi, she would expect me to. When I felt it appropriate for her to welcome me I wouldn't say anything to her. She would then proceed to go back to her room and pout about it. I find it annoying as hell, she expects me to initiate everything, and pouts if I don't. It got to the point that I didn't want to talk to her, it was always because she was upset. On some of the longer weekends we would get through that and all we would do is have sex. We would never go out, or hang out with her friends, or mine. I'm not to fond of her friends. Also, I feel like she has being like dependent on my family. Like she doesn't have a life outside of me and that makes it hard on my.

I've finally grown to the age where sex isn't everything. I don't want a relationship where all that holds us together is sex and I feel that is what I have. I feel that it will never be the same even if we tried to ""restart."" Restarting wouldn't change her perspective on riding a sled. I feel obligated to stay home and not go to my buddys house.

As big of a douche bag as I would have been I was going to break it off while she was down in college. This is where it gets tricky. My family has invested so much into her, shes really dependent on them. Shes the way that she got to college, the reason shes in the one she is. My sister drives over from her school on long weekend and takes her around the states. I feel as if I would be dropping her on the street if I were to break it off. Actually I feel like my mom would be disappointed in me. I feel like I should talk to my mom but I am actually scared to. It doesn't help that my gf is down in a college where shes got nobody but her roommates whom she just met.

I'm really in need of some advice here. Would I be an asshole if I broke up with her while shes down in college with nobody?

tl;dr Gf of 5 years is going to college in a different state. My family is invested in her and is the only thing she has. We don't have much in common, my eyes opened to life outside of high school.

100i5z,1,2012-09-17,If only the past could be changed and not be a waste,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/100i5z/if_only_the_past_could_be_changed_and_not_be_a/,"I feel like I failed.  I got a useless undergrad degree and then got a useless graduate degree with no future in the places I want to work in the most.  I have tried and tried to get good jobs, but it has failed too many times.  yes, I know people are dealing with unemployment, but this almost feels worse.

I originally thought I wanted to study medicine in college, but found out I wasn't cut out for it soon after taking the undergrad courses.  I was lost then and went into a major that didn't completely lose all the class credits I took.  I also was in a long distance relationship that probably should not have happened as it shifted things for me a bit too.  Studying an interdisciplinary major for the environment was a bad idea.  Later, I went into a masters program in urban planning.  A year after I was in there, at least I ended the relationship that was a mistake outside of the lessons learned.  I found out I was bipolar during this time.  Overall, now I see I should have gone into something better and applied myself.

My current boyfriend is in medical school after growing up in extreme poverty.  He was motivated to change his life after finding out a life in bad choices and poverty was not a way to live.  He enrolled in community college, worked full time, and went out of his way for perfection.  He studied all night after only two hours of sleep each night to get perfect grades.  He eventually got a fantastic degree and used it to get to medical school, where he is almost finished and doing fantastically there.  He is a top candidate for what he wants to specialize in.  The point of all this is, I feel like a useless asshole after looking at him.  I love him, but his success is a reminder of what I am not.

I now am working in a job that is with people who only got about a high school education at the state in a place that has no future and is not in my field.  I got it after over a year of unemployment which was depressing already on its own.  My co-workers resent my being there even though they have no idea how much I am a loser from my choices in the past.  I cannot get into the EPA or any place that I want to work because I chose useless fields and obviously therefore did not apply myself.  It feels like I lack the intelligence and drive to get anywhere.  I feel no passion enough to get up and get going into something.

I cannot feel anything but useless.  After seeing my boyfriend and what he has done.  I love him so much, but it hurts to see how hard he works while I was so lazy.  I wanted to try and fix things to help my career by talking to the person who was over my internship who now lives in another state with a great job.  They recommended getting an International Code Council zoning inspector certification.  I had hope then and bought the books to study for the test.  Now I cannot focus on studying them because it just feels dead.  The only thing that was good out of my past was that somehow things led me to adopt my dog and meet my boyfriend who I have been with for three years who is the love of my life.  My family, friends, and boyfriend know how awful I feel and keep telling me it will get better but I disagree.  I am 27 now and have too much student debt to go to school and start over as well as just am too old.  

The only things that hold me back from trying to die are that I don't want my dog to be alone, my debts I don't want someone else to pay after death, and my boyfriend not having someone to help feed him and finally the knowledge that if I mess up, I will probably have brain damage which is the only thing worse than my current circumstances. I just feel so useless and down with no future in my career.  I keep trying to tell myself that people have survived worse things, but it still doesn't seem to change how I feel.  

I want to call the person who counseled me in the past but I don't want to bother them since they are dealing with their own major health issues.   Plus, what will it honestly do?

I feel so lost and hopeless in my purpose in life.  I don't want to live through another person or in their shadow.  I want to be my own success but it feels so hopeless.  Is this going to be the rest of my life?  If so, then I just feel that once my debts are paid, it may be time to finish my brief existence.  I know ending one's own life is considered shameful, but what else is there when you pine the past that should have been different."
100g9b,60,2012-09-17,[FR]iend showed [ME] something in his attic.,xiggolthorp,Thetruthishere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/100g9b/friend_showed_me_something_in_his_attic/,"Just found this subreddit and love the concept, I have a few encounters that I had considered sharing with nosleep but never did because I want to share them with 
people who might believe me. This particular post will involve my best friend Jeff, I will let him read over everything before posting these encounters just to make 
sure he is comfortable with the content. This isn't the first time I've encountered strange, unexplainable things in my life and I plan to post more on that at a 
later time.

The most interesting paranormal event concerning Jeff occured during the summer of 2011 while I was out of town. The majority of this even I heard about from Jeff and
had I not participated in two crucial parts I would not believe him. During that summer I was at an internship 1,000 miles away but since we were good friends we talked
on the phone quite often. He started telling me about hearing strange noises in his crawlspace above his garage, (he sat in the garage while on the phone and they keep
their refrigerator in there.) After weeks of hearing these noises he took it upon himself to climb up there and see what sort of animal had made said noises. He was on
the phone with me while he climbed up there. He told me at first that he didn't see anything, he then told me he saw something moving in the corner, then all I heard
was a shout, a crash, and a lot of cursing. Jeff told me he fell out of the crawlspace because something up there ran at him. He said it was too big and sounded more
curious than scared. 

This is his description of what he saw ""It was not quite human and not quite animal in shaped. This thing crawled on all fours like a human but was way too fast. It
was on the smaller side. Only about four feet tall if it were to stand up.""

I thought at first that he was pulling my leg but he kept assuring me that he was telling me the truth, he suddenly said that he thought he wanted to get out of the
garage for a bit and would call back the following evening. During the following weeks Jeff's past time of our conversations was sitting in the garage and staring up at
the crawlspace trying to get a reaction out of whatever was up there. He told me that it was still scratching around occassionally and made some strange gutteral noise
that sounded somewhere between a goat and a cow. He did eventually climb back up there but didn't see the thing though he did find some evidence of something being up
there. This is his description of what he found "" I found where something had been moving some things like boxes and insulation. Slightly into the crawspace I found a 
burnt old scrap of paper with a symbol on it. I had never seen the symbol before and the paper would later disappear without a trace. For along time before and after a wierd sulfer
smell would be coming from there. I checked there was no gas leak and nothing I could connect it to. It seem to just be in the same spot I found the paper.""

He also told me he would hear what sounded like something scratching inside the walls. He heard these noises when sitting in the living room which shared a wall
with the garage and went on to say that he heard the scratching come from the connecting wall. A couple months after this all started up, it stopped completely and has
not reoccurred since.

I only had two personal encounters with this thing, one of which was over the phone. One night as we were on the phone he told me it was making that noise again. This
night he was in his room but could hear it from the garage. So while we were on the phone he walked into the garage, put the phone on speaker, and stood under the crawl
space. I know Jeff did not make this noise because he was in mid-sentence when it cried out. He did it justice by saying it sounded like a combination of a goat and a
cow and something about the noise made my skin crawl even though it was over the phone. The other encounter occured while I was visiting home in the middle of my
internship, I was over at Jeff's and as we were watching a movie in the living room late at night we heard the scratching coming from the garage. I was terrified but
Jeff and I went in there to see what it was. Jeff was about to climb up when I grabbed a broom handle and pushed up against the panel of the crawl space. I pushed it up
2 or 3 inches before I felt pressure on the other side slam it down. Jeff tested the panel himself and couldn't budge it. We left it alone for the rest of the night.

We don't know what it was or what made it go away or what even made it appear in the first place. I understand that the way I presented this might be a bit dry but I just
wanted to state the bare facts without any embellishment. Jeff and I will answer any questions you have and I will tell you more of my experiences with and without Jeff
if this goes well."
10064i,7,2012-09-16,Sex-based hiring discrimination?,teremamoogiefutchay,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/10064i/sexbased_hiring_discrimination/,"   When I was a teenager trying to work during the summer- it was so hard for me to find a summer job. However my sister- who is a couple years younger never had too much difficulty. I would always end up working somewhere shitty like subway while she got to work at the mall or as a waitress at a local restaurant. 

One summer a new frozen yogurt place opened up near my house- and we both filled out applications. I was actually called back for an interview- but when I got there the owner was surprised to see that it was me. He asked me ""where is your sister?"". Apparently he got our names confused, and wanted to hire her instead of me. This was few years ago now, but I think I remember him saying something along the lines that- they were really looking for ""pretty young girls"" to work at the place because the business was new. 

Well I mean from a business perspective I guess this makes sense- I would guess that hiring attractive young female workers might bring in more business. However, how is this not sex-based hiring discrimination? There are so many places that obviously do this- like so many of the stores in the mall- why don't they get called out on this? 

Now that I am working on my engineering degree- I think I am going through something simmilar again. One of my girl friends in my major got this really good internship with Nav-Air this past summer. We both applied to this- and we have very similar GPAs and everything. However she was the only one out of the 50 (of which there are only 5 females) in my major and my year that got this. I'd hate to say it- but I really think it had to do a lot to do with her being a woman. Ok so I understand that engineering is a mainly a male dominated field- and employers try to attract more females. But still- it somehow feels unfair to me."
1003ue,0,2012-09-16,Help needed with potential long distance(TL;DR/Very Long),[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1003ue/help_needed_with_potential_long_distancetldrvery/,"I am 19 year old male.

This is a general overview with some key specifics to give you a general idea of the situation.

Just a quick disclaimer. This is a very long story and I think some of the details are important. If you stick with it and finish it, thank you. If not, I understand.

Last summer I went to another state with my family to aid with a domestic disaster relief effort. We stayed with another family for a week or so, and they were very hospitable. We are both of the Muslim faith, and similar in our degree of practice. They had a daughter, who is 1 year older than me, who I thought was very beautiful from the first moment I saw her. However, we did not get to talk much as we were mostly in a parentally supervised environment. Before I left I was able to get to be friends with her on Facebook. At this point, my feelings for her were just a crush, and I realized that.

Back in my home state, I decided to message her and thank her for her families' hospitality. We ended up talking over fb message, ironically, for about a month. At that point I cut it off and became absorbed in a new semester at my university. Roughly a middle of the way through, she messages me and we begin to talk again. This time, however, I am caught up in other girl issues and am just talking to her normally as if I would any girl.

As it turns out, the side girl issues fade. But as her and my mom kept in close touch, they invite me back to their home(by myself) for an internship opportunity in their area. So I go their at the beginning of the next year for two weeks.

The first week, nothing happens. Then starting the next week, as the situation would have it, we end up hanging out with each other until the early morning hours watching movies, talking, etc. Each night it seems things get a bit more physical between her and I(I would say she initiated it mostly). I'm talking serious physical, like wrestling and other things, not dinky stuff. The last night before I leave, things get a bit heated and we make out. This is a crucial detail. As a Muslim(not going to debate about whether it was right or wrong) with a more or less traditional mindset and with not too much exposure to women, for me this seems to be a big thing. For her, she had previously been in a relationship for 2 years. However as Muslims we cannot engage in premarital sexual activities, so I don't know how far they got. I talked to her about afterwards, as there would be a large distance between us(multiple states) and we eventually we ""decide"" to keep in touch over facebook so our rents don't find out and banish us to Siberia.

Mistake #1 --&gt; I should've talked to her about whether or not we were, I suppose, ""together"" or not and expressed what I wanted. However, I didn't and that's what we came up with. fail

I come back and I am completely at a loss as to the status quo. Whether or not we are together, etc as we failed to work that out. As the days go by, she texts me and we talk. However, I never am the aggressor and I do not call her or hit her up as much as she did to me. The texting and calling seems to slow down. Whether she was busy with school or anything else, I have no way of knowing for sure. I talk to my dad (and friends) and tell him everything. He tells me that I should tell her that we can be friends and see where it takes us, as we can't do anything right now(b/c distance &amp; life goals). Some of my friends say similar things.

Mistake #2 --&gt; should've shown more interest(call, etc)

Valentines day comes along, and I send her flowers with a nice message and some chocolate(most I can do working with the distance). However, that same night I talk to her. I say that I don't know what to do about the distance and about us. She agrees and says shes not ""looking"" for anything right now. However, there is no distinct cut off. No one says that we are not going to talk to each other anymore. I apologize for making out with her the last night b/c of our Islamic restrictions. She says we both share the blame. My feeling for her are the same though.

Mistake 3 --&gt; Shouldn't have shown uncertainty/followed everyone else's advice

It is interesting to note that when I was with her in person, I was confident, in character, etc. When I came back, I found it hard to display those same things through text or phone call. I'm better in physical interpersonal relations.

Still feeling the same way I text her, and get more and more pressed, as I realize that she is not exactly showing the same amount of interest as she was earlier. I'd say I text her every 2-3 days. sometimes every day, sometimes every other day. I don't want to crowd her. In a last ditch attempt I invite her to a trip abroad with a humanitarian mission that would be a great opportunity for her and I. I tell her I like her in the message and want to get to know her better, however, I hear nothing back regarding that.

Eventually I call her and tell her that I still like her and want to make sure we are on the same page. She says she ""likes me as a friend"". Basically I get friend-zoned.

Against other people's wishes I maintain the invitation to the trip, I'm not a douchebag.Turns out she can come with me for the trip. I'm skeptical as to her motives; it would be a great opportunity and look good on a resume. I cut off communications with her unless absolutely necessary(i.e. pertaining to the trip). She hits me up a few times to talk, mainly about the trip, sometimes not.

The trip happens, and I'm guilty of still thinking that maybe something will happen. However, I seem to have lost all my confidence that I displayed previously and instead come of as tense. We have an alright time, sometimes she invites me over to watch movies. I don't push the boundary, I stick to what she said/wanted and keep it friendly. We go out on the last night before she leaves. She dresses up, saying that her mom wants her to dress more like a lady. Friends say that it was a sign she thought it was a date. Either way I'm oblivious, dinner goes well but without crazy event. I give her a bracelet I bought at the market earlier as a memento for her for the trip. She says she doesnt want it but I give it to her anyways. I wish her well in her future endeavors, thinking that this will likely be the last time I see her in my life. She leaves the next day. I text her every night afterwards and describe her what I did to make her not feel left out. Eventually I come back to the states.

Mistake #4 --&gt; Tense when I was with her alone; showed lack of confidence. Didn't perhaps make a move. But I wanted to be respectful of her and her wishes. I didn't want to come off as a douchebag.

I come back home. For some reason she maintains contact. She texts me maybe 1-3 times a month and asks some general questions about me and my life. I don't respond very well as I don't know what to make of it. As time goes on, however, I see the things that happened in an objective light and realize that I still do have some feelings for her. I remember our time together before the intl trip very often. Many times a day in fact. It seems to be bordering on obsession.

I ask her for the photos she took from the trip for a school report. A friend takes my phone one day and texts her that he wants one of the photos to be of her. she replies with just a what and I save face after retrieving my phone and say it was my high friend. She asks if he is my wingman. I confirm but also point out that he is high. Regardless, this weekend I text her again and she seems to be very friendly. Against my surrounding peers wishes, I chose to end the conversation and not throw any flirtatious bombs at her.

The problem is, I still have feelings for her. However, shes so far away now and I've botched my chances. Not clearly botched them, but relatively botched. I know getting a girl back via text messaging is stupid, but I don't know how to approach this. I'm not sure if I'm obsessed or what.

I guess what I want is neutral opinions on what happened. What do you make of it?

And if I were to continue ""pursuit"" how should I go about it? I'm not a good texter or phone caller. It's just not how I interact well. Is it still even possible with the distance between us? I've heard girls are selective with their time; how does that fit in here?

Or should I just try and let it go? If so, how? I seemingly have not been able to do it for 8 months over a ""small thing"" like making out, but it is what it is. I'm not going to fool myself.

As for seeing each other often, its more chance that that happened. We don't plan to see each other in the near future. It just worked out like that.

Dates:

7/11 : Met her last year in July

1/12: Went back in January; where all the shit went down

6/12: Went abroad with her

9/12: the current month

Thanks reddit for reading. Again, this is a general overview with some key specifics to give you a general idea of the situation. I wont mind any tl;dr comments, because it is lol. I know I'm still a young guy, but I just don't know what to do.

103lza,2,2012-09-18,"Low GPA and extracurricular activities, lots of work experience. Looking to join public accounting.",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/103lza/low_gpa_and_extracurricular_activities_lots_of/,"Hello r/accounting!

First of all, awesome sub. Lots of valuable information here.

As stated in my title, I wish to join the public accounting industry as an auditor. Like most people here, I am VERY interested in joining one of the Big Four and due to its highly competitive nature, I have a few question to ask you informed individuals &lt;3. Background:

I am currently a senior at a UC (University of California). The campus does not have a very good reputation, but the Big Fours do come to recruit from the campus yearly. My overall GPA is 2.9 and major (Business Admin/Accounting) is 3.1. I am also a member of Accounting Society. Unfortunately, we do not have a chapter for BAP. I also do not have any sort of leadership role in any organization. I, however, was a peer adviser for the international students along with 20 other people for a year. Now, before you jump the gun and think, ""Holy shit this guy is a fail LOL,"" all of these are because of my work obligation. 

I have been working since 8th grade in my mom's business. It's a franchise retail business of a F500. The company is a leader in the industry. As mentioned, I have been running the business alongside my mom practically for 10 years. Whenever I'm not at school, I'm working. Mind you, the work also has pretty terrible hours. During school time, i would be putting in ~20-25 hours/wk and during break time ~70 hours/wk. I am compensated by my mom for working ~180 days/a year and I finance 100% of my college-related expenses. 

So, thanks to this job, my times are pretty limited and makes it especially hard to focus on internship and school activities. As much as I hate it, work comes first, no work = no money = no school :(. Plus, graveyard hours are holy crap terrible for working students.

Now, this work has to somehow have a positive impact on my life to make up for all these limitations imposed by it. The work is very client-oriented. Like auditors, we are practically always on client site. In my case, my clients are major grocery stores (Walmart, Ralph's, Albertson's, etc.). When my mom first bought the business, it was bringing in ~200k in revenue. 11 years later, it's averaging ~600k/year. Since it is our business, we are naturally hard workers. Working 12 hours/day is the norm. Luckily for me, this job had given me a lot of positive qualities that can be leveraged for other jobs. 

* **Clients relation**: because my mom does not speak English, I am the main communicator (even when I was a cute little 12 year old boy with 3 years of English experience). The work involves me communicating to the store managers and my district managers and working out a plan to increase sales. Driving sales is a win-win for both the clients and us because we are on a 100% commission deal. So, as the only one that can speak English, I grew up learning how to maintain a positive relationship with the clients and any other beneficial entities.

* **Details, details, details** - Due to the nature of retailing business, we have to constantly keep track of the accuracy of our inventory count, and thanks to my awesome young vision, that is also my role. On a daily basis, I am responsible for keeping track of the products coming in/out and what is in the truck and make sure that all the physical counts match with what's on the paper/invoices. It sounds pretty easy, and believe me, it is pretty easy. However, it becomes pretty challenging when it involves thousands of individual item on a daily basis. Like the balance sheet, at the end of the day, we want the physical count to match with what is on the paper and any missing items = $$ loss :'(. 

* **Accounting experience** - It is also our responsibility that we keep make sure that the invoices on our end matches with what the corporate has. On a weekly basis, we would be given a weekly settlement and my job is to make sure that everything adds up. This was my first accounting experience prior to college and it was pretty natural for me to scan through stack of papers for mistakes. 

* **Customer Service** - Customer service is probably my biggest strength when it comes to this job. We are there at the client site providing service 363 days a year (stores are closed on Christmas/Thanksgiving :/ ), whereas our competitors take 2 days off per week. Thanks to this, we are seen as reliable in contrast to our competitors. For example, this past Labor Day, my products are supposed to sell really awesome and I planned out # of displays and their locations with the managers at Walmart to make sure there are no missed opportunity. Well, the following day my competitor came in and was amazed with how many displays we had up and went to ask the manager for some. He was responded with: ""We can't give you any."" Naturally he was furious and asked why he cannot have any when I had so many up. The managers literally told him: ""Well, you are not here 7 days a week like *my name* and you're going to be off on Labor Day, so how can I trust that you can keep up with the demands?"" 

Now mind you, this competitor also carries Walmart private label brands and for the manager to told him off in favor of me/my mom is a huge recognition on our service.

So, this is becoming extremely long and I just got back from work (I start at 2 AM) and about to take a nap. My question is: am I in the position to leverage my work experience enough so that recruiters would look past my low GPA, no leadership role, and lack of networking with them? 

Thank you r/Accounting for reading my long, uninteresting concerns :) I will now take a nap. Thanks again guys!"
103lur,5,2012-09-18,"So I'm Thinking of Breaking Up With Evangelicalism... Need Your Advice/Prayers, /r/Christianity",KingCrimson250,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/103lur/so_im_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_evangelicalism/,"So here's the deal. Been evangelical for most of my Christian life. That's the tradition that I encountered Christ through, and the tradition that nurtured me through my early Christian years.

The problem is, though, is that I've gone off and gotten my undergrad in theology, and that's opened up a whole new world of Christianity to me. I've begun reading more and more broadly, and its begun opening up a new thirst to learn more about who God is.

Why is this a problem? Because in my experience, evangelicals really don't like the idea of people being well-read. I know that's a harsh thing to say, but it's true. Every evangelical church I've been to has kind of got it's pet list of authours and pastors that you are expected to agree with, and if you don't agree with them, or if you question them, you're treated differently, like you're obviously not quite at the level of spiritual maturity they want you to be at.

The evangelical churches near me are huge on guys like John Piper and D.A. Carson, authors who, while good men serving the Lord, aren't people who I have a great deal of respect for on a theological level. 

But here's where the problem comes in: I find that within the framework of these churches, I can't honestly pursue God, because I'm expected to kind of fit into this New-Calvinist mould, and if I don't, I'm given these disapproving looks and suggested a Piper book that I would ""really benefit from reading.""

And so it's all kind of come to the point where I feel as though evangelicalism is attempting to interfere with my pursuit of God, because they're so wrapped up in ensuring that everyone adheres to their personal approach to Christianity they end up demonizing anyone who disagrees.

Telling people that I'm an egalitarian who doesn't believe in YEC was like the evangelical version of ""coming out."" And the big problem is, I'm not just a church-goer. I'm a wannabe pastor. I've been doing training and internships for church ministry. And if you're a member of the leadership team in one of these churches and you start asking these questions, then you're REALLY in trouble. Which to me makes no sense at all. Your faith journey doesn't just become cryogenically frozen because you've started getting paid full-time for your ministry.

I actually had an entire denomination of evangelicals shut me down and refuse to work with me just because I wanted to do my M.Div (or MTS, not sure yet) at a seminary that leans towards egalitarianism!


And so I'm really coming closer and closer to breaking up with the evangelical church. I call it breaking up because that's really what it feels like. I've got an emotional attachment to this church, and they're great people and they do great things, but there are too many problems in our relationship and I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life with them. 

But I don't know if things get any better outside of evangelicalism. I've reached a sort of theological moderateness, which means liberal Christians don't like me because I'm too conservative, and conservative Christians don't like me because I'm too liberal, so I don't really feel as though I fit in anywhere.

All I want is a church where I can honour what I perceive to be a calling from God to enter into full-time ministry in a church (because I've tried other things, other methods and ideologies of ministry. They're good, but there's something about working in the church itself that just feels ""right,"" almost as though it's where I'm meant to be) while still being faithful to my pursuit of relationship with God.

Any advice?"

I was never keen to hard work, I was pedaling along, finishing assignments, rarely doing anything extra. I was a fairly good student in school, mut nothing marvelous. I was second-to-last on the list of students accepted to my high school, and in the last 10% of students accepted to my major - psychology. I can't say it was bad though, because my high school was the 3rd best in my 600 000-inhabitants city, and there were 18 candidates per 1 place at my major. But that doesn't matter. 

All that time I was merely a guy who just wanted not to fail the class/test/whatever. No scientific circles in college, no conferences (well, actually I went to one during these 5 years, just one), no scholarships, no extra internships, the average from my grades was 3,6 (on 2-5 scale). One of the reasons for choosing this particular major was that I heard it was easy. Also, I had almost no friends from my faculty. I was a procrastination lord and master and I hated myself so much for it. ALL my attempts at self improvement, getting better grades/whatever were a perpetual streak of failure after failure. Now I have a master's degree in a science that, I admit - is very interesting for me, but nevertheless, the small amount of studying and extracurricular activities I have taken make me feel incompetent. 

At some point things started to stirr up. I had a nasty, nasty breakup with my girfriend, and it took me a year to free myself from being depressed. As a consequence I took part in two student exchange programmes, so I spent two semesters out of my city, and, what's more important - I started to think a lot. About myself, about what I want, about who I am and who I'd like to be, and about where I'm going and why. But I couldn't change the way I behaved, no matter what, and it left me being as ambiguous about my major as I always were (so strongly ambiguous). This has led me to start therapy and I have been going to a therapist for 6 months, that was as much as I could afford. What I did in therapy and in my own, private ""search"" made me understand more, and with time, I began slowly improving. I can do more of the stuff that I want to do, I procrastinate less. It's my first steps, I'd say I'm at 10% of the change I want to achieve, but I think something finally moved - I've started noticing this since a couple of weeks.

Anyway, because I felt I didn't really get the most of my studies, and because I don't really see myself working in my field right now for a number of reasons, I decided that I'd prefer to do something else in life, at least for now. This whole time studying psychology, I was thinking about engineering, but I was always afraid that it'd be too hard for me. I always found this field to be very interesting, though. On my 4th year in college I tried to enroll to a technical university and I failed. Next year, which is 2012, so now, (5 years after high school) I retook my post-high-school math test and tried to enroll again, but failed to get myself accepted to a public engineering programme that I wanted most (in my country public, free of charge higher education is considered better that paid education). So I said, fuck that, Imma apply to paid studies. Same college, same major, but I pay for classes. 

So here I am. I started classes today. I'm on a brink of the most difficult thing I have ever tried to do. Even though I do have a plan B (which is a career in psychotherapy or HR), I'm scared shitless. I don't want to make resolutions about how I will now change my ways forever, because I did that a million times with little result (at least until recently). 

I just want to try to do stuff right this time. It's going to be fucking hard, and motivation and self-organisation is what I need. That's why I posted this here. I don't have a lot of support in my friends or family, and I just wanted to get all this out of my system.

My overall GPA is a 3.0 (accounting GPA is lower than that) and I know I don't have a snowballs chance in hell in ever getting hired by Big4. I'm doing my best to try and network, but I guess I'm just terrible at it. I went to the ""Meet the Firms"" event last year and didn't land a single internship. I'll be going to the golf outing this year to try and network as well.

Anyways, on to my question...there is pretty limited time and hundreds of students at this event, so I may not be able to get to every single firm...should I just visit the smaller firms and cross my fingers, and then get to the Big4 later on if I have time?"
102zvl,1,2012-09-18,Fiance's younger brother accidentally knocked a girl up.,[deleted],childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/102zvl/fiances_younger_brother_accidentally_knocked_a/,"Backstory:

My fiance M26 and I F23 have been engaged for two years. We are set to marry next October. He and I are CF, and I am finishing school while he is working (he already finished his master's).

His younger brother, 23, spent the summer working at a casino as an internship for cooking school. He does not have a degree, but has left about two degrees halfway, and his parents are left to shoulder the costs. We are hoping he finishes cooking school. 

My fiance got a call from his mother this past weekend, and she shared some news. 

The brother knocked up a summer fling. They waited four months to tell his parents, and it was obvious he didn't want to do so, and was scared to share the news. His parents had somewhat already heard, since the girl was dumb enough to put it on FB before he told his family. 

Oh, and he decided to move across the country to be with her. They've known each other for like two months.

She is in school as well, and it is our assumption that she will not finish. Thus, the brother will be left to be the breadwinner, and probably not finish his degree as well.  

My fiance's dilemma is this:

His parents always bail his younger brother out, and he is concerned that this ""accident"" will prevent his folks from retiring and finishing the payments on their house. (They are almost done paying for it.)

He does not get along well with his brother, as he is angry at all of the mooching he does on his parents. (My fiance has been financially independent for years, and sees all this mooching as irresponsible).

My fiance wants to send his brother a message pretty much telling him that he'd better not ask to be bailed out, blah blah blah.

I seem to think that since they don't have a good relationship, the brother will take any aggressive message as bad, and ignore it completely. My idea is to reach out to him, but more in a manner of advice. 

Any ideas on how to best communicate to the brother that he'd better not expect to be saved once again by his folks?"

What I am here for is not help or advice with social work.  But I came here to vent and ask advice on my own life.  I am 22 and for as long as I can remember I have been depressed and think about death most days of the week.  I have never told anyone about the way I feel because I am afraid too.  The reason I came here is because you guys are fellow social workers and here in Chicago fall is starting which makes me more depressed.  During the darker seasons (fall/winter) I feel much worse.

I do have moments of happiness when I am with my friends on Saturday but that happiness is fake as it only lasts so long.  The rest of the week I put on a fake smile and people actually think I'm one of the happiest and funny people they know.  But in reality I am lonely and want to kill myself majority of the time.  I know I wont go through with any of my thoughts but the thoughts I do have are starting to bother me and get old.

I've gotten in this overly optimistic mode and I feel like the reality of everything that's happening to me is slowly setting in and I'm trying to block it out.

First of all due to being behind in schoolwork and house upkeep, this is the second night in a row that I have stayed up all night. Yes I know it's unhealthy but this is one of those rare times where I just NEED to catch up.

Speaking of which I have concerns for graduation. Due to a late start to the major, a high unit count (17-19) for the past year (including the summer), I haven't really had time to look into jobs yet. All the other Accounting majors already have internships now or jobs lined up for later. A online community I enjoy for accounting research is making it clear that I am nothing more than sub-par in terms of qualifications. It's making me very cynical. I am a positive person but lately I've been saying/thinking some really negative stuff. I feel irrelevant...like I'm ready to do something important but no one is noticing me. There was a meeting on campus today that didn't go well and some people were not very encouraging.

My dad had a PET scan today because there is a tumor in his kidney and suspicious fluid in his stomach. I am taking it well. I think. I don't know. Ignoring it. Telling myself it will be alright to the extent that I don't think anything is wrong with him. After all, they can just go in and remove everything. He's 55 and I'm just 22, nothing is going to be wrong. But I feel weird about it.

They put my childhood dog to sleep yesterday so that's a part of home that I will never get back.

I am working on the side of school writing papers for a good wage in order to help support myself. That's why I pulled the first all nighter.

I have the rough draft of a big project due in 8 hours and I have barely started.

I'm doing this weird thing where my free time is intersparsed between my work so I never really sit down to just relax for a few hours. I'll just browse reddit for like a half hour then go right back to work then sleep then repeat.

I have a wonderful living area near a beach and an amazing girlfriend so I hadn't really been hit with reality until tonight when I stayed up again.

It's starting to affect me all the fatigue and everything. For like the past four hours I haven't done anything really. You can probably even tell by the randomness of this post

So my question: I have class in the morning, 3 hour break, then class in the afternoon. I MUST be in these classes, I was gone a week due to bacterial bronchitis and used up absences. How do I space everything...like how should I spend the 3 hour break?

I was blissfully happy until tonight. It's one of those ""I feel it all"" days. Up to now I was just incredibly happy.

As of right now, I'm a 2nd year Mathematics major at UT Austin, 3.04 GPA, I have a little experience with Java, Python, and Excel, I have a leadership position in my fraternity, my only job experience is high school math tutoring and possibly working for the office of admissions at my university (will hopefully hear back soon), and I'm currently in Probability, planning on taking P/1 in the Spring.  I'm willing to go anywhere in the US for a summer internship.

The reason I ask is because if I didn't get an internship, I would just take summer classes and end up graduating a semester early.  I really don't see a point in doing so, especially considering how much I love college and college life.  I'm already relatively young for most people my grade (won't turn 21 until the summer before my 4th year) and want to enjoy my nonworking years for as long as I have left.

On the other hand, I have thoroughly enjoyed my Calc I-III sequence and I'm currently taking a proofs class and Linear Algebra I. I feel that Math is more difficult to teach yourself than programming is. Also, it seems my school's Math department has much better professors. 

I probably want a job programming though. Do Math majors have luck finding these jobs? Could I still get internships that CS majors normally take?

I could live with myself if I don't find a programming job. What other techy/mathy jobs should a Math major look for?"

",Kelso22340,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/102256/introduction_and_an_explanation_of_my_current/,"I wanted to start by saying that I've been lurking here for quite some time and I have been inspired and amazed at some of all of your awesome progress. Seriously, as someone who has struggled with weight issues ( a lot being psychological ) I am brought to tears some times with how great some of you have improved your lives. 


I have dealt with feeling over weight for most of my life. Not seriously over weight.. but enough to make me uncomfortable in my own skin. I guess that all started around 4th grade. But, it took me until middle school to have an absolute melt down. I remember getting back my school pictures in the beginning of 6th grade and literally running to my moms car crying. I also hadn't grown into my adult teeth yet and I was convinced I looked like a fat bever. I begged my Mom to help me lose weight. She gave me tips and I joined every sports team that was offered to me. This is what I consider my eating disorder phase of my life. I became so obsessed with what I ate, I even got mad at others for eating things I couldn't around me. Thinking back on it now, it's sad to think that 12 year old me was that unhappy and obsessed. But, I lost all my chubby adolescent weight and grew out of my obsessive food issues by high school (no I was never actually diagnosed or taken to doctors, but now when this part of my life comes up my mother has said that she thinks she probably should have taken me to see someone). I went through the rest of high school as a normal teenager... not over weight but not skinny...[this](http://i.imgur.com/h2WgC.jpg) is probably the thinnest I was in HS ...around 16...looking back on the pictures now I can see how I gradually gained weight up till my [senior year](http://i.imgur.com/4NcxQ.jpg) Throughout high school I was a consistant 145-150lb ( I am 5'4)  ... I played varsity lacrosse and ice hockey... and RUINED my ankle. My senior year of high school, I went through physical therapy hoping that would fix my  ankle... but alas I was told I needed constructive surgery. 


My freshman year of college, I started out on the lacrosse team....but over christmas vacation [This](http://i.imgur.com/0ZSBa.jpg) happened. I didn't realize how little I would be able to do after surgery. I had to get rides to class... became very lazy... started smoking..quit working out...but continued to eat like an athlete.. and before I knew it I hated myself. I wouldn't look at myself in the mirror after getting out of the shower and I would never consider weighing myself. I talked myself into thinking that clothing stores had changed their sizes and that their cloths didn't fit real people anymore. I couldn't wrap my head around that I didn't fit into any of my cloths anymore... I seriously just couldn't grasp it. It took till the end of my sophomore year of college,[picture](http://i.imgur.com/6Q81J.jpg) and another [picture](http://i.imgur.com/3gI5O.jpg),when my lacrosse coach told me that I either needed to drop 30+ pounds or just not bother coming back to the team. Well... most people would say screw you and walk off the team... but after realization that I needed to weigh myself and that I really did want to play on the team and get back in shape.... I cried a lot and then decided to get on the scale. Mind you the last time I had weighed myself I was 145...and in my head.. thats what I still was. But I got on to find I weighed 170lb... and on my 5'4 frame....thats a lot to have gained. Especially considering I thought in my head I was still in shape.... So I joined the TEAM weight loss group at my local life time fitness and the whole summer of 09' I spent working out at 5am and watching everything that went in my mouth. In august before I went back to school. I had [lost 25lb](http://i.imgur.com/PyAlB.jpg)and was hoping that my friends at college would know how much effort I had made. Well, my team mates... and my room mates definitely noticed. I'll never forget how awesome it felt when I showed up at my apartment and my room mate opened the door and yelled... WOAH WHERE IS THE REST OF YOU. Unfortunately my coach didn't acknowledge my weight loss... but he didn't kick me off the team either...it felt great when all of my team was congratulating me in front of him. I don't think he really expected me to man up and do it. I played lax for the last two years of college and we had our own problems butting heads over other issues... I was always the team emotional punching bag for my coach. 

My weight fluctuated a little bit my last two years of college.. but not a bit to really make a difference... but now that I've been off living in different states for my internships... and not on a sports team... I am having a very hard time maintaining and losing the extra weight I put on after college. I moved to atlanta last fall and made a ton of friends... went out all the time... drank and started smoking again.. so of course I gained weight. I moved to connecticut last winter.... had no friends... became depressed... worked out constantly but I didn't eat enough... So I didn't lose weight then either.. I went up from 147 to 157 this past summer and am devastated... I am now living in savannah GA... and I joined a gym and havent smoked since last year... but I am again having a hard time losing weight... I have tried cutting calories... and that will work for an extent... but I am unable to get under 150. I have been working on a lot of heart rate training lately... getting my heart up to my max HR... letting it come down and getting it back up again.  I am sick of just feeling alright about my weight and I want to get the extra 15lbs off that I was unable to get off when I lost weight in college... I figure that if I post my situation here that I will hold myself accountable some how that other people know what I am trying to do. I joined a soccer team here as well trying to get some more exercise in ( Ive NEVER played soccer before in my life!)... but if anyone has any help with plateaus I am more then open to it. 

This is me [now](http://i.imgur.com/pibqf.jpg)
5'4 153lb 22 years old
and I am stuck. 
I know I don't have any huge loss to brag about and I feel like I look whiney in this post. But I figured if anyone knows about how to lose that last 15... its ya'll. 

Thank you for all your inspiration and positive encouragement loseit!

1021zp,6,2012-09-17,Best course of action when she is too busy to date?,kingofturtles,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1021zp/best_course_of_action_when_she_is_too_busy_to_date/,"I (20) met this  girl (20) a few weeks back and we hit it off rather well, spent the first week of school hanging out with each other.  Neither one of us brought up the word date, but they felt like one.  I asked her if she was dating anyone, and she replied that she was ""taking the year to focus on me, since I'll be so busy between internships, working, and school"".

After a week of being booked solid, she asked me to hang out on Saturday.  I agreed, and we had a lot of fun. Same deal the Saturday after that.  I'm just not sure what is exactly going on with us.  Am I a potential boyfriend?  A friend?  I would love to be in a relationship with her, and I feel like she is waiting for something to happen, but she pretty much explicitly stated that she wasn't looking for anything serious right now.  Should I just keep doing what I have been doing and see if anything comes of it? Or should I actively try something else?  Is there some way of finding out what ""we"" are?"
101zov,1,2012-09-17,"[22/M] led on by [21/F] for weeks, now it turns out there's a long distance BF. Is it worth trying to win her over? Or just forget about it?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/101zov/22m_led_on_by_21f_for_weeks_now_it_turns_out/,"The story starts when I met this girl through an online dating website in the spring. We had an unbelievable amount of commonalities; love to exercise, biology majors, identical fall schedules at the same school, similar interests, we even both live with our grandparents while in school! The list goes on. We went on a few dates but I didn't detect interest on her end, so I dropped contact and forgot about it. 

She texted me a couple weeks later, and a couple weeks after that, and I started thinking that maybe I was wrong and that she was actually interested. But then she left for the summer on an internship, only to contact me as soon as she was back in town, and a few more times in the days leading into the fall semester. 

Fast forward 5 weeks later, we spend almost all day, every day together in our classes, I've been in a cast so she gives me rides to school and to the gym, where we workout together. And when we aren't together we are texting each other. I'd had a girlfriend that I'd been dating almost 4 months, but broke up with her a couple weeks ago because I realized I felt so much more strongly about this girl. She is not that big of a flirt (she's acts a bit like one of the guys) but the signals were impossible to miss, even for my socially inept ass. 

So I finally ask her on a date, and she says yes, only to contact me the day of the date to say:

*""So I've been, for lack of a better term, in a long distance relationship with this guy that's in the navy for a while. It's a really weird situation, but I wanted to establish where you and I stand I guess. I have so much fun with you, and I think you're really attractive and you're smart which makes you even more attractive, but I'm worried that if I start spending more time with you I'm gonna end up in a position that I don't want to be in. If you would still like to go to dinner tonight, I will pay for myself. If not, I totally understand. I have been struggling with this since you asked me because I hate hurting people's feelings, but I don't want to lead you on/end up giving myself a reason to stay in [city] when I really don't want to be here after next semester""*

And after my reply, another:

*""I'm sorry. I really do feel awful, but I can't put myself in a position where there's a possibility of me liking you more than I do now, and it's more than I should anyway. Thank you for being cool about this. I'm sorry I didn't say something earlier.""*

I should mention, that I actually am exceptionally good looking (I know lots of people think this, but trust me), and a pretty good catch overall (if I do say so myself) and I've become quite used to winning over any girl I choose. But although I have dated my share of women, I don't date as often as people assume I would. I'm pretty picky to be honest. I'm either not attracted to the women that I share interests with, or find the attractive girls dull or too interested in partying. So to find such a match was astounding.

Suffice it to say, this rejection pretty much crushed me. I'm not a very emotional person and typically handle rejection easily, but I've never cared this much before. And to make things more difficult, I still receive rides from her each day, and we're still lab partners in class, and she seems content to be friends and continue on as normal.

But I dont know that I can do that, I feel more strongly about her than I have towards any of my long relationships even, and it kills me to be around her now. If you've read this far, I simply want advice as whether it seems worth pursuing her, as I believe she may have really been torn about this decision herself, or whether I should forget it and move on, like I usually would when finding out about a girl's relationship.

105wfg,3,2012-09-19,"[22/m] Temporarily moved back in with emotionally negligent parents, feelings of past resentment resurfacing. How do I make the best of things before I leave again?",file13bin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/105wfg/22m_temporarily_moved_back_in_with_emotionally/,"Hello Reddit, using a throwaway for this one because it’s pretty personal for me.  This will probably be a little long &amp; read like I’m on a therapist’s couch, so I apologize in advance. :(

I am 22 year old male that will be graduating in December &amp; has plans to move to the other side of the United States to start fresh with my life.  For the last 4 years, I have lived on an urban college campus, attending university. I just moved in with my parents (to save up money for the move) for my final semester &amp; am currently running into issues that I’m afraid will escalate if I don’t figure out how to manage them. 

Let me elaborate. 

I grew up an only child &amp; a latch key kid in a small town– my parents were always working and I would spend hours upon hours alone at my home. On the upside, this molded my into a very independent person. I later grew to realize my parents are very superficial people who hide their personal or emotional issues from others (even each other).  My father is emotionally negligent &amp; controlling (I think he may have some sort of OCD) while my mother grew up very sheltered &amp; is superficial/unable to accept that she's capable of any wrongdoing  (think similar to ‘sheltered suburban housewife’ meme - yeah).  This made for a very lonely upbringing where my emotional problems were rarely consoled by my parents.  I harbored resentment towards my father, as he always made me feel like I wasn’t good enough.  My mother seemed so submissive &amp; self-centered that she didn’t do much to help the situation &amp; I didn’t know what to do besides just swallow my emotions.  I never acted out, never revolted against my parents - I harnessed my resentment through the arts and became a relatively successful musician in the closest metro music scene. I did very well in high school, graduated with honors, &amp; coped with the loneliness… until I fell into depression in college.

My band that I had dedicated my teenage life towards broke up, I lost a lot of friends, got involved in a toxic two-year relationship, &amp; found myself popping in &amp; out of therapists/psychologists offices for a whole year.  I was diagnosed with chronic depression, severe social anxiety, ADHD – got put on &amp; off medications, lost interest in almost everything in my life, college GPA plummeted, confusion &amp; anxiety happened on almost a daily basis. I was going to drop out.

Then I got a surprise scholarship to study abroad &amp; spent a good portion of this last summer overseas in many foreign countries.  It was a breath of fresh air &amp; the best thing that has ever happened to me. I got back in touch with who I really am, stopped taking my meds, made new friends, and did well in my classes. I felt like my life had somehow escaped a car crash &amp; I had a whole newfound appreciation for everything.  I felt free to live my life, rather than be haunted &amp; held down by past experiences.

Now here I am, Reddit, in my final semester in college – staying healthy, working out, working a job &amp; internship, &amp; trying to stay focused on my studies.  But I feel like I’m starting to become undone again. It’s difficult with this living situation, I find myself slipping back into the person that I was before I left overseas – depressed, anxious, easily irritated, overwhelmed.  I’ve talked about my previous issues with my parents (Finally addressing the loneliness of growing up) &amp; I can tell they somehow, in someway, empathize with me – but I can’t help but feel they transformed my bad situation into OUR bad situation &amp; now they feel bad for themselves for not being “good parents” so it turned into a pity party.  And I don’t want them to feel that way.  But it does makes me angry that I feel lonely again in a situation where I reached out to them &amp; didn’t get anything of substance in return.  They just don’t know how to address my issues, which I don’t expect them to – but they also don’t really TRY to address them either.

I’m tired of feeling lonely but I don’t want this to escalate into something more – that’s the last thing I want before I move away.  Despite the resentment, I want to leave on good terms – I regret when I act out due to suppressed anger.  I don’t attempt to try and make them understand much anymore because I think we may never see eye to eye, and that’s probably my fault for staying silent so many years – they just don’t understand how much of an emotional toll it took on me. 

I feel like maybe I haven’t thought about the right way to go about things &amp; there is a way I can get through to my parents that I haven’t though of…? Am I doing something wrong? Or are my parents really just negligent towards emotional issues? If I can’t get through to them, should I just avoid being at the house as much as possible to avoid any issues? 

I need you’re advice, Reddit!  It’s only a 4 months or so until I’m out of this, but it’s a big turning point in my life &amp; I don’t want to regret anything before I leave them! 



**TLDR: Grew up with emotionally negligent parents, went to college &amp; became a sadass w/ depression, went overseas &amp; perked my happyass back up.  Now temporarily living at home again &amp; my happyass is starting to droop into a sadass again. Don't want to blast ass all over my parents before I leave. What do?**



Edit: Wow. That was really long. So I gave it a TLDR. Sorry.

105o0n,2,2012-09-19,2 weeks......and I'm in this really strange headspace!,MT84,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/105o0n/2_weeksand_im_in_this_really_strange_headspace/,"So I've been lurking on this reddit page for quite some time now.  I first found YBOP in June 2011 and immediately felt like I had found the answer to a lot of my problems (though initially I was probably unrealistically hopeful.  The longest I've gone with no PMO is around 35 days.  

I've been to two weeks several times in the last year and have always found the 2 week mark to be a turning point when some brain fog would start to dissipate.  I have to say, this time, not happening.  I just feel like I'm in this weird head space.  I feel very cut off from myself.  Could be about starting school and my internship (social work grad student).  So definitely a really stressful time.  

I'm hoping that no PMO along with giving up my internet connection at home (still can access internet on my phone for emergencies) will make a difference.  In the past, with every abstinence attempt, general internet browsing would be OUT OF CONTROL!!!  And eventually, the scattered mind from internet browsing would lead me to PMO.  

Here's to ending this compulsion I've had for like 13 years, since I was 14.  "

104y3i,9,2012-09-19,Need advice on learning to say 'NO'...,Cheeso,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/104y3i/need_advice_on_learning_to_say_no/,"Through, therapy, life, blah, blah, blah, I've come to learn that I'm not good to myself and I have trouble saying 'No'. This affects all aspects of my life...fml

It's empowering to know, but when I first realized this I felt like I got bricked in the face and trying to break the cycle I decided not to be hard on myself...

Anyways, the specific situation is that I joined a start up in February (I was jobless at the time) to learn and build my portfolio and started working a very demanding job a few months in.

At first, I was supposed to write content but now my boss has marketing and I'm not sure with the stress of my new job that I can continue..

I need to have 'the talk' to tell her how much I can handle. She's trying to grow her business and I don't want to just walk away but she's also become a friend and I feel bad that I can't handle both my day gig and this.

Also, at the start she said I'd have the freedom to do what I want with no mention of deadlines or specific goals so it seemed easy to handle given other commitments. Now I have other folks she's hired assigning me laundry lists of 'action items' for this unpaid gig.

How do you quit a job or internship without feeling bad about it? Especially if it's a friend? How do you determine it's just too much for you? The hardest part was realizing I'm just spreading myself too thin.."

**3.450** sleeping in fighters for **8 months!** 

Imagine yourself in your pyjamas, or like jaxspider in your birthday suit, on a random night, before the day you have an important appointment early in the morning. Before you are ready to enter the [magical dream world](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/) you quickly set your alarm before you forget it. You fall asleep, your head being cuddled by the soft pillow, not realising what tomorrow will actually bring you.     
The next morning your alarm goes off. It's one of your favorite songs which you decided to use as an alarm, because then you would wake up happy. You hate it now. And because you are getting irritated as hell, you turn the alarm quickly off.      
You turn your head, now looking in the shadows instead of the light coming behind of the curtains, taking a deep breath.     
*""I can rest for another 5 minutes""* you think, followed by a gape.       
Your eyes close slowly.       
You open them again but there is something wrong.      
You feel awake. *too awake*. You look quickly at your clock and realise that in the what seemed like 5 seconds time, an hour has gone by. And the three feared words rush through your mind resulting in feeling a cold shiver down your spine: *I'm too late*. 

Now imagine the fact that there exists a subreddit, capable of making that scene never happen in your life (again). Sounds good right? What if i told you it exists? ""Get Out""! You will yell.      

Well, I'm glad i had found this subreddit because i've had multiple encounters with the sleeping in experience. With some big impact as result. Let's not get into details, i will just say it had something to do with the following words: Friends, weekend, job, no job. So i am more than happy to feature this subreddit, for you.

/r/GetOutOfBed gives you the best tips and tricks to get out of bed or to improve your sleep. For every person whose brain [decideded](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/yytsm/august_28_2012_rmyevilplan_my_evil_plan_is_to/) to get him/her almost every morning, this could be the antidote. But waking up by using an [irish waking song](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=KgoczbY99OA) isn't enough. You need to get out of bed immediately.

So, are you getting excited to learn more about /r/GetOutOfBed? I had an informative talk with the friendly /u/ashrewdmint, moderator and creator of /r/GetOutOfBed, who will give you an idea of how /r/GetOutOfBed looks like.


&gt;##1.How did you come up with the idea to make /r/GetOutOfBed? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** At the start of this year, i really wanted to start getting out of bed regularly. I was inspired by other self-help subreddits and decided to start my own, just to see what would happen. Unfortunately, i have fallen off the bandwagon myself, but i'm glad to know that it's still a resource that helps others. 

&gt;##2.What sort of posts does one find here? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** Anything about sleep or sleep hacking is welcome, including tricks to get yourself out of bed. Sometimes people will post a nightly thread to announce they will get out of bed at a certain time in the morning or not to sleep in. 

&gt;##3.What is the best tip/trick you have seen posted? 
&gt;&gt; **ashrewdmint** a popular trick is to practice getting up in the morning by using this: http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/ 

&gt;##4.Can    you    tell    me    in     a    few    sentences    why    i    should    /r/GetOutOfBed?     A    reason    to    improve    my    sleep?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Well,    it    seems    that    sleep    is    really    a    challenge    for    people    in    developed    countries    and    we    never    seem       to    get     enough    of    it.    I    think    the    fact    that    most    people    have    a    hard    time    getting     out     of    bed    in     the    morning,    or    wake    up    uncomfortably    to    a    blaring    alarmclock,    is    a    sign    that    something    is    wrong.    Besides    just    the    quality    of    life    issue,    there’s    also    a    personal    motivation    issue    involved    with    sleeping    in.    I    want    to    wake    up    motivated    and    energized,    not    lazy    or    depressed.    And    I    think     that    you    can’t    really     isolate    the    selfcontrol    aspect    from    the    sleep    quality    or    health    quality    aspect.    I    find    that    if    I    get    bad     sleep,    forcing     myself    to    get    up    at    a    regular    hour    isn't    sustainable.    Ultimately    it    comes    down    to    what    you    want    from    your    life.    Do    you    want     to    feel    refreshed    and    energized    and    motivated     instead     of    lazy    and    complacent    when    you    first    wakeup?    Do     you    want    to    optimize    your    sleep    and    feel    great?    If    so,    then     I    think    those    ideals    naturally    lead    to    /r/GetOutOfBed.


&gt;##5.I   wake    in    the    middle    of     the     night     out     of     nowhere     multiple     times.     How     can    i    prevent     this    from    happening    again?
&gt;&gt;    **ashrewdmint**    Sleep    is    pretty    complicated,    and    I'm    not    too    qualified    to    Shell    out    advice.    But    I    can    list    things    that    have    helped    for    me    or     things    that    I'm    pretty    sure     will    affect    overall    sleep    quality.        

&gt;&gt;    1.Change     up     your     diet    if     you      have     any     digestion     issues.     I     eat     mostly     Paleo     and     that     helped     my      overall     health     and     sleep     quality.    Eeriment     with     cutting     out     certain     kinds     of     food     and      see      how     you     feel     afterwards.     Test     various     things     and     reflect     on     the     outcomes.            

&gt;&gt;    2.Limit     artificial      light     exposure.     This     is     probably      one     of      the     huge     things     that     has     changed     sleeping      habits     in     post-industrial     cultures.     Circadian     rhythms     are     ingrained      in     biological      structures     and     humans     are     no    exception.     Light     is     one      of     the     big      things     that    will     influence     your     clock,     and      blue      wavelengths     of     light      are     interpreted     by     your     brain     as     daytime.    If     you     are     in     front     of     a     computer     screen     or     a     TV     a     lot     at     night,     that     is     actually     going     to     decrease     your      brain's    production      of      melatonin      (a      hormone      that      makes      you      sleepy).      I     use      [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/)      to      change      the       color      of      my      laptop      screen      at      night.      It      makes      it      warmer      and     more     yellow-y,     which     reduces    the      amount     of     blue     light     that     would     be     in     a     completely     white     screen.     I      also     will     wear    red-tintend     glasses     or     goggles     to     help     mitigate     the     effects     of     regular     indoor     lighting.     In     the     future    I     want     to    get    prescription     sunglasses     or     something     so    I    can     do     things     at     night     and     still     see,     but     also     reduce     the     effects     of     bright     or     white     light.     I     also     want    to    see     what     happens     if     the    sunglasses     are     darker     and     if     having      dim     light     is     more     important     than     just     having     red/yellow-tinted     light.           

&gt;&gt;    3.Take     lots     of     Vitamin     D     in     the     morning—like 5,000-10,000     IU.     [More     about     that    here](http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/).                 

&gt;&gt;    4.Calm     down.     This     is     something     that     I     recently      figured     out.     Although     diet      and     light     exposure     do    have     effects,     it     doesn't     matter     how     great     everything     else     is     in     your     life,     if      your      mind     is    stressed     and     racing     and     you     can't     calm     down,     you     will     get     really    crappy    sleep    if     you     sleep     at    all.     At     least,     that's     what     I     discovered       for     
myself.     Here's       what     helps     me     a     lot:       

&gt;&gt;    * Have     a     regular     evening     routine,    and    stick    to    it.     Make    it    an    iron    law.      

&gt;&gt;    * Experiment      with     binaural     beats.     I     use     the     iPhone's     SleepStream     app     and     choose    the     ""Deep     sleep"" wavelength,     but     there     are     also     lots     of     binaural     beat     videos     on     YouTube.    I     haven't     fully     researched     real     studies     done     on     beats,     and     although     it     may     be     a   placebo,     it's      a     placebo      that    works      for     me.     And     if     it     works,      I      don't     really     care     how     it     works.     

&gt;&gt;    * Sit     without     a     chair     and     count.     I      like     the     [seiza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza)     position,     but     I     use     pillows     to     make     it      more comfortable     for     me.     I'm     not     used      to     it     enough     to     be      comfortable     without     it,     and     my     legs     still     fall     asleep,     but       I'm      getting      better.          
I    count     to     100     and     start     over,     counting     on     inhalation     and     exhalation,     but     only     going     to     the next     number      on      the     next     inhalation.     This     seems     to     help     focus     my     mind     and     it     helps     me     wind     down.     If     you     attempt        this     and      feel     restless,      anxious,     bored     or     frustrated,     it     means     you    really     need     to     do     it     and     you     should     keep     going.     The     more     you     feel     like     avoiding     calming    down,     the     more     you     need     to     calm     down.     At     least,     that     is     what     I     have     found     for     myself.         
   
&gt;&gt;    Anyway,     there's     a     lot     more     you     can     find     out     about     this     subject     and     I     encourage      you     to     have fun     researching     and     finding     things     out     for     yourself.     Unfortunately     I     don't     have     the     time     to     back    up     a     lot     of     what     I     am        saying    here    with     links,    but    it    is     generally        easy     to     find     where     I     am     getting     this     stuff     with     Google.

It is none other than InvisionCraft, a genuine Survival Multiplayer/Role Playing Game Server! InvisionCraft has actually been around for some time now. Almost a year to be precise. As a community, we have been through thick and thin. Our time here spanned out over three generations, which is why we're currently referred to as Generation X. But you are not the least interested in our history right? You want to know what makes our server worthy of your expectations. Haha, very well. We are a Survival/Role-Playing Game server that has recently become ""premium"". Our ""generation"" is approximately a week old, meaning there is much potential for anybody who decides to start today. We feature dozens of plugins (listed below) and several venues that may pique your interest. Such venues include The Mall, The Event Plaza, The Gallery, NPC Villages, etc. In addition, we try our very best to host events daily regardless of how many players are online. Some of our events include Unscramble, Trivia, Zombie Apocalypse, Hunger Games, PvP Tournament, Building Contest, Pig Race, End of the Line, and the King of Ladders. We strive to provide the best service possible. Our staff is always ready to assist players on the go. In short, we assure you of our best attention.

(see text inside as well)",Buschlightwins,Bulldogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bulldogs/comments/106ja1/i_need_help_bully_reddit_getting_a_puppy_this_is/,"My family has always had an english, and I love Hailey (our dog) she's going on 12 this year. I'm a college student, and I'll be graduating in December of 2013.  I have a great job already from an internship, and I want a companion.  I want to get my bully now so that I can spend the first 2 years training and spending a lot of time with him before I work my 9-5.

That being said. This ""breeder"" I found.  The puppies are NKC registered, and I'm told they have no health problems, and the parents are healthy as well.  The grandpa is supposedly Bishop of Naptown Bullies. (google him he's gorgeous.)

However I've only been in text contact with the breeder, I've spoken for a puppy, and it all seems really great.  I'm just a bit concerned about a few things.

1.) The breeder doesn't know my name, living situation, or anything, seems only concerned with selling the pups.
2.) I'm not really familiar with American Bully's.  My mom breed AKC English, but she's super busy with life and doesn't have to help me shop for a puppy, nor does she know the breed.
3.) Naptown Bully pups go for 1500 (male) 2000 (female).  Why is the breeder selling them so cheaply if they have such a great bloodline?

Lastly, I just want a friend and companion, somebody I can workout with, take in the car, go camping, and I can still have the bully personality in a larger, more active dog than an english.  If this is a puppy mill, or not great breeder, I can still help the puppy out, what should I look for as warning signs.

** Edit** Realize my link didn't work. 
 I'm getting a male for $500 He comes with first shots and worming, papers, and I was given a chance to visit, haven't got to head over there just yet though.

**Edit 2**
Thanks for all the warnings guys! I really appreciate the feedback and it seems to be about how I feel on the issue.  What I think however, is that this lady isn't really a breeder, she's simply attempting to make some return on the female she bought for 2 grand.  At least that's what I'm hoping.

I'm going on Sunday to see the pup and living conditions.  I'll be looking at how feedings take place, how happy the puppies are, any kind of lethargy.  The mom should be there and I can look at her, and hopefully the case is I have a lady who doesn't really know what she's doing and had a litter of great pups....

On the other hand. if it's a crappy situation, then I have a serious decision to make =("
1068q7,1,2012-09-19,I'm a Canadian citizen living in the US on a work visa.  Can I get a mortgage?,canadiamerican,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1068q7/im_a_canadian_citizen_living_in_the_us_on_a_work/,"Background:

I moved from Canada to North Carolina this past January for a job at a large engineering firm.  I graduated with a masters degree a little over a year ago.  My job pays well and is secure.  I have no debt and am aggressively saving for a down payment.

The Plan:

My company runs an internship program where new university grads complete three work terms at different locations around the county; each is six months in length.  They all say it is a huge headache to find an apartment and move their stuff each rotation.  I want to buy a large house, live in one room, and rent the remaining rooms to interns as they rotate through my location.

The Problem:

Since I have only been in the US for about eight months, I have a very short credit history.  I contacted a few mortgage loan officers (only large banks so far) and they explained that without a two-year record of employment, housing, and credit history, they are unwilling to work with me.

The Question:

What options are available to me?  Try to find a smaller lender that can work exceptions to these types of rules?  Try to get a mortgage through a Canadian bank?"

109c63,16,2012-09-21,"X-Post from /r/noFap, regarding ""Nice Guy Syndrome""...",boissonneault,relationship_tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_tips/comments/109c63/xpost_from_rnofap_regarding_nice_guy_syndrome/,"It applied to me and how I view basically my entire life. Thought others who struggle through certain relationship issues might find out somemore about themselves. 

Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/108jzz/nice_guy_symdrome_very_important_issue_for_fappers/

I'm currently reading a book about Nice Guy Symdrome. The author lists many characteristics of ""Nice Guys"" that i'd like to share with you. I used to be a ""Nice Guy"" before my NoFap challenge - i'm changing now. I think that you guys will identify yourself with many of those characteristics. One detail that the author doesn't know: ""Nice Guy Syndrom"" is TOTALLY related to fapping. I thank God and NoFap for saving me of this shit. Here we go:

Nice Guys are givers. Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and appreciate them.

Nice Guys fix and caretake. If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked).

Nice Guys seek approval from others. A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone's approval or avoid disapproval. This is especially true in their relationships with women.

Nice Guys avoid conflict. Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing things that might rock the boat or upset anyone.

Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.

Nice Guys seek the ""right"" way to do things. Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy, problem-free life. They are convinced that if they can only figure out the right way to do everything, nothing should ever go wrong.

Nice Guys repress their feelings. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel.

Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.

Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men. Due to their childhood conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, angry, or abusive — traits they link to ""other"" men.

Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others' needs ahead of their own.

Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center. Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate relationships.

What's Wrong With Being A Nice Guy?

We might be tempted to minimize the problem of the Nice Guy Syndrome. After all, how can being nice be such a bad thing? We might even chuckle at the Marvin Milquetoast behaviors of these men as portrayed in comic strips and television sitcoms. Since men already represent an easy target in our culture, the caricature of a sensitive guy might be an object of amusement rather than concern.

Nice Guys themselves frequently have a difficult time grasping the depth and seriousness of their beliefs and behaviors. When I begin working with these passively pleasing men, almost without exception, they all ask, ""What is wrong with being a Nice Guy?"" Having picked up this book and puzzled over the title, you may be wondering the same thing.

By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life.

The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys:

Nice Guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest . Nice Guys are secretive. Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence.""

Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.

Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.

Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.

Nice Guys give to get . Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.

Nice Guys are passive-aggressive. Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.

Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.

Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness.

Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.

Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.

Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises.

Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships. Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example: l Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem. l Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem. l It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be ""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness.

Nice Guys have issues with sexuality. Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.).

Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential. ""

108b7f,14,2012-09-20,I'm too sensitive about everything and I want it to stop.,hands_in_pocket,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/108b7f/im_too_sensitive_about_everything_and_i_want_it/,"I cry over the smallest of things and it's ridiculous.

The most recent incident: I just moved into a new apartment building and I went to do laundry for the first time here. I ran two loads (putting the second in when the other moved to the dryer) because I was told that you're allowed a maximum of two machines. I moved the second load to the dryer about half an hour after the first one. I assumed the drying process would take about an hour since that's about how long all the previous dryers I've used have been. I lost track of time a bit and went to retrieve my clothes about 20 mins late (i.e. about 1 hour and 20 mins after I put the first load in the dryer), and found that my first load - panties, bras, and all - was strewn across the table. Okay, whatever, someone needed the machine. I push it all into my basket and head back upstairs since I can't grab both loads at once. The elevator arrives and a middle-aged guy steps out. He takes a look at my laundry basket and asks if my clothes were the ones he took out of the machine. I say yes. He asks me angrily if I could take them out myself so other people could use the machines. He claims he took them out of the machine 45 minutes ago. I apologize and say that I didn't realize they would take that long (that is, they would be done that soon - but I can't form words well on the spot). He continues to yell at me about how he's sick of taking other people's clothes out, and other people need to use the machines too, etc., etc. This goes on for a few minutes, I continue apologizing, he continues yelling. I finally get in the elevator and start tearing up. Worse: I have to go back for my second load, tears in my eyes, fumbling about trying to get my clothes out of there as quickly as possible (dropping them on the floor multiple times) as the guy just stands there and watches me silently. Then a lady casually asks me about my laundry basket in the elevator as tears are streaming down my face.

I hate being a crybaby. I hate taking everything so personally. I honestly wish I could just stop caring about everyone and everything. Sometimes people make mean-spirited comments *on the internet* (which I grew up with, so I should just be used to it now) and I start crying. Now I'm thinking of getting a rolling laundry cart and taking my clothes to the nearest laundromat (1.5km away, I don't drive) because I'm terrified of ending up in that situation again. I'm terrified of running into him in the elevator. I've been crying for an hour because one guy was angry at me for 3 minutes. I don't have any close friends I can talk to.

I'm away from home for school right now. ""Join a club! That's the best way to make friends!"" - I can hear you exclaiming it already. On that note, earlier this week I thought I'd join the archery club at school. Turns out there's really high demand and it was very busy. I've never done archery before. At one point in the night, I was preparing to shoot and my instructor walked off for a minute to grab a different bow for someone else. I have terrible posture and he had been adjusting it before all of my shots, I don't want to pick up any bad habits early so I lowered my bow and waited for him to return. This guy was standing behind me waiting to shoot and he told me I was ""swinging my bow around too much"" (I admit I swung it about half an inch right as I lowered it and turned partially to see where my instructor had gone... there were 5 targets and I was shooting on the leftmost one). I shrugged it off and said ""oh, sorry."" Then he went on, ""if you're not going to shoot, can you get off [the lane]?"" I was pissed. My instructor came back and I said ""I was waiting for my instructor to come back so he could check my posture and such."" Then he told my instructor about how I was dangerously bow-swinging. Super pissed. Even now, I'm *still* angry and upset about it, and it was such a small thing. I almost don't want to go back because I don't want to see that guy again.

Several months back, I received a mediocre final evaluation at the end of an internship and I started crying. It seems really inappropriate for a professional environment and I really want to avoid it happening again... I just want to stop feeling. I want to cut out my tear ducts and the part of my brain associated with emotion. Alternatively, I'd like to hear some more realistic approaches to woman the fuck up and stop being such a crybaby about everything."

I'd really like to find a company to do an internship with somewhere in New York State, or somewhere where I could relocate at a low cost.

10bdls,0,2012-09-22,"Mitt Romney and more.....the down votes begin. (this is NOT spam, but watch it get spam deleted)",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10bdls/mitt_romney_and_morethe_down_votes_begin_this_is/,"Subject: MITT ROMNEY
Just some facts about Mitt Romney that we will not hear about from the media.

Mitt Romney:

* After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked as an attorney.

* As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store in Massachusetts that sold office supplies. That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and employs over 90,000 people.

* Romney or his company Bain Capital (using what became known as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply, and many others.

Got your calculators handy? Let's recap.

* Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year.
* Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.
* Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years.
* Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years.
* No salary as president of the Olympics 3 years.
* No salary as MA governor 4 years.

That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind of man Mitt Romney is!

* And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 15% of his income..
This is real character vs....well you bullshit liberal rhetoric.

Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know  that he won't desecrate the flag by continuing to bow down and apologize to foreign powers, or squander my money on multiple vacations and failed loans. 

I believe he has the ability to turn this financial debacle that the ""Spending President"" has aided Clinton and Bush getting us into. We didn't know that when Obama said he'd give us change, he meant nickels and dimes, and he would get the big bucks publishing books about his life that contained made up material and material composed of multiple events rolled into one. 

We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background we have a better chance of doing it. Why did we hire a community organizer to fix our fiscal problems? Would you hire Pen and Teller to run the House and Senate? Would you hire Snoop~~Dogg~~Lion to run the DEA? Would you hire Keith Richards to head up pharmaceuticals? 

Romney never took drugs, did not associate with communists or convicted terrorists, nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for an omniscient being to damn the United States. Granted I'm not crazy about magic underwear but it pales in comparison to a church that damns our country. 

Obama pledged a transparent government and pledge to place the discussion of every bill before he signed it on the White House website for Americans to vote on, he pledged that large bills would be on C-Span where we could see it. he lied. None of those things ever happened.

Obama pledged to shut down Gitmo, He lied. It's still open and fortunately so because the very detainment center and the very methods he campaigned against and swore to end, are the very same used to put an end to Osama Bin Laden. He even promoted general David Patreus to head of the CIA. Yes Obama made the man most of you labeled General Betray Us head of the CIA. Obama pledged to do away with many Bush policies and instead has lied continuing on most of those policies. 

Obama has become the very type of politician most of you bitch about , rail against and voted against to put him into office in the first place.

I am a fiscally conservative and socially liberal independent. I'm voting for Romney. He's paid his dues in taxes and more in charity than Obama(who also pays a tax rate lower than his secretary btw) and if it's the best complaint and argument you people can come up with as to why you want to vote for Obama other than team politics and you aren't able peel yourself away from being a Democrat (or a Republican in the case you refuse to vote for Obama) to vote for somebody else...you're voting for all the wrong reasons. 

I refuse to not vote for a man simply because of his political party of choice. I refuse to not vote for a man simply because he's wealthier than I am.  I refuse to demonize one rich man and defend another simply because of political party affiliation. I refuse to believe all the bullshit on tv, the campaign ads, and the ridiculous polls. I refuse to let left leaning /r/Politics force me to be quiet even if they keep deleting my submissions or claiming it to be ""spam"" (What a fucking joke...""liberals"" that rally against imperialism who imperialistically delete my non liberal leaning submissions) I will not go quietly. I will defend my choice.  Condemn me for it all you want but remember this....

This ain't fucking football and  even if it were....

We're all Americans first.

We're on the same team."

They threw rocks at me and I threw them back when my dad came outside with a shotgun and almost shot them, but they were able to get away. I was so embarrassed I began masturbating furiously with my stuffed dinosaur doll when my mom came in and told me it was time for dinner! I told her I was fapping but then she yelled at me and told me I couldn't spend my whole life sticking my penis inside a tiny dinosaur, then I told her I would become a dinosaur fetish porn star. She got really mad and told me I would be a failure like her uncle, but I didn't care. I left the house and went to my weed-smoking friends house, I got so high I flew into the moon and met the cheese elves who live there. They told me that the only way I could stop the Minotaur (the guy with the body of a bull and head of a man) was if I got an apple and shoved it up Katy Perry's ass. I accepted the quest, but later realized Katy Perry was actually a 50-year-old hobo version of me, come from the year 2180 to tell me that if I couldn't slap Pikachu I couldn't ride her mom. After spending years debating whether chickens could swim in gelatin I hooked up my gameboy color (it was the purplish-invisible colored one) to my friend's lava lamb, but it got really upset and started baahing at me like crazy, so I whipped out my chocolate- flavored kunai knife and stabbed it 37 times in the chest. My friend was all like ""bitch be trippin' balls"" and kicked me out of the house, where I then realized if you had 3 quarters,  4 dimes and 4 pennies you'd have $1.19. I got in to my white van looking to pick up some chicks at the park, but when I finally got over there I remembered that I was an octopus, and the third arm on my right was actually my penis, and was detatchable sort of like the way a midget with a beard looks kind of like Squidward if they were taller, had orange skin, didn't have a mustache but had a bigger nose.  Then I finally found the master sword (the one from the Legend of Zelda games) and asked Telephone if they needed to go to the bakery yet. He said no, but I could see in her eyes that it really wanted to be my unpaid intern. I ended up hiring them and now we're married with one kid named charlie, named after the kid I sit next to in science. He also sits next to me in science, but that doesn't matter considering I'm already a level 55 Dark Paladin with the Spear of the Dragonfucker on my side, I'll always be able to make sure kids get to school on time. Except for yesterday, when Gordon decided he would touch Alice's arm and she screamed ""RAPE!"" causing me to swerve the whole hot dog and I crashed into Pikachu. Remembering my side-quest I slapped that motherfucker, then was teleported to Led Zeppelin-land, where my bass started vibrating so hard the waffle cone told me to gtfo and then I asked for the power to fly, so everything exploded into Cinnamon Toast Crunch. That one annoying lady on the magic school bus gobbled everything up and said ""Science!"" before falling facefirst into two lesbians making out. I then picked up my backpack and walked back to mars, realizing that I may finally get to sleep in my own bed. My walk turned in to a run, then a sprint, before I ended up in a swarm of Zubat. I waited for the 3 minute title sequence to end, then whipped out my Mage Staff and zapped there asses, but I underestimated my abilities and blew up Planet Earth. Silent tears began pouring down my face, and I gobbled down my KFC. The a few hours later I went through my regular morning routine, brush my teeth, go poop, get in the car, shower, go to school, get home from school, teleport to Uranus, fap furiously, visit Bill Nye, beat Chrono Trigger again, catch all 756 pokemon then realize that it's already the year 2180, and I'm not Katy Perry, which means Bill Nye was lying. I went back to Uranus trekked through all 17 pounds of it's crazy-hot lava and slapped that Gengar, He used Mean Look and I shit my pants. And by shit my pants I mean turn into nyan cat and fly through the sky farting rainbows all over the fucking sushi-filled egg roll. The only real answer was, ""did he kill my father?"" I decided he must have, so I tracked him down and ripped his heart out. With her last dying breath she told me upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbaselectstarttwo player, giving me the giant mudkip of the apocalypse. Everyone who was able to escape from Planet Earth onto the 34-foot space shuttle was actually an alien, secretly disguised as Rainbow Dash. Luckily I was able to combine with Edward the Vampire to turn Super Saiyan 7, then we spent 12 episodes charging up my special bloodline technique which I learned from my father Brock while I was training in the Land of the Hidden Vagina. We fired the laser but destroyed the universe and that's why I'm annoyed, I never beat the Water Temple in Pokemon Gold."
10bp8h,3,2012-09-22,I need a drill to get her out of my head.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/10bp8h/i_need_a_drill_to_get_her_out_of_my_head/,"Hello all. Just discovered this sub, and I am in need of some serious help.
A couple of months ago, my now ex girlfriend [21] and I [also 21] split up from basically being fed up with each other. I had relocated for the summer for an internship, and our relationship was rocky in the first place.

She spent the majority of her summer with some co workers of hers, one of which she kissed 2 days after our almost 2 and a half year relationship ended, and started dating him the next day. Before we ended it, I was a wreck because I knew exactly what was happening, but being 6 hours away from her, I couldn't do anything about it.

She had moved into my house before I left, and still lives here now, although spends all of her time at her new boyfriends. Things between us were awful until I came back, and once we actually started talking in person, things got better. And better. And better. To the point of us fooling around behind her boyfriends back, which has now been put to rest by her.

The real problem was that I was really taking everything as mixed signals. The night/days we were together were the most passionate we'd ever had, but, then she would just kiss me goodbye and go to her boyfriend. I've been trying to get her back, but to no avail. I don't make her happy like I used to, and her new guy does. She wanted to be ""bad"" with me, but not ""good"" with me. She claims to care about me and wants me to be happy, but, the only thing I want is her, and she knows that and has done what she can to convince me otherwise. I know, in the long run, we'd never work. We want too many different things, and we have such different likes, dislikes, and opinions as it is, but, I can't help but still love her. I never stopped, and I don't know how to now.

I apologize for the massive wall of story, but, I have to get it all out. I have to get her out. She messed with my head, and now, wants seemingly nothing to do with me, mostly because I'm so upset about everything. I'm really at a loss for what to do, and I really do feel like I need a drill just to get her off my mind. 

So, strangers of reddit, please, help me. Help me move on. I need it more than anything.

I'm also one of the many silent mods here on /r/metahub (full disclaimer). I saw that you guys were [somewhere interested](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/yy8jj/r_subredditofday_finding_new_mods_submitters/) in the daily working of /r/SubredditOfTheDay and my recent announcement of hiring new writers from the community.

I wanted to give you guys the heads up directly myself. From the horses mouth as they say.... but first an origin story.

/r/SubredditOfTheDay was run by /u/SROTD himself. But due to being too awesome he had to resign. I have taken control... yodda yodda yodda, new leadership, new direction circlejerk. Anyway, I knew my writing skills were never up to par but I always wanted to contribute. So the next best thing I could do is hire those that could write.

Here is a list of gang... hopefully in cronological order of *hiring*. 

* /u/SROTD (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* /u/syncretic (Retired)
* /u/SidtheMagicLobster (MIA)
* /u/LGBTerffic 
* /u/UkuleleNoGood (Retired)
* /u/BauerUK (Retired)
* Few more that I do not know the name of...

* /u/JMaboard (Retired, now only a guest writer)
* ---
* /u/hippiemachine
* /u/Soupyhands
* /u/SaltyChristian
* /u/Freakazette

Everyone below JMaboard was a recent intern. Hippie, Soupy &amp; Salty and Freakazette are the first batch of new full time writers. I'm so damn proud of them. They are fantastic. I just hope the rest of the interns shine as bright as they do.

_____
So I grew up in a very Christian household. When I was a kid, I was forbidden to play Pokemon cards, or read Harry Potter books, simply because the church deemed them ""Satanic."" So while my friends were off having fun with those, I got to do nothing but sit in a corner on the playground by myself. I was so forced into the church and convinced it was all true so strongly, that it even had an impact on the way I dressed. Ex: awkward-fitting jean shorts, ugly Nike shoes, shirts with cheesy religious stuff that wasn't even the correct size, and a huge ugly cross pendant. I met my best friend through this, but let's keep him in the background. The entire time, I had always suspected I had homosexual tendencies, but I would mentally punish myself each time I would even start to think about just considering that.

Now I actually dress like I have a style (which is pretty damn cool, btw) and even have my ears gauged out at 10g, which I never would have done 2 years ago, and I now live a renewed life free of fear, doubt, and self-hatred. I have never been so happy in my entire life. Oh, and that friend I was talking about who came out before me? Yeah, he hates me now, and still goes to his church three times a week.

I was so forced into the church and convinced it was all true so strongly, that it even had an impact on the way I dressed.

10e5og,1,2012-09-24,I want to leave my current career path and follow my dreams. Am I an idiot?,BrockThrowaway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10e5og/i_want_to_leave_my_current_career_path_and_follow/,"Some details... I'm a 20-year old Software Engineering student currently at a 16-month internship with a software engineering company. The internship would end at the end of next summer and I'm looking to return to school and finish my degree after that, with only one year to go.  It would be completely pointless for me not to finish my degree, as I've already done 3 years of it. I'm just not positive what I want to do after that.

Partially relevant details: I've recently come to terms with the fact that I'm gay, and started coming out to many of my family and friends. Back when I was in the closet, I hid a lot of my personality, dreams, and aspirations because I had deemed them too ""gay"", and I didn't want to have that stigma attached to me. I cut all of that out of my life and turned to engineering, which seemed like a viable option. In retrospect, I wish I had simply embraced who I was.

My true goal or passion in life is hard for me to pinpoint. Originally, I always wanted to be an actor in film and television. I loved the local productions that I was involved with when I was younger, but quit them in high school when I was trying to hide who I truly was. But I'm also very, very interested in the behind-the-scenes aspects of filmmaking and television shows, such as screenwriting and directing.

Lastly, my other true passion in life is music. I played piano from a young age and consider myself to be fairly talented. I love playing the guitar as well. This, though, I may consider to be more of a hobby than something I could make a career out of. If there was a career here, I wouldn't want it to be music education. I would want to be in a band or as a solo artist, touring and making new music. The style of music I make would definitely be in the ""indie/indie rock"" field.

My goals and aspirations seem so... unrealistic, compared to graduating with a software engineering, getting a stable job, and not worrying about income. But I know I won't be truly happy. I've considered several options, all which start with me finishing my degree. Then they branch out: Should I get more education focusing on tv and film production? Should I get a software job in L.A. (seems like San Francisco would definitely have some options) and see what I can do from there? However, a full-time job would probably be a huge obstacle in trying to break in to the entertainment industry. 

I'm also worried about the diminishing returns on my engineering degree. If nothing works out, I've assured myself ""at least I have a software degree I can fall back on."" But if I'm not working in that field after graduating (and the longer I wait), I feel that my chances of getting a job would be considerably slimmer, especially in the rapidly changing world of software and technology.

Is this crazy? Am I an idiot for thinking of abandoning a solid, well paying career, when so many people are desperate for one? Also, my dreams are a bit different from each other. If I do intend to do this, I have no idea which one to focus on. If I was successful with music, would I still have that itch to get into tv and film? How viable is this, anyways? Moving to California, without having a job, would definitely be expensive. Not to mention the fact that I'm actually Canadian. Should I move to Toronto instead? Or Vancouver?

I would just say that I'm very, very confused and lost about what to do with my life at this point. I feel like after coming out, I've kind of turned a new leaf, and I want to be this different person I had always wished I was.

**TL;DR:** After I get my software engineering degree, I want to completely switch paths and head into the entertainment industry (acting, writing, directing, or making music). It's always on my mind, and I feel like I would regret it if I don't. I feel like I won't be happy with a software job for the rest of my life, wondering what could have been. Am I an idiot?"
10e47y,2,2012-09-24,20120924 - 659.  Uggos.,FredTrellis,MoreThan600,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoreThan600/comments/10e47y/20120924_659_uggos/,"Has it not struck you, as it has me, that every villain in every movie, theatre piece and musical stage adaption of the Manga classic - is ugly?  Even in radio plays and audiobooks - the voice of the villain is always creepy, evoking an ugly person.  
  
Moreover, when we make the regrettably necessary journey back to our real reality, we can see mugshots of detained subjects:  those unlucky enough to fall under the spell of meth, those unlucky enough to have circumstances where theft and it’s associated risks are preferable to starvation or invisibility, those pedophiles unluckily denied entry to the priesthood.  
  
These mugshots are not, for sure,  captured by  a top glamour photographer.  No-ones' diary reads “10am : Maxim at muscle beach : Lucy Liu lingeries shoot.  12:30 : Prostitutes and their needles (mugshot and evidence), Highgate Constabulary”.  What a giant of the illuminated black and white grainy world you would need to be to stand astride such a chasm in your day planner.  How many interns would you need to prevent mixups?  The restraints on Lucy Liu should be decorously  pink and fluffy hints of the dark fun that lurks in the souls of men, and those on the crack whore are necessitated by the darkness that has tired of lurking in the souls of men.  And one intern is insufficient prophylaxis where, potentially, Lucy Liu ends up wearing the wrong handcuffs.  Indeed, one intern would be insufficient prophylaxis Lucy Liu ends up wearing the right pink and fluffy handcuffs..  A photographer would need these details checked over and again.  
  
If s/he existed, such a photonic giant would be hard-pressed to make much of a mugshot, no matter how skilfully they deployed their outside-in white umbrellas.  They are simply not given the basic material to work with.   In short, like the fictional villains of the imaginations deliverables, the real villains are predominantly ugly.  
  
For sure, this represents prejudice.  Discrimination against those less beautiful.  Preference to the symmetrical, the fashionable thin but not skinny, with strawberried hair and blueberried eyes.  Through the medium of the internet, we have heard first-hand testimony of beautiful people who sailed through life, borne on the breeze of approval from all around them.  The invitations to the prom.  The constant reaffirmation of people ingratiating themselves in tiny ways.  The speeding ticket that is waved away.  The better seat in the cinema.  Opening a new carton of chocolate ice-cream - even though 32 flavours is nearly the same as the advertised 33, and that we actually closed 5 minutes ago, sure it’s no problem, I’ll just open a new one, scoop out a couple of balls of obsequiousness, and handle your cone with loving care.  Do you want a marshmallow with that?  
  
  
It is not so for the less aesthetically pleasing.  These people have realised that in the gene-replication contest that life is, they lost already.  The moment they were conceived.  With no chance for a bye into the quarter finals.  Through no fault of their own, their ugly face predicts an ugly future.  
  
The stress at being so comprehensively a loser in life is crushing.  Daily grinding it’s fear of rejection and loneliness into deeper asymmetries and cracks in an already-distressing visage.  No one can truly paint a brightening, cheery and welcoming smile on to a habitually scowling, frowning bitter ugly face.  
  
  
So it is, that those who genes have dis-favoured are stressed by merely existing.  They already feel a self-rejection in anticipation of a wider rejection.  They already feel the bitter pain of lost love - love for themselves.  
  
The beauties of this world glide, self-assured, self-loved and approved through this world.  The uglies struggle daily against their stress, pain, angst and rejection.  This is the real reason for the mugshots and the theatrical villains being ugly: these are the people who are likely to snap first, and reject and threaten a society that rejects and threatens them for their unchosen appearance.  
  
One day you will may see climbing a tall tower with an AK47 slung across my shoulders.  Now, you know why.  "

What should I do?,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/10glfl/my_ex_20f_and_i_23m_broke_up_and_she_is_acting/,"My exgf [20f] of 2yrs and I [23m] broke up about two months ago while she was away at an internship. She left in May and came back at the end of August. 

She grew up in a religious family and when she left home I was her first. Things went really well for about 6 months and then she began said she no long wanted to have sex which I was fine with. And we struggled with stopping for just over a year and we finally managed to stop. We also had other troubles with non communication but the sex was the main issue. 

While she was away at her internship we broke up because she said that she was no longer in love with me, and that she had not been happy for a long time. She began seeing a guy while she was there and she said that she felt like she was in a relationship with him for the last two weeks she was there. 

Since then we have spoken a lot about us and she says that she still loves me but can't get over our past discrepancies. She has been dating but says she isn't serious about any of them but just wants to get her mind off of me. 

I'm also dating around. (not serious either) and she gets upset if I mention anything about it. That coupled with the fact she says she still loves me but is no longer in love with me, leads me to believe that she wants us to work. She's even mentioned that. 

Now here's the question: I'm not sure if I should stick around or just move on. I've honestly felt like she was the one for a long time and I think we will get back together but I'm worried that it maybe pointless/doomed to fail.

10gkcm,8,2012-09-25,Anyone else get into skating when they were older? (Advice),YearOfTheRisingSun,skateboarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/skateboarding/comments/10gkcm/anyone_else_get_into_skating_when_they_were_older/,"Hey fellow Redditors.

I think a little background would be helpful.  I grew up in a rural area with a gravel driveway and no where anywhere near by to skate.  Growing up I always wanted to but just do to my area it wasn't really possible.  

Fast forward to the present and after a few years in college I decided to finally give skating a try (large cement covered campus is MUCH easier to skate than a gravel driveway).  I bought a board back in March and started just skating around campus.  None of my friends skate so I didn't really have anyone to offer suggestions, teach me, etc.  

This summer I got an internship out in Connecticut and found a great skatepark near New London and started going there.  The first couple times were REALLY nerve racking as even with just a few people there I was by FAR the worst skater and often it would be me (21) and a bunch of younger teenagers and they would all be ridiculously good.  I started just going later at night trying to catch times when no one would be around.  

Long story short I still absolutely suck at skating (can't devote too much time due to a full time job), I still haven't learned to Ollie, and I feel awkward when I try and go practice because I'm not just some terrible little kid whose obviously learning, I'm older than most of the people there and clearly the worst.  

Did anyone else learn to skate when they were older (out of high school)?  Learn to skate without other skaters?  





TLDR: I started skating late in life, none of my friends do, I suck and feel embarassed in front of younger skaters.  Advice please."
10fvqc,8,2012-09-25,I want to tell you all my story.,ChocolateMagic,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10fvqc/i_want_to_tell_you_all_my_story/,"You've all made me so happy.  I'm still dealing with all this damned anxiety, but I know now that it will get better.  I discovered this subreddit today and have since been poring over submission after submission. 

I don't feel nearly as alone. 

I have an appointment with a psychologist tomorrow thanks to my wonderful girlfriend.

Warning: VERY LONG RANT AHEAD. Anyway, on to my story:

I was home for winter break last year and everything was wonderful.  I played lots of games and watched lots of movies with my family, cooked lots of delicious food, and completed (grudgingly, yet with a certain satisfaction) a lot of yard work.  

It's always nice returning to the fresh winter atmosphere of my family's farm.  I had been away to college for two full years prior to this and had just finished my 5th semester with great grades in a Mathematics curriculum.  Honestly, everything was perfect to me.

But then I had my first panic attack.

On Christmas Eve night I lie down to sleep in my warm bed when I start feeling this strange feeling in my left arm and left pectoris region.  My arm is tingly and my chest feels twinges of pain.  And then the first thought crept into my mind:

*""What if I'm having a heart attack?""*

As many of you know, this let loose the floodgate of anxious thoughts:

*""Is this what a heart attack feel like?  Why isn't it going away?  What's wrong with me?  Could it be something else other than a heart attack?  Maybe it's diabetes or something.  Why is my face going numb?  Am I having a stroke?  Quick: read something.  I can still read, that must be a good sign.  The pain in my chest is getting worse and feels weirder even.""* 

MOM, PLEASE TAKE ME TO THE ER.

Tests were fine.  They sent me on my way with some Ativan and a ""Merry Christmas"" and I rested peacefully.

It was sometime later that I had my next panic attack.  Three months or so.  

I was sitting in class when I was wondering why my sternum cracked so much.  And then I began to worry that I broke my sternum and my bone marrow was seeping into my veins and would quickly kill me if I didn't go to the ER right away (caveat: I'm not the sharpest knife in the spoon drawer).  I felt lightheaded and I *thought* I was going to pass out.

I raised my hand and politely told my instructor that I may soon pass out.

Naturally, he stood there for a long moment, unsure exactly what I expected him to do, before rushing to bring me a glass of water.  

The more I thought, the closer I crept to the borderline of consciousness and oblivion.  Fortunately, I didn't pass out.  Someone recommended that I put my head between my knees and I was fine in about 10 minutes, albeit still shaken up.

That second incident became the catalyst and I was having panic attacks nearly every day until the end of the semester.  I'd have them when I tried to lie down to sleep, especially, and they were always triggered by thoughts of poor health.  My grades dropped, my relationships with others plummeted, and all the while I was adding unnecessary stress to my girlfriend's life.

This summer changed everything, however.

I spent this summer at an internship in Boulder, Colorado.  It changed my life in many ways, but in particular, it put a stopper on my anxiety.  My confidence was at an all time high and I felt like I could do anything I set my mind to.  I had no panic attacks while there bar one. 

I woke up one day with an irregular heartbeat.  From the time I woke up until the time I got to the ER, my heartbeat would beat fast and then slow and then fast again with no apparent pattern.  The irregular heartbeat woke me up so I didn't *consciously feel* anxious prior to this episode.  Hence, why I was legitimately worried this time.

Again, tests were fine again.  They gave me more Ativan and I went home.

Every time I visited the ER, they gave me Ativan and told me I was fine.  As an attentive reader, you may have assumed that at this point of the story, I am now fully aware of the fact that my physical health problems are non-existent and that I have an anxiety disorder.

Your assumption is wrong.

Some deep thing inside of me still believed that *something* is wrong, but the doctors didn't do the correct test or simply that the test was messed up in some way.  I still believed that I had a health issue that the doctors just haven't picked up on yet.  

Well it turns out that I did have one problem. 

Gluten.  

I had been having intense heartburn and incredibly bad gas for about two years and had no idea why.  The GI doctor told me it was irritable bowel syndrome which it was, but he didn't perform any further tests.

Anyway, 5 weeks ago I cut out all gluten from my diet.  I've been eating healthily, exercising and noticing the physical changes, and have been having the greatest bowel movements of my life.  It's been surreal.  I've felt for the first time what it's like to be healthy, young, confident, and strong and it was amazing.

Until this past Friday when I experienced the most intense nausea and the strangest bowel movements I've ever had accompanied by the same crippling anxious thoughts I had experienced prior to my summer internship.

It was like having diarrhea and constipation at the same time accompanied by incredible burning.  I had tried to lie down to sleep 5 hours earlier at midnight, but the nausea kept me awake.  And then I saw blood on the paper when I wiped and really began to freak out.  I woke my girlfriend from sleep and asked her to take me to the ER and she reluctantly, yet happily agreed.

Test after invasive test, they told me to eat more fiber and drink more fluids.  Oh, and they said to keep taking Ativan.

Now, this is where your brilliant narrator finally picked up on his dilemma.  Regardless, he spends 2 days suffering from chronic nausea and indigestion, loses 3 pounds, and shows up at the doctor's office on monday frustrated and on the verge of tears.

The doctor was great.  He listened to my rambling patiently.  He then suggested I have a little more blood work done and a stool sample analyzed to check for more possible problems.  But he also has a hunch.  He prescribed me Prilosec and told me to by an OTC liquid antacid.  He thinks I may have Gastritis.

It's been 12 hours since I first took the Prilosec and the first few swigs of the antacid, but already my nausea has nearly gone.  I took some Ativan and my stress has subsided for the moment.

I have an Anxiety Disorder.  I don't know which one, but it's mine and I do not expect it to go away anytime soon.  It makes me irritable to the point where I snap at people I love.  It makes me angry at myself and my shortcomings.  But with a little effort from me and a lot of help from drugs, a psychologist, friends, my loving family, and my awesome girlfriend, I know I'll be able to get better.

I hope you all can find solace in your lives and I wish you the best of luck.

I am leaving the US for 6 months to do an internship in Germany, and I was hoping to use the collective financial wizardry of this subreddit to figure out a place to park roughly $40k in cash. Right now it's just sitting in my bank account in my credit union, which isn't *so* bad most of the time, because if I use my debit card 12 times a month I get 1% interest (wooo....). However, when I'm in Germany I'll be relying mostly on cash, both that I'll convert into Euros and that I'll make from my internship, so those 12 transactions won't be happening, and I'll be getting 0.05% interest.

My credit union offers 182-day CDs at .25% for that amount of money. Do you all know of any better possibilities? If it matters, I am already a Vanguard customer (with some stocks/bonds and a target fund IRA - that money is not included in the $40k).

I'm hoping to use the money as a large down payment on a house in the nearish future (say, within a year or two). So, wherever I put it should be pretty darn safe. On the other hand, that $40k doesn't include about $10k that I want to keep in cash for emergencies, so it's okay if it's locked away.

10iljd,2,2012-09-26,A great week slowly turning into a sour one.,Chinksta,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10iljd/a_great_week_slowly_turning_into_a_sour_one/,"I thought this would be a great week but I was wrong. Still getting used to college life.... 

Monday - Girlfriend told me that she needs some ""alone"" time, that usually means that a break up will soon be happening. I freaked out, started apologizing and beg her to not leave me. I was in tears... started drinking.. I called her while I was crying, told her to not leave me and begged her to come back. I was wrong, I told her that her ""busyness"" is turning this relationship bad. It was just me who wanted more out of it. I was begging so hard, I yelled at the sky asking why is this shit happening to me? People started to freak out, I passed out in my bed, I believed someone checked up on me. 

Tuesday - Felt like shit, send more message to my girlfriend telling how much I missed her, I really wanted to make this relationship work. Went through day walking sadly... after seeing people holding hands together, having fun and kissing. I thought of my girlfriend... how much I wanted to kiss her and I was crying in the middle of the streets. At night, my girlfriend replied saying that she will have lunch on Thursday. I told her that I was sorry again. I called her several times, but she was ignoring it. She told me to leave her alone but I kept calling. More drinking... then later, one final call. She didn't pick up, but I decided to leave a voice message. I was crying... told her that I was sorry that I'm a greedy asshole and I really want this relationship to work. She later replied saying that ""we should be friends"" but I don't want that. I still want to remain as her ""boyfriend"". Passed out on my bed.

Wednesday - I decided to do some college homework, but couldn't think at all. I'm so sad that I was thinking about her... Something told me to send a picture of a cute cat with text saying ""I'm sorry, please give me a chance"", I send it. I checked on her facebook, she has an event that she really wanted to go, so I left a comment saying to ""sign me up!"". Lunch was painful, I was sitting alone but there was a couple sitting in front of me. They were talking and having so much fun together...laughing and touching each other... I thought of the fun which I used to have with my girlfriend. I feel like tears are coming out. I quickly finish and literally cried while I was walking back to my place. My uncle called me to invite me for dinner, at first I told him I didn't want to go and explain my situation. Somehow, I told him that I'll go. 

So far, my girlfriend is going to Toronto this weekend but I really wanted to spend time ""healing"" this relationship. I had a plan where she and I would go to a park and have a picnic there but she's going to fucking Toronto. She will be more busy soon... she's starting her internship and that might leave less free time. I'm just wanted to go to Toronto with her but there aren't anymore spots left... I tried asking everywhere if anyone wanted to sell their tickets...but no luck. Things are slowly getting bad... I feel like I'm slowly losing my girlfriend...although she told me that it's HER fault... Somehow I felt like it's just me...who wanted more from her... I'm sitting in my room and outside looks like it's going to rain...the day is gloomy. I prayed that tommrow my girlfriend and I will work this out together, I don't want to lose her... I send her a text saying ""Hi, how are you?"" but no reply... It's like she's ignoring me. Something inside me told me that she felt the same way as I am... sad...wanted to work this relationship out but I may be crazy... 

I really hate it though, she's leaving on Friday 7:00 AM sharp... I mean I have the whole fucking weekend planned out. The trip cost fucking $200, I can't believe that my girlfriend would rather spend a lot to go spend her time without me. She will be back on Sunday too... I bet she will say that she's too tired from the trip. I fucking hate this life. FUCKING SHIT.    "

10hzc5,5,2012-09-26,"I can no longer ""mother"" my mother. Entire relationship has changed. ",Mrsteddyruxpin,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10hzc5/i_can_no_longer_mother_my_mother_entire/,"My mom has always been needy and lacked common sense from as far back as i can remember. I always thought of myself as ""the good daughter"" who helped and guided her through all of her bad decisions. Everything has changed since I have become a mother. I have to mother my son now, and I'm in the midst of my internship, I have a husband..a mortgage...and a lot on my mind and I just can't adopt my mothers problems any longer. 

Now all we do is fight. 

I wish she was an adult. I wish she was reliable. I wish she didn't live like a slob. I wish she would keep her promises. I wish she cared about her health. I wish she would stop seeing people for what they can give her. I wish I had a wise, calm, uplifting mother. 
My drug addict brother has moved into her house, and all I get to hear about is how great he is for ""helping her"". I like to call it ""enabling her"". He does everything she asks, and accepts all of her behaviors...of course his 32 year old butt is getting free rent, food, utilities, and extra cash..so why would he create conflict with her? 

I helped her quit smoking. She was 7 months quit and when she broke up with her crazy lesbian girlfriend (hopefully for the last time) and kicked her out of her house (again) my brother went and bought her 4 packs. If she's going to ruin all her progress my brother could have at least made her go get them herself. She has had two heart attacks. The doctor said she has to stop smoking and drinking insane amounts of caffeine. My brother keeps feeding her both. She's going to die if she doesn't start taking care of herself. But I can't keep begging and fighting with her about it. Either she wants to live, or she doesn't...

She has no furniture...her house is in disarray and reeks like ciggs and is filthy, so my sons first birthday will be at my dad's house. She spent our entire time on the phone tonight being bitter and angry with me about this. She kept saying ""I know this isn't your fault, and this is the only option but I don't have to like it"". I feel like she's trying to ruin this experience for me because she isn't getting to do what she financially and physically is incapable of doing. 

I am so insanely dissapointed in my mom's effort at living that i cant bring myself to congratulate her for shampooing her carpets. That's what normal people do. Set the bar a little higher. 

I can't run to her rescue, fix her problems, or condone her destructive behavior anymore...so she doesn't call..and she doesn't text...and if we do talk. It's always about her. Never me. And we fight. 

I don't know what to do reddit..I feel like I'm losing my mom...

10hwaq,27,2012-09-26,"""...but that's no reason to not have my computer done""",[deleted],TalesFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/10hwaq/but_thats_no_reason_to_not_have_my_computer_done/,"This was from when I was an IT intern.

The week had been insanely busy, and the day this happened we had a town blackout.

HIM: ""Hi I'm here to pick up my computer""

ME:  ""Did we call you?""

HIM: ""No, but the guy said it'd be done today""

Now, anyone in auto, comp repair, or anything that gives an estimate on the date knows that those estimates are under good conditions (and with a lot of luck.) So I go and search all over and find out that every computer station is full, and his computer hasn't even been worked on yet. 

me: ""Sorry, but it looks like it's not ready""

him: ""but... the guy said today""

me: ""I'm sorry, but we operate on a first in first out basis, and we've been busy. Plus with the blackout I couldn't ring you up""

him: ""I understand that, but that's no reason not to have my computer done"" *proceeds to walk out and slam the door*

in my head: ""No, that's a perfect reason you dick."""
10htoh,2,2012-09-26,My life feels so meaningless,i_ate_carrots_today,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10htoh/my_life_feels_so_meaningless/,"I'm not really sure how to begin, but I just have had this completely overwhelming feeling that I've led such a pointless, terrible life, that I can't really look at myself or my life and respect anything about it. I've felt this way for as long I can remember my own emotional state; to put it another way, I can't remember ever being actually happy for more than a moment at a time, and I can never remember ever actually recognizing that I am happy while it happens. 

I feel like I have become trapped in my own pointless cycle, doing the same things and acting the same way over and over just to get through the day. I feel completely alone, despite having a fair amount of acquaintances and people I do things with; I have a pretty active social life and I can meet new people pretty easily. I can make people laugh pretty easily, regardless of whether I've known them a long time or a brief time, so I usually end up hiding behind that and never really forming meaningful friendships. At the same time though, I have no idea how to stop being just a clown, and I'm not even sure it would make anything better if I did. I feel like it wouldn't add to my character, only take away the only quality people like about me. I'm completely skeptical about all of my relationships, and never really feel that people actually like me, rather they're just tolerating me (I have had weirdly dramatic friendship endings with other guys where they have told me that they only tolerated me, and basically reaffirmed my fears). I'm greatly unsatisfied with having shallow friendships and relationships, and I often find myself bored with the people around me, but dependent on spending time with them because I feel uncomfortable without having active social interactions (I both fear the social stigma, and actually dislike constant solitude past a certain length of time). I am also incredibly nostalgic, against all logical reasoning (my childhood was not particularly good or bad, but I definitely remember it too fondly), and become hung up on the past very easily. 

I used to have incredible anger, and I could only hold it back for so long before I would end up overreacting and breaking ties with my close personal friends and partners over petty, small incidents. I have been able to ""repair"" some of these relationships, but I do not talk to any of them anymore except for rare circumstances, and never for very long. I have deep regret for these lost relationships, not particularly because I want to be around/with them anymore, but mainly because I really wish I had handled it better and managed to keep being friends while maybe not being together or best friends or what have you. I have no idea if it is actually feasible to ever try to recover these lost relationships, or if it would be much healthier to just let them go and let go of the past. I imagine that the answer is the latter, but I feel that knowing something is bad for you isn't enough to fix the problem. I wish I could be more assertive and upfront with my real feelings, but I feel like I can't risk losing all of my friendships/relationships, which is what I envision happening when I think about it. ""Nobody wants to be your friend/date you, they just want you to make them laugh/entertain you/use you"" is what I have in the back of my head at all times.

However, I sometimes have moments of great confidence in which I really cut through the cross talk in my own head and really focus on what I want, and I go for it. These feelings typically apply to school and work; I'm in junior year studying engineering and doing very well academically, and I have internship experience that I enjoyed a lot, and have recently had interviews for next summer's internships that I thought went really well. I'll still be interviewing throughout the semester too, which is helping to drive my interest in the field. I don't really know how I managed to convince myself to take school seriously despite feeling unimportant as a person, but I really am thankful that I have that trait. My situation could be so much more worse that I typically feel that I should just suck it up and focus on doing the right things, but all too often I break and can't minimize my problem successfully. I wish I could throw myself even more into school, but I've realized that I can't really control my interest level in something by sheer will. I lift weights 3 times a week and have made mediocre progress; I still have the body image issues I had when I used to be fat (I lost 60 lbs my freshman year of college; I was 6'2"" 165 then, and I spent the next year or so building up to 6'2"" 195, I don't really know why I went into detail), and never really feel comfortable with the way I look. Outside of lifting I can't really bring myself to do any other active things, so I usually end up doing pull-ups on my doorhang pull up bar. Again, I'm not sure why I went into so much detail. Maybe it's helping me to detail everything. I have an unusually high desire to know things, particularly things about people, even people I don't know or have ever met. It actually does aggravate me to not know something, and I have to try and convince myself it's alright if I can't learn it (I honestly wanted to know personal things about somebody's friend in Boy Scouts, not really because I cared about the person a whole lot, but really just because I try to learn everything I can) and I have a feeling that that quality is off-putting to some people, people who are more private and don't feel comfortable about me knowing their personal life. But at the same time, I never let anyone around me know anything *very* personal about myself. I don't think anyone who knows me really actually thinks much about me or knows much about me. 


Oh my god I can't really fathom how much I've just ranted here. I think I just needed to say something about it, for maybe somebody, even just myself, to be able to see my problems written out. I really would appreciate any kind of input, but definitely I would appreciate as much thought as you could give me; I really will take this to heart, I need to hear somebody else's thoughts.

Thank you for your time and your consideration"

Need advice on how to live now (22 yrs old),[deleted],Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10heh8/kicked_out_of_house_need_advice_on_how_to_live/,"I majored in History with a focus on pre-med. My grades didn't come out too well and medical school isn't an option anymore. Although I could try again, I don't have a drive for it anymore. I'm getting kicked out because of my failure so I need advice.

I am a 22 year old male living in Dallas, Texas. 
I have about $12,000 saved up. I have 0 credit (no cred history), no car, NO debt (not even loans), no job. I have a desktop pc and 2 laptops. I'm going back to college to pursue a Computer Science degree (I have a path that offers bachelors+masters fast with internship and ultimately a job right after graduation). This time I will be taking a loan.

I have found a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment for $520 a month including water that's close to my university with fantastic reviews. I also know how to cook, and I'm usually on a diet so I don't eat as much.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated on where to look and what to look for. I'm looking at used Honda Accords on craigslist that won't break the bank. Should I pay monthly or all in one? Also, should I get any job or one that relates to computer science? What should I do about furniture? What electricity and internet company should I look at?

Thanks"

What the hell am I supposed to do?",downandblue,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10ku6i/i_feel_that_my_life_is_a_miserable_vicious_cycle/,"Hello, /r/depression! I'm going to warn you guys that I'm probably going to write an incomprehensible life story before getting to the point because I'm just getting stuff off  my chest and I actually don't mind if anyone has anything to say because it's therapeutic writing this out. There will probably be a TL;DR because this is a huge fucking wall of text. You may skip to certain parts of my rant/blog or whatever as you please (probably the -PAST- part haha). The ""straight-to-the-point"" will probably be in the TL;DR and after it.

I just want to let you guys know that I do not want to be referred over to /r/suicidewatch as I do not plan on taking my own life as I understand the devastating wake one can leave if they were to take their own life. I also am going to try to be as anonymous as possible because I have friends and family that browse reddit often. Also, I apologize if I'm all over the place because I've had something that had severely bothered me recently that made me recede back into my previous ways.

**-MY PAST-**

About myself, I'm an 2x year old guy who has probably been depressed since the beginning of high school. My parents are well off and are immigrants who left their home country due to heavy military conflicts who are living the dream in the US, so anything I do is minuscule compared to them and my problems are nothing compared to theirs. Back in highschool I was socially withdrawn, a loner, was bullied, and probably considered a loser among my former friends. I didn't really know I was depressed until I got into my first year of college. 

My parents wanted me to go into medicine as it's the best thing in the world, so I felt like I had a lot of weight on my shoulders. On the second semester of college, I started to lose motivation, started to do horribly on exams, and my grades dropped drastically. I had actually developed some sort of chest pain every time I felt down that felt like it was sinking deeper into my chest. Luckily by the end of that semester I didn't fail the classes, but it was still a D which doesn't look good for me at all and lost all hope in getting into the medical field. 

During the summer I contemplated suicide. Before actually planning it, I decided I should try to seek psychological help via the student psychology counselor. I want to let you guys know that my family doesn't really believe that mental health is a ""real"" disease/disorder and getting help is for it is ridiculous.  After getting asked several questions by some intern and being transferred over to the actual counselor, I found that this did not help me at all, as they didn't give me a real answer and probably didn't really understand what I was trying to say. The intern was surveying me and jotted down any particular notes that would be of interest for the counselor. I did not mention I was suicidal so they just labeled me as depressed with ""morbid thoughts"". During the talk with the counselor, she told me that there was a mobile psych unit and that she would call them if I wanted to seek help. I agreed to try it. As she was making the call to them, I overheard ""Does he need to be restrained?"" and I immediately refused as I didn't want any part of that and did not want to be labeled as a loony bin. This was detrimental to me as it really made me feel like absolutely no one understood me at all. So for most of the summer, I just sat around my house locked up in my room watching shows and played video games all day and night while planning how to do it. 

When I finally got towards the date, I broke down and told my parents and my brother. They seemed to take it well and was supportive of me by telling me to take a few months off to get myself back together. I've never seen my brother cry in a long time when I talked to him about it when we were driving around a few days after. I understood that if I were to take my own life, I would leave my family in the state I am in. But for some reason, they still didn't recognize that I still had those feelings and that I should seek help (well I personally believed I needed help but didn't know where to get it). Atleast the thought of suicide was gone even though I still had the ""morbid thoughts"".

**-RECENTLY-**

I've recently completed a program offered by the local community college that was a healthcare provider program that lasted roughly 2-2.5 year (I stumbled upon this program on a flyer after the ""past"" thing). During the program, I had the false sense that I had a purpose in life and that this was it. Coming out of this program with no real experience in working or with people, my self confidence dropped to an all-time low as I was expected more of myself and that anything I do could get me sued, terminated, and worse, hurt someone. I was supposed to be in charge and I'm the most responsible for my actions in what I do. 

The first real job (first job in my life) I got was rough as I was so green and didn't understand the simple tasks that weren't really talked about during the program. I just couldn't handle it. I worked part time for a few days and I felt I hadn't gotten better at what I was trained to do. I dreaded coming to work every time and slowly became more and started to develop some sort of anxiety every time I received a patient. One day, the company went out of business all of a sudden when I came to work one day and nothing was at the office. I've only been there for a month and only worked 2 days a week (long hours) and was still in their new hire training period. I was absolutely relieved when I realized I didn't have to work there anymore. So the only thing I thought to do at the time was to take some classes to complete an associates program for about 6-9 months.

**-CURRENTLY-**

After that, a friend told me I should join the company he works at as they were far more stable and more friendly to the inexperienced (same job title). It would probably be a very ideal job for many who are in the field and want to make great money while going to school. I would get paid more and had an opportunity to have them schedule work time in a way it wouldn't affect school time (I didn't want to stay in this field forever). So I built up some sort of temporary self-confidence at the time and applied for it. I got the job and was beaming with happiness. I didn't have a hard time going through the classroom training until I got into the actual on-the-job training. I did fine the first day, but it went downhill the second day. I couldn't do as I was expected and my mind went completely blank when I was supposed to be able to handle my own job (simple tasks). I managed to go through the day but I absolutely hated every moment of it. My friend saw me and shot me a text about it and told me I should just go balls deep, balls to the wall, and be cocky/confident as hell. I can't very well do that, because I just did not have that in me.

The next day, which was yesterday, I had the worst mental breakdown I've had in my entire life. When I was doing my job, I just without warning started sweating profusely, my arms and legs shaking uncontrollably, my heart rate probably increased 2x, and my hearing was going away. I knew what I was having was an anxiety/panic attack and I couldn't continue doing my job. I basically pissed a lot of people off and made a complete fool of myself. I was utterly embarrassed. I talked to the person I was working with and asked for his suggestions. He suggested I go see a doctor to see about treating my anxiety problem. When I got home after work, my parents obviously knew that I didn't have an awesome day and I told them what happened. Basically what they said in our native language, ""Suck it up and grow some balls. You're not a woman, etc. I've had a gun pointed to my head and had several instances where my life and others were at stake, etc."" My dad literally said ""deal with it"". It made me fucking feel pathetic. When I asked if I could see a doctor about this, they said straight up told me no (I'm currently under their health insurance so I have no say whatsoever). 

I have not quit my job yet, but I may be called into a meeting after this mishap.

**TL;DR**
I just can't seem to do anything right in my life. Anything I do, I would fail hard and make a fool out of myself. I'm terribly indecisive It's so frustrating because I can't even do anything in my current state. I'm always down and when I'm down, I'm REALLY depressed. I can hide my emotions very easily, but when it's at its worst, people can see it. I let people down and it really gets deep under my skin. I have a very low confidence level and I don't really know how to raise it. As seen in the ""-CURRENTLY-"" section, I've recently discovered that my mental statuses are debilitating in everyday life and I can't seem to grasp living anymore. I honestly feel like it would be better if I disappeared off the face of the earth. I have also realized that I really dislike the job I have trained and studied for 2 years (I have a deep respect for the people who do this job), but if I stop people would think I'm just a cowardly bitch and a quitter. It just seems like everyone around me tells me to suck it up and deal with it. I'm pretty sure the people who saw me that day (explained in the last paragraph of ""-Currenty-"") definitely feel that way. Maybe even my own parents would feel this way, since they don't believe that I have a serious underlying issue.

My question now is what the fuck am I supposed to do? I haven't the slightest clue what to do next because I can't even think straight.
I don't mind if any of you guys think less of me, but I feel like I'm at the lowest point in my life right now and I can't seem to get out of it. I've tried really hard to turn my life around, but failed miserably.

If reddit can help me, great. If not, that's fine too. It made me feel a little better because I'm able to express myself how I feel right now than to listen to someone tell me to suck it up.

10kmdh,20,2012-09-27,Got my first big boy job - now to tackle the touch decisions...,deathsythe,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10kmdh/got_my_first_big_boy_job_now_to_tackle_the_touch/,"So lets just say for argument's sake that I have my first real job after undergrad. (Yay!)

Now lets also say that I have a mortgage worth of student loan debt (well over $100k)

I need a serious plan.

So I hit excel and started crunching the numbers. (this is the best my ECON courses at an engineering school can do for me basically)

I am fortunate enough that I have a job where it is possible to live home with my folks - which I don't mind about. I am also fortunate enough to have them take care of my cell phone (family plan) and basic living expenses (meals at home, laundry, heat, electric, yada yada). I am however responsible for my car (which I own) so gas and maintenance is on me (Which I wouldn't have any other way.

I have since begun making frugal lifestyle choices; not going out as much with my girlfriend, brewing my coffee at home instead of stopping out on the way, switching my little remaining credit card balance to a interest free promo deal (wish a plan in place to have it **all** gone well before the period ends), switched to a no-fee credit union, etc...

I also am retaining my part time job at a local deli on weekends.


So here are some of my questions:

* My employer provides company matching up to a certain percentage of my annual salary in a Simple IRA. I am currently budgeting to meet that percentage. Smart- Yes/No?

* I am currently enrolled in grad school as well. I finished damn near all of it during undergrad, but still have like 3 courses to take. I was fortunate enough to get into a program where I receive the same amount (%) of grants/scholarships as I did during undergrad. This puts my tuition at like $2k per semester I take a class at night. Should I continue this? Should I pay for this in cash? Should I take out a loan (good credit score btw) to pay for it and add it to the model I have? Also - I haven't discussed it (regarding numbers) with my employer as to what finishing grad school will afford me on the job, or even if they have tuition reimbursement - but last I checked they don't. I really don't want to put it off though, especially since I am so close yanno?

* Currently putting anything/everything extra I have into paying off the loans, starting with the highest rate first. I don't really want to consolidate, deffer, or any of that because from what I can tell it isn't very good for your credit.

* In my current model, I have allocated to make not only the company matching % contribution to my Simple IRA, but also my maximum contribution to my RothIRA (because I am afraid that the government is going to get tired of not being able to have their hands in it and is going to do away with the provision for it.) Thoughts on that? (FWIW I have a pretty sizable investment in it currently because I made the max contribution every year I was on internships.

* I have halted most of my hobbies that aren't frugal - Silver coin collecting and firearms primarily. I do occasionally buy and flip things on the side though - should I continue to do that?

* I have to commute by car to work, there is really no opportunity for mass transit or bicycling. I do want to eventually get myself another motorcycle (I don't have one anymore) to save on gas. (in b4 - deadly, gunna crash and die, etc...) My car does get decent MPG (~28 or so) for an older car.


All in all - based on my current model I am able to save around $1000 net a month (after expenses, taxes, etc...) to put towards my loan repayment on top of the minimum. As I stated before - current strategy is minimum on everything that isn't the highest rate at the moment, wash rinse repeat. My model does not take into account raises or anything, so it is just stock as of right now. Based on it - I will be paid down to nothing in just over 6 years. (in which I will update ya'll - OP will deliver!)



Am I on my way? Anyone see any egregious errors or flaws that I'm missing?




Thanks to everyone here for all the information, knowledge, and help that everyone's posted to get myself, and plenty of others like me, into this mindset.

Edit - it appears I made a typo on the title - I will live forever with the shame... :P

In less than 24 hours I have to pack up, get on a plane that I'm terrified to get onto, fly alone to a city 5000 miles away, leaving my girlfriend and cat in my home city, work as an intern for 3 months, in a city that has almost daily riots, all while probably living alone in an empty apartment.

Sigh.

I have always had a fear of flying, but I recently had taken control of it. I have family in Greece, so I have flown there back and forth 3 times previously, once alone. I've also flown on about 12-14 other flights in my life, so you would think I would finally get over my fear.

But this time, I'm leaving my girlfriend, who I live with, and my own cat. It just has seemed to make my fear of flying 1000 times worse, seeing now it's mashed up with my anxiety of having to spend almost 3 months away from my girlfriend and the majority of my family.

It's gotten so bad that I have been having panic attacks all day today and have been having random bouts of crying. I don't really know how to deal with this, it's like I've taken all of my anxiety involved with this and focused it into my fear of flying. :(

Is there anything I can do? Can anyone talk me down? I'm NOT going to let my fear of flying control me, but I can barely stomach this feeling of fear that I have for tomorrow.

I'm sorry if this seems like a rant, it's just I'm so worried I can barely think straight. My fear of flying.... The thought of sleeping in an empty bed for the next few months.... It's really making my anxiety go crazy."

10mmle,11,2012-09-28,"[24m] dating a longtime friend [24f] and need a little advice Re: grad school, stress related libido issues, and emotional withdrawal.",888throwaway8888,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10mmle/24m_dating_a_longtime_friend_24f_and_need_a/,"/r/relationships,

I am in a rather unique situation, and don't have many people that I can talk to about it, so here goes. Throwaway account because she's also a redditor.


I have been dating one of my closest friends since high school for roughly 3 months. She had just gotten out of a long term relationship a few months prior. In a drunken moment back in July, I told her I'd had a crush on her since I was 14, and she admitted she felt the same. We intended to wait a while before jumping into anything, but as we began hanging out as potential lovers, that plan went out the window in a matter of weeks. Things during the summer were fantastic, but as the semester has progressed, they've gotten less fantastic. We've always had good chemistry and been able to communicate well, but lately she's been kind of emotionally withdrawn. I attribute this to the fact that she's in her last year before graduate school, stressed as hell about the application process, etc... It hasn't been until the past month or so that things have really become confusing.


There are three main things I need advice about:



1)She's emotionally withdrawn: She's always been slightly guarded about her emotions- I came into the relationship knowing and accepting that. Since the start of the semester, though, I feel like she's not communicating to me what she wants/needs from the relationship. I've been torn between being the supportive, present boyfriend, and giving her her time and space to tackle the grad school admissions process. I want to know what's going on in her head, and I've talked to her about it, but she keeps saying she needs time to process the semester &amp; to be patient.  I have no problem with the patience part- I waited ten years for the right opportunity to date her. I just want to know what I need to do.



2)Stress/body image issues manifesting as low libido : When we first started dating, our sex life was fantastic. The chemistry was great, our sex drives matched, all was well. We haven't had sex in almost a month. I stayed over at her house last night, and it seemed like the mood was right. When I went to fooling around, she said she wasn't feeling it. This has happened the past few times. I'm not looking for the physical pleasure sex brings. Rather, I'm looking for the emotional connection that I feel has been slipping away. We talked about it last night, and she was genuinely unhappy that it hadn't happened- to the point of crying. I told her not to worry about it, and I can be patient. She's considering seeing a therapist about her body image issues and her predilection to let stress dominate her. Should I encourage this, or should I leave it be for now and let her decide? ALSO: She's on birth control- I've heard that can often kill the female libido.



3)Graduate school (AKA the elephant in the room): This is the biggie. She just finished her graduate school applications to 5 schools (She's an animal sciences major, applying to vet school.) The closest is 5 hours away. I realize that it won't be for another 8 months, and a lot can happen between now and then, but I'm still concerned about it. I love this woman, and I have since I was a young kid. Without a shadow of a doubt, I want her to remain a part of my life for a long time. She thinks she won't get accepted, but she's graduating with honors, has internship and professional experience, and letters of recommendation from doctors in her field. I think she stands a damn good shot at it. If/when she gets accepted to graduate school, should I let her go (and most likely break up in the process) or should I talk to her about moving with her?


TL;DR: Friends forever, couple for 3 months. Need advice on how to work through issues relating to stress from higher education."

I taught p4-p6 Math and English during the morning.  Here is the picture of me with the locals eating thai style, http://imgur.com/sbxkr... (Btw, yes I am deaf) 

Okay here's the deal.  I am going back to SE Asia in Thailand to meet up a friend for two weeks from December 14-28 then be on my own or possibly meet another friend for maybe a week or two.  Then yes actually being a solo...for the first time ever until February 11, I am going to meet my friend again from her own journey and travel to India with her.  So anyone who had experienced traveling from Thailand to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia.  Please let me know what was the best thing you saw there.  How to get there, train, bus, etc.  I am planning to do my own research but I always appreciate hearing from people who had actually went there and their stories.  

When I go back to Thailand, I will be visiting my ""family"" from the school.  And then not sure where as I have not heard my friend's plans.  But ever since I got back from Thailand, Chiang Rai was the only thing in my mind that I wished I went there.  

I am DYING to go to Indonesia.  So it seems not everyone always take this route. So anybody who had.  Please do share your experience with me.  

Any other advice/tips/must see place?  Anyone else planning to go to SE Asia during that time?  Would be greatly appreciated! "
10ltx7,7,2012-09-28,Next year I would love to move (I have been living in the same city for my entire life) and I have been trying to decide between two places. Ask me questions to help me decide which is the better choice for me?,Carcats,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10ltx7/next_year_i_would_love_to_move_i_have_been_living/,"I simply need a bit of help with reflection and decision-making.

I am trying to decide between Austin, Texas, and Hamburg, Germany. I am a 19 year old female human, and I am/have been incredibly interested in film/cinema (for as long as I can remember). I recently began dating a guy here, who, incredibly, completely separately from me, decided to move to Austin next year with his friends.

I have been going to the university in my college town for a year and a half. I grew up here, and my parents still live in town as well. My first year was incredibly difficult for social/personal reasons, and I ended up incredibly depressed at the end of the school year but still managed to end the year with a respectable gpa. I decided to change my outlook and learn to be happy by myself (I ended my year-long relationship so I could rely on myself more) and went on a month-long solo trip to Europe. I visited my German family in Hamburg, where I would stay next year if I decided to move there, and travelled down through Switzerland and Italy. I speak fluent German.

Prior to anything in my life going awry, about a year and a half ago, I began thinking about moving to Austin to continue my studies at University of Texas, Austin. Because I am poor I plan on moving there and working for a year to save money and so I can become a Texas citizen and receive in-state tuition the next year.

So either place I would attempt to continue my education about film and cinema, although in Austin it would be more university oriented, whereas in Hamburg I would attempt to get an internship with a smaller film production company where my father is friends with the owners (so I believe I have a reasonable chance at an internship there).

Please please ask me questions. I sincerely hope that I posted this in the correct subreddit! Also sorry if I included too much back-story. Opinions are welcome as well.

10lltq,2,2012-09-27,Now what? Help me pick my way in life.,[deleted],education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/10lltq/now_what_help_me_pick_my_way_in_life/,"I'm not sure this is the right reddit for it, but here it goes:

I'm 23 and currently in my 2nd year of masters.
I finished my undergraduate with a Bachelor of Science in Communication Science - mainly marketing, advertising and a bit of economics.

I then moved in Sweden and took a Masters of Science also in Media and Communication Science.

Basically I'd like to work in marketing, but I'm not entirely sure about that.
I've always been interested in technical knowledge, engineering, mainly software engineering but not only. However, for some reason or another, I didn't choose to go to college that way. I somewhat regret that now, but again, not really, because marketing attracts me too.

So now I'm at a stand-still, and I don't really know what to do.
My options are:

Hope to get an internship that eventually leads to a job and then in get a CIM certificate (Chartered Institute of Marketing). Later on, five years or so, I'm planning on taking the GMAT and going to a part-time MBA while working.

On the other hand, I could start a PhD just right out of college. I'm thinking either Business and Management for a PhD - but I don't really think that's a good choice, because I would rather work and then get an MBA instead of that PhD.

I'm rather inclining towards a HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) PhD. That would allow me to tie together my passions for both social sciences and technical sciences. However, I'm not really sure that's a smart career choice. I do want to have a career, but I also love knowledge.

I'm a bit lost. I don't even know what I want to learn, because I want to learn everything, but don't know which would prove to also be a good career path.

It's too late for me to get into astrophysics, and even if it wouldn't, I would have the same problems, wanting to get into what I'm currently doing.

I notice people have either an inclination towards humanities or towards technical. I'm stuck in between the two worlds. I want to combine them. I don't know how to do that.

What do you think?

10lcas,1,2012-09-27,What's the best way to integrate an intern into a Rails project?,dogweather,rails,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/10lcas/whats_the_best_way_to_integrate_an_intern_into_a/,"We're setting up our first intern (a high school student), who'll be doing web design at first.  So he'll need to modify and create ERB templates and SCSS files.  

He has an older Mac laptop and so I'm thinking that the best way to set him would be to create a new Linode with the app running in development mode. Give him sftp access. Check out the code in a new branch. Configure github so he can only push to his branch. Currently I just have a normal Github developer account with our project in a private repo. But this might push me to get an organizational account instead.

He's working remotely (lives out of state). But he's doing this for a class, which is imposing structure. I've met him in person in the past, and we've started weekly Skype meetings. And so I'm mostly focussed on the logistics of enabling him to edit templates and see the results.

10nwzd,5,2012-09-29,Girlfriend left me after three years after I changed my life to accommodate hers.,FRizKo,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/10nwzd/girlfriend_left_me_after_three_years_after_i/,"We met in Sweden while she was having an summer internship at IKEA world HQ (she's American (22) I'm Swedish (25). 

I lived next door to where she was staying and we spent the entire summer together. That fall I went to visit her in the US. After that it got shaky as we didn't know how to continue our relationship. Skype was a big factor in our lives at this point. I had a current life situation where it was no problem for me with 6 hour time difference. 

Eventually she folded and hooked up with her ex. This was painful as I could see more and more pictures of her on facebook with this guy. Eventually she told me over skype about him and her hooking up. I so wish I left all this at this point.

A few weeks later her ex decided that he didn't really want her and dumped her. She came crying to me. And seeing how I also felt the stress of not knowing any future together I forgave her. 

Shortly after we came up with a plan to be together. She would apply to go to grad school her in Sweden. Grad School was at the time free here. And there are several programs that are purely international. Including one that she was passionate about. Environmental studies. 

She applied but didn't get in. We found out that this was because it was the last year that non EU students would study for free after the government had changed the laws and a record amount of applicants applied. 

Somehow we managed to keep going. We decided she would apply for a resident permit that you can get here in Sweden if you are in love with a swede. That worked and she went over to Sweden to visit me for a week. Next year she got in to the school. Keep in mind I did most of the work. 

We had a vacation in Italy together and shortly after she moved in with me in Sweden to start school. This was august. Everything went on and seeing as she didn't know any Swedish and she was swamped with school work. She never got to hang out with my friends in a meaningful way. (eventually politeness wears down and people start speaking their own language at party's and stuff). 

So I changed everything to accommodate her. To make her happy. 
I started alienating my friends and my family. Eventually she started making friends in Her class. Most of her classmate lived in another city so it was hard for her to attend any social events. It was an 1 hour commute. And when she started sleeping over at her new friends places I was happy about it because she got to have some social things happening to her that wasn't solely based on my sacrifice. 

January she tells me she has lost most of her feeling towards me. I got a real wake up call and start doing the social events at her school with her ( I even bought her a 800$ air ticket for this upcoming summer so me and her could go visit her family shes been missing). 

This being me working 9-11hour days then commuting to her Schools city to be completely exhausted at the end of every night. Eventually I arranged a Sauna party here in my town, I even arranged our apartment to hold over as many as 7 of her classmates to stay over if needed. Everyone invited showed up, but only one took the bait to sleep over. That was what I learned later the guy she spent most nights sleeping over with because he had a foldable couch. The morning after the sauna party everyone decided to take a trip to Copenhagen. I made my GF and this guy breakfast. I made blueberry pancakes. it took me some time since I hadn't tried doing that before. My GF and him left for a trip Copenhagen with the rest of her class, I was invited with but I had more work to do early next day and really needed some rest.

A few weeks go by when I think I started to make her feel more for me. A national holiday was coming up that is a big going out day. I asked time of from work to go with her. I got a denied and ended up working that day. When she got home the day after she tells right away that she slept with him that night. (the guy I made breakfast for)
Well things turned to shit here. It is now 5 months after and I'm still depressed. I started hanging out with my old friends again but it is really strained as how I alienated them before. I have no problems picking up new girls but it leaves me with feeling like someone who is full of shame.
The only just desert she ending up getting was the she lost her resident permit when she left me. She ending up having to pay 26K$ to finish her last school year. (not to mention that she now has to pay full rent and other costs that I covered for here since she was studying and I was working)

I'm not a hundred percent sure why I'm posting this. I just needed someone to read my story. Input would be nice. I'm feeling incredibly depressed about this and need to find a way to get over it all.

We hung out a couple times at first and he was pretty easy to talk to since we both like video games and manga/anime. He started referring to me as his ""closest friend"" at school which was kind of weird since we literally only knew each other for three days at that point but I just shrugged it off. 

A couple of days ago, he already started revealing EXTREMELY personal details of his life (ie: how his dad passed away, he was mercilessly bullied at his middle school, he was addicted to online gaming for years, he was in an emotionally abusive relationship and he was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for the last ten years). I got really uncomfortable since it was very unprompted and again, I've known him for less than a week at this point but I have had quite a few experiences dealing with depressed friends and thought that inviting him out to do activities would make him feel better.

I invited him to a party that night and thought it would be a good idea because some of my friends there are really into video games as well and all of them are really nice and friendly. However, he stayed quiet for most of the night and after a few hours, he was alone in the corner and looked really miserable and asked if he could leave.  Apparently he had gone to campus (at like midnight) and just walked around because he was scared he was going to start crying at the party since he felt alone and sad that I wasn't talking to him a lot that night.

I would tell him about different organizations and activities on campus but he always says that they're too much work or that he's not interested. He doesn't do much day to day except go to class, come back to the apartment and try to hang out with his one other friend here but she also seems to be backing away from him since he constantly texts her and asks her to hang out. Whenever I stop by the apartment to drop something off, he seems irritated that I never hang out with him there. I'm really busy this year with an internship, classes, and other extracurriculars and when I DO get free time, I would prefer to hang out with my friends and boyfriend instead of staying cooped up in my apartment.

I am genuinely concerned for his well being as well as my living situation (since coming back to a semi-hostile roommate every day is getting to be a bit tiresome). I really don't know what to do since he seems to reject all of my ideas of joining new organizations or meeting new people and I'm hesitant to become a full-time shoulder to lean on. Moving out or kicking him out is out of the question since housing in my college town is extremely sparse and the options that are left are very expensive."
10ne5q,0,2012-09-28,my view on the interns,[deleted],greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/10ne5q/my_view_on_the_interns/,"so ive just recently started watching the show and am currently halfway through season 3. i feel that i need to throw in that im a guy and so my opinions may be mildly biased. but anyways these are my opinions on each character and what they represent. id love to hear some input and other opinions.

george omalley- i love george's character. i love what he represents and his continuous effort to be a good person. in my eyes george represents the struggle between being an honest doctor to their patient and the struggle between doing good for their patient and interfering with their coworkers. the way he speaks up for the patient when a coworker may be in the wrong and the way he supports his friends who are struggling with a patient.

izzie stevens- at first i really liked her character. the way she came from a trailer park and worked her ass off all the way to becoming a surgeon. but as she got tied up with denny she got progressively more annoying. i think that she represents the struggle doctors may have of becoming too attached to their patients. and i think her rash decisions cause more harm than any good that they may create and as of right now she is quite annoying being as stupid as she is.

christina yang- yang is one of my favorite characters. from being the hardworking intern that she is, to the way that she is straight to the point and (generally) thorough in her actions. but the way she represents the blank space between good doctors and worried patients, she has some of the worst bedside manner ive ever seen. and from what i can see her biggest struggle is balancing her work life and her social life. the two are far too interchangeable in the wrong spots (relationship with burke) and entirely absent where needed (speaking to and comforting patients)

alex karev- i dont have much about him, no idea what he represents or stands for. but ive recently started to like him. he just seems like a good guy for the most part

and lastly i have..

meredith grey- i absolutely full heartedly 100% hate meredith grey. i presume she is meant to represent the struggle of working with coworkers or something along those lines. but in the end she is a whore. a stupid, selfish, ignorant, arrogant whore. i cannot find an ounce of good in her. the way she feels entitled to date both derek and fin and then throws a fit when derek gives up and dumps fin (a great guy) because she loves to be hurt by derek. this. girl. sucks.

Now that I've obtained a job my new goal is to get promoted early. More specifically, become a senior in a year in a half as opposed to two. 

I've seen people's LinkedIn where they say they got promoted to senior early at a Big 4 and it seems they are very technically savvy which improves the efficiency of their work. Also met someone at an AICPA event who got promoted early, she started in January as opposed to fall too. Before the promotion she had her CPA, Master's degree, and had a bunch of internships while in school, including a busy season one. 

I've heard promotions are based off busy seasons and I've already interned during one and since I'm graduating in September
l'll have from September to December to sit around and hopefully complete my CPA. I won't have a master's degree but I'll still have 150 credits and a few minors(I.T., econ, and 1 or 2 more). Have taken a couple computer science/programming classes so I could be good with VBA by the time I start (bringing it back to being technically savvy). I have also had a bunch of internships all at major companies and plan to add one more to the list summer 2013. I also help with recruiting on campus and plan to continue to do so.

10pb5k,33,2012-09-30,The white turd,Axelior,SRSPOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSPOC/comments/10pb5k/the_white_turd/,"Hello Ms.

I go to prestigious university on a combination of academic and need-based scholarships. I am a computer science major, and I love programming and computers. I have a girlfriend who I am secretly engaged to and I will make that engagement public next year. Unbeknownst to her I will save up and buy a ring and get down on bended knee, and then tell the world.

i am a large 18 year old Jamaican-American male of very dark complexion. I inherited my build from my father who was a bodybuilder in Jamaica before coming to the U.S. with my mom to build houses and a great home for a family and for me an only son. I nurtured that build with construction work with my father. My mother stopped working to take care of her mother who had Alzheimer's and to teach me advanced subjects while I was in elementary school.

Everyone else in my classes is white and asian. My school (or at least who I see) is 95% white, Asian, and Indian. Growing up in a black community, I was constantly called an oreo, called white. The same people made fun of my dark skin and said I looked like a turd,  and that I disappeared into the night.

Here, I don't get that. I get people using the n-word around me ironically, because they are so far past racism. The validity of my presence in many areas, a hacking club, a research internship I won, is questioned until I am able to demonstrate sufficient intelligence. When I wear a hoody in the winter, people I was laughing with earlier in the dining halls don't recognize me and cross the street to avoid me.

I wear university branded T-shirts and clothing as much as I can so people know I'm one of the good ones, that I'm not scary, and I'm not stupid.

I get complimented so often on how well I speak (I have a pretty neutral, midwestern accent. I never picked up any Jamaican Patois from my parents,  or African-American English from my peers. Looking back, I wonder if this was purposefully done by my subconscious.) It's so good that I'm college. It's so amazing that I'm in such a good one.

My fiancee's mother is constantly trying to set her up with other guys, guys who she thinks is good, all of them white, all of them Slovaks to ""keep the blood strong."" None of them are as 'good' as me according to American Success^TM . I work hard, study hard, I go to a good school, I have a job, I'm also skilled in construction, haven't I done what I'm supposed to? Why am I not good enough yet? We have been dating for three years. They've never let me further in the house than the doorway. Apparently her mother mocks my car, because it is a '96 Toyota. The same car my mother took me to preschool in, I can pick up my girlfriend with now. The sentiment makes my girlfriend and me happy now. But it is not good enough.

I struggle so much with my race and identity. So many mornings I look into the mirror and hate the color of my skin. I wish my parents, the parents that I am so proud of and grateful too and love so much, didn't have such obvious accents that prompted comments on weed and Bob Marley. So many times I wish I could just wake up white. But I won't

Sorry for the wall of text. I just wanted to tell some people my experience in a safe place. Never shared them with others before. My whole environment thanks to my major, interests, and career path, is white and Asian middle to upper-middle class people. None of this means anything to them. Racism is over, we have a black president. Real problem is the huge (tiny) number of black kids in this college thanks to AA. Hopefully they don't think I am one. I didn't check my race on applications, so now I can claim to be free of that ""taint"". I am congratulated for it.

Thanks for listening."
10p5vd,9,2012-09-30,Never thought I'd have to ask this [21M] but I cheated on my girlfriend while away [21F] What's the best way to handle it?,critisize_away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10p5vd/never_thought_id_have_to_ask_this_21m_but_i/,"I saw a post a couple days ago that was similar to my situation and I figured I would ask for advice as well. I've been in a LDR for the last 6 months and during the summer I went to work at an internship overseas. For the most part it was a good learning experience but there was one night where we had the night off and I went out with two of the guys to go have fun and see an new country. I had talked with them beforehand and we were only supposed to go out for drinks and then come back after, so I figured no big deal. 

Ended up going out to a bar and they paid for all my drinks since I was the intern. It was a pretty good time and I ended up drinking more than my fair share. (Isn't that how every one of these stories goes) One of the guys I was working with had a lady friend and wanted to spend some alone time with her, which I didn't have a problem with. She had also brought a couple of friends though and he was very adamant that I spend time with one of them. I had told him many times before going out that I had a girlfriend and told him that night that I wasn't interested. He still pushed the idea though and had I been back home I would have just left but I was in another country, didn't know the language, didn't know exactly where I was, and had no form of communication. I figured it would be safer to stay with the group than wander off drunk and alone in the middle of the night. 

We left the bar and went to a hotel, told him again that I didn't want a room but he insisted. I then made one of the stupidest decisions in my life and instead of just saying no, in my drunk logic thought if I went in and gave him some bs story afterwards he would leave me alone. So I went in the room with another girl and told her that I wasn't interested and she was pretty confused by that. But we ended up watching TV for a bit and then she took a shower. I thought I had handled the situation well until she came back out in only a towel. At which point I screwed up royally, she felt me up a little I ended up feeling her up and kissing her once before the guilt and the realization of how much of an idiot I was set in and I left. Never took off my clothes, no sex, none of that but at the end of the day I still cheated and I feel like the biggest scumbag in the world. Got back to my room and pretty much died inside, I had done something I thought I was incapable of doing. 

I talked with the guy the next day told him that I felt like crap and he pretty much told me, ""Good, you're losing your morals and becoming a real man."" For the rest of the time I was there he would occasionally, for lack of a better term, brag about getting the intern to cheat on his girlfriend. Needless to say I never talked or went out with him again. The rest of the guys gave me that, what happens here stays here bs too. But I couldn't change what I had done. At the end of the day, I chose to go out with them, I chose to get way too drunk, I chose to go into that hotel room, and finally I chose to touch another girl.

I wanted to tell my girlfriend immediately but she was going abroad for a semester and the last thing I wanted to do was ruin her trip by letting her know that her boyfriends a cheating scumbag right at the start of it. I haven't seen her since the incident but I know I would have broken down if I had. I'm back at school now and it's a little over a month later, I'm talking with the school therapist but the guilt doesn't go away. I feel like I'm falling apart and I don't know what to do. Although he said he can't make a decision for me the therapist is asking me to hold off on telling. She is such an amazing girl and I love her. She doesn't deserve to live a lie though but I don't want to break her heart while she's on the other side of the world and supposed to be having an amazing time. Yes, I know I should have thought about that at the time. All I ever wanted was to make her happy and be happy with her but now I've selfishly thrown that away. 

I screwed up, it was my fault, my girlfriend did nothing to deserve this, I know I'm a cheating scumbag, a loser and all sorts of other names, if you want to call me them go ahead, it had never crossed my mind that I could screw up this badly. Also, for everyone who hasn't cheated, please learn from my poor decisions, just because you haven't doesn't mean you can't. Don't be an idiot like me and put yourself into situations where you could possibly screw up in the first place. But now I don't know what to do and am asking for help. Has anyone been in this situation or on the receiving end of this situation? How was it handled/what is the best way to handle it? 

**tl;dr I was overseas for an internship when I went out drinking with two guys. One of the guys went out of his way to get me to cheat and I ended up feeling up another girl. Girlfriend is abroad and I currently feel like the worlds biggest scumbag. I don't want to break her heart while she is supposed to be having an amazing time. It's been a month and I haven't told her yet. Therapist is implying no to tell yet. I don't know what to do.**"
10p1cx,10,2012-09-29,Non-stop for 6 months...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10p1cx/nonstop_for_6_months/,"In may, my Dad's spleen ruptured when he was on a cruise. He almost died, and I spent my entire savings to fly down to Ft.Lauderdale and see him through this tough time. This would be the first time I would see my step mom for 7 years, she has never liked me and has been less than kind. 
----she would call me a fag in front of my friends, belittle me, call me ""short with a big nose that no woman will ever want,"" has fucked up my self esteem, and nearly ruined my relationship with my father. She is a disgusting pig.
This was the most trying week of my life, or so I thought. My Dad would go on to spend months in hospitals. From May until July my Dad was in the hospital.

In July, I was squeezed out of my job, found a new one, was abused at that job, left, found a new job (unpaid internship), found a job to supplement it, interviewed for another job, and took the new job that would ultimately pay more money. As a result, I now have $150 to my name. I had to borrow Money from my parents to pay my bills. 

To top it off, my best friend was killed in Afghanistan in the beginning of August by a IED. 

Think it's over? Not even close...ever heard of Mollescum Contagiosum? Well I have developed that on my genitals, I went to a dermatologist and had an STD test to confirm this, and yes it is mollescum contagiosum, as my STD panel came back 100% clean on everything. 

Now, I am broke, despondent, living paycheck to paycheck, barely making it though school, I have mollescum contagiosum, my friend is dead, (my dad is better, which I am thankful for as our relationship has improved). However, I am sitting on piles of debt, and I just want it to be my time ya know?

Im not stupid, I have a Bachelors Degree, and I am getting additional schooling, I am competent and qualified, yet I cant find a job making more than $10 an hour. 

When is it going to be my time? When will I make money? When will I find a women who loves me and be happy? Why do good people get killed? 

Im so stressed...I just feel like I am going to break down. But I press on, like I always do. "
