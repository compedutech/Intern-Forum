I need your help, your feedback, and mostly, your honest opinion.

TL;DR: **Please, help me get out of this depression! I WANT TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND I NEED YOUR GUIDANCE**

I've been depressed for quite some years, and since recently I want to become who I want to be happy again!
I'm ready to try anything, even though it's against the feeling in my gut.


I'm on my Erasmus in Sweden, and i've left myself in my room, and would play videogames, instead of exploring the outside world and enjoying the nice weather. I've done some stuff with friends, and traveled here and there, but I regret that I didn't take every chance I got, everytime I thought ""It's such nice weather outside"", yet I decided to stay at home and sleep in until the afternoon, basically killing the day.


**How did this start?**
Whenever I'm alone, or rather, without my GF, I just can't sleep. To fall asleep alone is almost like a torture. I feel sad, empty, self-loathed, and I just want to cry but I'm not able to cry as I would like to. I would want to bawl, because it would comfort me, but all I can cry is a few tears and feel the pain of sadness in my guts. I can't tell if it's loneliness, rather that I don't have a distraction. Even then, if I'm sleeping with others in the room, I might still feel the same deep down there. But when I sleep with my girlfriend, I forget about all the things that make me feel so depressed. Sometimes I think about them, but I just need to look at her and I just realize everytime again and again how insignificant my problems are and that I cannot change anything about my past, except the present and future. Recently, alot of friends ended up in the hospital. My grandpa of a cardiac arrest twice, a close friend died of a brain infection, another had a stroke, a few traffic collisions, and stories from other peers with terrible endings. The brain infection death of my friend is fairly recent, and before he became sick, I was pretty sick myself and had a horrible headache and neckpain, to which I hoped I don't have an infection in my head. I got better, then my friend got in the hospital and died... I got sick again, and it got alot worse (Mononucleosis), I didn't eat or drink and ended up in the hospital on an infuse for a couple of hours to get some water en minerals. It really helped me, I stayed at home for another week to get better. I laid there in the hospital and at home with all the pain, and compared to the others it was nothing, my pain was really nothing compared to what they went through, yet I could barely stand it. I thought I could die... I'm not in a fairy tale where I will reach 80+ years and be happy, I can really die in my early 20's and it doesn't even have to be my fault... There I realized how valuable life is, how I want to hold on to it, and stop dwelling on bullshit.


**I changed**
Suddenly, as I got rid of most of the symptoms and could walk around like a normal person, I noticed I changed.
The person I was, who liked to be alone at home, craved for social interaction. The one who didn't care about others, started showing interest in their lifes and what they are doing, actually caring about becoming friends or just getting to know each other. I've gotten physically alot more active. I want to visit places, I want to do stuff with friends, meet new people, and I take initiative and I'm not afraid to express myself. Everything was first the contrary. Maybe it's not also a bit overwhelming, but it feels good! I'm still not there, I still get stuck in the spiral, especially when I'm alone and I still dwell on my past on the stupid things I've done, but like I've said, I need to get convinced that it's all the past now, and maybe even be thankful for all my messups, because I learned from it how bad those things could make me feel, and what I shouldn't do. A piece of reality that makes me move forward, accept as things are and enjoy life. I believe it's my period of sickness and all these people around me being off so much worse, which made me realize that life it too short to be thinking over some couple of stupid dollars I missed out on, and that I should be gratefull for alot of stuff. I became positive, and even got commnets that I'm so positively thinking lately. I catch myself it's not always the case, but really, I've improved alot! 



What mostly runs in my head, is:
**Spreading my sadness and bad mood**
I wasted so much of my life being depressed, not wanting to do anything, and mainly, having a stupid mood which not only affected me, but also others around me. I believe my mom is pretty sad about the fact that I'm like this, and yes, I'm sad too. Because of myself, and because of my mom, and other loved ones. I would also be very pessimistic, especially around optimistic people like my mom and GF (god, I wonder how they managed it this far with me). 


**Money**
This year, I have wasted 3000 dollars on shares, due to some stupid reasoning. Then I also missed out on a grant for my studies, which was another 1500 dollars because I tried to apply, then I red somewhere that ""it's not possible"". All I needed to do, is read it carefully and I would've known I could request it through another form. Another wasted 1500 dollars come from the fact that I was past the deadline to apply for a grant for doing my internship abroad. But I was already after the deadline when I got to know that I got the internship and I couldn't fill it in in advance. So I don't count it really, as I didn't anticipate I would go abroad to begin with and actually be accepted. Anyway, 4500 down the gutter. Of 3000 dollars I had the chane it might have become something more, of 1500 dollars I missed out on because of my stupidity. I used to be very clever with money, but now there are some things I could've done better. Canceling some stuff that I didn't need could safe me another 500 a year. So this year, I wasted ALOT of money, and it's eating me.


Money doesn't make happy, but money can make sad and life a bit tougher.


**Self-loathing**
Whatever I do, I always think it wasn't good enough, and that I can do better. The fact is that I never try 100% and actually be happy whatever the result is, because I did my best. It should be the latter, not the former! It's very hard to change that mindset, but as of recently I decided that whatever I do, I will try my best, and pet myself on the back and tell myself what went good, and take the improvements as a point of attention for next time, but still getting satisfaction from my succes and my attempts at doing my best. This goes for anything I do. I will start with hygiene ""I showered quickly, and I feel fresh and clean!"" Like always, but I will try to appreciate the little things about life. By the way, my dad is an asshole which I haven't seen for 10 years because I feel he doesn't deserve me, a dad who only yelled with psychological abuse and sometimes even physical. To this day I get pissed and can get my day ruined just by thinking about him. 

**I miss the good old times**
I miss being a kid. Not in age or the lack of responability... I lack the time where everything was interesting, where the smallest things made me happy, where I could express myself and not be afraid, where I could socialize, have energy to do anything I could think of. To get tired and just go on, because I want to. Meeting new people, having fun in everything. I want to be emotional again. I want to feel emotions like I used to. So happy that I can't get that grin off my face, so sad that I just can bawl, so in love that my heart beats uncontrollably and feel the butterflies in my stomach that my GF gives me. I already experience it, but rarely, on days where I forget about anything, and just think about the presence, which is maybe once a month. I really love my girlfriend, and it's one of the few emotions that I still feel, stronger than other emotions but less than anger, emptiness, and sadness and anything that depression is feeding on.





**I'm not there yet, I need help**
I've woken up. Life is short, life is valuable, I should stop dwelling on bullshit that has happened, be grateful for whatever happened which has brought me to where I am, and pay life back for enjoying it. But I'm only getting started to get over it, and I need your help, your advice, to tell me what worked for you so I can try it without guarantee, but just see IF it might work for me.


I want to live life to the fullest, I'm sick of laying in bed all day, literally, or locking myself up and being the pessimistic arse who thinks that everything sucks and nothing is fun. I want to be a person who inspires others, I want to be fun, the man of my girlfriends dreams and the son a mom could have always wished for.

TL;DR: **Please, help me get out of this depression! I WANT TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND I NEED YOUR GUIDANCE**

2nwd0b,2,2014-11-30,My girlfriend [21F] of one year says she is unsure if she loves me [21M],uncertainthrowaway21,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nwd0b/my_girlfriend_21f_of_one_year_says_she_is_unsure/,"We have been dating for over a year. This is my first real relationship while it is her first relationship.

I think she is a great person that I love spending time with. We are very comfortable with each other and she is the only person I am comfortable being really myself around. The same goes for her. We told we loved each other about 2-3 months into the relationship and we only grew closer after that. She had an internship at a different city than I was so we did long distance over the summer. We visited each other every week and spent the weekends together.

After summer, things only got better. We were back at school and sleeping together every night and waking up together every morning. From my perspective, things seemed to get better and better. We were really compatible and we were falling in love with each other more and more.

She can be considered to be an emotionally unavailable person. She really keeps a lot to herself and she doesn't like confrontation. Whenever we argue, she closes down and doesn't share what's in her mind that openly.

Even though she was the first one to say I love you, she also was the first one to bring up her doubts about whether what we have is actually love or not. She brought it up on multiple occasions, saying she doesn't feel the ""butterflies"" or she sometimes doesn't feel close or ""lovey dovey"" all the time. I assured her that this was fine and that not everyone feels those, and that they aren't characteristics to love. I also told her that I sometimes feel more distant as well and this is just natural, and that she shouldn't think that we don't have anything because of these reasons. Most of these arguments were easily resolved and we were back to our normal selves.

These arguments were fine until today when we had a larger discussion about this. She had been distant lately and I started to get the impression that she wasn't into our relationship as she used to. Even though we spent most of our days, and all of our nights together, I was starting to feel I was more invested and into it than she was. Her reactions almost made me feel scared to tell her I love her or show any sort of intimacy. I brought it up with her and she told me that it was the same issue again.

I tried to be as understanding as possible, trying to get her to talk and share her emotions but she wasn't very open about it. Here are some of the things she said:

- You are my best friend, you are the only person I can feel comfortable being myself around.

- I care about you more than I care about anyone else.

- I love spending time with you, and being able to tell you about the things that happen during the day.

- I love sleeping with you and waking up next to you.

I know these to be true for a fact. I have no doubt that we are amazing together and that we work. We definitely are compatible and when we spend time together, doing things that we love, we enjoy it thoroughly. Even doing our own things on our computers, we are happier and more comfortable if we are together. She says she loves cuddling together and watching a movie with me. She, however, also says that I started to feel more and more like a really close friend than a boyfriend. I tried to explain to her that this isn't a bad thing and this is the normal course of a relationship.

Now she is at her place, reflecting on the things we talked about today. I, however, doubt that she actually will. We will be talking tomorrow again but I find it really hurtful that she is stepping back on the ""I love you"". I can see that she loves me, I had no doubt that she does. But her coming to me and telling me that she is not sure definitely hurts. It also hurts to see that she isn't open to an open, emotional discussion. She kept telling me ""I have nothing to say"". I told her that her reluctance in discussing this openly makes me feel unimportant. I told her that she should put the effort and in a way ""fight"" to show me that she loves me so that we can still be together. She says she still wants to be together yet doesn't make an effort to make me feel better about it.

As I said, she is really not the type of person that's good with emotions. She tends to block them and try to move on with her life. This is due to her parents. I don't want her emotional unavailability to be the reason why this relationship ends. I know we can work, I know I can help her get better with expressing her emotions. She seems to be confused about what love is. She is under the impression that it should be an overwhelming feeling experienced every living moment, or if that's not the case, that it is not really love.

I have no doubt I want her in my life, and I have no doubt that she would also be miserable if we weren't together. However, she doesn't seem to see that because she doesn't follow streams of thought that make her feel uncomfortable. I don't want to lose what we have together just because she is not imagining how it would be without us being together.

What do you think? Do you have any experiences I can gain insight from? If you agree with me, what should I tell her to show the actual situation? If you disagree with me, how should I be looking at the situation?

**tl;dr**: We have been dating for a year and after having exchanged ""I love you""s for over six months and spending great time together, my girlfriend says she is not sure if this is actually love because she doesn't feel the ""butterflies"". What should I do? "

2nwquu,1,2014-11-30,Advice,[deleted],linuxquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/2nwquu/advice/,"Hey all, I'm not sure this is the appropriate place to ask but I figure if the right person reads this and it amounts to anything at all I did something constructive.
quick backstory:
I'm a 32 year old chef in NYC that is been beaten down by the business and ready to move on.  After high school (2001) I went to a small tech school for ""computer programming"", at the time I was taught xml, html, java and sql. 
I finished the program and realized soon after that my education was basically useless.  
After 10 months of job searching in Philadelphia and cooking on the side to survive, I abandoned that career path and went to culinary school to pursue an avenue I knew I could find steady work in. 
Fast forward to today:
I live in NYC and worked as a chef here full time (70 hrs+), I just recently had a child and this change in my life has brought to the surface some harsh realizations. 
1st and most important is family time will never exist if I continue to cook.  I rarely see my daughter and my wife is asking when something will happen and I'll have something more ""flexible"".  
2nd and secondary is the pay... I have been cooking since I was 15 years old and professionally since I was 18. I have run kitchens, managed in large hotels and ""put my time in"" having never made more than 40k a year. 

I spoke to my executive chef at a michelin star restaurant in manhattan and had a very tough decision put before me, continue on my path making 40k a year as a sous chef and maybe one day make chef de cuisine and be making 65k. He came clean and told me he's not making 6 figures despite his mild fame and reputation in the culinary world.  He told me I would never make good money in this bizz and if the love of food wasn't enough to sacrifice everything else I was in the wrong business. 
Thats where this post comes in.

I always wanted to get back into tech, I have all but forgotten most of what I learned 12+ years ago. 
I was top of my class all those years back, was always done projects first and cleanest, problem solving and spotting broken code came easy to me.
I feel that given how much the tech sector has grown in the last decade maybe there is hope for me yet, maybe somewhere out there is a way back in. 
I've taken a new position working 30 hours a week at a small place near my apartment, $11/hr prepping in the am and left my other position... 
I'm trying to explore all options and now that I have a lot more time on my hands maybe get an unpaid internship 
cleaning keyboards and looking over shoulders in an effort to learn something. 
Any advice from fellow new yorkers is much appreciated. 

TLDR: Chef looking for career change in NYC will work for min wage "
2nx6g8,7,2014-12-01,Me [19 M] could use some help with a pretty serious crush.,doda124,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nx6g8/me_19_m_could_use_some_help_with_a_pretty_serious/,"OK- I just typed this all up in an AskWomen thread, and I've kind of been hiding this problem from my self, so I figured I'd just bring it here and hopefully someone can give me some advice.

 I've had a few crushes throughout high school and the first few years of college, and it was nothing big. I'm pretty conservative and the idea with me was always finish school, go corporate, save some money, then start focusing on women/a woman. In other words, I don't even try to go for dates/ relationships at all. I want to graduate before all of that. It all sounds good IDEALLY, but that's not how feelings work. I've had 1 semi-serious crush recently, and then a recent crush who just has such a strong effect on me.
   So, about 2 years ago I met someone at my campus. Our ideas and values lined up pretty well, and i started to really get interested in her, and then something happened (doesnt really make sense so I'm not going to bother explaining it) and then she became a completely different person to me, so that one kind of went backwards. 
 Now here's the one that I'm stuck on so far. I was browsing some related youtube videos and ended up watching a 25 min personal video she posted and I pretty much immediately fell head over heels (which almost never happens with me) Everything about her that I saw in the video was extremely attractive to me (moreso than a few other guys. I later showed my cousin who I'm really close with, and he said I'm just crushing hard) , and the video was pretty heartfelt. it was a really strong crush, but I figured she was in the Northeast (like New York) for some reason. At the bottom of the video there was a link to her tumblr, so I logged into a dusty account I made a few years back and kind of read most of her blog and posts over the next few days(I kinda felt like a creep, but the term facebook-stalking didn't come out of thin air). Everything I read just made her sound more amazing. I sent her a message telling her that I really enjoyed the video and hope everything goes well with her, she sent a nice reply back, and i thought that was the end of it. I noticed later that she had another youtube video, so I watched it and noticed the area and realized she was under 30 min away from where I go to school. I sent her another message, there was a little bit of back and forth between us, she mentioned that she was planning on going to that school, I talked for a little bit, and that was pretty much the end of the conversation. Now I'm stuck in the position where I REALLY like her from what I know about her, but she pretty much knows nothing about me- and I kind of feel like a creep by thinking I know her, because its all online and can be summed up in a few messages and her blog. On one hand, I don't want to say anything, because I have 2 semesters of school left and I have a paid summer internship at my dream job, and I want to get my shit in line. On the other hand, I cant help but think about her throughout the day, and for 1-2 hours when I go to bed. thoughts just keep running through my head. Now, I'm usually very rational, and my emotions stay contained, but I'm finding it incredibly difficult. One part of me can't stop thinking of her, the other part of me says get your shit together, finish whats important, then worry about this stuff- besides, you dont even know the girl. Only other two things that are in the way is that even though I'm pretty confident, I know I'm chubby and have been working on losing it (currently 6'2 and 240lbs, from 290lbs 1.5 yrs ago) and want to continue losing weight and look the best I can before I start looking around. The other thing is that I'm, like i said, 6'2, currently 240, and I'm pretty sure she's like 5'0/ 5'1 and like 100-130lbs. I think its cute, but it'd seem like a pea and a Sasquatch. and that's my internal argument. any advice, etc, would be much appreciated. 

TL;DR- crushing extremely hard on girl i haven't even met, more so than I ever have before in my life, 1 year before graduation.

Trying to save on student deals.,call-now,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/2nx9zo/first_build_computer_science_student_and_gaming/,"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Gaming , college work , and taking advantage of my school's free software and subscription to Lynda.com to learn new things. Biggest priority is high graphics/fps. Very addicted to Total War: Rome 2 [can't stop daydreaming what it will be like to play with over 10fps on low settings :) ]  Will also like to play games like battlefield 4.  Will be teaching myself C# for an internship I have lined up. I can see myself dicking around with free software I get from school such as adobe creative suite and autodesk but nothing too serious for that, I just want to be able to explore.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$600-$700 

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

This Week. Especially since today is Cyber Monday

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Just Tower

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Indiana.  Best Buys / RadioShacks in town and a Fry's an hour away if it's worth it.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Mouse ,  Keyboard , TV as Monitor (LG-32 LH30 LCD 1080p).

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Nope

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

SSD. (I get 100GB of free storage through school so that is not an issue at all)

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Whatever is cheapest. It's whats on the inside that counts :)

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I think so , it's complicated. I *could* buy windows 7 or 8 really cheap through my school but the website saids that you're not allowed to instal it on a blank machine it's only for upgrading.  but I don't know if that's something the disc can actually stop you from doing or if that's a legal thing they just have to put up. 

. Unless anyone knows how that process works I think I'll just play it safe and buy Windows 8 from a vendor.I know it's only $70 through microsoft  if your a student , not sure if it's cheaper somewhere else though.

Have any of you taken back a ""cheater""?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nxj75/my_m22_ex_f21_cheated_broke_up_with_me_has/,"Sorry for the wall of text, I need to get this off my chest as much as I need advice. I’m a fresh college graduate trying to make my way in the world while everything kinda disintegrates around me.

My ex and I dated for the last 2 years of university and our relationship was pretty fucking awesome; we had even considered moving in together for the last few semesters. During that time we had a brief flirtation with long distance while she was abroad for a few months, which was kinda rough but honestly survivable. And so it was with great trepidation that we cast our eyes forwards towards ""real life"" when I graduated last spring (She's a year under and will be finishing this spring). 

The plan was for me to stay with an internship at school during the summer. She needed to work during the summer and found a position as a counselor at an alumni family camp for our school. We were then going to go on an awesome road trip before I moved back home (essentially a state away) to apply to graduate school and do more internships.

This really was the beginning of the end. The camp was essentially an extension of the greek system, which seems to be the norm for these kinds of things, and featured copious drinking, rampant sex and all other fratty things. (An example of which were parties where they would rephrase popular song lyrics to summarize major events in camp and thus mostly served to ""call out"" people and spread gossip. Essentially these songs recounted the sex lives of the counselors set to music.)

Because of the atmosphere she was quite busy (she needed to be with kids at 8 and they consistently partied til 2 or 3) and long-distance really started to break down while she was at camp. Things like I wouldn't hear from her for a few days or when I did I would get a twenty minute conversation of nothing. (E.g. ""What did you dress up as for the party last night?"" ""Oh... ah. I don't know! ha ha."") After a month of this she visited me and kinda-sorta put us on a break. Like she used those words and the terms of the ""break"" weren't defined. I was mostly reeling from the sudden loss of contact and the change that I saw in her and said OK, trying to carry on as usual.

When she came back at the end of the summer it was like everything had gone back to normal, that was until one of my last days on campus when we had gone out with some friends. She was telling camp stories, which genuinely are unbelievable and had a throwaway line about making out with a chick. I hadn't known that had happened and wasn't really OK with it, so I made eye contact with her but let it slide. When I asked her about it later, it turns out she had more than made out with more than just chicks, and one night had ended up fucking one of the other (male) counselors.

At this point I would like to say I kicked her to the curb and all that macho shit, but mostly I was shocked. I left for a little hour long walk around campus at 4AM. When I got back I almost kicked her out, but she ended up staying the night mostly because a bunch of her shit was in my apartment and I needed to move out that day. After a few teary breakdowns in the U-Haul, I decided after all the shit I went through I was going to take the trip with her at least for me. (In my mind the alternative was going to my parents house and I really couldn’t have handled that.) During that trip, maybe out of fear, maybe out of love, I decided that I could forgive her and overlook a single drunken trespass. It was at this point that she broke up with me. 

Her reasoning was that she had just been unfaithful and we were moving into a long-distance phase. I think this also was exacerbated by the real-life-ness of the decisions we’re about to start making, as I’ll probably be moving somewhere else for graduate school and she may need to do something similar for her post-grad stuff. Honestly it made sense, but I’m kinda a romantic and never wanted it to happen. She wanted to still be friends and keep in contact, but I say I need time and essentially break contact with her in September.

I’m going to finish this up now as I’m probably past some sort of word limit. She just visited and wants to get back together. She’s saying things like I’m the best thing that ever happened to her and she’s been crying for hours knowing that she hurt me as badly as she did. I sincerely believe she’s a good person: that she’s entirely transparent in her motives. I just don’t know what this means for me, for us. She’s the kind of girl that I could see myself settling down with permanently, but after the drama of the last six months I’ve not sure. I just worry that I’ll look back and see the one that got away. I know that I'm young and there are plenty of other fish, but the romantic inside me says something about her is special.

About two years into our relationship, I was put on some very necessary medication which killed my libido.  Before then, our sex life seemed pretty normal to me (though I've really only ever had long distance relationships to compare it to), but apparently I'm remembering it wrong, that our having sex wasn't too frequent before the medication.

About a year ago, I was put on another necessary medication that brought my libido back, but unfortunately, the first medication had done a lot irreparable damage.  We had turned into best friends who sleep next to each other and go on ""dates"" and who cook together, but the lusty/romantic magic was gone.  Even when we'd try to make out, everything was wrong.  We just didn't mesh anymore.

In February, my partner found and fell in love with my metamour and we all moved 15 hours away (for a job, school and internship) and live together (after housing would have been impossible/too expensive to live apart).  Outside of finding equitable time and space with our shared partner, things have been running very smoothly.  I really like my metamour, she's a great fit for our (formerly) shared partner and she's a great housemate.

After about a year of me being frustrated/heartbroken that I can't and don't have the same romantic/sexual/new relationship energy relationship with my (former) partner as my metamour does and my (former) partner feeling guilty constantly that they can't give me what I want and knowing that they're ""a source of so much of [my] unhappiness"", we decided to break things off last night.  Honestly, it's been in the works for a while, definitely before February.  If it didn't happen now, it certainly would've happened in the next year or so.

So we've decided to make things easier and honest and we broke up.  While it was a mutual decision, I am absolutely devastated.  They're all I've known for SUCH a long time, and even if our relationship is still exactly the same at this very literal second (outside of us ""breaking up"") as it was before last night, I'm still feeling a loss.  I don't know how to deal with this.  I still have them around as my absolute best friend in the whole world, but the idea that I won't ever kiss them again and telling them that I love them would be (and feel, with our new status) inappropriate is a really difficult idea to grasp.  This would have happened eventually and has not been affected by my metamour.  

I am not currently dating or sleeping with anyone else, and it's been a very, very long time (like, a year or two?) since I've slept with anyone, period.  It should be easy to find someone else to meet, even just to be friends (let alone a romantic/sexual partner), but we moved to a somewhat remote area with a very small queer community.  I really like it here and I have a job that I really like and I'm not interested in (nor could I afford to) moving.  

In moments of clarity, I can see how this is really a good, healthy thing.  I no longer have to feel anxious or jealous that my former metamour is getting all of our former partner's time and energy and feeling like what I get are ""the scraps"".  I no longer feel held back by what my former relationship offered me and I can have that with someone else.  We still have a car, a dog, an apartment, family, and a host of other things together, but now it's different.

How do I deal with this?  How do I deal with not sleeping next to my ex every night?  How can I deal knowing that they're having a (probably healthy) sex life with someone across the hall from me?  How can I not feel guilty for my first medication being the catalyst to our broken sex life?  We both know it was necessary to take it and they aren't resentful at me for it, but I can't help but feel like I was the one who started this whole mess years ago.  How can I deal knowing that my metamour has everything that I've wanted in my relationship with my ex and now I'm single with no prospects, and nobody to run to who could (at least temporarily) distract me from this.  How can I grieve this loss?  Everything that I'm typing here is what we talked about least night, so ""talk to your ex!"", while totally valid, is kind of a moot point.  Any advice or specific talking points you can give me would be really helpful.

TL;DR-- Mutual breakup of a relationship of 6 years because we haven't meshed well sexually or romantically for years.  Now we're going to stick to ""best friends in the world"", but we still live together, with the other person they're dating.  We were in a polyamorous relationship, so I hold no resentment toward my metamour."

Thanks to /u/sahyee




**1) What are good pieces of information to use when displaying potential risks a client is going through? (Client is A Payment Gateway)**

&gt;In general, risk identification will vary from client to client but there are methodologies that are commonly used to get there. This is a topic I could write a paper on, but I'll try to keep it short (for now at least). The key that I feel to understand risks effectively, no matter who the client is, is understand their business processes. How are their key business functions performed? What are their processes, step-by-step and start to finish? Which systems and networks are involved? Which data assets are involved and where are they stored/transmitted? When you have a good understanding of all of that information, it becomes easier to go ""a domain at a time"" and think - okay, what are the network risks here? Procedural/Human risks? Are vendors involved? What does access management look like for this company? How about physical security? You can use that information, frameworks, and your own experience and knowledge to get a decent picture of the threats that face an enterprise. Also don't downplay the benefits of staying current in business and infosec news.




**2) What are the best ways (in short) to mitigate risks if the company in question is holding a lot of sensitive information from their clients?**
&gt; If a company holds ""sensitive"" information from clients, there are several concerns. Firstly - how sensitive is the data? Is it subject to regulatory compliance risks (e.g. PCI, HIPAA, FERPA, SOX, etc.) or is it more proprietary in nature? Having a data classification scheme within the organization that is codified can help with this - I assume you might mean payment data as per your first question. I know this seems like a roundabout answer, but there isn't necessarily a ""best"" way to mitigate risks - the risks an enterprise faces are totally dependent on the risk appetite and overall risk view of senior management. Typically when I hear ""Sensitive"" information, however, I immediately think of regulatory risks. I would start by identifying risks to sensitive data assets, seeing which risks can be accepted/transferred/avoided and then use both regulations and frameworks/guidelines to guide mitigation efforts. In the case of payment data, I'd say start with PCI - it covers network security, policies and procedures, access management, and a whole gamut of other topics. Also I'd refer to several of the NIST publications (SP 800) that relate to information security, and implement many of their suggestions in various security areas. Does this answer your question at all?


**3) Some good reads maybe you can suggest me to go through?**

&gt;Good reads, there are so many. The thing about IS Risk is that it is very broad - a good IS Risk Analyst needs knowledge of many areas of security and computing, and also business, finance, and more. A book that I thought was awesome for getting my head in the right place is: Managing Risk and Information Security: Protect to Enable by Malcolm Harkins (the CISO of Intel - also this book should be free on Amazon for Kindle/Kindle Apps on Android and iOS if I'm not mistaken). For breadth in security disciplines, I'd recommend (as odd as this sounds) reading through something like a CompTIA Security+ exam prep book - that exam covers a lot of areas of infosec that will get your feet wet across the board and help you understand a little bit of what risk professionals need to consider. And also as boring as it may sound, check out NIST SP 800-37, Managing Information Security Risk (it might be 39, but I think it's 37). It is actually very thorough and not entirely dry.


**4)What made you get into this for a profession? AND study it in school?**
&gt;My journey into infosec isn't totally unorthodox, but I jumped into it rather suddenly. A couple of years ago I got my B.S. in Computer Science from a mid-tier public research university. I was thinking about grad school but wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do. I took an interest in cyber security after hearing about some data breach (I don't remember the specific incident) and after some research I took an interest in Management Information Systems (MIS, an academic program at my university). I saw the course list, Information Assurance, Database Management Systems, Network Security, Digital Forensics, and I knew I was interested. I applied and joined the program, and in a series of events I received a scholarship for future cybersecurity professionals which allowed me to join research groups and work on some pretty cool technical projects. I took more interest in risk, compliance, governance, etc. because of my MIS program - I learned a lot about how information security isn't just about ""hackers"" and after some internships and talks from professionals I realized that working in the risk area is where ""the money is"" - not just dollars but where I'd get to use a wide array of knowledge in security on a daily basis. I see now that I made the right choice - I'm not limited to a niche technical skill job, but I get to use a whole breadth (and depth) of infosec knowledge which has earned me respect and gotten me some pretty cool responsibilities on the job and in research projects academically. Having a knowledge of risk, I learned, is also a key asset in determining whether or not you can move up and become a manager in the field, or a CISO especially (which is something I'd like to do). This is an extremely truncated version of my path into the field, but I think I covered the gist!

**5)Your personal view on Insurance to mitigate Unauth. Access related risks/losses? (I am an insurance professional, hence the question)**

&gt;Using insurance to mitigate unauth? In general I feel like insurance (risk transference) is a pretty sloppy way to handle most risks. Insurance to protect against a tornado destroying a datacenter? Sure. Against unauth? I mean, extra options can't hurt but I'd much rather have better procedures both from a technical and a managerial side to mitigate those risks. I think having insurance to protect against access related risks/losses isn't sustainable - if companies decide its cheaper to use insurance than actually analyze and protect their systems through sound processes, they are just going to get breached time and time again. This will eventually just make insurance for those risks unaffordable anyways when insurance companies realize how often data breaches happen and how much money they'll be paying out. Then there are regulatory issues, reputation risks, and a whole other can of worms gets opened. Some other professionals may have a different view than I do, but I think only having insurance to transfer those risks (since it isnt truly mitigating) is just lazy and setting up your business for total failure."
2nxren,1,2014-12-01,"31 [M4FFFFM] Office on the top floor, group kik erotic roleplay",mydirtyrp,dirtykikpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/2nxren/31_m4ffffm_office_on_the_top_floor_group_kik/,"CURRENTLY RECRUITING FEMALR EMPLOYEES!

So I have been wanting to set this up for a while now after being inspired by some different posts. While I enjoy pen pals here on reddit, kik is just so much easier to keep up with. It is also so much better for getting groups of people chatting together, it does however suffer from rather short interactions.

My idea is this: create a kik group for long term sexual roleplay based around the setting of an executive level office floor. We all work for the same company (Saeder-Krupp America) as its executives and their assistants. Given the rigors of our work, it has become common to blow off steam through sexual means and as long as the work gets done, no one much cares who is fucking who.

Everyone in the rp group will be given a position and title as fits an actual executive office. This will also be for those that can roleplay on kik during office hours in the US, that means 8 am eastern to 6 pm pacific (Thats 7 am till 9 pm central time). You are certainly welcome use the group to chat and play outside of those hours, but you should be somewhat active at some point during them.

The positions in the company and the current occupants:

CEO - Derrick Fletcher (u/mydirtyrp)

Assistant to the CEO - open

CFO - open

Assistant to the CFO - open

COO - Jon Ward

Assistant to the COO - open

VP of Sales - John Barton

VP of Development - Ashley Rose

VP of Finances - open

VP of Infrastructure - open

VP of Personnel - open

Assistants/Secretary Pool - Zach Payne

Intern Group - Drake Mondan

If you wish to apply for a position please pm me and we can discuss your qualifications. The primary factor in what I am looking for is creativity and detailed in your writing abilities. Additionally you should be familiar with groups and roleplay chat in general.

That all being said, there are some specific concerns that I have and want to address.

RULES OF THE OFFICE:

Be Honest: This one is going to be long but it is important to me for everyone to have a good time. You must be honest about who you really are. I do not care who or what you actually are in real life with regards to what you roleplay, but you must be honest with me and the others in the group in order for everyone to feel comfortable. This means if you are a male and want to rp a female, that is fine, but you must be up front about it. The inverse is true as well. If it turns out you have lied about your identity you will be asked to leave the group. With this in mind, I am the only one that can ask someone to verify and will be done in private. Anyone else trying to force someone to verify will be asked to leave the group.

Be Discreet: Since we are all here to have fun of a rather erotic nature, you must be a person of discretion. That means no sharing people's usernames, no saving or sharing of others photos, no outing others on websites. Anyone found doing anything regarding exposing another user will be removed from the group.

Be Respectful: This is an erotic roleplay, but that does not mean you can act a fool or be abrasive. You must always have another members consent for any activity in the group. If you and a member are going to participate in a shared fetish that is more extreme that might disturb others (intense bdsm, ageplay, rapeplay, bodily waste, etc.) you should take it private. You may not abuse or berate others in the group. Do not bring in any bigotry, hate speech, or -ism into the group. If you are warned about behavior, correct it or leave. If you have a problem with a member, you come to me.

Be Tolerant: There will be people or situations that might not be your thing, but that does not mean you can call others out. If what is going on is consensual and not harming the group, then ignore it if it isn't your interest. Also, try and resolve conflicts between yourselves without being disruptive, and take it to a private chat. If you can't let me know.

Be Your Character: Once you have settled your character, stay in that character while in the chat. If you need to speak out of character to deal with something, notate it as such. Also be somewhat realistic about things, no body-bending positions, guys with zero refractory period, or other crazy sexual oddities.

Show Up For Work: I recognize that real life is a thing and there are times where you can't jump in, but try and keep the group up to date on those things. If you are going to be out for more than a day or two, let someone know. Prolonged or excessive absences will be removed from the group in order to make room for other roleplayers.

So if after reading all of this, you are interested in joining, the please send me your info and we will find you a position. Hope to hear from many of you soon."
2nxxqg,1,2014-12-01,Advice,[deleted],computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/2nxxqg/advice/,"Hey all, I'm not sure this is the appropriate place to ask but I figure if the right person reads this and it amounts to anything at all I did something constructive.
quick backstory:
I'm a 32 year old chef in NYC that is been beaten down by the business and ready to move on.  After high school (2001) I went to a small tech school for ""computer programming"", at the time I was taught xml, html, java and sql. 
I finished the program and realized soon after that my education was basically useless.  
After 10 months of job searching in Philadelphia and cooking on the side to survive, I abandoned that career path and went to culinary school to pursue an avenue I knew I could find steady work in. 
Fast forward to today:
I live in NYC and worked as a chef here full time (70 hrs+), I just recently had a child and this change in my life has brought to the surface some harsh realizations. 
1st and most important is family time will never exist if I continue to cook.  I rarely see my daughter and my wife is asking when something will happen and I'll have something more ""flexible"".  
2nd and secondary is the pay... I have been cooking since I was 15 years old and professionally since I was 18. I have run kitchens, managed in large hotels and ""put my time in"" having never made more than 40k a year. 

I spoke to my executive chef at a michelin star restaurant in manhattan and had a very tough decision put before me, continue on my path making 40k a year as a sous chef and maybe one day make chef de cuisine and be making 65k. He came clean and told me he's not making 6 figures despite his mild fame and reputation in the culinary world.  He told me I would never make good money in this bizz and if the love of food wasn't enough to sacrifice everything else I was in the wrong business. 
Thats where this post comes in.

I always wanted to get back into tech, I have all but forgotten most of what I learned 12+ years ago. 
I was top of my class all those years back, was always done projects first and cleanest, problem solving and spotting broken code came easy to me.
I feel that given how much the tech sector has grown in the last decade maybe there is hope for me yet, maybe somewhere out there is a way back in. 
I've taken a new position working 30 hours a week at a small place near my apartment, $11/hr prepping in the am and left my other position... 
I'm trying to explore all options and now that I have a lot more time on my hands maybe get an unpaid internship 
cleaning keyboards and looking over shoulders in an effort to learn something. 
Any advice from fellow new yorkers is much appreciated. 

TLDR: Chef looking for career change in NYC will work for min wage "
2ny0wh,30,2014-12-01,It's not worth it - why I as a Harvard grad working in NYC finance am taking a pay cut to move back to China,[deleted],AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/2ny0wh/its_not_worth_it_why_i_as_a_harvard_grad_working/,"Here's my story. Let me preface by saying that I realize I already have it better than most from an economic standpoint, so I don't want to come off as ungrateful. I'm in my mid-20s and could probably make at least $200K/year for the rest of my career if I chose to stay in NYC and maybe even $500K+ if I get lucky and work hard enough over the next 10 years to get promoted. But here's the problem - money can't buy happiness and being a successful Chinese American man in NYC is crushingly lonely, which is why I'm choosing to leave my high-paying career for a much lower paying job in Beijing.

Never mind that I somehow made it through Harvard's obvious racial quotas - maybe it was the fact that I had good grades as well as perfect SAT and SAT IIs and a long list of perfect APs, or maybe it was my acceptance into the Research Science Institute program as a high school junior which feeds many high school students into Harvard &amp; MIT every year. Whatever it was, when I got in it certainly made my family happy, who came here dirt poor civil engineering grad students in '92-'94 on H1B and F1 visas when I was 4.

But enough about my family - they did their part in trying to not only make a living for themselves but also giving me a decent upbringing. I do still give them flak for letting me eat so much ramen and other unhealthy food growing up which I still believe prevented my height and dick size from reaching my full genetic potential - I'm 5'9'' with a 5'' dick - but then who understood healthy eating in the 90s? The revised Harvard School of Public Health food pyramid only came out in '03.

Anyway, we could never afford the best private schools in the northeast like Exeter, Andover, Horace Mann, or even the local Lawrenceville School, so public school it was. The public high school I went to had a very sizable East and South Asian student population, and looking back pretty much everyone self-segregated by ethnicity. True to image we Asians were all somewhat nerdy math and science types, and I myself competed in quite a few classical piano performance competitions even acquiring a DipABRSM from the Royal Schools of Music (perhaps now the cynic in me wants to say - what an honor to pay to be recognized in the classical Western arts - and then get derided by my contemporary Western peers for playing into the stereotype!)

When it came to the girls in high school I was kind of cute and had some decent interest from women from various ethnicities (especially non-Asian) but a combination of my focusing on schoolwork and other social pressures from white men and East Asian women made sure nothing ever happened. I distinctly remember a pretty blonde girl who liked me but kept getting negative cues from her peers – for example one conversation I overheard between her and an Italian boy:

""I think he's cute."" ""But he's Asian!"" ""Just because he's Asian it doesn't mean he's a person?"" ""&lt;silence&gt; So why don't you ask him out then?"" ""&lt;silence&gt;""

Or another instance I was running for student council and she announced that she would be voting for me at the booth, when a Chinese girl in my grade looked at her, laughed, and gave her an eye roll as if to say - ""How can you find him attractive?""

Or yet another instance when a girl mentioned on the school bus that she thought I was cute only to have her Korean friend interject that she didn't think ""I was that cute"". Or my Chinese piano teacher's daughter who told me when she was 6 and I was 8 that she liked white boys more than Asian. And so on with many other examples, but never the other way around.

But while it bothered me that many of the white boys thought of me as an inferior class, I guess I could never get over being so distinctly unattractive to all the East Asian girls around me to the point where they were almost embarrassed about associating with Asian boys. If any Asian girls were the exception, they would have tended to be more on the homely and traditional side - anyone ""hot"" or more sexually open gravitated straight towards white.

Admittedly, I also personally had and still have a white bias when it comes to sexual attraction - perhaps also partially due to white pornography consumption - so I'm well aware the problem runs both ways. I also recognize that because WMAF is possible while AMWF is typically not due to social pressures, the AFs get a lot of extra flak.

Ultimately, on this front I believe that introspection is important for both AA males and females. Part of the reason behind this divisive phenomenon in the AA community is that we grow up instilled with the value of education, but we overlook the toxic elements of what a Western education brings to us. When everything is centered around Western values, we grow up believing that Western art, music, science, history, and even religion, considering the number of East Asian Christians out there, is the absolute truth. Living in the shadow of the British defeating China during the Opium Wars and colonizing HK/Singapore, how do we avoid the inferiority complex inherited over the past six generations? Outmarriage among Korean and Japanese women is even more extreme - no doubt in part because their governments have directly aligned with the U.S. and have Western military bases on their land. So much for pan-Asian unity.

Other minority communities have navigated the issues to various degrees of success. Where I grew up, the Hispanic and African American communities to a greater degree rejected the bullshit they were fed in school, but at some cost to their future economic mobility due to their relative lack of emphasis on education. It’s obviously still possible though to achieve both economic mobility through education without developing an inferiority complex as a minority, with Exhibit A being the NYC Jewish community united by their own unique religious culture. This also brings me to my Harvard experience.

They say that the best and brightest who grow up in the East Coast go to HYP, while those who grow up in the West Coast go to the UCs and Stanford. This is typically true. I can't speak much about the West Coast experience, but in the East Coast ivies, the largest ethnic subpopulations are Jewish and East/South Asian, who respectively tend to originate from wealthy communities and private high schools in Manhattan/Brooklyn/Long Island/Westchester/MA/CT (think Gossip Girl) vs. poorer immigrant Asian communities west and south of Manhattan along the Northeast Corridor where I come from. Together, Jews and Asians represent about 50% of Harvard, with the rest being a large mix of other typically less wealthy whites, other minorities, and a good mix of internationals of various economic strata as well.

Was there continued self-segregation at Harvard? You bet. For all the efforts that Harvard puts into creating a racially and economically diverse student body (and for which it's now getting sued), it does a pretty bad job of actually getting its diverse student body to interact with each other. Practically everyone ate their meals on campus in each of the twelve residential houses or the freshman Annenberg Hall, and of course, everyone sat with their respective social groups Mean Girls style. By this time in my life I had also developed a good deal of self-loathing after tiring of playing into the Asian stereotype, and I resolved to make connections with other groups to broaden my perspective.

And so I did, to an extent. I had a much more diverse group of acquaintances than I did in high school, with people of all skin colors and backgrounds, but I noticed I still struggled the most trying to connect with white people, but perhaps even more so with rich people. When you put the two together, white men and to a lesser extent the women who came from wealthy families would refuse contact with anyone else and seemed to only want to interact amongst themselves. These are the same white men who form the large majority of the infamous final club social scene at Harvard. The final clubs are effectively well-connected fratty old boys' and athletes' networks which despite their indisputable arrogance and elitism draw women of all backgrounds to them like bees to honey. And with the women, it was the same issue in high school all over again - the only women who rejected the culture tended to be unattractive by Western standards.

Depressing, indeed, to the extent that I came out of freshman year with a traumatizing 2.5 GPA after wasting the year playing video games. Sophomore year went better but I still wasted most of my time trying to get social acceptance climbing the ladder in a student group which I failed miserably at. Luckily, by junior year I came to the realization that even though I had come to hate my intellectual side due to the stereotypes, the only way I was going to get gainful employment was to get better grades, and I ended up graduating with a stats masters in addition to my useless economics BA degree cum laude. Throughout this entire time, I also tried to improve my image by working out in the gym, eating healthy, and buying fashionable clothes, but I mostly just alienated myself from the nerdy Asians at Harvard who were content socializing amongst themselves. Otherwise, the reaction to my efforts to manage my appearance were mostly neutral, and I didn't gain any more acceptance from the fratty crowd. I was kind of just out there, on my own, with a lot of acquaintances, but few real friends.

When it came to junior year summer internships, I got lucky insofar as my uncle's neighbor happened to work at a small fixed income fund in NJ and generously allowed me to shadow their operation for the summer, because I sure as hell wasn't getting a paid internship with my grades at the time. But with that experience under my belt and my 4.0 senior year, I ended up landing at a large investment bank in NYC as a quant &amp; trading analyst.

Funnily enough, this was also one of the most racist experiences I had in my entire life, and to this day I wonder if I should be going after them for employment discrimination. Not that quants are poorly paid, but on any bank's trading floor in NYC, the traders and salespeople are traditionally the revenue-generating employees who get paid the most, and are also overwhelmingly white. The college grads accepted into the quant program were overwhelmingly East and South Asian, while those accepted into the trading program were overwhelmingly white. This had zero correlation to college pedigree, grades, or major. Obviously, with the increased prevalence of electronic trading, the effectiveness of the old boys' network on Wall Street has diminished since 5 years ago, but no doubt it's still there. The most ridiculous outcome of my two-year analyst rotation was that despite getting top performance reviews one year in trading and next-to-top performance reviews the next year in quant, senior management still refused to hire me and other Asians back as trading associates, even with the strong support of trading managers. The one or two white colleagues I had in the quant program easily got promoted.

And so I quit the bank for a job in Chicago to do high-frequency trading, which incidentally turned out to be another fiasco when the portfolio manager I worked for with a previously strong track record failed to get any of his strategies to work before I joined. With a lot of my input on the machine learning and AI side, we finally made some money by the end of the year, but since he didn't hit the P&amp;L target the firm wanted he got fired. So back to NYC I came, this time at a different investment bank as a trader managing electronic flow again. Very high compensation and lots of good people, but this time I had a direct manager I had a poor relationship with. I don't think race was as big of a part as it was more internal politics, but I was still discouraged from taking risk and put on a much tighter leash than my colleagues. It was also clear my manager saw me more as a quant than as a trader. At the end I made a mistake where I went over my small risk limit due to client flow even after a year of profitable trading and I got fired for a small loss, even though my colleagues right next to me were given much more leeway with the same work experience and when they had much larger losses they just got a slap on the wrist. It was absolutely my fault that I lost this job – but the moral here is also if you're an AA, make extra sure you don't screw up and don't expect the same tolerance for error your colleagues get.

Fast forward to now after working odd jobs for about a year, I'm faced with another choice between joining yet another bank as a quant (now that I'm shut out of a trading career with the job termination I got), or alternatively go back to China and take at least a 50% pay cut over the life of my career. I should also mention incidentally that during this time I've busted my balls trying to find a girlfriend through online dating with nothing to show for it. It doesn't matter what I do, because I have a ripped six pack, a very high income, and tons of athletic and cultural interests but I've come to the realization that because I'm Asian and of average height it's never going to happen. I have not managed to get a date with a single hot and reasonably intelligent girl over a year especially since most women I have anything in common with here are Jews who will never date a gentile regardless of other factors. I've also noticed the Asian girls in NYC either don't take care of their appearance or go after white guys - basically high school and college all over again. The popularity contest and self-hate never ends and I'm powerless to stop it because I even have it myself. Anyone who thinks that money, intelligence, and muscles are the panacea to AA male problems, let me assure you firsthand that they are not.

So what's the solution - I think I'll leave the high-power jobs in NYC to the Jews and other whites or maybe the Asians who are happy to play second fiddle, and meanwhile I'll move back to my home country. I'll gladly take a cut in my salary and standard of living to take a chance on reprogramming my damaged psychology, meet some normal Asians who grew up in Asia, and still build a satisfying career without giving up all hope for finding at least one satisfying romantic relationship before I die. I am absolutely exhausted by all the race issues in the U.S. and until Asians can find the same solidarity the Jews can (which is hard since most Asians are secular), it's just totally pointless. Especially with the strict Asian immigration quotas, even if we get an impossible pan-Asian unity the AA community will take at least three generations to reach a steady state of influence like what the Jews have right now. Until then, hasta la vista. I’m smart enough to make a living anywhere, I’m completely fluent in Mandarin, and China has developed, so why stay here?"

2nyhux,0,2014-12-01,This year has been interesting.,mandies,Showerthoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2nyhux/this_year_has_been_interesting/,"This year has been interesting. For those of you who know me real good, you’ll know that I use the word interesting when I have nothing great to say. You’ll also know I said “real good” with some sort of accent because that’s just how I do.  I’m not a fan of emphasizing that things have not been the greatest, because I think that at any given moment you probably have more reasons to be thankful for than to be upset at.  That’s what I want to focus on; what I am crazy thankful for. But first I’m going to tell you why this year has been “interesting.”  I feel like this will affirm the fact that I really don’t have much to complain about. Now then, let’s reflect on this year (2014) shall we:

January: After graduating in November (2013) I was fortunately working at a place with an incredible team. It was a bank. I hated it. But man the people who worked there were amazing. I realized you can put fun into anything if you truly want to. I hated it and yet I had fun, what an oxymoron! But in January I decided I had to leave; for the sake of the bank and for the sake of my sanity. I explored further education options and found out my school offered a credit to recent graduates in any continuing education course (how awesome is that!) I am pretty sure at that moment I was setting myself up for a new path. Why? Well, I looked at all the courses and I had 1 of 3 options:  take a course to beef up my skills for my resume, take one that further educated me on the subject of my bachelor’s degree (psychology) OR option number 3, use it to do something I had never done before and explore my creativity.  Option 3 it was and I enrolled in a screenwriting course (FYI I’m obsessed with all kinds of film; the bad and the good!)  It’s not that I thought I could actually start writing films since I loved them so much, I just wanted to see if I could BE creative. Whatever that meant, I felt I needed it. 

March: I was career searching all while doing this course, and when my Alma mater had a Start Up Job Fair, I set up with a friend to go. Now if ever you go to a Job fair do me a favor and be prepared: bring a resume or AT least a business card or something to that effect. Anyway, I checked out the pamphlet on who was there and what positions they were searching for and my friend and I went around picking up goodies from every Start Up booth we visited (some of these ideas were brilliant!) We were about to leave but I had noticed a company on the pamphlet and when we were finished all the booths, I wondered why we didn’t see them. This company was similar to Groupon: it was group buying that gave incredible discounts to everyday things. They were looking for a Copy Intern as well as a Social Media/Marketing intern. I wanted the copy one. I found them, pitched myself (I was now somewhat confident in my creative capabilities), and well she liked me!  But not for the copy position, for the Social media position. I got the job and within 2 months I was the Social Media Marketing Coordinator working on advertising and marketing campaigns. It was amazing. I never could have imagined that things would have progressed so quickly and so incredibly. Again, how fortunate was this opportunity. The company was made up of some incredible individuals who owned what they did and it was the best office culture I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.



September:  Things were just getting started. I moved out for the first time to Downtown Toronto in order to make my commute to work easier. I was excited when people asked me what I did, and I was on my way to planning a home purchase with my boyfriend. I was on a high and the only reason I knew how high I was, was because I know what it felt like to feel low (bank days). The company had gone into some restructuring litigations. They were being bought by a US company and a huge amount of employees were laid off. I had made the cut, and I had been assured several times that I was moving forward with the new company. Every day I would meet with the Marketing Director to discuss our revenue from our online Ads. On Sept 12 we had our meeting and I was told that more layoffs were happening today and I was one of them.  Even though so many layoffs were occurring, I was still completely shocked. I was very surprised by my reaction though, it was the first time I had ever left a job not by choice.  I thanked my boss for the incredible opportunity she had given me, that I had grown and learned so much from the company and that I would always be grateful for that (she was the one at the Expo that hired me). And it wasn’t a fake reaction. This individual and this company had taken a chance on me and groomed me for a position that I ended up loving. Do you know what it feels like to be happy to wake up for work? Well I did, and even if it was short, it taught me so much. Guess what, I now know that it’s possible to love what you do. At the ripe age of 23 I was fortunate enough to learn that. 
October:  I didn’t have much time to sulk for my loss, because the weekend I lost my job, my sister was eating lunch with a friend and her work needed someone to do admin work for 1 week.  What! My thoughts were: 1. this is awesome 2. Rent moneyyyyy! Fast forward 3 months and I’m still here and working on their social media campaigns part-time. I’m learning HTML and photoshop to up some skills in the meantime and applying to jobs in the hopes of starting over again. 

So like I said, you can see this year for me was confusing as hell, but it was filled with delightful and surprising blessings.  I don’t know what’s going to happen next, and that scares me. But I know that I need to stay positive and reflect on how moments that seemed unfortunate, where actually filled with fortune.  From the day I set to “be more creative” I kind of changed my path. I was in research and psychology before and now look at me! Life is weird, and it’s only going to get weirder. I just hope I can keep this smile, spend time with my amazing /crazy family and just enjoy this ride.

So before my question, a bit of a backstory... 

I'll be moving to the Portland area (Vancouver, WA) next summer to work for an investment firm that I've done two summer internships with already. 

I'm a student at the University of Florida and have lived in Florida my entire life. I've also only ever seen snow twice, both times on Mt. Hood during the two summers I was out there. That being said, I have zero experience driving in snow and/or ice.

My plan is to buy a car in Florida and drive it out to Vancouver a week or two before I start my new job. I want to be able to do a lot of hiking/camping in the area, even in the winter. I'm wanting to price things out early so I have a general idea of what I'm getting into financially and have one key question...

Is 4-wheel drive or all-wheel drive a feature that I should be viewing as a necessity, or will a front wheel drive car with tire chains be sufficient?"

2nz9f2,95,2014-12-01,Tigge's Q&amp;A videos (News),speakingmoose123,battlefield_4,https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/2nz9f2/tigges_qa_videos_news/,"Hi battlefield friends,

maybe you know the ESL final was two weeks ago and David Sirland aka Tigge had a question and answer round afterwards.
I decided to post the Q&amp;A videos and a TL;DW summary with the most interesting (at least for me) news. I took all the videos from the German youtuber ""Jim Panse""; don't worry, it's in English.



[1st video. Several general questions: future content, Bf's release and EA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU6b70Xhveo)

* more stuff is coming to Bf4 (more news at the end of battlefest), no details yet
* now they follow the guideline ""players first"" more than before
* the release of Bf4 was a wake-up call to EA: being more openly to people; acknowledging bugs, telling they're fixing this and that etc. --&gt; he refers to the Final Stand release


[2nd Video. CTE, healing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWWyjDxK4oU)

* CTE is coming to consoles: they're ready, Sony/Microsoft aren't.
* they'll tweak the med bags/packs
* they try to ""inform"" the enemy player that the enemy's healing (no solution yet)
* they'll look at suppression


[3rd video. Netcode, weapon damage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh5RlcciZXo)

* they'll try to fix ""damage collection"" caused by players with bad connection
* Bf3 seems to have a better netcode than Bf4 because it's faster and ttk is lower: they want us to know what's happening when someone is shooting (f.i. adding tracers)
* **They played a lot of Bf3 recently because of reasons he can't talk about**
* they'll do further damage tweaking: more skill should be involved in giving damage


[4th video. Fast gameplay, anti-cheating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LlCUXYgx4c). Cheating is bad mmkay?

* Bf is not about fast gameplay and k/d but team play
* They flag/ban a cheater's computer to find it (maybe) again: 3 factors are involved in banning: Fairfight, Punkbuster and a DICE anti-cheating team


[5th video. Creating DLC, internship at DICE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-C6sLKyk-A)

* They started making Final Stand in February/March this year


[6th video. Phantom Program, anti-camping measures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiaT1FzOe-o)

* There is no Phantom Program
* No release date about the ""frequency cone"" yet
* They try to ""encourage"" camping snipers playing more the objective by giving them bonus killing guys within a radius of a flag etc. (just ideas)


[7th video. Point system, competitive matchmaking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=208EH4cKdW0)

* idea about the point system: every team play points are getting in a bucket and if your team wins you'll receive two times your ""bucket points"" only if you stick to your team until the end of the round
* TEAM PLAY!
* end goal of competitive matchmaking: add a matchmaker for guys on their on or with their friends and ""a game mode that feels like battlefield"" (maybe vehicles, maybe not)
* it'll have leaderboards, ladder, seasons and placement matches"
2nzekh,5,2014-12-01,seeking career advice from practicing dietitians,[deleted],dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/2nzekh/seeking_career_advice_from_practicing_dietitians/,"Hi!

I'm currently studying computer science at university.  My initial choice before transferring to university was dietetics.  I spoke to a few before I made a decison and I met more people who were unahppy than people who were happy.  

Some of the common complaints I heard were:

* lack of respect from doctors and nurses alike.
* very low pay
* extremely difficult to find the mandatory internship
* hard to find a job

The thing that turned me off the most was hearing that if I was not accepted into a program at school where the internship is included, I would have to pay for an internship.  The idea of paying to work one year and not get paid for it didn't seem appealing.

I'm finishing my first semester as a computer science student, and I have to be honest, I didn't enjoy it that much.  Some moments were extremely stressful and I didn't like how a lot of it wasn't completely straightforward.  I also picked it due to more jobs being available and better pay.  With that said, I am considering going back to my original plan.  

**Can anyone here, who IS a dietitian, give a valid argument as to why I should or shouldn't do it?  Can you also clarify some of the things i've heard from other dietitians?**

Thank you."
2nzio0,1,2014-12-01,For the first time in seven years..,iamsolostpleasehelp,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2nzio0/for_the_first_time_in_seven_years/,"..I'm ready to admit that I can't beat depression alone, and need help. This story might out me to friends and family, but it's time to tell the truth about how I feel. I am 26 year old named ""John"" , and this is a very short version of my story.

A boy named John was born. John was plump for a child, and rarely caused a fuss for his parents. His older brother, Jim, was the trouble maker. Jim and John were inseparable when they were kids. John looked up to Jim, and Jim took care of John. They both loved to play video games, specifically computer games. Our parents thought this was weird as their generation grew up playing outside. We did our fair share of playing football, basketball, and similar sports in the neighborhood; however, I was usually the smallest person playing including younger children. This puts us at 6th grade.

Eventually, our parents didn't force us to go outside anymore. We stayed inside on the computer playing video games; at least that's what our parents thought, and it's true to an extent. We fell into a different world than most, we were hackers. Whatever game we played, we would clone and modify the largest ""hacking"" websites for the game. These ""hacks"" were typically a way to reveal the map, or give an advantage to the player using them. To make a long story short, we stole thousands of accounts for different games. Friends needed a new key for a game? No problem, we had tons of them.

Now stealing gaming accounts isn't that bad in my eyes, but invading friends' privacy is a problem. I remember hacking everyone that I knew, it became my own game. This went from having conversations with them via their printer, and some cases I even ""helped"" them thwart this hacker. Talk about devious behavior. This isn't the only thing we did back then; we social engineered computer parts from best buy regularly. There's way more to this part of the story, and I'll probably come back to it to reveal an event that I believe changed my life.

My brother and I had hit our goal, we were unimaginably rich in every game we played. This is the point where my brother stopped playing video games as much as I did. One night I woke up to my parents house phone ringing. It was around 3:00 AM on a school night, and I was in eighth grade; my brother was a freshman in high school. I picked up the phone and heard my brother says hello. I proceed to hear in a synthesized robot sounding voice, ""Don't make us remind you. We know who you are. We know who your parents are. Here's your proof."" The person knew everything about us, and it scared me. I talked to my brother, and he told me not to worry; our friends were taking care of it.

We haven't talked about this event much in our lives, and for good reason too; these people were perceptively dangerous. My brother and I went very different directions in life after this happened. This is also when I felt we really started to drift apart, I didn't feel like we had that everlasting brotherly connection anymore. He turned to drugs and alcohol way sooner than me, always way more social than me, and naturally a ""cool"" kid. 

However, that didn't stop me from being one. We had quit hacking around this time as life became more exciting. My sophomore and junior year I really started to spiral with drug use, namely pills and marijuana. Anyway, I remember taking a bunch of Zoloft (why I was trying to get fucked up on Zoloft is beyond me, I remember a girl we'll call Lauren taking them the day before saying it was fun, etc.). Reacted very negatively to the Zoloft and had a couple days of vomiting. Met up with my buddy we'll call Tim before school and smoked a bowl before school. I remember getting out of his truck and my vision being blurry. I took one step forward and my vision cut out, but I was still awake; this was very scary. I remember grabbing the back of his backpack and falling to the ground. He put me in his truck and took me home; I slowly woke up in his truck. Went to the doctor and found out I passed out due to dehydration.

This prompted me to stop hacking out with Tim and all the cool kids. I started hanging out with a new group of friends, you could call them geeks or nerds. We all liked computers and playing video games. Yeah, we were those weird world of warcraft kids. I always stood up for my friends in high school, and never let the ""cool"" kids pick on them. They all knew I was a hacker, and I didn't take shit from people. This was mostly a fear tactic, being devious paid off. However, being devious didn't always pay off. I've never told anyone this, but I actually took the ACT high. I got a 19 overall, and only took half the test. I honestly got bored in the middle of it and started filling in patterns instead. Naturally, my parents and brother encouraged me to retake the test. I ended up social engineering my way out of the test, and never retook it. My high school guidance counselor told me I was looking at a tech school or community college; years later, I found my high school transcript and noticed I had a 3.8 GPA. I definitely could have gone to a university, but this did not hinder my success.

I ended up going to a technical school for information technology, and learned about penetration testing; penetration testing is essentially ethical hacking, companies pay professionals to hack them and report the weak points. I decided this would be an excellent career path given my history. This marks around the happiest point of my life as I finally had a long term goal to achieve, and then I met her. For the story's purpose, her name was Kim; and she's still the only person I've ever truly loved to date. To make a long story short, I was living the dream. I was 19 years old with a beautiful girlfriend, an internship making $15/hour, and on my way to becoming a professional gamer as well. I also had a great group of friends, the only issue was time.

Anyway, I was in my last semester at the technical school. Everything was going great when all the sudden, my body shut down. To date, I'm still not even sure what happened. My doctors say it's from taking stress out on my body. After bring poked and prodded for a few months, I was admitted to the hospital. Turns out I developed a hemorrhoid, which I still have and affects me today. What I failed to mention is my mental state completely shifted, and I had lost sight of what was important in my life. This brings us to a week where I lost everything I cared about. I dropped out of the technical school, got fired from my internship due a lack of communication of my illness, and Kim broke up with me to top it all off. Ultimately, she was young and selfish; she ended up dating another guy she was talking about a lot near the end of our relationship. Oh yeah, and now they're married.

Okay, so I'm now a complete mess at age 19. I had everything going for me, and now I only had one thing; my professional gaming career. I'm not going to say what game, but it's extremely popular. I was on the forefront of that scene, and am still mentioned in articles today. Yay, I made it as a pro gamer. Decided to transfer to a university where two of my closest friends were going. I stayed in an apartment with them over the summer. Within a few weeks, I quit professional gaming and gave up my free trips to Sweden and France. Around the same time, I started smoking marijuana again. Drug use spiraled out of control -- name the drug and I've taken it with the exception of crack, meth, and heroin. Started selling marijuana to support my drug habits. Ended up dropping out of this university, and was arrested once for a drug related charge. I ended up moving back home to get back on track, plus my parents were pissed and basically forced me into doing it.

I ended up finishing my degree at the technical school and started working. Ultimately, I decided to go back to school. I never got the university experience, and I wanted it. I transferred to a state school where I was studying information security. I was 21 and living in the dorms, it was hell. I hated most of the kids in the dorms, and had trouble meeting friends in class. I spent most of my time getting high with a friend from my home town that happened to transfer there at the same time. I ended up working on a project that gave me my first big claim to fame. This landed me an internship at a major company, I was their first information security intern. Things were going well, I started an information security club. I participated in various national competitions, and even won one of them beating out students from MIT. This landed me an internship at a big information security consulting firm; my dream was finally coming true. I was becoming well known in the security community, and earning respect; my street cred was certainly growing. 

Now, while all of these great things were happening; I was secretly depressed and extremely lonely. I had so many students, and even professors that looked up to me; yet, I was doing terrible. I don't know exactly how this next part started, but I ended up on craigslist casual encounters. Let me start off by saying that people on this website prey on the weak minded. At this point in time, I was definitely weak minded even though I was doing so well according to society's standards. It started off by being bored and lonely one night, and receiving a blow job from a man in a dark room. I actually went back to this guy many times over the years, he served his purpose in my life. Anyway, it certainly didn't end there. I got more curious, and wanted to fully explore my homosexual tendencies. I've never told ANYONE the truth until now. It was a late Saturday night, and I found a gentleman in his 30's to help explore my curiosity. I went over to his place around 3 AM, and he greeted me at the door. Seemed like business as usual, he leads me up to his bedroom. I don't want to relive the entire experience with the details, but to make a long story short; I was practically raped. He overpowered me, and I wasn't going to leave the room; tried to squirm away, but that didn't work. At least he didn't aim to make it painful. My own fault for posting to be ""submissive"". Live and learn, I guess; thanks for HPV asshole.

Regardless of this, I kept going on craigslist casual encounters. I don't know why, and I still go on there today; been a long time since I've met up with anyone (Grindr is a different, yet, similar story). It's practically an addiction for lonely people; the false hope of potentially finding someone to spiral out of loneliness. Anyway, that brings us closer to today. I ended up dropping out of university in my last semester due to depression.As of this writing, I am still 2-3 classes away from finishing my bachelor's degree. Shortly after dropping out, I was offered a job making close to 200k/year doing penetration testing. That's what I'm doing now. I'm six months into this position, and still incredibly unhappy. I thought most of my problems came due to stress from school, but that's just what I kept telling myself to feel better. Fact is I've been depressed for over 7 years, basically since the moment Kim broke up with me. Most days I don't want to get out of bed, and only do so to keep my job. I generally slack at work even though I'm the most skilled person on my team. My boss is completely incompetent as is the team lead; fucking government contractors. The people they recruit are even worse. 

I've secluded into my isolated behavior again. I have a bunch of friends in the area, but I've slowly pushed myself away from all of them. They only hit me when they need my technical expertise. Most nights I sit at home drinking beer and smoking marijuana. I'm starting to show signs of engaging in illegal activity again, which isn't good. What's even worse, I'm only doing that to keep suicidal thoughts out of my mind. I'd never actually hurt myself physically, and never have; I suppose that's what other people are for. I always thought money was a problem, but I found out I really don't give a shit about money now that I make a lot of it. I don't live my life any different. I'm still completely lost, hopeless, and feel like I have no purpose in life. I've generally been coasting at work because working hard doesn't get me anything but more work I'm not interested in doing. I don't know if turning my hobby into a profession was a mistake, or if it's simply another deep state of depression. I'm learning towards the latter, as I don't really enjoy doing anything. The only thing that helps me calm down and not think about all of this is marijuana. I self medicate with it heavily. 

I haven't enjoyed life for around seven years. How the hell do I turn things around and start enjoying life again?"

2nzvtw,29,2014-12-01,One thing that has greatly improved under Wolff --- the medical staff,scorejockey,OaklandAthletics,https://www.reddit.com/r/OaklandAthletics/comments/2nzvtw/one_thing_that_has_greatly_improved_under_wolff/,"Oh man, after discussing with u/frakking-anustart about the old A's message boards, I decided to have a look back.  Holy shit, the medical staff around 1998-2006 was a mess.  Some examples...

1.  Mark Mulder had a **FRACTURED FEMUR** that not one doctor on the A's staff detected.  They thought he had a hip strain and kept putting him into a whirlpool for 2 weeks, say he was ready to pitch, then after a few innings he would be back on the DL and straight back to the whirlpool.  Rumors of him being soft were abound, until he took it upon himself to see another doctor, who declared ""Why Mark, you have a broken leg!"".  If they had caught it in time he literally would have been able to play in the ALDS that year, which we lost.  He was set up to play in the ALCS if we made it that far.  Dude played a few times in a 6 week period on a broken leg.

2.  The oblique strains were endless on those team.  Hudson alone missed like 3-6 weeks each year cause of an oblique strain.  I don't think he has had one since leaving the A's.  But it wasn't just pitchers.  Hernandez, Chavez, and a few others all missed time with oblique strains.  It was like a sure thing, if you played for the A's you were going to get an oblique strain.  The worst part was it was a mystery that still has not been solved, why did so many players in such a short time have so many oblique strains, while not one other team in the league had this problem.  Now I am thinking about it, I am starting to get obsessed again, does anyone have any kind of medical knowledge that could explain why one team had so many of the same injuries while no one else did?

3.  One of the best of all, Bobby Crosby **BROKE HIS BACK!** somehow in a game and the staff tried saying it was just a muscle strain in his ribs.  Seriously.  A broken freakin back.  He played for a few weeks with it.  The scary part is, he again went to another doctor after the season who figured out about 5 seconds after he got the X-Rays he had a broken back.  The DR told him he came very close to never being able to play again because he kept diving around and swinging with a broken back.  Holy Shit!

4.  One of the clauses in Frank Thomas' contract was he did not have to use the A's medical staff at all, and paid for his own doctors on hand.  This is probably the reason he was able to play almost 140 games that year.  Jason Kendall refused to see any A's doctors at all, and he played 150 and 143 (though he was a tough sonofabitch and probably could have cut off a foot and still demand to catch.  I miss that guy).

5.  The Rich Harden saga.  Man, I don't think I saw anyone as hurt as him.  I am thinking now the medical staff screwed him up so bad that he just became injury prone the rest of his career.  There is no possible way a pitcher could be hurt so often without a misdiagnosis somewhere, and given the history of the staff at the time, it really is the only viable reason.

6.  Eric Chavez had more injuries figured out by real DR's at the end of the season that I could not list them all.  Dude got banged up playing here, seriously banged up.  He had a long career, but after 7 years of playing for the A's, when he turned 28 something went very wrong.  He was never healthy after he got hurt in 2006, and while nothing was said publicly I now believe it was again some misdiagnosis that kept him on the field because it was ""just a muscle strain"".

I know there are some more, I am looking through to find some more shockers.  Though, between Mulder pitching on an undiagnosed broken leg, and Crosby playing with a broken back, I don't know if they can be topped.  I forgot all this stuff, but looking back I am sitting here in shock at all of this.  Man, Schott and Hoffman were some cheap ass bastards to get a medical staff that was so bad, I am wondering if they were all interns still in medical school.

There was also bitching about the training staff (remember that dude with the tie dyed shirt who was the head trainer), but man, at least Wolff has hired credible doctors and trainers.  

EDIT: I mispoke when I said Crosby played for a few weeks, it was 6 games.  Still, 6 games with a broken back.  Here is a link where he was bitching to Slusser about it.  http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Crosby-upset-with-A-s-doctors-Team-misdiagnosed-2484503.php"
2o08k2,3,2014-12-01,I have come to a conclusion. I guess there isn't much more preparing that I can possibly do. I just have to jump in? (possible trigger warning for mentioning suicide and self injury),mightbeaperson,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2o08k2/i_have_come_to_a_conclusion_i_guess_there_isnt/,"It is more valuable to me the possibility that I might be a real person who is deserving of being treated with love and respect than the comfort of fluffy towels and material goods that my parents have coupled with their coldness and refusal to treat me well.

I told myself that I would leave on my 18th birthday. I told myself this for years. I didn't, and I've nearly killed myself several times due to how my parents have made me feel. I feel so trapped by them.
They are paying for my college, and as luck I am for having them do that for me, I hate the social obligations which it comes with.

I don't have enough information to know how they'll react should I stop seeing them. I'm not sure if it's even a possibility in their eyes. I haven't fought with them since I came to college, and I am a sophomore. I know that when they had control over me, they'd certainly overuse it. They'd break me until I was literally grovelling in front of them, and then they'd keep going, just to make sure I knew who's boss. I blocked out the memories of it for a while, but I'm starting to remember, and it disgusts me while at the same time it explains so much. I truly hate these people and I wish to never see them again in my lifetime. Now I've got this possibility that something in my normal life will trigger another flashback. I've already had one in class. It's really shitty.

This isn't entirely doable for winter break, as I have to get my wisdom teeth pulled and I'll have to stay with them over the actual holidays because I don't want to impose on anyone. Other than that, I'm currently working to figure out how to have a place to stay for as much of the break as possible.

After this winter break, I know that I need to set up a dentist apt for spring break or maybe just switch to a place near my college and stop worrying. I'm trying to find a doctor here that will take me, because I've got some health problems I want to look into. (Unfortunately, I'm still on my parents insurance, but what can I do? I'm 19 and I work 5 hours a week. I don't exactly have enough money to do it myself just yet.)

So now I am trying to figure out the logistics of leaving them. I'm paid through spring semester, but I have no clue if I can get them to pay past that if I am no longer in close contact with them. At least in my view, I've been ""paying"" for college by supporting them emotionally when I'm there, and I'm done with that bullshit. Even when it's noneventful, it still hurts me to do it. I've relapsed after a year of not self injuring. I'm done with being my parents' emotional plaything.

I guess my question is: how do I do it? I have no license and no car. I live in the dorms and my college is in a very remote area. I was so lucky to get an internship halfway across the country last summer, but it's where I got injured pretty badly so I don't think I can repeat that job again. My goal is to be out and not have to deal with them besides for payment of tuition (if that is going to continue happening, otherwise I'll see if I can get declared independent of them.) and I can probably do that through email.

I feel a very strong need to be away from them for good, for my own safety and mental/emotional health. I just can't take it anymore.

I don't know what I'm doing, though. I don't know the repercussions. It's really scary and I worry that I'll go out, fail, and have to come back to them. I wouldn't survive that for sure. I keep on hearing that suicide can make you re prioritize and make you more willing to do difficult things because they are still better than dying. I understand that, but I want to make sure that what I do, whatever I do is successful so that I don't get stuck with my abusive nparents again. How??"
2o0bud,10,2014-12-01,Christmas alone?,starselle,LifeAfterNarcissism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/2o0bud/christmas_alone/,"Hey you all,  
  
Okay, I went NC with my mom in September. And then after a while of interacting with some siblings and aunts who would guilt trip me and then would constantly say that I am the one doing something wrong and that I'm terrible for taking an internship that my mom disapproved of, I've decided to just stay LC or NC with those extensive family members. If they do call, I try to keep my whereabouts secret and I'm thinking of unfriending them from facebook.   
  
Anyway, I had an amazing thanksgiving with a friend of mine who came to my new city. We cooked, we went to a bar, we had a blast. I felt awesome and was so glad she was here. Because everyone kept on asking if I was going home for Thanksgiving and it was just annoying to keep on deflecting, lying, and addressing the question.  
  
Anyway, CHRISTMAS IS MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY. I loooooove Christmas. It really signifies everything that I love. The spirit. The peace. The joy. The harmony. The music. The cheer. Christmas is the ish...! But, since I've decided to go NC, I won't be spending it at ""home""...  or my previous house. 
  
How can I ensure that I will have a good Christmas? I know I will have to lie to my current roommates in terms of booking a bus back home, when in reality, I'm just staying in the apartment. But, it is quite sad from a strangers POV that I will be spending it by myself. What can I do?  
  
I mean, I'm fine just not doing anything. But, who knows, I may be really sad when that time comes because that means my internship is ending and I will be alone."
2o0eqm,11,2014-12-01,"No matter what I do, my value is determined by who I'll end up marrying",lavathe,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/2o0eqm/no_matter_what_i_do_my_value_is_determined_by_who/,"I just came back to college after going home for Thanksgiving. Right before I left for Thanksgiving break, I found out I got a job offer from one of my dream workplaces. It pays a great salary and has so many perks and I was so proud to have gotten it after all the work I've put in over the years. When I came home to surprise my family with the news, the reaction I was met with was asking me if this job would get in the way of getting me married.

It was at this point that I have realized that truly no matter what I do with myself, it will mean nothing to my family in comparison with who I marry. 

I remember making the varsity tennis team in high school, only to have my parents become dismayed that my skin would get darker and no one would want a ""sweaty, ungraceful girl."" I remember the proudest moment in my 18 years of life when I was accepted to Harvard, and my parents were happy not because of my career opportunities and college experience but because I would be able to find a nice husband there. I remember when I got my first dream internship and my parents didn't want me to take it so that I could stay home for the summer and learn cooking and other important bride qualities. I remember when we had an uncle visit who was impressed by my recent academic work, only for my mom to roll her eyes and mutter something about how my recent cooking work needed some help. 

For some reason I always held onto the belief that if I truly did something amazing, they would appreciate me for who I was and my achievements. It only hit me hard today that the uncomfortable truth is that no matter what I do, it will mean nothing to them. To them, I am not defined by who I am but who I marry. They are afraid that by being too ambitious, I won't be able to get married because too much education and too high of a salary is not an attractive trait and limits my marriage pool.

Has anyone else ever been defined in similar ways by their family? Has anyone ever eventually improved their relationship with parents like this?

Now that I have owned up to myself what I tried to deny for years, I have realized that from this point forward the best my relationship with my parents can be is purely a diplomatic one."
2o0f9p,3,2014-12-01,Day 37. No desire to contact ever.,bluespottedtail,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/2o0f9p/day_37_no_desire_to_contact_ever/,"Hi everyone.
So, it's been 37 days since my last ""contact"" with my ex, which was really just a text saying I couldn't handle being friends on facebook. But our breakup was 3 months ago. Up to today and at that point, I thought he was at least a sincere person who felt bad for his own barriers and inability to commit. He seemed to feel genuinely bad. 


I've had some rough times this month, particularly during Thanksgiving, when I had hoped I would have met his family. But overwhelmingly my self esteem and inner voice has improved, and I was starting to really ""let go""- my grief was having its last gasp.


Well...today my friend accidentally slipped out (she's not always so aware of her words) that she saw him on OkCupid two weeks ago, where we had met. This was upsetting because it meant that throughout the entire relationship he had lied to me about his account. As we were dating and it seemed to be exclusive, I mentioned that I deactivated my account. He didn't mirror what I said, he just said ""I forgot my password, so I don't have any way to log onto mine.  One of many red flags, sadly. His response bothered me at the time, as I knew that he could have requested a new password to delete it (and I knew he still went on) but I didn't push further. Two weeks after he ended it with me due to his own emotional/psychological barriers and commitment issues, I saw he went on in my emotional wreck/stupor of checking all of his social media at once (hahaha). That week we talked on the phone and he again said he ""forgot"" his password. Now that he's on the SAME account that he supposedly ""couldn't log into"", I know that was all a total lie...and I think I did the whole time. It was a punch in the stomach to me. I thought he was at least sincere in his claim that he was so fucked up and wasn't going to be dating for a while, that he would get help for his own issues. He played the part so well, and perhaps he did feel that a little. But he was too afraid to really confront those issues and is back again, looking to ""date"" (ie, a casual relationship where he can selfishly do what he wants/have sex with you until he realizes you are more serious than he is). 


He even listed the books I got him for his birthday (that I spent all day looking for) as among his ""favorites""... ouch.

So he took the love, care, and affection I had for him on top of my favorite things(which he definitely didn't even all of read yet). And he didn't give anything back. I had trusted his words of sincerity, and up to today, was content with never getting back together, because I knew he had his own issues to work out. I genuinely was beginning to wish well for him. I thought he was at least a wonderful, sincere and sensitive person.


Now that I know the truth- that he was lying and giving me a deceptive image of who he was for the entirety of his relationship, my entire view of it has changed. I see the relationship now for what it really was. I remember messaging him 2 weeks after (I was angry, but my intuition was correct) that I felt he only cared for me as an intellectual companion and physically, not emotionally. Or, that he wanted me to listen to him emotionally/be there for him, without anything in return. He called me ""explaining himself"" (ie absolving himself of any guilt) and I BELIEVED HIM.

Well, now I do not. This stings right now, but I am so proud of myself, for being the person who was willing to listen, give and be flexible in the relationship (too much, obviously I was a bit blindsided). But, overall, I was never anything but sincere to him. I sincerely gave all of my love, care and deepest vulnerabilities. I do not regret that. I am a really fucking cool girl who is  (in his words, LOL) emotionally intelligent, sweet/caring/thoughtful and intelligent.

The strange thing is that he knew my capacity to love and care, and respected me enough to stop ""using me"" as he had been. But he certainly is not changing his ways. I just hope he doesn't hurt anyone else.

I don't want to see him again mostly because I feel very deceived. But, it's really also that I am so much better without someone who would LIE to me. I don't deserve to be treated like that. And he doesn't deserve to reap the benefits without giving in return. But most importantly, I don't ever want to contact him. Ever. I would never accept his offer to speak as ""friends"" or ""something else"", if that ever came (which it won't). 

I don't know how helpful this is for ya'll. But, I can say that it gets better. I am, despite today's setback and shock, doing great. I am applying for a new job, maybe an internship for next summer, and am thinking about how I can continue to create my own love and community. 


So I'm listening to John Lennon's [Instant Karma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqP3wT5lpa4) and George Harrison's [Isn't it a Pity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn_ZRatLl1o), but I also wanted to offer this wonderful Dharma talk I listened to today, before I found out the true story, called [""Awakening Through Change and Loss""] (http://dharmaseed.org/teacher/175/talk/25594/)"
2o0ffr,15,2014-12-01,"Just relapsed again, 8 years of daily smoking has taken its toll.",redeemed_1,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2o0ffr/just_relapsed_again_8_years_of_daily_smoking_has/,"I just don't know what to put here honestly; I have posted on leaves many times, but always got a lukewarm response, although I still appreciate any encouragement from people.

Basically, I've been addicted for 8 years now, I have quit for a month before. Another quit lasted 3 months, then another 2 months. I have been smoking again since my last quit, and this relapse has gone on for over a year now. (I just had 3 days off weed, but of course I ruined it again)

I was pining to smoke terribly, and gave in. Bought ten dollars worth just for an easy high, also because I don't even have a job right now so I usually only buy 20 or 30 bags.

Anyway, any advice would be nice. I know 2 weeks is when it becomes easier but oh my god, I can barely get through the first 4 days, I haven't gone more than 4 days without smoking in over a year now. What the hell have I done to myself? Whenever I know I can't smoke I get this feeling of crushing, hopeless, dark and awful depression. It is just a feeling of death...my brother committed suicide last year at age 23 too, and I'm 26 now. This is just ruining my life. I NEVER thought suicide could effect me, but it got my brother. I was smoking the DAY I found out, up in my room getting high, came downstairs and asked what was wrong.

My mom and my 12 year old brother told me that my brother had not shown up to work in a few days, so they sent police (this was 600 miles away, he was doing an internship) and found out. This was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever been through, and the hardest thing, besides my marijuana addiction. During all the funeral proceedings and getting all the stuff taken care of, I just wanted to smoke. I didn't take any with me, so I only had one last bowl and quit for like a week maybe, before I got home and smoked immediately. So yeah, I don't see myself quitting anytime soon unless a miracle happens, it just feels too damn good. I just hope there is some way out of this prison.

Edit: To everyone who posted, I really appreciate it. Thank you."

I recently landed an amazing spring internship position at an IT firm. However, it's contingent on me actually passing my current classes. It's the only offer I've gotten in the ~1.5 years I've been searching. I have 3 finals that I need to do well on.

2. Database Management System (SQL)
3. Operating Systems

I'm going to be honest here. I completely slacked this entire semester and got by just be doing the bare minimum. I have the book for all 3, but I just can't bring myself to study.

I just have issues bringing people close to me, and I have a rather poor sense of compassion. I have never held a relationship longer than 3 months.  



**My ex &amp; I have quite an interesting past.** We've known each other since high school, and even dated in high school. I really did like her then, but being the stupid teenager I am I listened to a best friend that didn't want to lose another friend to ""a girl"". So I broke up with her then, it wasn't that serious. We dated for maybe a few weeks. 



**We stayed friends afterwards,** it was hard to keep in touch though. She went away to college, and I decided to go to a commuter campus. We always would mesh real well when hanging out. We talked a few times when she was home from school, sometimes even hanging out. I was too afraid of a long distance relationship though, and decided to not pursue it. 



**Summer came,** I had begun working out a few months prior. I was brimming with a sense of self confidence. The last girl I had talked to was in one of my classes from spring semester. Things didn't work out, but I was not bitter or hurt by it. I decided to try pursuing another relationship. I had been single for awhile at that point. It was summer, and I've always relied on school as my way to meet girls. I'm not one for the bar scene, I don't drink. So I turned to a convienent dating app, and found my ex on there. I was surprised, it stated she was in my location again. 



**We started dating again,** and broke up within a month. She broke up with me, and left me extremely bitter because it came out of no where. She would periodically text me after that, I never responded. She finally left me a voicemail three months later, stating that she wanted to get back together. I had to think about it for a bit, but I had gotten over my bitterness. I still remembered the great times we had when we were together. We got back together, she was working in the city at the time. She was doing an internship sort of, requiring a long commute to the city &amp; back. I knew she would be busy, but everything just felt so right. I was convinced it was some work of fate that kept bringing us together. 



Everything started out fantastic. We were both incredibly happy to be back together. When I would spend time with her, it felt like it just clicked. She was super busy, but would be finished &amp; graduated in December. We still hung out quite a bit, I would help her with any sort of tasks she would have to prepare for her internship. I was just happy to spend time with her. About almost a month in, she tells me she loves me. Normally I don't like to throw the word love that soon. I felt like our situation was different though. I was incredibly relieved for her to say it, as I had almost said it a few times the week prior. I felt the feeling mutally. I felt like this girl was the one I could be spending the rest of my life with. Everything lined up perfectly. My parents liked her a lot, her parents liked me. Things were great. 



**Last week,** she had a family member hospitalized for health issues. She became incredibly busy, juggling her day job &amp; spending time with her family member at the hospital. We did not see each other nearly as much, but it was fine. I knew she had a lot on her plate. I couldn't realistically expect to see her as much as I was before. Thanksgiving rolls around, I have a friend visiting from the city because he had no where else to go for thanksgiving. I get caught up in my own world, busy with work &amp; playing the new WoW expansion more than I should have. I kind of put her on the back burner without even realizing it. I never once asked her how she was doing or how her family member was doing within the first 3-4 days of them being in the hospital. 



**Thanksgiving day I'm texting her,** talking to her. She asks me why I hadn't even offered to visit the hospital, or asked how anything was going. I feel like a complete and utter moron at that point. I completely blanked on that whole thing, I did not intentionally do this. I sincerely apologized, but she was extremely upset. She had every right to be. The person she loved couldn't even make time to check in and see how shes doing, let alone show some compassion &amp; visit. I felt completely devastated and extremely angry at myself. What I had done was extremely thoughtless &amp; carless. I was in awe at my senseless lack of action. We argued over text late into the night. 



**Friday comes &amp; we are still arguing over text.** I'm at work for the whole day, so most of the time I was too busy to text back. I let her know I take full responsibility for my actions, and I have zero excuses as to why I acted that way. We talk on the phone friday night. The entire conversation turns into a giant argument, with her telling me she doesn't care about our relationship right now. I felt completely devastated. I felt like I was worthless to her, and she did a good job convincing me that I am. Here I had this person that I let into my inner self, only for them to completely crush me inside. She was still extremely upset I never bothered reaching out. She felt as if it was ridiculous that she had to volunteer emotions to me, and that I wasn't asking. I do not disagree with that at all. I promised her I would be more proactive in reaching out. She rejected any offers, stating that it was too late. She told me she would always remember that I wasn't there for her when she really needed me. I knew I had fucked up real bad at that point, I went on tilt. I teared up, asking her if this was her wanting to break up with me. She got angry I suggested that, and said that I shouldn't be thinking that way. I continued to promise I would do anything to make this right, and that I would make sure to be more proactive. Once again, the pleas fell on deaf ears. I got extremely frustrated. I saw absolutely no resolution to this problem, as she was making it incredibly difficult. 



**Saturday rolls around, I am busy that day.** I text her a few times to ask how shes doing, and how her grandma is doing. She tells me that she knows im trying, but she feels as if its not a sincere attempt. She also says she has no time to talk to me that day. I tell her to have a good day and end the communication at that. Once again, the frustration was boiling within. I still felt devastated at her telling me she doesn't care about our relationship. Sunday comes. Football &amp; a heft dose of yard work keep me busy. 
I try texting her in the day, but she doesn't reply until night. She barely responds to me, and just stops responding all together.



**Today happens.** I had been thinking about our relationship on an obsessive level, analyzing everything. Working myself into a mood where I convinced myself there's absolutely no chance in hell she will stay with me, I text her. I had convinced myself that for my own well being, I needed to end it. I needed to move on. The feelings of worthlessness combined with the anger I have within influenced me poorly. There were a few other factors that came into consideration too. She plans to move to the city when finished with her work up there now. She wanted to find a job up in the city and live there. I had zero intentions of doing that, as I quite enjoy my suburban enviroment. I had not completely ruled out the option of moving up there with her. To put a time line on it, she had anywhere from 6 to 8 months until she would be ready to find a job up there. I just was not excited about moving out there, but I wanted to be with her. 



**So I text her today.** I tell her I need to see her in person, despite with how busy she's been. I tell her I only need 15 minutes of her time, and that I had some concerns I wanted to address. I was very short about it, as my anger and grief had influenced me texting her in this manner anyways. I told her I knew she didn't care about our relationship, but I needed to talk to her. She responded with that I shouldnt even say that, and that I know she actually does care. With the mood I had worked myself in, I replied very coldly that she told me several times she didnt care and to let me know if she can meet up. She asked me if I was planning on breaking up with her at that point, to which I denied. We agree on a time and place, and set up this brief meeting.



**I had zero intentions going into this to actually break up with her.** I wanted to tell her how I felt worthless, and that I had been really hurt by her actions. I also wanted to apologize in person, and try to plead my case in that she should give me a chance in showing I can be there for her. Everything goes fine at first. I tell her how devastated I was when she said she didn't care about our relationship. I tell her how I feel like she considers me worthless now, and in the future may act in the same sort of manner. I tell her how I feel like I have issues trusting her now, knowing that she will forever hold my previous actions over my head. I told her how much it bothered me that she will always see me that way. It goes sour from there. She tells me she didn't really mean that she doesn't care about our relationship, and how I have no reason to feel like I'm worthless to her. I really did not have a reason. I merely overreacted and worked myself into a frenzy over this, not taking into consideration that sometimes we do say things we don't mean. 



**From then on, I went on tilt.** I managed to keep my composure, I don't like yelling. We start arguing because I'm even putting her through this right now. She has been extremely overwhelmed with all the other stuff going on, and this was the last thing she wanted to talk about. I deviated from my original plan and let the emotions take control. I let it slip that I want to know if she wants to stay with me or not. She starts freaking out, and I go on tilt even more. I told her that I'd like to know her answer tonight, right then and there. It was incredibly childish, short-sighted, unfair, and incredibly selfish to force her into a decision like that. She get's flustered, and starts freaking out even more. It ends with her leaving my car, slamming my door and saying its over. 



**I breathe deeply, and drive off.** As I'm driving off, I recognize the gravity of what I've just done. It finally hits me. It's done. Here I am, the man that just forced a girl he loves into making a decision after working 12 hours, then spending 3 at the hospital. She loved me too, and I had just made her make an incredibly difficult decision. I didn't even give her time to think about it. My selfishness needed to know then and there, I convinced myself the sooner it's over with the better. Instantly, a huge wave of regret and sadness hit me. I had realized how incredibly terrible I had acted. I forced a girl that has a family member hospitalized, is working 60 hours a week, and under an incredible amount of stress to end a relationship with someone she loved. I am absolutely disgusted with myself. I am literal human scum for doing this. The best part is I realized that I probably should have just toughed it out until she was no longer upset with me. I destroyed our relationship, within a matter of a week. She texts me later asking if I really meant all of it, and how ridiculous the request for me to make that sort of decision immediate was. Like a moron I reply with how I still felt like I was worthless, and that I know what I've done. I told her I meant it. She then told me that she could never possibly forgive me, and that I can't even understand how much I upset her.



**At that point, it fully hit me. I did this.** I was responsible for getting in the way of us continuing our relationship. I had caused it's downfall entirely. Of course I regret doing this. I understand that's normal. I threw a meaningful relationship away, just becasue we had hit a rough patch. All those times we spent together, all the happiness we had were down the drain. Forever gone, with no chance in hell of ever being repaired or reconciled. She could have been the one I marry, the one I start a family with. All because I cannot control my emotions. I feel empty now. I'm upset with myself. By far I'm digusted with myself. I commited an act that I never could even imagine myself doing. I am an absolutely awful person.



**I apologize for the length of this.** I needed somewhere to vent though. I don't have any friends that I can talk to about this kind of stuff. My friends are simply ""bros"". I am writing this as a way to not only cope, but in hope someone reads this and decides against acting as rash as I did. Break ups occur, things happen. Just make sure to act with a clear and open mind, considering every single factor. I wish I had done that instead of jumping in head first.

2o0vln,3,2014-12-02,i [19 M] broke up with my fiance [21F] 3 weeks ago. She wont stop trying to get us back together and i kind of want to.,throwawaywhachagonna,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o0vln/i_19_m_broke_up_with_my_fiance_21f_3_weeks_ago/,"I am a 19 year old male, when i met my fiance she was 19 years old and i had just turned 17. I had also just gotten out of jail after a long stint in the legal system for drug use (more on that soon).

I met my fiance when i was high on cocaine and tripping on DXM. A friend  that i had used for a long time for free drugs worked with her and invited her to hang out with us one night because we needed someone to buy us hookah at the local hookah bar. The first time we met my friend left to go hook up with a girl leaving me and another friend with this complete stranger at the hookah bar for several hours. during that time she described her time as a BDSM slave and me being someone who had never had a chance to explore that side of myself (also being extremely high) needed to have relations with someone like this. She had been smoking weed, and as i found out was always smoking weed, at the time but i didn't care. 

I was put into the corrective system after we hung out several times and we had started dating after the 3rd time we had hung out (again we were both high on our respective substances the entire time) i was put thrown into what i know as the hands of juvenile corrective system. I was put in a juvenile detention center, got out and ""hung out"" (did more drugs and had sexual relations) with her, then was quickly thrown in a ""mental health hospital"" because reasons, and immediately after than sent to a state run rehab because i was a cocaine and really every other drug addict. When i was transferring between these 2 places i had the opportunity to  contact someone and of course it was her, and of course she did not answer. I then called my close friend to in a very serious manner told me she was pregnant. I did not have the opportunity to contact her again for a month and a half, during which time i took my rehabilitation very seriously on account of this impending child. When i finally had earned enough points to contact an SO i did and found out that a cruel joke was played on my best friend and he took it seriously and relayed it to me hence why i thought she was pregnant. I got out 2 months later after several visits to my old life that included me and her hooking up for hours at a time until i had to go back to the center. 

Eventually i got out, she moved in with me and my mother for 2 months and i started a semi-successful IT business while she got a job that was actually full time. With our new found income we found our own place to stay. But meanwhile she would not stop smoking weed and drinking something i did not want to do. After we moved in with each other in our own place she continued this for a month till i demanded a stop to it (she cant take all the blame when she offered me alcohol i would happily oblige.) I got off probation after 5 months of being clean (not failing drug tests honestly i was not clean) and she started drinking again because she had just turned 21. This did not stop, and it was not hard to get me drinking again.

During the next 9 months i found a job as an intern at a large cable company, she still worked for her gas station. We had started fighting over drinking, her hiding alchohol around the house, an old friend telling me she cheated on me while i was in rehab (to be honest i think that more than likely it was that old friend she did it with, but neither would ever admit it and eventually i disowned that old friend), and me coming home for lunch with her and another man being in my house in their bathing suites (don't think they did anything now a days but at the time, oh boy did it make me mad).

We moved to another apartment after i got a promotion at work and was no longer considered an intern. Soon after than she quit her job despite my warning to get a job first and that i could not afford to pay for our apartment without her working. She did not ""really"" (at least in my opinion applying to 2 jobs in one month period is not trying, i am really trying to put both sides a evenly as i can. i can't but ill try) 3 months later after selling off several things that sure were only things but had sentimental value, to keep living our life she got a new job. She still did not help with bills or rent for the next 5 months. At this point i left her, and after a huge fit she finally left and came back with another man (who she claimed was a family friend, but you know... she has that history) to get the rest of her stuff. She was drinking obsessively at the time and we fought alot because of it. I had told her to leave for a while but couldn't go through with it several times then immediately found her spending money she didn't have at the near bye bar and flirting with men (maybe its just me again neutral point of view but one woman and 7 older man, including one that tried fighting me when i told her to just come home, seems like flirting to me) told her she needed to slow down on alchohol but she would buy it after work anyway, and expected me to pick he up after work and pay all her bills.

She won't leave me alone telling me i need to take her back and i feel like i should, something i did not mention is that i have paranoid schitzophrenia and although it more than likely is the reason i am so successful for someone my age, i can't sleep, i can't sit in my house alone without going crazy and she always knew how to help me through my episodes. I have never been sober without her and still kept my cool and i really think her using me is kind of the price i have to pay to keep someone in a relationship with a person like me. 

What the fuck should i do? i know the answer will be easy for alot of people and there is a huge part of me saying ""just ignore the bitch"" but theres that part of me eating away at me telling me that life was easier with someone to help me through it. It is not as easy as it should be because of this... i dont want sympathy i don't want feel good answers i just want the truth...


---   
**tl;dr**:  I am a young paranoid schizophrenic with a history of drug abuse that just left a person that may or may not have manipulated my faults to get what they want, but i honestly don't know if i just think that because i'm being paranoid. Any help would be appreciated.. She wants me back but i dont know what to do. "

I am a senior at Oklahoma State University and I am an MIS major, however, I want to start a software engineering career. I found my passion for software development later in my college career, and I have no internships or professional experience, and I'm looking for some advice. A family situation also requires that I stay in Oklahoma for at least the next few years.

Most companies I talk to want someone with my major to start as a help desk and then transfer within the company later. I do not want to do this, even though I would make good money doing it. I cannot get recruiters or my advisers to understand that my position is not my unwillingness to put time in to get started, it's my unwillingness to put my time into a job that I don't like. I work as a technician at a local computer repair shop right now, and it's a great job, but the work just isn't very fulfilling. Even when I get to go hands on with larger systems for local businesses, the work just isn't what I want to do. I understand that this is better than washing trucks at a distribution center the rest of my life (my previous summer/school year job), but I would honestly rather go back to school and complete a computer science degree or try to do contracting work on my own. 

I have been interviewing for every on campus development job I can find posted, and I have a friend trying to help me get a job at our App Center. I've been working on personal projects with friends and trying to learn popular frameworks like AngularJS (which I would ideally like to work with professionally). I have had a very successful interview with a company that will reevaluate me in the Spring, and I'm hopeful that I will still get that job, but I definitely want backup plans. The company in question declined to offer me a job because they were concerned that I would not be content working on desktop applications, but they emphasized their culture of never looking down on coworkers when they ask ""stupid"" questions. One of the senior engineers even asked me questions about relational database design during the interview, and we talked through what I knew. I followed another engineer and we walked through debugging an IE issue, and he was very receptive to any questions I asked, even though I knew almost no JavaScript at the time. Ideally, I would like to make myself more desirable to this company next semester.

I just feel lost at time about where to start and what to do. I've been taking all the computer science courses I can and trying to learn something everyday. I would love like Mike talked about where I could just learn from a senior engineer, and stay with a company for a significant amount of time, I just need some direction.


I'm linking to all of my relevant information for any feedback on the state of my GitHub, current projects, etc. I would love to hear feedback.

[EA won ""Worst Company in America"" for 2 years running: both in 2012 and 2013. The reasons for this were obvious.](http://consumerist.com/2013/04/05/ea-admits-it-can-do-better-but-blames-worst-company-success-on-homophobes-and-whiny-madden-fans/)

&gt; Our analysis of the reasons for EA’s inclusion in last year’s finale makes no mention of Mass Effect 3 or SOPA. Instead, it looks at EA’s history of buying up smaller, successful developers with the intention of milking — and arguably ruining — the intellectual properties that made these acquired companies so attractive. It also discusses EA’s exclusivity deals on popular sports games, that some say effectively sets the bar for retail prices for the rest of the gaming industry.

The list of reasons for their nomination go on quite extensively.

What we eventually reach is the excuse that EA had decided to use as their shield:

&gt;Moore contends that EA’s decision to allow users to create lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) characters in some of its games has resulted in a voting campaign orchestrated by those opposed to portrayals of LGBT characters in games

The article responds with

&gt;If there is such a campaign, the people involved in it have not reached out to us, nor have we seen evidence of this traffic to our pages. While any number of tech and video game sites and forums have been writing about and linking to the WCIA polls (here’s lookin’ at you /v/), our analytics show absolutely no incoming traffic from anything we’d label as political, let alone conservative.

Huh.

&gt;In coming out and responding to its previous win — and possible repeat victory — EA had the opportunity to show the gaming community the respect it deserves, but instead has insulted its intelligence by asking it to accept that its quite obvious faults are really just minor problems and that the actual source of trouble are faceless, homophobic hatemongers.

Sound familiar at all?

Have a read through some comments they quoted for even more hilarity

&gt; I don’t dislike EA because they are pro-LGBT. In fact I am supporter of LGBT rights. I dislike EA because they have a long standing history of anti-consumer practices. Not liking EA does not make me anti-LGBT, it makes me anti-EA.

And my personal favourite:

&gt; NO EA! You do not get to Spin the story and take the Moral high ground on this shit! Don’t try to fool people by lumping these intolerant assholes with the people actually making legitimate complaints against your practices. You don’t get to try to make yourself look progressive like that.

The article concludes with the following:

&gt;Gaming might be a multibillion-dollar industry that attracts the world’s biggest names in entertainment, music, and sports, but it is nonetheless treated by both the media and the business world with a reductionist shrug. Companies like EA are happy to foster the misinformed perception of your average “gamer” as a whiny, nitpicky loner who will complain about anything, as that image only helps to discredit those who have a valid complaint about a relatively pricey consumer product.

[Our friend Erik Kain even wrote a few articles on this.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/04/05/ea-in-full-damage-control-mode-points-to-anti-gay-hate-mail/) 

I hope this trip to yesteryear was fruitful. Maybe we can learn something from this. If this shows anything, it's that these people are not above stooping to Worst-Company-in-America-Level tactics to defend themselves. And worse, the megaphones (and unpaid Gawker interns) they have at their disposal means they're much more effective at it than a company that actually needs to pay for PR."

“My name is Holly, I’m 23, and I’m here for counseling for some anxiety issues.” I hear myself saying.
I found myself pouring my heart out to the doctor and his intern. She sat quietly while I spoke, but Dr. West was very engaging, asking questions like “Why do you think that you have to do this?” or “What caused you to feel that way?”

*Geez, Doc, if I knew, I wouldn’t be here!*

I shrug, but continued about my childhood and the variety of reasons of I was in counseling in the first place.

“I just find myself obsessing about the same things over and over. And I need to make lists. Lists keep me organized.” I said. 

“What if you didn’t make a list?”

I sat in silence. Didn’t the man listen at all?

“I don’t know. I don’t know if I could **not** make a list.”

“Why don’t we try that and see if it helps? We can talk about the results at the next appointment.”
Why would he give me a task that he knew would set off my anxieties? To see how I deal with stress? Obviously not well since I was sitting here with them. 

I sighed and stood up. I turned off the camera and looked to the two corpses propped up next to it.

“I’ll see you next appointment then.”

2o2srz,1,2014-12-02,Starting a new job next week and I'm scared,SoBeginsOurOdyssey,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2o2srz/starting_a_new_job_next_week_and_im_scared/,"I'm starting a new job next week and I'm scared and need some internet hugs right now.

Rationally, I know my new job is going to be great. The position is awesome, everyone I met with was awesome and had advanced from within, their benefits are unreal, big raise, awesome place.

But I am so scared I'm going to fuck it up, or the people will find my personality horrible (I've been called ""abrasive"" in reviews, in a nice way) and I won't make friends at the company, or that I'll have problems with management, or that I don't perform as high as they expect, or something, I don't know. 

There is pressure to perform well at the new job since it's a mid-level position that I feel like I've lucked into even though I have less than five years of full-time experience and my spouse wants to start their own company in the next year, so the pressure of providing benefits for the family is on my shoulders. 

I've been at my current job since I was in college and it's the only full-time job I know. Unlike many Millennials, I've been lucky enough to be here for several years and have worked my way from intern to mid-level. For a variety of reasons (chiefly among them, new management that doesn't value my contributions and existing management that doesn't see the problem) I realized it was time to move on before this place ate me alive, and I'm totally confident that I made the right decision to leave. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to my last day. 

I think what I'm scared of is the unknown. I *know* the leader of my current job dislikes me and I *know* some of our projects are a huge pain in the ass but I know how to handle them. I've been here so long that I know more about the company than any other rank-and-file employee (and even most senior employees) and I'm scared about what it will be like to completely start from scratch again. I've been here so long that I can't imagine anything else. I feel like I'm breaking up with a serious high school boyfriend/girlfriend -- had fun and learned a lot, but not amounting to anything long-term -- rather than leaving a job, that's how invested I became in this company.

It doesn't help that I've been in a bit of a funk for the last 6 months-year or so and don't feel as confident or as happy as I used to. It's hard for me to get excited about anything as much as I used to and new things are anxiety-inducing. Day-to-day life is anxiety-inducing alone and a typical day makes me want to crawl into a ball and disappear into a TV show for hours on end while sitting in the dark basement. I'm really helping the new job will help pull me out of that, but that state is making it hard to be excited about getting out of that situation. If that makes any sense at all. 

Surely someone here has been in a similar situation and can share their own story or some words of encouragement?

As a disclaimer, I don't actually hate college *or* academia, and I don't actually mind being mindful of one's language in public discourse. So those are my cards. If I have offended you already, I'm sorry - because that's just the sort of SJW I am, apologetic when I have offended someone.

I actually didn't expect the amount of bullheaded, angry circlejerking in this thread. I mean, the headline kind of sets it up, but it sets us up for a variety of comments, and they totally focused on just one thing, and they got *hopping mad* about it.

&gt;I'm a student, been doing stand-up 4 years, and I'm annoyed by this also. Every freakin' coffee shop and bar around campus is walking on eggshells.

Get ready for ""As a student,"" but also, ""As someone who took a class in community college,"" ""as someone who went to school twenty years ago,"" ""as someone who had a conversation with a student once,"" ""as someone who crossed a campus on my way to work once,"" and a thousand other variations on the essential qualifiers that, when mothers or feeemales do it, is absolutely despicable, but otherwise completely necessary.

&gt;&gt;I identify as roosterkin and find your callous disregard for chicken life unacceptable.

For all they're hatred of strawmen, redditors just can't get enough of this ridiculous tumblrinaction-style straw comedy.

Those threads go on, but I'm out, or else I'll never escape. Second top comment:

I can't believe these guys. What world do they actually live in? Have they met students? Do they know what students are? What it is they do in class? Is this like proles vs. intellectsia or whatever the fuck they did a century ago? Down with the educated, hyper-tolerant elite?

&gt;It's the Star Trekification of America's educated - everyone is welcome, we're all equally important, you can see the difference in people, you just don't say anything. Walking on eggshells, yep...everyone get's a trophy.

Haha, I can't believe this. Heaven forbid America become slightly more like Star Trek, the egalitarian utopia where no one wants or needs and everyone is treated equal (at least within the confines of Roddenberry's 20th century sensibilities). Yeah, what a fucking nightmare that would be. You mean to tell me *everyone* is welcome? We're *all* important? I don't think so, bub.

&gt;I hope everyone realizes that this is just the afterglow of what baby boomers did to this country. Gen X'ers and the tumblr generation are just a product of The Most Self Absorbed Generation, aka baby boomers. You can basically trace the degradation of the country back to the baby boomer generation coming to political and financial power.

HAH! How about that - they managed to make the tumblrina-jerk part of the larger, more vitriolic and aggressive Baby Boomer jerk! How did they do that? *How?* 

When I was browsing on my phone earlier, there was a long comment thread about soldiers who attended class once and used crude language and offended people and stuff, followed by many declarations of agreement and horror stories revolving around whether Afghanistan is, or is not, a stone age culture. (Hint: yes, it is, literally stone age, they use stone tools, stop being so over-sensitive please, stupid SJW). But I can't find any of that now, so I'm gonna leave it.

I also can't find any of the Carlin quotes I promised. I guess I kind of dropped the ball on that one.

I hope I didn't offend anyone. I also hope everyone had a happy Thanksgiving and a relaxing weekend. I recommend the cartoon ""Over the Garden Wall"" if you are into animation. It is a well-crafted narrative that resolves itself satisfactorily and is supplement by very interesting musical numbers and thematic subversions. I also recommend you eat plenty of fiber - eat fiber-fortified cereals if you have to - and drink water - it really *is* important. I've also recently using Plackers floss picks and alcoholic mouthwash every night when I brush my teeth and it's very effective. They say you're not supposed to rinse your mouth out after you brush your teeth, but I can't stand not doing it, so I rinse with water and then I use the mouthwash, and I don't rinse that. If anyone has any better recommendations I would truly love to hear them. We only get two front teeth, after all.

Stay warm out there!

I go to a pretty small liberal arts college in New England. Since it's a small school, the social scene is very insular and interconnected, which is often pretty nice. I have a fairly close core group of friends and that's great.

February of this year, a girl who I had only known from afar showed up at a party at my house and we ended up hooking up. I would later learn that she, too, had a thing for me despite never speaking and we were both pretty surprised to learn that the other was interested. Almost immediately, I realized that she wasn't just a cute girl I saw around campus, she was also extremely intelligent, funny, humble, pretty much everything I would want in a friend or in a partner. Cue a fairly lengthy period of what I guess is best described as a FWB scenario?

What I mean by that is that we hooked up fairly regularly, but beyond that, we'd hang out together and do very typical couple activities: watch Netflix and cuddle up together, show up to each other's events, grab meals together, et cetera. At no point during this whole period (from like March through June) did we ever discuss what our ""status"" was, we just kind of let things exist in an uncommented-upon state. My friends generally just treated us as a couple despite the lack of official title or whatever. It's also worth pointing out that, at every point in this thing--from the beginning to the present--the sex itself has always been intensely tender and passionate in a way that a booty call would never be; we've both acknowledged this.

During exams, when we realize we'll be going home (to separate cities), she finally decides to bring up the concept of being in a serious thing. Her first move is to ask me what I want. I tell her (like an idiot) that whatever she wants, I'll be fine with. She proceeds to say that she really ""likes"" me but she isn't sure she wants to be in a serious relationship with me. She explained that she was very conflicted about the whole thing and figured that, if she wasn't absolutely sure she wanted to date me, that it would probably be a bad idea to try. Okay, whatever. She was also insistent that we remain friends because she was adamantly opposed to having me not present in her life. It hurt to hear her (essentially) say no, but I told her I understood.

Over the summer, I was offered a paid internship in Chicago, where she lives. I took it, and since I knew nobody else in the city, I ended up hanging out with her one-on-one during days off and other free time. It wasn't like an every day kind of thing, but we were in constant communication even if we weren't seeing each other even when we weren't hanging out. Some of the times I'd see her were initiated by me, others were initiated by her. We didn't sleep with each other during any of these things, even though we never explicitly discussed ending our physical thing when we talked at the end of school.

Summer ends and we go back to school, and fairly early on, we end up drunkenly hooking up. It was her idea, but I was obviously not going to say no. We end up having sex two times in a row, somehow, and then as we're just sort of cuddled up afterward, she just begins talking about how she feels. As far as I can remember, her main points seemed to revolve around her still being extremely attracted to me (not sure if she meant this in a purely physical sense, but maybe), but she felt like she wasn't emotionally ready to be in a serious relationship because of various things going on in her life (her family is kind of falling apart, she can't really pay for school, she was diagnosed with some kind of stress/anxiety disorder). I told her that I understood, that I obviously still had feelings for her, but that I got that she wasn't interested and wouldn't try to push her into anything she wasn't ready for. After this point, we continued to sleep together, but I was entirely aware that she wasn't in a place where she could reciprocate my feelings even if she wanted to (she'd actually said stuff like ""I wish I could love you the way you deserve to be loved""). 

By this time, I spent enough time with this girl that she (and, to a lesser extent, her friends) had basically assimilated into my group of friends. If we were actually dating, this would have been awesome. It didn't bother me that my friends hung out with her or anything, but the effect of it is that even if I ever did work up the balls to rip off the band-aid, so to speak, I'd either have to keep seeing this girl constantly, which would be dumb, or I'd have to make my friends choose between me and her, which would also be dumb. It's not any of my business who she chooses to associate with, but the obvious solution to my problem--""remove all traces of her from your life and move on""--is not really feasible in my current social situation. Plus, we're still friends, and we see each other or talk multiple times a day.

We still sleep together sometimes, but she's openly acknowledged at this point that she worries she's leading me on, though I've told her I don't expect any kind of emotional commitment from her. At the same time, though, she's literally cried into my chest while telling me that if she could just get over her own weird insecurities, she'd give anything to be with me. I feel awful that she feels like she needs to justify her (lack of) feelings to me, but at the same time I am completely confused on why she acts the way she does--is it because she's just not romantically interested in me? Is it because she's worried she'll fuck up the relationship somehow (worth noting that her parents had an incredibly ugly divorce when she was young, and it obviously continues affect her)? Is it just her weird insecurities? Or have I constructed some kind of imaginary narrative in which a girl who just wanted to bang me really has feelings for me, and I got so attached to this idea that I forgot I just made it up entirely?

---

Obviously, I'm overthinking everything, but these are all bells that can't really be un-rung.


It is worth pointing out that I've framed this narrative in the way that I think gives you guys the most information, but it's also possible to read this entire series of events as *""I hooked up with a girl, immediately caught feelings, and she was too nice to tell me to fuck off right away so we ended up in a protracted and messy non-relationship that I'm too much of a bitch to get over""* OR *""This girl is really obviously into me but the concept of a relationship makes her super anxious, and rather than work it out I'm trying to throw in the towel.""* Any of these are possible and I've thought all of them. Talking to her about this kind of thing is surprisingly unhelpful, as she mainly just gives me moderately contradictory information, we talk for hours, and nothing is resolved. This must have happened at least four times now.

It's also worth pointing out that, while both of us have been sexually active since high school, if we actually dated, this would be the first real relationship either of us would ever have been involved in.

I'm asking you guys about getting over her because I don't really know what else to do, and if I just left it here, I assume the immediate response would be ""get over her, dude."" I'm not entirely clear on how I ought to do that, given everything I've explained.

Wat do?

**tl;dr**: Need to get over girl I (used to?) sleep with and still have feelings for. Also need to get over her without removing her from my life. Also need to figure out if I have over-thought this entire thing and should not be trying to ""get over"" her at all."

After the usual chit-chat about our day, she says we need to talk about our relationship: 

She starts by mentioning the fact that I don't give news (a real issue I have and that I need to work on). 
Then I go on saying how I feel we have different lives (she's doing an internship, I'm in business school) and that I just don't feel fulfilled by the relationship: we don't see each other enough, I have a job and my studies that take some time, we live about an hour and a half from one another and only see each other on the weekends.

The conversation went on and it got to the point where I felt like there was no future in this relationship. We ended up breaking up, with her in tears and me really not understanding what just happened.

I don't know why I didn't reason with myself or tried to see why it was we were in a relationship and just let it go at that point. It feels like I was probably tired and frustrated at that point and didn't feel like really reasoning with myself.

It is now Tuesday, and I don't really understand what got me to break up with her. There honestly was enough room to fix things up (I could give her more news and try to take more news from her, and we could try to see each other more). The thing is, since it is now a weekday life feels almost normal for me (because we would be pretty much independent on the weekdays). However, every time that I think about it, I can't help but wonder why exactly I broke up: I still love her, and every moment we spent was great (although we didn't spend much time together outside of the weekends).

I don't know if I should try to talk to her to try to really see what is up, if I really meant everything that I said and don't see any future in this relationship or if I can't see that I simply stopped caring about her. 

Any advice is good on the subject, don't hesitate to ask more details.

I'm in a relationship since 9 months and I live in the U.S while my GF lives in germany. So it's a long distance relationship since 5 months and I'm going to see her again in 20 days, woooow. We were physically together for five months and everything was awesome, we lived together since I was doing my internship next to her place etc. Really super nice and we lived together.

I have never cheated on her, and I'm sure she never did as well. 

The thing is, one year before we started dating, I almost had sex ( we didn't go that far ) with one of my best friends. We had done this twice and I made her promise to don't say anything.

Of course, she did say it to one her friend...who told that to someone else... . She does not know that I know she talked about that because I made her clear that this was a mistake we should just erase this from or memory in order to save our friendship. But she talked. 

Anyway, when I started dating my GF, she asked me if I had ever done something with my one my females friends. I just said no and I lied because my GF is very jealous since her last BF cheated on her...4 times. I just figured out that she would be very annoying and paranoid whenever I would see my friend. So I lied. But it was over a year ago!

I'm just now afraid that she discovers my lie one day and that she won't trust me anymore or will think I cheated on her while I was in the U.S, which is obviously BS, I don't even  text any girls to make sure that there is no ambiguity.  

I just don't want to tell her because long distance relationship is hard enough, we had some troubles because of that and  I don't want to make things worse and to worry her. And I know she is going to be super fucking mad and she might even dumps me because remember, its a long distance relationship so it is very FRAGILE.

I just feel bad because I'm not an asshole, I've never cheated on her, im not planning to do so etc etc

I really feel like I'm trapped because I had done nothing wrong, it was a year before..

Any advice is welcome,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2o3s41/im_having_a_hard_time_in_my_college_courses_i/,"It is nearing the very end of the first semester of my sophomore year of college, and I currently have two D's. 

Of course the classes are not easy (biology and organic chemistry), but I thought if I tried hard enough, I could make it through. Some people may think that a D is a passing grade in some cases and not too much of a concern. However, the courses are part of my major and I need at least a C, as well, it will plummet my GPA. If my GPA goes below a 3.25, then I will be removed from the Honors program, which provides a nice scholarship along with a few other benefits. 

I have always had a passion for science; excelling in high school courses, being part of the Science National Honor Society, participating in STEM events, doing several internships as a lab technician to a scientist. When I was in the 5th grade everyone was asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, and while most people said play in the NFL, NBA, or becoming an FBI agent, I said I wanted to be a scientist. Now my dreams are coming crashing down with my GPA, and I feel like a fucking idiot. 

My parents are aware that I am struggling, but I do not think they are grasping at what level. They have always been proud of me and supported me, hoping I could surpass and achieve what they couldn't. I don't want to let them down, and it's only the first half of my sophomore year, so I might be able to turn it around. Still, I am scared about school; a feeling I am not used to. College is important, something I set out to do and intend to complete. The school is providing plenty of scholarships to make it easy for me to attend. I will be letting down more than just myself if can't pull through. 

At the same time, I am having second thoughts about even going through the whole motion of college and the middle class career that awaits. There is a part of me, in the back of mind, that seeks fame. 

I'm sure many have had similar thoughts of throwing away the mundane and aiming for glory. I dream of being a comedian or writer. Perhaps not a legendary standup or award winning screenwriter, but I would accept being a starving artist. I really want to quit consuming and start creating. I know I have not shown myself to be particularly interesting, bubbly, funny, or full of personality in this self loathing and droning tale about my personal issues. Never in my life have I ever revealed this part of myself to friends or family. Yet, I do not think they would be too surprised if I ever do tell them. My parents occasionally mention that I could make a career out of the jokes I crack, and they would love to see me follow through with it. Even though I am not known as the most talkative in the family, my siblings comment on how the conservation dulls when I leave. When I meet up with my friends I am referred to as the funny guy of the group, and that's the role I've been placed in for all my friendships. Hell, classmates and teachers always comment on my presentations that I bring comedic relief to even the most dreary of topics. 

My whole life has been spent trying to make people laugh. I used to make stupid videos with my friends whenever the opportunity arose. Whenever I think of something funny I write it down in my phone and try to wedge it into conversations. I used to write scripts for YouTube videos I wanted to make. The only drawings I do are comics that I keep hidden in a secret stash. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to see come to life, but I don't know if I can devote the time to make that risk, and still attend college. 

There I go again... I understand the connotation with the statements that I am making and the compliment fishing self doubt I continue to be spilling out. It's just that I want to fully express my situation and feelings. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask because I need your answers. 

I thought I could pull through with an end of the year grade saving miracle, but it is not looking that way. Should I let everyone know I failed? Should I considered an easier major? Should I hold off on my fantasies until after college? Should I drop out? What should I do?

Why am I asking the Internet? I'm hoping for a wide range of answers, not just people telling me what I want to hear.

P.S. I do not feel like doing a TL;DR, I'm sorry for possibly putting this in the wrong place. I apologize for the long text, writing this on my phone, the minuscule pity inducing bitching, and possible tooting of my own horn. "

He's very interested in karting but unfortunately we don't have much money and it seems like a pretty expensive sport. However I'm a firm believer in ""where there's a will, there's a way"" and I'm hoping some people in Karting community could offer some suggestions on ways that he might be able to get into it pretty inexpensively?  We live about an hour away from the Jim Hill Karting School in Ventura, Ca. and were looking into maybe trying to get a summer internship or something like that.  Any suggestions for creative ways to get him going would be greatly appreciated!

(TL,DR - how can I get my son started in Karting without going into massive debt.)"
2o42br,3,2014-12-02,I'm a CMA in Canada. What's my upwards mobility?,ZiggyZig1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2o42br/im_a_cma_in_canada_whats_my_upwards_mobility/,"For those in other countries let me just give an explanation of what CMA is in case you dont know.

In Canada we have 3 accounting bodies, Chartered Accountant, Certified Management Accountant, and Certified General Accountant. They're all now combined (combining?) under the CPA title.

I think its fair to say CA's are the best, generally speaking, but the CMA is a decent designation as well.

With all that said I'm wondering what my career options are at this point. I'm a Financial Analyst at Canadian Tire (the largest retailer in Canada) and am making $58K. Not chump change but definitely not ideal. When I started the CMA program I had visions of making 6 figures soon. That's definitely not the case. The way I see it my next step would be another FA position within the company until I have 2 years under my belt. I'm guessing my next FA position I'll be making similar money, so prolly $60-65K. From there I could become a Senior Financial Analyst, I'm guessing making $70-$75K (maybe 80K), and after 2-3 years of that become a Manager. I dont know what a manager makes ($90-100K?) but it seems like a loooong hard road, not something that is a guaranteed path (nothing is guaranteed of course but I dont necessarily think its a direct path either ie 50% of FA's will become a Manager). Also I used to think becoming a Manager is hard but do-able since in the past I've always worked for Managers who've been in that position a while. But in my current role we had the manager change a few months ago and my gosh, I'm soo impressed with my current boss. She's been able to pick up stuff pretty rapidly, already seems to know my own role better than I do (its fine for her to have a high level view but to know the actual role better than me, very impressive) and knows the other 2 people in my dept's role well as well, thats impressive. But also very intimidating, I dont think I'd be able to do that in a few years time. Part of me assumed it must be her past Canadian Tire experience that's helping her but when I spoke with her about it she said not really. As in it helped her a little bit to know the background but this role was quite different than her past one, which makes sense to me. So yeah I dont know how that happens but it makes me question whether I'd ever be capable of becoming one.

Sooo with that said, what on earth is our salary potential? I really dont see a direct path to $100K but even $80K seems pretty far off. I've looked at other Accounting type salaries on Glassdoors and I dont see anything particularly lucrative. Even Investment Banking, which I thought was like the top of the top, seemed to have an average salary of $80K. That's it?? I thought that was among the most highest paid jobs. And to me average means like 10 years experience. Interestingly enough my brother is in his last year of university right now as an Engineer (he did a 16 mth coop last year) and has already been offered a job at $85K!! How the hell did that happen? I'm 10 years older, in a field that is also supposedly pretty good, and a kid with 1 year's experience is making so much more? Granted he's incredibly smart academically and so got one of the best internships they have I'm guessing (or maybe they all pay similarly?) but its still crazy. I should mention this is in a different province (Alberta) so there's a premium they're adding, but still.

Anyway I went off on a tangent there. So I want to know what upwards mobility I have, and what I can do, if anything, to make more in the near future (present to 2-3 years). Figures are always preferable wherever possible, and of course I know it all depends."

2o4u76,0,2014-12-03,Help !Applying US visa with an arrest record!,zhangz64,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2o4u76/help_applying_us_visa_with_an_arrest_record/,"Hello Everyone,

My name is mike, a third year engineering student at University of Toronto.

I am in a very difficult situation right now hope that I could get some help here.
 
I had a unpleasant encounter with RCMP about 2 years ago when I took to part-time job to sell DVD at a flea market.
I was new to Canada, ignorant, and completely unaware that I was creating illegal profits for those people(Owner of the DVD shop).

The RCMP showed up on the second weekend of my work and arrested me on the spot.
Even though, I was released without charge (No finger prints were taken, No mug shots). I still have a record of arrest according according to my arresting officer.
That day is the darkest day in my life which i wish i could forget.

I had a costly lesson regarding the law and how to protect myself in the future. I even took Canadian law courses at University of Toronto to have a better understanding.

Right now, I just received a Internship offer from a US company. I am in the process of applying the US visa.
One of the question in the application form is ""Have you even been arrested"", I was devastated when i saw this question.  My dream job could vanish due to a ignorant mistake 2 years ago. I talked with a immigration lawyer and I was suggested to get a arrest record from RCMP to prove that indeed I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I know that The ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of law. But I believed that I have learned my lesson.
I also believe that Everyone should have a second chance.
Here is my questions:
1: Does arrest record get uploaded on CPIC?
2: if it is not there, What kind of search I can do to confirm it?
3: if it is there, How do i get a copy of arrest record?(Since the officer is from RCMP, would it be difficult?)

4: if I tick the section ""Have you been arrested"", and I attend the appointment with my arrest record, Would I run into problem with my VISA application.
5: Do i need a US visa waver only for arrest?
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Mike"
2o4vi0,0,2014-12-03,"Is my mindset wrong, as a college aged man?",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2o4vi0/is_my_mindset_wrong_as_a_college_aged_man/,"To give some background, I'm 20 years old. I've got my fair share of good luck, such as going to a great university, having some good friends, a family that pays my bills. I've also got some bad luck: I don't feel secure about my major (business) or a job, I have some insecurities, and I've never had a girlfriend.

I'm a pretty normal guy I think, a little nerdy and sometimes quiet but generally I feel good about myself. I've improved a lot over the years and I'm still learning and improving myself, trying to lift and get as good grades as I can and get an internship.

**But I still feel really bad about the fact that I've never had a girlfriend.** My history with girls is pretty short. In senior year of high school, I had my first kiss and then lost my virginity to a girl but it was just cause she was mad at her boyfriend and used me to get back at him. So I had one kiss, and had sex once. Since then I haven't had anything and I'm a junior in college now. I've been to some parties but I've never had a girl be interested in me when I talk and flirt with them, to the point where it got demoralizing and decided I don't like parties that much. 

I try not to let it get to me, but literally all of my friends from both high school and college are having sex literally all the time, and many of them have girlfriends. I know that I'm not ""owed"" anything so I try not to let myself think that but it really sucks honestly. I feel like I'm missing out. When people describe college as the best four years of your life, I don't think I've been more miserable or jealous. And it makes me feel like an idiot because that seems  so petty. But on the other hand, I see all my friends having fucking anniversary posts and all that stupid cute stuff and I am sitting alone, playing video games or doing homework. My friends all pick on me about it too, not in a mean way, but they're always trying to help me out or telling me to go on tinder and whatnot and I just don't know how to respond because they're right, my life WOULD be better if I could get a girlfriend, but for whatever reason I just can't.

Am I wrong about how I'm thinking? Or is it just not my time yet? I don't know what to do, I'm at my wits end having consumed and tried so many self-help and improvement techniques. Please give me your thoughts "
2o59m9,5,2014-12-03,PhD Archaeology or undergrad law/commerce (x-post r/gradschool),totesanonymous,auslaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/2o59m9/phd_archaeology_or_undergrad_lawcommerce_xpost/,"Hi all,

I am 26. I have a Bachelor of Fine Art, a Masters in Arts Management and a Masters in Arts Curatorship from arguably the top university in Australia. I was also accepted to do my PhD in Information Studies at University College London, however I was unable to secure funding and deferred my place until next year. I have applied to do my PhD in Archaeology at a well respected university in Australia (as I don't see any prospects in securing funding for UCL despite my deferral) next year but I'm having serious doubts regarding my long term career and student debt.

Despite my education and internships and contracted positions at museums, galleries, festivals, etc. I have been unable to get my foot in the door and secure a permanent position in the arts. For the last 18 months, I have been really exacerbating all resources at my disposal and applying for as many positions as possible but the fact is I got one job offer for minimum wage at $37k per year. I considered it but after it was made clear that the company had very little career progression or further opportunity, I chose not to take it. As a result, I am currently working for my mum's business in the financial industry and get paid double that annually.

I am now considering going back to uni and retraining in the law/commerce field. I have applied for several undergrad courses such as law/commerce, law/international relations and am considering applying for a master of laws due to my postgrad qualifications. I have a postgrad average of 85% average and solid undergrad marks.

I have also really come to want to help people and change what I see in the arts as grossly unfair treatment. After studying arts law and a lot of arts curatorship issues I am really passionate about issues such as artists and intellectual property, the repatriation of stolen artefacts, copyright infringements, etc.

My PhD research surrounds the preservation of prehistoric rock art using digital technology and is an extension of my Masters thesis. As such, I see it as a whole other kettle of fish in terms of subject matter, direction and outcome. I am also incredibly concerned about completing my PhD and then being unable to secure an academic career or an job outside of the field, considering my previous experience.

At the moment, I am having a full internal battle and have even resorted to a pro/con list but am feeling very apprehensive about my current career situation. I would really appreciate any wise words, brutal honesty or anecdotes from strangers on the internet.

2o5qix,17,2014-12-03,Interested in a paid internship in the network security field? Read here...,swrx,providence,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/2o5qix/interested_in_a_paid_internship_in_the_network/,"Hey /r/providence,

We have an up and coming paid internship position and we’re looking for applicants since we hired our current intern as a permanent employee.  Dell SecureWorks performs network security management services for large and small customers and we’re looking for up and coming techies to join the operations team in Providence.  We’re redditors, we’re gamers, and we are networking experts.  If you like all three, you’ll love this job.


Our wish list for applicants is pretty interesting:   We’re looking for someone personable, very eager to absorb as much information as humanly possible, someone who can type and navigate multiple desktop windows like nobody’s business.
From a technical perspective, we’d like you to have a networking background with some basic routing, switching, or linux networking experience.  We can teach you the rest.


At first we’ll have you do a lot of repeatable/easy tasks but based on how fast you progress could quickly end up doing more interesting tasks like VPN configurations, firewall interface/policy reconfiguration, and troubleshooting.
The 3-6 month full-time internship pays $18/hr with the opportunity to make much more if you excel and transition to a permanent role.
In the past we’ve hired interns out of JWU/RWU, from Best Buy, and this one guy who was a short-order cook with a passion for networking who turned out to be a network security rock-star.


PM with a quick blurb on your background and we can talk more about the position.

2o5r08,6,2014-12-03,"My social experiences make me feel like there's something wrong with me, but it feels like there are somewhat valid explanations for a lot of my troubles. I need some guidance.",[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2o5r08/my_social_experiences_make_me_feel_like_theres/,"Skip down to below the line if you just want to read why I'm here.

A quick recap of my social life: First three years of high school, I was somewhat of an outcast, hung out with the nerdy kids, and I didn't really care because that was the kind of stuff I enjoyed. I never really would have considered myself happy, but I was content with where I was. I never thought about things too hard.

Senior year, I make friends with a lot of new people. Smoke pot for the first time, drink for the first time, and I'm having a blast. Looking back, senior year of high school was the best time of my life without a doubt. Before leaving for college, I remember thinking about how grateful I was to have such great friends now, and I began to get really nervous about what could happen when we all go off to college.

So we all go off to college. I'm put into a quad with three other guys who either know each other or already have friends somewhere else, and I have trouble inserting myself into their already-established social groups. I stick with it because people hang out in the quad all the time, it's a pretty nice social vibe, but I can never shake the stigma that everyone looks down on me for being an outsider. Whether or not that was a valid stigma (it probably wasn't) is up to interpretation. By the end of the year, I was so excited to go home and re-unite with my high schools friends. I had a job lined up and everything; things were going great.

Less than a week after I got home from freshman year, something happened in my life that changed everything. I lost everything that I held dear. I couldn't hang out with my friends anymore, I lost my job, and I lost the respect of my family. It's not something I enjoy talking about, so I'll leave it at that.

This event sent me into a spiraling depression that took about two years to climb out of. My sophomore and junior years were horrible, looking back. I went out probably three times in those two years. Senior year definitely improved, and I made some new friends and went out a lot more. Senior year was by far my best year of college. I still dealt with the same self-image issues that I've dealt with my entire life, though.

Now, I'm graduated and job hunting. Honestly, I'm the happiest I've been in years. I can safely say that my depression is more or less gone, although it does come back in episodes which I'll get back to. I've vastly improved my body, my self-image has skyrocketed, and my future looks pretty good (as long as I can find a job in this market).

-----

Now, for why I'm posting. It's that ""At what age did you lose your virginity?"" thread. 

As I said earlier, my depression comes back in episodes. They can last from a few days to a few weeks, but I've learned how to nip them in the bud so they don't take over. This morning it was triggered by that thread. If you couldn't have guessed it, I am still a virgin at the age of 23. Most of the time, I don't really give a shit. Looking back, there are plenty of good reasons it hasn't happened yet. To be honest, I never even had a chance. Right now (well, for the past few months) is the first time in my life that I legitimately stand a chance.

But, it is bothering me now. There's a lot of talk in the thread how virginity is a big indicator of how well-adapted socially you are. It just irks me that it's taken me this long; it feels like there must be something wrong with me and that things will inevitably fail to improve.

I've convinced myself that once I do get in bed with a girl, I'm going to lie to her about my being a virgin. Obviously this depends on the circumstances, but that's what I'm going with. I like to think I'm confident enough.

I want to make my 20s my glory days, since I've so far failed to make anything great out of my high school and college years. Right now, it's not looking so great though. I get so preoccupied with finding a girl to date that I forget what's more important: Finding a job and moving out. I understand that my prospects with girls and with friends will be so much greater if I can do those two things, but I guess I get impatient. I'm scared to continue online dating because of this, but I'm kind of stuck between the two.

The fact is I'm lonely and sad, while depression and anxiety loom over me waiting to pounce as soon as I'm weak enough to let them destroy me again. I don't want to let that happen. 

I want to find a job. I want to move out of my parents' house. And I want to have decent girl prospects. That's it. Now why does that need to be so fucking difficult for me? Everyone else makes it look so easy and natural.

-----

Edit: And I'd just like to elaborate on the whole job hunting thing. It is easily the most frustrating thing I've ever had to deal with, in my entire life. It is maddening, infuriating, and every synonym of those words I can think of. I can't even tell you how many jobs I've applied for and heard nothing back from, or finally got an email 6 months later telling me I didn't make the cut. And when I do get a call back, it still leaves my chances at about 1 in 10 candidates. I have a very valuable degree and a decent GPA, with a great internship. I just don't get how people do it.

And forget reaching out to the people in the companies; unless I know someone through a friend or family member, the people are harder to find than Bin Laden. I get why they hide; it's so that they don't get bombarded with emails about jobs. Just the nature of the internet is so ridiculously counter-intuitive to entry-level job searching because there are probably bots out there that shotgun out resumes to every position that gets posted so any real application (like mine) is just lost in the mess. It seems like the only way to get a job now is through connections, which boils down to luck based on your own social circles.

And I have ideas for projects that I want to work on but lack the money to follow through with; in fact what I described in the above paragraph is something I want to do: Create or invest in a new job posting/application system that addresses the absurdly long list of issues with the current system. The room is there, someone just has to make it. I can absolutely guarantee that if it's done right, it will be a massive success and will fix a lot of the problems that new graduates currently face. But that's just me rambling."

On the surface, I probably seemed fine, but deep down I felt like I was sinking.

The hot yoga studio I have been going to on and off (mostly off) for the past couple of years started a 30 day challenge on Nov. 3rd. I decided to try it out and quit drinking for a month. I just finished yesterday! Over the past month I have lost almost 10 pounds, feel much stronger emotionally and physically than I have in years, and feel like I have sweated and stretched all of the lingering toxins out of my body.

More importantly, I came to the solid realization that I am never going to be able to re-introduce alcohol into my life. I can't drink responsibly and that's ok. I went to my first AA mtng last week and cried too much to say anything. I went again last night and didn't say a lot, but I did spend time talking with people before and after. One of the women saw me walking home and gave me a ride. I can't believe how amazing it is to talk to people about real issues, not just school and other small talk.

I know I've mentioned it on here before, but halfway into the hot yoga challenge, my boyfriend and I broke up. I had been on the fence about this relationship for almost a year, and am glad that a decision has finally been made, so we can both move on. I feel so emotionally supported by my friends, and hadn't realized how much of a real connection was missing with him in our relationship.

Finally, I found out yesterday that the aquarium where I started out as a volunteer, and am now an intern, asked if I want to be hired part-time in January. I'm in grad school, so a part-time job on the side would be perfect. It is incredibly validating to have someone tell me I am doing such a good job that they want to hire me (even though my last blackout episode was in front of aquarium staff at a halloween party).

I couldn't have made it through all of this sober without the support of this subreddit. What an amazing feeling it is to know that I genuinely prefer life without a drink. I'm looking forward to sticking with this!

Thanks everyone!

There's an intern (21f) who is messing with my libido.  At first I thought that glimpses of her bending over showing her jeans pulled tight over her ass were co-incidences but I overheard her talking to her friend and she apparently enjoys hiving her boss these little treats.  I talked it through with my wife who found the whole thing funny and I took her advice to relax and enjoy the show.

.

I'm having trouble relaxing.

.

She somehow is pushing all my buttons with every look, smile and gesture.  I spoke to her today in the tearoom and while she ""hugged her knees"" producing a tight little cameltoe.  When she saw me looking she bit her lip and smiled.  We flirt all the time and she takes every opportunity to brush past me.

.

My wife is loving it.  She knows I'm too strong willed to cheat and we don't know if this girl wants sex or is just getting off on the tease.  I came home horny as hell the other day and she greeted me with a ""poor boy are we all wound up?""  She kissed me and bit my lip playfully and I pounded her cunt to a screaming orgasm right there in the kitchen. 

.

I guess I will just need to accept my fate and endure the thoughts of taking this hot little cocktease, tearing her clothes off and fucking her with every ounce of my strength.

Just thought I would share."
2o6ef9,1,2014-12-03,"Reddit, my life has been pretty good, but I lack any sense of urgency. I usually end up letting life happen to me. Not sure if I'm depressed...",socereal05,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2o6ef9/reddit_my_life_has_been_pretty_good_but_i_lack/,"I was pretty active in my own social life until around 16, when i suffered a traumatic brain injury. I made a full recovery, but I feel like the sense of urgency in my life has been dulled. 

I'm 23 now, but earlier in my life I was very engaged in cultivating my own social life. I had this zest for approaching people, interacting with people, having parties, and just generally being a social butterfly. Human interaction was exciting and enjoyable to me. In middle school I adeptly ascended the social ladder and was considered a ""popular kid"" as we headed to high school 

However, beyond the age of 16, this capacity and zest seemed to escape me. Since 17 years old, I've basically been a spectator in my social life, allowing personal events to unfold based on other people shaping them. I feel no urgency to engage in my own social affairs. I guess its a weird entitlement or depression. Left to my own devices, the most I am willing to do is read a good book and sit around lost in my own thoughts. 

Lets say it was COMPLETELY up to me to find something to do for me and my friends, to arrange a social outing and sell it to others. I can't do this, I don't care about it, and no sense of urgency compels me to want to do it. 

At 17 I had an intimate relationship with a girl who took my virginity. I fell in love with her. Despite this, most of the action and frame of the relationship was her doing. I was just passively along for the ride. I felt no urgency to participate in the unfolding of the relationship. She dictated what we did and I was just the guy who fucked her. Obviously, she got bored and irritated of essentially stringing me along, and this fueled resentment within her. We eventually broke up. 

18-22 was a fun time. Lots of parties, sex with lots of girls, ect BUT only because my friends were so engaged in this endeavor. I honestly didn't understand my value to my friends during this time because I was essentially a social/value leech. I leeched off everyone else's urgency and participation in life. I can only say that I am above average in terms of looks. What I want to know is why the FUCK don't I have a personal sense of this urgency? Why is there no fire lit under my ass to do things for myself? 

Well, at 23, I'm now in a LTR with a friend I've known for five years. I've had sex at least once a day, but other than that, our relationship is completely set in her frame of life. We go out when she finds things to do, she invites me to her parents house, we do errands for her ect. I've been passively sitting around at her apartment for 6 months now, and if she isn't around the furthest things I engage in are browsing social media, working out, or reading a book. The friends I used to have have caught on to my social leeching and distanced themselves. They realize I bring nothing to the table, but expect to eat off their plates. I can't blame them. Where is the urgency to be a self-agent in my own life? Why do I need to wait for other people to take the initiative? Why do I feel ZERO motivation or need to do things for myself? What is this???

I wonder if there is a neurological issue from the brain injury or if im depressed because this shit just doesn't make sense to me. Is it possible that I'm just extremely fucking lazy and adjusted to being provided things without lifting a finger? My parents have paid for my life up to this point, I've worked one job when I was 15, and other than that jack shit. 

I'm more acutely concerned about this issue because I'm graduating college next semester and I haven't done anything except the coursework for my liberal arts degree. No internships, no work, absolutely nothing...and NO SENSE OF URGENCY. 

One thing I have contemplated is traveling to another country and working in an oilfield or something like that. I feel like circumstances will force me out of this bullshit. What do you guys think?

The dress code for my internship is **""smart business casual.""** I've had internships in government and in a law office in DC, so I get the gist of dressing for a business environment, but I need some advice on what is considered appropriate in London. 

I also need some advice on how to dress for **London weather**. I currently live outside of Boston, so I already have a lot of sweaters, but most of my business-appropriate clothes are appropriate for hot DC summer weather. 

I'm looking for advice and suggestions, anything you care to share! 
***
**About my body type**:

I'm 5 ft even (just over 1.5 meters), and unfortunately I'm struggling with my weight right now so i find it difficult to find pants/skirts that fit me - I have nice legs, but try to stick with thicker fabrics with looser cuts to hide my tummy :( I don't like anything too tight. 

Hopefully I will slim down before my departure January 11th, but obviously I can't count on that. I find that it is easier to fin dresses that fit me than pants or skirts appropriate for business.

***

**My Style:**

Like I said earlier, I like shirts with looser cuts, and to classes I generally wear a funky sweater over leggings with boots. I've been going for interesting casual lately because that offers more things that fit me. 

I like color but lately have been going for darker tones as I adapt my Floridian-born style to more appropriate winter clothing.

I don't think I really have a specific style - it changes as my weight fluctuates and also as time goes by. I'm always willing to adapt new pieces into my wardrobe and have some eclectic tastes, for instance I wear skulls and love studs, but I also enjoy bright pinks, pastels, gray, lace, etc. 

If I were at my ideal weight/body shape I would probably have a lot more preppy items in my wardrobe, like slacks with skinny belts and button downs, but I have to work with what I've got! 

I'm very open to suggestions in any genre of style (is that the right word? idk). I love to try new things!
***

**Some specific questions**: 

* Should I bring heels to change into once I arrive at work? I have a lot of hand-me-down, pointy-toed designer pumps from my mother - would I look pretentious wearing these or would it be fine?
* I'm currently struggling with my weight, and find it difficult to find pants and skirts that fit me. Would stretchy-type, slimmer fitting pants in appropriate fabrics be ok?
*What kind of sweaters can I wear to work? I'm unfamiliar with cold-weather business dress.
* Suggestions on types of skirts that would be good for my body type?
* looser drawstring pants tend to be easier to find in cuts that fit - will these be too thin or considered inappropriate for their pajama-ish associations?
* back to shoes - shoe advice for business appropriate winter flats? would nice (Cole Haan) riding boots be ok? 

***

Wow this post ending up being a loooot longer than I intended, but I thought I would give you guys all the information to preemptively answer any questions! Thanks for reading and I appreciate any and all feedback!

2o79ln,3,2014-12-03,I [22M] think I have Trust issues or maybe it's something else?,Striker3414,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o79ln/i_22m_think_i_have_trust_issues_or_maybe_its/,"So I [22m] think I have trust issues. I feel like I didn’t have them until the other day though. My GF [22F] mentioned she wanted to go to a party instead of hanging out with me and asked if that was ok (I think the only reason I wasn't invited was cause I have drill the next morning). I said it was fine because she has mentioned that it had been a while since she went out with her friends (she’s been stressed with school, her work, and an internship) and I know she really misses her friends. Plus I don’t want to make her choose between me and her friends (who all like me).

Anyways ever since she mentioned that I can’t get the fear out of my head that she’s going to get super drunk then flirt, grind, and make out with some other dude. I think there are 2 reasons I think I have these fears. 

Very early on (after our second date) she tried to hook up with someone. It didn’t end up happening (Because I left hickies on her). Plus I went out on a date with another girl (would not have hooked up with her though), so rationally, there really should be no reason for me to be jealous/not like that she did that. But I do for some reason (maybe because she was actually planning on hooking up and I just wanted to go out and meet new people?). That was the last time she, or I, went out with someone other than each other.
 
The second reason is because of her past. She was a Sorority sister (typical one) and it's only this year that she's not in the sorority anymore. She used to party and rage a lot during that time. And she's talked about how she hooked up with guys during that time and was always grinding on dudes and getting grinded on. She hasn’t done this since I’ve started dating her because she’s been stressed with work, school, her internship, and sometimes family. Oh and she’s started to dislike alcohol (too many blackouts/hangovers).

So how do I deal with this? I feel like these fears are not really founded on anything. I don’t want trust issues and I don’t want these to hurt our relationship.

*Edit 1* Forgot to mention that she's going to be meeting up with me the next day. She is going with me to drill because it's the Christmas party drill.

**tl;dr**: GF Is going to a party that I'm not going to. This has brought up fears that she may cheat on me. But I think these fears are unfounded. How do I deal with this?

I am not a Texas native, but I go to school very close to Houston and will be there this summer for an internship.  I know it's quite early but I've already started to noodle around to see what type of housing I can find.  I'll hopefully try to split an apartment with a friend from Houston, but I figured I would see what y'all had to suggest.  Here is what I'm looking for/my parameters.  

1.)  I will not have a car, so I will need to be somewhat close to city-center downtown, as in walking/biking/public transit distance.  My internship is with a large company located in one of the skyscrapers downtown, which is fun, but not when you don't have a car.

2.) My searches thus far have led me to the Midtown area, which I realize is not cheap, but close enough to where I'll be working that it won't be problematic.  I'm looking (hoping) to spend $500-$600/month, although I'm finding rents more like $800 for low-end Midtown apartments.

3.) I don't mind sharing an apartment with someone, and I realize I probably will have to if I can fit my budget.  I'm also looking for a 3-month lease.

Any help would be much appreciated!"

I felt like I was getting stupider and stupider the more I learned in school, despite the fact that I graduated top of my class with a dual major. In pretty much all of my classes I felt like the dumbest person there. I think I'm just good at tests. I could ace a test without studying much or really even paying attention in class, but ask me a question about any of that material the next day and I'm suddenly clueless. Coming out of college I felt like I learned next to nothing, and I'm sure it doesn't help that I have no interest in my major.

So naturally I took a job in a completely different field, thinking I might enjoy it more. As expected, it only took my feelings of incompetence and ramped them up to the next level. Now I have this feeling of anxiety any time I'm talking about work related stuff, because I have no fucking idea what I'm saying. And almost every time I make a ""decisive"" statement, I end up looking like an idiot. That's not an exaggeration. **Every time**.

On top of all of this, I cannot *stand* the 9-5 (or 8-5 in my case) grind. I can't picture doing this for the next two years (the time it will take to pay off my loans), let alone for the next fucking forty. I've worked 3 internships before this job, all in completely different fields, and I've had this exact same feeling at every one. Most nights I get home from work wondering what the most painless way to kill myself is, but then randomly I'll have a positive day where everything seems manageable. 

Going to sleep is when it hits the worst. It seems like all these feelings I try to suppress throughout the day just come pouring out the second I lay my head on the pillow, and I always end up fantasizing about my high school job. Working a *maximum* (not minimum) of forty hours a week at minimum wage in a chain restaurant. Mindless. I'm not even sure at this point if I really did enjoy working there or if I'm just romanticizing it at this point.

In the end, I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't work in jobs like this for the rest of my life--even the tought of working here for two years seems insane to me--but I don't want to disappoint my friends/family either.

Edit: Thanks to anyone that reads this; I really needed to vent. Writing it down helped me feel a little better."
2o8qx9,5,2014-12-04,I [30 F] need advice for helping my brother [32 M] to grow up,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o8qx9/i_30_f_need_advice_for_helping_my_brother_32_m_to/,"A little background: Growing up, my brother had a learning disorder - actually that's not even really certain. He didn't do well in school, but a particular learning disorder was never diagnosed. He later was told that he has an emotional disorder. My parents gave him a lot of attention and helped him with homework and I just did well in school without being prodded. He finished high school barely and went to community college - I think he spent like 7 years there. He has always been interested in art, but he never actually passed the math classes required to complete a program. And his art was never completed pieces, just obsessive doodling.

He had off and on jobs as a bus boy and at subway. My parents sent him to culinary school programs which I also don't think he completely finished. He started drinking a lot (alcoholism runs in our family). He was still living at home at age 30. My dad is kind of a jerk - it was rough living at home. I recently found out he attempted suicide at some point. He didn't have any friends really - he always had trouble making friends growing up. He is a very sensitive and emotional person. He cries a lot. He's perfectly nice and affable. Very into comic books, movies, and videogames. But definitely an outcast. He's always had a hard time being rejected - friends flaking out, etc. He has low self esteem and doesn't just pick himself up again. I, by contrast, am very successful, married, own a home, have a dog.

Anyway, a few years ago I had the bright idea that he could move to where I am living (from l.a. to san francisco) and I got him an internship at a food truck. This would get him some experience in the food industry as a cook, which would hopefully get him a job. I didn't realize he would stay here. I think me helping him has actually helped his self confidence a lot. He's taken the initiative to find jobs on his own, built a network out here with food truck people, made some friends. But there are still some milestones he hasn't made. He is basically at a 32 year old who is developmentally at the age of a normal 18 year old. 

He needs to find a new place to live. He currently only pays $600 a month for a room in a house with a crazy lady. She is moving in her elderly mother and kicking him out. I've been sending him craigslist listings and hope that he is also looking on his own, but I have no idea. He has no credit history. No credit. He also got fired from his job and needs to find a new job. He works part-time for food trucks, but nothing incredibly steady.

I guess the advice I need is... how much should I be helping him? I've been trying to be there for him more emotionally, telling him he can come over and hang out whenever he wants. I send him Craigslist links and job links. I'm trying not to be too judgy as I have in the past. I think my mom assumes that I'll let him move in with me and my husband at the end of the month when he doesn't find anything. But I feel like if he hasn't found anything (and I think he's willing to settle for ANYTHING) after 2 months, was he really trying? What do I do? Should I tell him to get an SRO? He saves absolutely nothing and spends every cent... probably a lot on alcohol. My mom paid his latest rent payment. I suggested he go to therapy for his self esteem problems and he made an appointment which he bailed on because he got a work gig. Should I get him a life coach? How do you explain to someone how to be a grown up? Even things like getting a storage unit, I have to help him with. He can't drive, he never learned. My mom asks me to do things for him like get a bus pass. She, admittedly, babied him way too much. When he arrived in SF she thought I should show him physically how to take the bus. She didn't have confidence in him or empower him, which was definitely part of the problem. He has no hustle. All the hustle is done by myself and my mom for him.

I'm afraid if I let him move in for a month that he would never leave. And San Francisco is literally the WORST place for him to be since he makes minimum wage. But he has friends and family and some jobs here which is more than l.a.

I'm sure there is way too much context to explain here. And I'm not sure what I'm asking. I feel like I should go to a therapist so I can deal with other people's problems. He's coming over tomorrow and we are going to help him prioritize the things he needs to do. I guess I'm wondering if there is some miracle program he can go to that teaches him how to be an adult and be independent? Also how do you build up a credit score from nothing at this point? And any leads on a super cheap room to rent in the bay area?

2o8umg,9,2014-12-04,I just want some validation that I'm not an unlovable freak,RugglesIV,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2o8umg/i_just_want_some_validation_that_im_not_an/,"I always cringe in the morning when I look back on a rant I posted in my sadness late at night, but it feels really good to write it out and post it in the moment, so here goes.

I'm a month away from being 21. I never dated anyone in high school, never went on a single date, nor in the first two years of college. This summer, a girl at the place I work and I started getting close, and she started coming on to me, and I realized I liked her too, and I told her such and she reciprocated. Yay, happy. We have a few weeks of being like this, spending time together, watching Lost, cuddling. At one point we were doing a job together, making some electrical repairs, apart from the other interns, and I jokingly asked if this was a date. I realize it doesn't have to be, but she rejected the idea that it was a date so forcefully, even though she was laughing the whole time. I was kinda hurt by it. What's so bad about being on a date with me?

Then she asked if I had ever been on a date, although she knew I had never had a girlfriend. I said no, and she expressed some shock. Gee, thanks for that too.

Fast forward to after summer, and she wants to see me but won't date me. Won't be my girlfriend. We live about three hours away from each other, and we had a few visits. I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said she didn't feel like we clicked yet. She wasn't yet totally comfortable around me. Well what the fuck? You were coming on to me all summer. We've had 6+ hour skype sessions. We went to get dinner, and I paid for it, and I still don't fucking know if I can call it a date because of your little hangups about this stuff.

Another weekend we were spending together, I asked her late at night as we were cuddling on the couch after watching a movie what was holding her back. Why didn't she want to pull the trigger and just be boyfriend and girlfriend. She gave three reasons, the last of which was that she didn't feel comfortable closing the door on her ex, who she had dated for two years and broke up with during the summer, AFTER she had started coming on to me, and after like over a year of trouble in their relationship, which among other things included him pressuring her to get married. Furthermore, one of her other reasons she gave me was that she wasn't sure we would work out as a married couple. Your last boyfriend was pressuring you into that! And now you won't even DATE me because you don't think we could get married? And as I learned later, from another mutual friend who worked with us over the summer, you're determined not to get married until you're 25 anyway? WHAT THE FUCK?

I should have broken it off right there, but I didn't, and then the following night she told me she couldn't date me, whereas up until that point she had just been putting off the question. I said okay, good luck, hope you work out all the stuff you've been telling me about, about how confused you are about your life, about how you don't know what to do, about how confused you are about me, all of which kinda hurt me because like hey here I am and I wanna be your boyfriend, and you profess to like me so what are you confused about and why aren't I good enough? Why did you date this other guy for 2 years, even when you were fed up with him for over a year of that time, but you won't even start with me? What's so wrong with me that you won't date me?

So she left and I proceeded to have a really shitty week. Then, the next weekend, she showed up unannounced at my apartment--a two hour drive, and told me that the last week she had was the worst of her life. She had tried to follow other people's advice and cut me out of her life until she could figure it out, but said that just made it worse. So she comes back, we talk all night, she leaves in the morning after getting all flirty again.

I visit her again some weeks later, ask her where we stand, tell her where I want to be standing (dating). She still won't do it. I say I want to just admit to it, stop beating around the bush. What we're doing wouldn't really change even, I'd go visit her, she'd go visit me, but we'd be able to just say that we're dating. I could tell my parents about her, she could do the same. This time her reason for not dating is that there would be more ""pressure"" on us when we got together. I said something to the effect of ""come on, this isn't engagement"" but didn't get anywhere.

That was the last I saw her in person, a few weeks ago. Tonight she said she had something to tell me, so I called her and she said she was some sort of talk on mental health (she's a nursing student) and was talking about an example from her own life, and started talking about the night she showed up at my apartment unannounced. She thanked me for being a ""great friend"" when she hasn't been a good one. She said she hasn't always been a good friend, but didn't apologize for anything. I just said thank you, that's very kind of you, and we chatted a bit... But I was sort of taken aback, mostly just thinking...

What the fuck?

What the FUCK?

What is this? You just tell me out of the blue, after a few weeks of texting each other far less than we used to (ever since last seeing her) that I'm a great friend? After a text a week or so ago saying you knew I wanted answers and you were sorry you couldn't give any? Was this some way for you to say in a sort of emotionally stunted way that you had thought more about it and still didn't want to date me? Were you just rubbing in my pain? I haven't told you yet how much I've been hurt because of you, partly because you've been trying to be so cautious because you said you didn't want to hurt me. Well, that didn't work. You weren't very cautious either. So, a while after hanging up, cue a new bout of weeping over emotional strain from me, and this post.

I'm just so fucking sick of this. I'll see her next in a month and I don't know if I should just spill out how much she hurt me. I'm sick to fucking death of being almost 21 years old and for all my life either never having had the balls to tell a girl I liked her or have a girl not want to pull the trigger and validate that I'm a person worthy of dating. I'm sick of my friends who I complain to telling me that I'm one of the greatest guys they've ever met when none of it means anything or pans out to be anything I actually want.

Also I have this hypertrophic scar under my left eye which is like this big weird red bump that I've had since like, middle school and I think it's profoundly screwed with my self-image and sense of self-worth, because I feel like a deformed freak. So that doesn't help. Sometimes people say they can't even see it, and it is pretty faded, but sometimes it's not as faded and I can always see it really well in the mirror because I know it's there.

I just want to be validated. I want to know that someone who I want to date also wants to date me, without me getting dragged through the mud for 4 months.

I know this seems like just another ""boo hoo I'm a nice guy and girls won't date me"" post, and maybe it is. But it really fucking sucks. And she started coming on to me before I said anything, which makes me all the more frustrated with how it turned out. She's not the only girl to have shown interest in me, so I know I'm not totally repulsive to women, but this whole ordeal has just been wrenching on me and I'm so sick of it all.

Well, this post got really long. Thanks if you actually read the whole wall of text, but I can't expect you to."

So many lovely ways you guys have made it go, and given me so many orgasms. Thank you, all you handsome people out there! 

Here's the prompt:

First female president of the United States. Should be a strong woman, right? Well yeah, but the office has its way of wearing you down, and that's where you come in. Over the last four years you've risen from the ranks of an intern to being in charge of my re-election campaign and my image. You've essentially filled up all vital positions around me with your friends.

At this point, when you've made me dependent on your and isolated me from previous political allies, you decide to set your plan in motion. Slowly but steadily, you'll turn the president into your very own fucktoy and puppet. Bimbofied and slutty.

That's the general idea anyway. You may add your own wishes or change the story completely. I'm really into being humiliated by younger men. Bimbofication and hatefucking are other fantasies of mine.

If interested, feel free to send me a PM and we'll work out the details!

Kisses! &lt;3

2o9spb,20,2014-12-04,Girlfriend going on month long trip,[deleted],TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2o9spb/girlfriend_going_on_month_long_trip/,"I am currently in a month long LTR with a girl who is a foreign exchange student and everything is going pretty well.

However, winter break is approaching and she will be going back home to Nanjing, China to visit her parents and also work as an intern for a company.

Most of her friends back at home (both guys and girls) spend much of their socializing and hanging out at night clubs. From the stories she's told me from the past, she is relatively high status in the scene. She is friends with the DJs, club managers etc. and often gets hooked up with free drinks and such.

My main concern is that as a very attractive girl (8-9/10), she will get hit on ALOT. I've witnessed this before when we've gone to clubs together and has been the cause of a few disputes mainly due to me being too drunk to hold frame and not be butthurt about it. Since then, I've recovered frame. She tells guys she has a boyfriend but I know somewhere deep down, she secretly enjoys the attention and validation she receives as AWALT.

I also know she is respectful of my opinion as she's asked me to help her decide the dates she leaves and comes back. She's also expressed to me that she doesn't want me talking to any other girls while she's gone and asked me if there was anything in particular I didn't want her doing in China. She also wants to make sure we Skype often while she's gone.

I don't to be controlling but I feel as I should lay down some boundaries even though whether or not she respects them is ultimately her decision. But I know already she'll tell me she goes to have fun and hang with her friends, which is only half true.
But by expressing my concerns, I don't want to come across as needy or insecure.

Thoughts?





What should I do in a situation like this?"
2oagov,4,2014-12-04,LPT: Help with a wrongfully issued ticket,LobsterLAD,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2oagov/lpt_help_with_a_wrongfully_issued_ticket/,"I have a question for you knowledgable people.  Today while driving to my internship I was ticketed for going 73 in a 55.  However, my car has digital cruise and I had it set to 62 mph.  A vehicle behind me began to tailgate me, I merged into the right lane to allow him to pass (he was going 73 my guess) I then merged back into the left lane.  Shortly thereafter (5 seconds) the vehicle I allowed to pass me abruptly hit their brakes, slowing to 55 as did I thinking something had happened.  I then saw the cop sitting on the shoulder (no radar in hand) about 50 yards from me.  He then pulled out as I saw in my mirror I moved over to allow a lane to the gold vehicle that had passed me thinking he was going to get him, instead he ticketed me for that vehicle. I never went over 62 mph and he wouldn't hear me out, so I am obviously pleading not guilty and going to court.

Now is where I need some advice.

I have never been pulled over before, it has been 5 years since I got my license so I did not want to be rude to the officer so I just accepted the ticket and went on my aggravated way.  My cousin is a police officer in the town where I live about 10 minutes away, when I go to court would it be advised to bring him as some sort of leverage?  

Also, when contesting the ticket and I make my statement should I explain what had happened?  I don't want to come off as argumentative or like I accusing the officer of lying, that won't get me anywhere quick I assume.  Now I know I was technically speeding, but it was 11mph off from my actual speed.

Any advice or tips on what I should do?

**CHARACTER R**

**Name:** Roth Nikola

**Age:**  17,  25th day, 4th month

**Gender:** M

**Symbol:** A red Snoo antenna **see appearance*

**Occupation:** Intern (former), Student

**Appearance:** [Art Courtesy of UnknownChaser]( http://i.imgur.com/yf9gHdX.png)  He is albino

**History:** Roth was born far from the urbanized Atlas center, living in the most rural of regions.  These regions, due to religious fervor and risk of Grimm, made sure to have aura unlocked at an early age.  Relatively quickly it became apparent that his semblance allowed some odd occurrences.  Lights and other electrical devices would sometimes remain on throughout his home, even when unplugged, batteries removed, and the breakers flipped.  [St. Elmo’s light]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire) became prevalent throughout the region at times.  Between this and his unusual appearance, he garnered special reputation in his home town.  An older gentleman, a huntsman past his prime, took interest in him.  He recognized the boy’s ability, seeing potential in his odd side effects.  The man had many old friends within the world of weapon smithing, including members of the Schnee Dust Company and the Atlas military.  Finding an employee willing to take the strange pale boy, Roth found himself in the company of an eccentric man working in the Knight project.  Roth had a natural talent for understanding the workings of a mind, playing with small test bots the employee occasionally brought home.  During the day, he began frequenting the local plaza to people watch.  With his interest in robotics and powering semblance, he designed a pair of droids who would become his weapons.  The bots allowed him to control the rampant energy he gave off when using his semblance, channeling it into a useful form.  He likewise designed a lightweight exoskeleton and eyewear to make up for his frail frame and bad eyesight.  These were hooked into his body, powered by his semblance and excess heat.  Many people would call him a friend, his understanding of people making him likable to just about everyone.  As well as he got to know all of them, however, few really knew what the quiet but smooth talking boy thought.  His sudden decision to enter Beacon Academy surprised those who thought he would dedicate his life to science.  With a golden mind and a silver tongue, he easily wormed his way into combat school.  With his weapons a testament to his abilities, he entered Beacon Academy with everyone wondering what Roth intended.  Little did they know the sudden action occurred due to the source of the droids AI – stolen SDC software and hardware.  For now, he’s escaped his caretaker by moving to Vale as a huntsman, but the droids still bear the marks of their SDC origins.

**Personality:** Roth could be called quiet – he certainly wasn’t someone who ran his mouth unnecessarily.  He’d crack a joke or pull a prank every now and then.  He’d make the most cold people blush with his flattery and could cut someone with his wit should they try to get smart with him.  However, he was by far most animated with his weapons, the two AI of his making.  Whether it is upgrading their software, firmware, or hardware, these are the things that take much of his interest.  He’s very private about their function, however, to avoid suspicion of their origins as military tech and his past in Atlas.  It is as though everything else is but a game he plays to stave off any boredom, a cover to blend in.

**Strength:**  His weapons pack a lot of firepower with a lot of versatility.  The exoskeleton and eyewear also possess rudimentary software with a variety of abilities, such as enhanced sight and buffs for reflexes, strength, and flawless hand-eye coordination.  He is undoubtedly a smart guy, especially when it comes to knowing how people think.  He can serve as an emergency generator if necessary.

**Weakness:** He relies on his machines to supplement his less than perfect physical ability.  Removal or destruction of these would severely cripple his abilities.  An EMP would likely ruin the electrical systems and possibly kill the AI of his weapons, which manage the complicated systems and computations necessary to operate all of his technology.

**Semblance:** Production of electric energy.  The electrical power isn’t quite under his control, but radiates from him.  It produces palpable effects – hair standing on end, static discharge, and electrical devices turning on without power.  In extreme states, it can even produce St. Elmo’s fire along items and ball lightning.

**WEAPON**

**Name:** Sta Je Novo and Sta Ima Novo

**Primary Form:** When condensed, they form a pair of large cube, roughly 6 cubic inches.  Twelve legs are arranged into a square side (just imagine a circle cut into twelve equal sections and a square cut out with one at each corner).  Each leg has screen on the outer side, allowing it to display anything, though the default is the form of a Professor’s Cube (5x5 rubik’s cube).  This can be played either through touch screen or hand motions.  Eyes are on the corner legs, in the largest part (the middle of the corner square on the professor’s cube).  

**Secondary Form:** They can take another form, expanding to roughly sixteen times their condensed size.  Within these sits a spherical core, housing the computer elements of the Novos.  They can be powered by the excess energy from Roth’s semblance, a resource of electric dust, or batteries recharged through his semblance.  They possess rudimentary AIs that are rambunctious and mischievous (being prototypes of the AK-220).  Two ports run through it, forming a circular tube with a spherical cavity hollowed out in the center.  Each port extends out toward one of the sides, segmented into eight equal arcs. The corner legs on the base fold out on limbs reminiscent of Spiderman’s Doc Ock to allow walking, possessing enough strength to carry a sitting Roth.  The smaller legs possess limbs like the eye, able of picking stuff up with enough dexterity to, ironically, solve a Rubik’s Cube.

**Tertiary Form:** The ports on the core allow Roth’s arm to go through.  Four of the arcs on the ports extend inward to form a tight hold on the arm.  The bottom of one Novo (let’s say Je or “Jay”) is on his outer forearm.  The legs on the sides connected bottom edge fold out to extend into a spiked shield.  The spare legs on the sides now facing upward and downward fold out into a slanting plane against the back of the shield.  The remaining ones from the sides Roth’s arm is through extend into a kind of armored sleeve over his elbow and hand.  Use of his semblance can cause the appearance of St. Elmo’s fire (plasma) along the tips of the legs, marking the potential for electric shield bashes.  The other Novo (let’s say Ima) has only the sides with arms through them change.  The side on his upper arm forms an armored sleeve like that on Je, though this one is all around instead of just one side.  The side on the hand has the smaller legs pull back to let the hand through.  The corner legs extend to about eight times their length and join into a blade of about four and half feet in length.  Roth holds this at the connecting limbs, giving him a sword.  Like the shield, St. Elmo’s fire forms at the tip when his semblance allows for electric abilities.

**Quaternary:** With his hands within the core, the same sleeve mentioned in the sword design is formed over his elbow.  The legs main legs of the opposite face go to the outer part of his body, the inner and forward leg of the top spinning out to become opposable.  This creates a five fingered claw that shares all the dexterity of his hands but far greater strength.  They mirror the movements of his hands within the core’s cavity.

**Quinary:**  With his hands within the core, the same sleeve mentioned in the sword design is formed over his elbow.  The opposite face has the legs pull back to leave the opposite port bare.  Through use of semblance, the air within the cores is ionized into plasma.  Magnetic manipulation from the Novos fires it out (like a railgun) to form a plasma cannon.  If the legs form a funnel, a concentrated beam like that seen in the spiderdroid can be used.  Similarly, if the corner legs split the opening into four, it creates a kind of scatter shot.  This is a draining use for both the Novos internal power supply and Roth, making it a last resort/badass mode thing.

**History:** Je and Ima were mostly made by Roth.  Some elements of their design were given as assistance by his caretaker.  However, the bulk of their sophistication comes from tech that Roth stole from the Atlesian Military division of the SDC, specifically the Atlesian Knights program.  This includes the prototype AI that he’s altered for their personalities.  Their completion marked the end of Roth’s days in Atlas as he fled to Vale and joined Beacon Academy to escape his caretaker and military investigation.

**Fighting Style:**  I imagine each form having it’s uses.  When he wants to keep some distance between him and his opponent, especially if there’s more than one, I think the plasma cannons come into play.  The scattershot softens up a group nicely, while the full blast brings a bit of “shock and awe.”  Should he need to be a bit more tactical or defensive, the sword and shield comes into play.  However, the hands also give quite a bit of brutal power as well.  They allow him to literally jump in and rip Grimm apart or beat opponents into a bloody mess.

**Trivia:**  Roth means red in old German.  Nikola comes from Nikola Tesla, and means “victory of the people.”  Sta Ima Novo and Sta Je Novo come from Serbian, both (according to Google Translate) mean “What’s new?” which was the former motto of Reddit and the source of Snoo (‘S new?).  Why Serbian?  Nikola Tesla was Serbian.  He and reddit’s technomancer themes led me to the semblance and capabilities of Roth because of Tesla’s research into wireless power transmission and a death – excuse me, [“peace ray”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla#Directed-energy_weapon).

2ob7lu,4,2014-12-04,"[help] my friend is in an evangelical cult, whose methods are an eerie reminder of the LDS church. (warning: long)",CharlieBravo92,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2ob7lu/help_my_friend_is_in_an_evangelical_cult_whose/,"Hey guys.  I guess I'll start with some background.  I like to call myself a [post-evangelical Christian.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-evangelicalism)

Anyway, I had this roomate at my last apartment.  Nicest guy you'll ever meet, we'll call him Larry.  Larry was a cut-and-dry evangelical, to the core.  No swearing, no drinking, no smoking, no dating (he preferred ""courtship"") nothing.  All his friends were just like him, it was almost cute.

I, on the other hand, try to take a more reasonable approach when it comes to morality (see the article I linked above.)  So yeah, I drank, I smoked, I had my girlfriend over from time to time.  I also brought over some shady friends.

Despite our differences, he was a really reasonable guy, and one of the best roomates I ever had.

That all changed when his fiancee dumped him.  She had been his ""courtship"" since age 14, and he did NOT take the breakup well.  I can't blame him.  After spending a couple weeks completely depressed, he eventually started praying constantly, to ""discern God's plan for my life since I clearly didn't know it.""  Fair enough I guess.  Makes him feel better.

Then it got *weird.*

Over the next few months, he started ""hearing back from God in prayer.""  These revalations of his would lead him to do some crazy things.  He quit his job and started an unpaid internship in a completely different field, saying ""God will provide.""  He went broke.

Then, he felt ""called"" by God to be a music/worship pastor.  The problem was HE CAN'T SING.  Myself and the other roomates are musicians, and none of us had the heart to tell him he sucked.

Eventually, he realized it was God's ""plan"" for him to go to this new Bible college.  It was just founded this year by a church in Sandpoint, Idaho (we're from Coeur d'Alene.)  Kinda off in the woods, beautiful campus, whatever.  They would be studying work by lots of theologians and philosophers.  

I actually supported this decision.  Maybe being exposed to some theological debate would make him realize that he can't trust his gut feelings all the time, and that there's a lot more to any religion than just following the good feelings you call the spirit.  It would keep him away from his ex, and generally just give him a new start.

...Until he made his first facebook post.

This college, which boasts a grand total of EIGHT students, is in the middle of NOWHERE.  The schedule is insane, with classes, prayer, and chapel from dawn to dusk.  Worst of all, it's outside of cell phone coverage and has no internet.

Larry can only post on facebook once a week, when a college-owned van drives them down into Sandpoint for a short visit to a local church, where they get about an hour.

*okay,* I thought.  *A bit more intense than any education I'd ever want, but whatever.* 

Until my other roomates hung out with him this thanksgiving break.

**He is convinced that he was not a ""real"" Christian before attending this college.**  Last I checked, that **IS** the definition of a cult.  You're either one of them, or you're on the road to hell.  He backs it up with talking about how his ""heart wasn't in the right place"" before attending this college, blah blah blah.

Here's the deal.  I love this guy.  I don't want him to be there.  I don't care if he's an evangelical or a muslim or an atheist.  He's one of my best friends.

I KNOW there's NO POSSIBLE WAY I can change his mind about this college's theology.  But maybe, just maybe, I can show him how this school is a cult?

So that's my question to you, the kind, supportive people of r/exmormon.  Without arguing theology/history, what methods have you guys found to expose the manipulation and [spiritual abuse] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_abuse#Spiritual_abuse) of TSCC?  Think those methods could carry over for my friend?"

For a quick over view of my life to help my later question I'll bullet point the major moments in my life:

- 2 years old: parents divorce(big whoop it happens)

- Father keeps asking for less and less time with my brother and I

- Father rejects brother for orientation

- Father remarried and moves away

- Go out to see father(15 years old)
---Father sends me home after finding out I kissed the native american boy down the street that at the time I had a huge crush on. He was mad he was ""not white"" and labeled me a whore/slut/worthless POS and never talked to me again(even on his cancer ridden death bed)

DIGRESSING 

In the same time frame

- Mother is dating around, marries when i was 7

- Makes me feel like any mistake I make is a horrible disappointment(I hate the ""D"" word). Also enjoys calling me fat, and trying to force me to be girly(I was a tom boy and actually deemed underweight by doctors while she was 200+ lbs)

- Years later find out shes hoe-ing on the side, accidentally out her even though I was really trying to not be involved.

Graduate and move out, She tried to force herself into my life and loves taking credit for my accomplishments.

I get a great internship all by myself = she e-mailed some people for her amazing daughter and got me a job because she loves me so much

I'm leaving out the fun stories and I'm sure my brother would vouch for her crazy sundae with extra nuts but all of that fun information brings me to this.

I am pregnant and I'm terrified I'm going to ruin this kids life because my parents did a number on me and I'm really screwed up in the head. On top of the fact that in order to feel comfortable with my parents around my baby I would HAVE to be there 100% of the time because I'm afraid what she would do/say/etc. Am I crazy?!"

   I write to you all today in hopes that those of you starting out will stay with it. Those of you who have been here for years will encourage the new guy/girl. I'm not a special scenario, I'm just a guy who found his second family. The hardest part is just stepping through the door. I don't want to come off as an attention whore, I wasn't even going to post but I have a question and this seemed like a fitting backstory.

   Long story semi-short, I was in an extremely low point in my life. To make things worse I decided to weigh myself at the beginning of July 2012. 285.7, there it was. I know some people start at a box heavier, some lighter, I now know its just a number, but then it wasn't. I hated myself. Depression is a profound monster and it was winning. My note was written, I was ready to check out. My birthday was July 11 and I figured I'd have one last hoorah that week with my family. As the week progressed something hit me, I had to try one last thing. A friend of mine had been hounding me about this thing called crossfit and told the owner I worked on a farm. He told me to swing in and talk about trading a weekly basket for my membership. I figured I'd finally look into one last change before I told the world to take it easy. 

   Day 1, July12 2012: Its as vivid as ever because I knew it was for me. 21-15-9 Wallball, push up, sit up, pull up. I was hooked. I was challenged. It was something I felt I could progress well in. It validating my job as a farmer in that an athlete wanted my product. Everyone was positive and inviting. I was the last to finish and everyone cheered me on. WHO CHEERS FOR THE PERSON IN LAST PLACE?! Crossfitters fucking do, thats who.

   As time went on I grew close to so many. I loved who I was becoming. Coach saw my work truck littered with soda bottles and flipped out. I cut out soda, from 2L a day to cold turkey and went through what felt like withdrawl. Fucking poison. Now my nutrition was another focus. I felt I was getting stronger, endurance was my slowest progress but after a year my mile time went from 12min to 8! I now sit at around 6:45. Snatch 155, C&amp;J 185, Hit a 395 DL in August. I began shadowing my coach in July of this year, and even ran my own classes (with him there) in August/September. I had people looking to ME for assistance, coaching, advice. ME! I would have never fathomed that 2 years prior. I owe who I am to my coach. Coach E, you saved my life.

   I love who I am with CrossFit. I love my energy on a daily basis. This post is so scattered in thought because I want to give so much detail but no one has time to read it all. 

   So, Beginning of October I moved to SW Portland Oregon. Until I move up in my career (probably between March-June) I really can't afford going to a box. I've tried to find it in my budget and it's just not there right now. I feel confident in my knowledge of form and function, but I don't have my L1 cert yet. As an earlier post on r/crossfit stated, there can be animosity of coaches with out L1. I feel foolish entertaining the idea of applying for coaching positions without it. I was allowed to at my old box because my coach knew my ability with people and crossfit principles. Do boxes ever do internships in exchange for membership? For those of you on here who coach, do I even have options other than Crunch Fitness for $10/month? 

   I apologize for the long and scrambled post. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I was hoping someone in this great subreddit would know something about getting a work visa for an internship as a non-EU citizen. 

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student from Toronto and recently I was offered a 4 month internship from Google Zurich, but part of the requirements is that I need a letter from my University stating that the internship is mandatory to my degree. Problem is that my program is just a CS major and internships are not required at all; I doubt I'll be able to secure such a letter. My google searches has only turned up one link in a forum that said that the letter is 100% a must, yet someone also said that it is not always required.

Does anyone know anything about how the student work visas work for non-EU students? 

Thanks for your time."

I am currently a broke college student and I do own some nice polo button ups and just nicer button ups, but definitely if I'm going to be buying something will need it to be fairly cheap. I am working over the winter and if they like me I will be working again in the summer so I am hoping to make a good impression to make them want me back, with that being said I feel like the first thing I should do is get clothing that makes me look professional and sharp and well kept. I am a wider guy and a little stocky not fat, I'm 6 foot and a 180 pounds, just an average build but I do have wide shoulders and a wider stance of that makes a difference. Any outfit and clothing advice would be greatly appreciated. Also any advice on hair styles would be great too, I look young and goofy with short hair and am trying to grow it out and find a classy nice look or something of that sort (not fashion model fake look or excessively flamboyant look) if not that I was thinking about trying out the shaved sides and longer top trend that's going around, either way any advice on hair styles would be great too!

2ocbcq,2,2014-12-05,Depression,XtremeGuy5,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2ocbcq/depression/,"I quit smoking for a month at the end of this summer. At the end of my month-long break, I began exhibiting symptoms of depression. I became very sad, irritable, and everything seemed to become dark. There were times where I felt lost and would cry myself to sleep. I'm beginning to start thinking about quitting for good (or at least getting myself off any kind of schedule). I smoked every day last year; my grades suffered and my memory did as well. This year, I've taken major steps to reduce my smoking. I now only smoke on the weekend, and the quality of my schoolwork has increased quite a bit in comparison to last year, despite the classes I'm in being much more difficult. However, I smoked every night last week, and have decided not to smoke for the next couple weeks to help myself focus on finals. I fear that I may become depressed  in the couple of weeks to come much like I did this summer. My question for you all is: is it possible to help combat these symptoms if they arise? What can I do to remain happy, focused, and free of depression-like symptoms? My hope is that my maturity and reduced amount of smoking  will allow me to quit for the next couple weeks without symptoms, but I want to know what to do in case the symptoms do arise. I plan on quitting (at least until the end of summer) at the end of my winter break, to allow me to apply for internships. But right now, I'm focused on the couple weeks ahead. "

So I found this sub-reddit about 6 months ago and made the switch, but  I made what I guess you could call a soft switch, I am doing my internship at the moment and didn't really have the money to buy a really nice DE Razor, so I bought myself an el-cheapo Razor for like $1 and have been using that for the past 6 months.

I have managed to save a bit of cash and what I think I can afford now (I can't really, but it's time) is [This](http://www.mantality.co.za/doubleedge-razor-chasing.html). that works out to roughly $60-$70 after conversion. 

I would love any input you guys may have as to whether or not its worth the money as this would be a pretty massive investment for me right now.

      I have a bit of a complex situation currently I live with my wife and 2 dogs in a rented house and have a somewhat large debt. The problems I am having is currently she is a student and only able to work part time for minimum wage (Internship).

I was changed to an independent contractor 2 years ago and my pay was increased slightly to compensate for that however we also moved to another state and have needed the extra money each month for cost of living.

As it stands the money I make each month barely covers bills, food + credit card payments with $50 or so each each month for R&amp;R expenditure.

currently no mortgage but leese a car, have about $18,000 in credit card debt and currently ($10,000 owed to IRS although that will increase to $20,000 next year).

as we are currently just covering the bills my thinking is that when my wife finished her current masters and gets her license she should be able to start working full time and a low end starting salary for her industry is $40,000 or so. This will more than double our current monthly income and I was thinking due to the tight belt at the moment we should plan for using her salary to A) Pay my owed back taxes and B) start an avalanche plan on our credit cards followed by her student loans...

Is this a good plan? I am planning on reading through each section here to get specific information on each aspect of my financial situation to improve it but I can only work within my current scope of income right?"
2odudf,14,2014-12-05,"Me [22 M] with my (ex?)girlfriend [22 F] of 1 Month, is contemplating suicide things are ""too hard without me""",Mrsheeples1992,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2odudf/me_22_m_with_my_exgirlfriend_22_f_of_1_month_is/,"I don't know what to do. Here's the entire story, we met online and things went great we had awesome chemistry, but before all this I found out she was pregnant with her ex-husbands child of about 4 months (their entire relationship lasted like 6 months or so). For whatever reason I didn't think this one through, but I enjoyed my time with her soooo much and it was nice to have her around.

Then I learn she has a lot of problems and the worst part is that I literally have no idea how to handle these problems since my life isn't really put together that well to help someone with these sorts of problems. For example, I don't want to share the specifics of her story but they involve many abusive exes, sexual abuse, and basically torture. 

I try and help but I guess maybe now I'm guilted into staying with her and I do care for her and she's spent the night ever since our first date for an entire month. She's very clingy and would guilt me into her staying over the first few nights till it was a regular thing. She put a lot of effort into the relationship at first, then things just get harder and tougher and she's even more pregnant and mood swings, and just entirely too much for me to handle. I did not know what I signed up for.

That comes to last night, she could tell something was up with me lately, I told her I've been having nightmares, I've been having really low lows and high highs (I legitimately might be bipolar, but its the kind where your mood mostly hits lows for a few weeks sorta thing and then highs and such, it's actually more common and my mom has it). Anyways, because of this and generally my life isn't that put together either, I tell her that I need time to think things over and see if I'm even capable of adding someone to my life granted hers especially since she has so many special needs and is pregnant and divorcing her ex, and clearly it's a lot for one person to go through even one of those problems I mentioned before.

Now she breaks down and we talk and I tell her things I didn't even know about myself and why I am the way I am and such, and she's in tears as am I, I care about her, but I literally don't think I can deal with this. I'll take this time to think and we pack her things to get to her place (I didn't just kick her out she had to go back to her place because of other reasons). She's miserable and upset, I got back to my place thinking that I can figure things out and think, clean up a few more of her things I find, and then she calls saying her place is freezing and she needs one of her heaters she brought that she forgot. I bring all her stuff back over and then asks me to come in and she breaks down yet again. Saying things like I can't do this I need you, why is this happening, and I can't think a thing, I've already emotionally shut down and just need to figure things out for a bit and I tell her that I haven't decided what to do (and I haven't). 

She begs and pleads with me for me to take her to spend one more night with her (I'm actually really nervous to now, because she is clearly unstable) and after me saying ""I can't""/""we shouldn't"" we do. because she said she couldn't be alone in her apartment (idk where her roommates were and they really were not there). 

We go to my place and I try and sleep best I can and I'm not trying to say anything and just think but I can't all I can think is how much I hurt her, how she isn't sleeping, and is having panic attacks due to her PTSD from other events in her life.

I take her home the this morning head to work and I get a call from her 2 hours in, and she's talking about how she really can't do this, life just never gets better, I need you, I can't go on without you. I plead with her to not do anything, do not self harm or do anything worse. She doesn't give me a clear answer and says I won't make any promises I can't keep. It goes on about the same conversation ending with me being unclear still and I need time to think (still haven't gotten it). Said if I don't hear from you I'll be concerned. 

Anyways long story short she seems very unstable and has already had a tendency to hurt herself, and I'm concerned if I decide I can't handle this (and it's a lot guys it really is) I think she will attempt suicide. I'm honestly leaning on cutting this out of my life because I've never been more stressed in my life, and I'm doing my internship right now and then my last semester in Januarary and graduating in April and I'll be starting my life and she wants me to commit to her completely (after just one month, in fact I remember a conversation along the lines of she'd do anything for me a few times and she meant it. Also a conversation of she wanting to get engaged and I it's a ""amount of time thing for most people, but it's about just how much you love someone, I know I shouldn't have said that, and I know that you need time etc etc"") 

I realize I got myself in deep here, but I just don't think I can handle this and don't know how and I don't know what I want. **What do I do!?**
---   
**tl;dr**: Girl I date for a month has a lot of issues, clings to me. I tell her I'm having trouble with my issues + being able to have a relationship with someone with her amount of issues (I was delicate) and tell her I need to think on it. She calls me this morning reallllly sounding like she was pondering to attempt suicide (she's been through a lot)."

The people who gets Bitcoin, gets very exited and starts to talk with as many people as possible to promote it. 

Some just do not get it, and they drop out. 

""The Bitcoin light bulp"" moment for me, is when those skeptics or pessimists come back to you, some even months after you spoke to them, and says ""Listen, I am sorry, I just got it, and it's amazing!"" 

At work, I explained it to a group of interns a few months ago. They worked for minimum wages and I wanted to boost their income. 

Today one of them came to me and said, ""Damn.. I get it now"" 

It's just a great feeling and you get to smile, when people bash you down, and then come back to you, asking for more info on the ""Bitcoin thing""   "

**My short bio:**

I graduated as an Engineer and, while doing my masters at my university, I did two internships at Google Mountain View. One as a Network Engineering Intern and one as an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) Intern. Note that most interns at Google are SWE (SoftWare Engineers) interns, so maybe I have some answers that are not usually found on sites about Google Interns. I visited several US Google offices and one in EMEA and I know A LOT of Googlers.

I was also a Google Student Ambassador for my University. So I was a point person for people that had questions about what interning at Google was.

The reason why I am stating this is to hopefully answer some questions from people that want to intern at Google and to clear out some misconceptions (the immediate reason was that today I saw an article about jobs at Google that promoted an incorrect image). Also it's my first AMA (hope I do it right :P).

To start off, I knew going into our relationship  (whether it be friends or more than friends) that she was going to eventually leave to go back home to finish school. She's currently on an internship that ends soon.

We started hanging out in groups, then groups quickly became just the two of us. Movies, dinner at my place, going out to eat, tv night at my place .. the whole shabang. In a given week we spend 3-4 nights together. During dinner one night without me even bringing anything up she said she sees me as a friend, and that she won't date anyone at work.  Here's where it gets a little confusing. 

One night we were out I got a text from another girl that expressed interest in going out sometime. I told her that I got the text to which she said ""You can't start anything with another girl"". To which I replied, who is this other girl you speak of? She didn't say anything and just stared at me for what seemed like forever and she said to forget about it. Later that evening I said I had never met any of her family and she said when I visit I'll meet them; we had never discussed me flying to see her after she leaves.

Now she drops a bomb on me one night saying, and I quote, "" I have something important to tell you, but I won't tell you until the day I leave - unless it gets more intense"". She gave no clues other than that. 

Needless to say I'm completely confused by the situition and can not read her intentions. She did call me today to tell me that she plans on moving here permanently once she finds a suitable job. Unfortunately I may just have to wait until the day she leaves to really find out. Thanks for reading my wall of text!

We had a great time so I invited her over to dinner on another night. She came over at my place, we had dinner and had a great time. Then we had sex. And again. And again. Best sex of my life. We met again some days later and did the same thing - sex, sex, sex. So we talked about it: I (just coming out of a 4.5year old relationship) told her that I don't want a relationship, just sex. She agreed and added ""lately I had some bad experiences with relationships and got dissapointed a lot"". No problem for me, I just want to have sex and hang out from time to time because I enjoy spending time with her. And the sex is mindblowing. So we agreed on being FWB (her words, not mine!) I asked her if she was seeing other men and she replied ""no, not anymore. You satisfy me. I'm not planning on banging other men"". Now I have to tell you, this woman is an aboslute nympho. Never met a woman like her in my entire life. But we fucking clicked in bed. I satisfied and dominated her so hard. She loved it and told me that no other men has ever did to her what I did. Now she could be lying of course but that's very unlikely as she is a very honest and direct person.


We met again for lunch some days later, then went to my place and had sex again. This all happened in a time span of probably 8 days. She texted me a lot in this time but I always killed the conversation because a) I don't like texting too much and b) I didn't want to get too emotionally involved with her. 


I then had to do my military service so I was only at home once a week (that's how military service works over here in europe). I got a bit needy and said ""I'm home on X. Are you free then?"". I didn't text other women because I knew she would be guaranteed, awesome sex. Quality over Quantity. That's when things started to get strange. Normally she would reply instantly. But that stopped. Then she said she's sick so she can't meet me. No biggie. But I still had a strange feeling. She talked about an internship she absolutely wanted so she had to put in some time to write her application, update her CV and stuff. I then went back to military service. Fast forward a few days I write her again when I'm available. No response for 16hours. I knew something was strange. Then I get her text:
""I'm very sorry but I don't want to continue the thing we have started. I can't explain it to you, it's just what I'm feeling right now and I want to focus on the internship and my other examinations (she talked about  a lot of universities she wants to attend) and if all goes well I'll have this internship in Y (another city) for 6 months starting in january. It's all too much for me now. I hope you understand. I'm sorry that it turned out that way but I'd rather be open and honest about it than lie to you.""


I replied something along the lines "" I had a feeling that something wasn't 100% ok. I can understand you but at the same time feel that it's very unfortunate because we had something great going - having great sex and getting along very well."" I then wished her good luck with whatever she was planning and added that it sucks that we say goodbye over text.


To which she replied: ""I'm very sorry that it's over text but I just wanted to tell you my feeling instead of lying and being akward. We can see eachother again. It's not goodbye. I just wanted to tell you what I think and what I feel."" 

Me: ""Sure no problem. Just write me when you have time and we're going to have a drink""

Her: ""Okay""

Now I have absolutely no Idea how this happened out of the blue. We had a great time - in and outside of the bed - and we clicked very well. Maybe we clicked too well? I think something about her story is strange: While I do get that she want's to focus on her career I don't get why she doesn't want to have sex anymore. Sex is the best thing to relieve stress. Nothing is better than sex after/before/while studying (probably not WHILE studying but you get my point...). For me it's either a) she think's I want more than sex or b) she want's more than sex and is trying to protect herself from falling for me because she cleary put her carreer over everything else. I also dont get her feelings. ""It's just what I feel right now"" WHAT do you feel? do you have feelings? do you not have feelings?

**Important:** I am absolutely new to this FWB thing and I'd like to have some insights from you guys! I talked with three friends about this (2 male, 1 female) and they all said it's very strange. especially the ""feelings""-part. Maybe I got this all wrong and it's just too much for her indeed. I have no idea. 

I'm planing on not texting her for at least two weeks and just wait for her to reply. Because I have a feeling she will write back. As arrogant as this sounds but I know she wants the D. 

Timespan from when we first met to her last text is exactly three weeks, so a very short amount of time!

**tl;dr** FWB ends our ""relationship"" out of the blue because ""it's too much for me right now""."

2ofnxi,3,2014-12-05,Can't stop thinking about her.,Running_dude,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ofnxi/cant_stop_thinking_about_her/,"So this is a long story and it's hard to explain all of it but I can’t stop thinking about this girl. Not sure who to talk to so I came here. 

I met her my freshman year of college in 2010 ( I’ll call her A). She hung out with my group of friends and she and I became really close. I liked her a lot and I thought she liked me (she told a girl not to ask me out because her and I were talking) but I did say anything. At this point in my life I was 19, had never so much as told a girl I liked her and had only once come close to kissing anyone. 

So freshman year ends and her and I talk over Facebook. I plan on asking her out when we get back to school but panic and tell her I have feelings for her over Facebook. She tells me that I am her best friend and that she ""doesn't know what she would do without me"". We go into sophomore year and never talk about the Facebook message that I sent. We hang out probably four days a week. I still have feelings, we go to a party and both get drunk. I put my arm around her and she freezes. Literally no reaction. I start to avoid her because I can't handle being just friends. Months go by, we talk occasionally. She dates some guy who drinks every day of the week.Apparently the guy cheats on her with her roommate and they break up. Junior year of college I’m still kind of avoiding her but see her every so often. I go to a party at her place and he runs across the room and jumps on me to give me a hug. Another time we hang out and when I say I’m going to leave she offers to pay me to stay. 

At this point I’m two and a half years into college. I’m a smart good looking guy who has never had a girlfriend and never been on a date. I get all motivated and plan on asking another girl out but then I go to a party where A is. She is really drunk. Tells me how much she misses me. How the only reason nothing happened freshmen year is because she didn’t want to make the first move. How it has been so hard not seeing me all the time. Her best friend jokes that her and I had made out and A gets super mad say “I never made out with mike (best friends long term boyfriend) you can’t make out with Running_dude"". I leave the party confused.
I got to her place to talk about it the next day but all her roommates are there so we don’t talk about it. She texts me the day after that and she says she does not remember anything. The things she said really went to my head though. It’s pretty much what I have always wanted to hear. I ask her to hang out once or twice and she says she can’t. I kind of give up. I go to my friends place not to long after and he tells me that A invited them to her 21st birthday party. I reluctantly go thinking it will be weird. The party is in the basement and  packed. I work my way upstairs where I see As best friend. She says we need to talk. We talk for a while and she tells me that A really likes me but does not think she is good enough for me. She says that A is super drunk and just made out with some creepy dude. She also says the she does that a lot. She tells me how much A misses me and that I should basically give her an ultimatum. I just leave. A texts me about a week later to apologies and I tell her it’s okay. I plan on not talking to her again. 

Senior year of college. I have still yet to go on a date or kiss anyone even though I have had a few chances. A, texts me once and I respond but end conversation after two or three messages. Months later her and her best friend come to my apartment. They  had been at the bar. A is very drunk (this is pretty common) we talk and it is just like old times. She asks me if I hate her and I say no. Which is true but I never told her how mad I really was. A few week later she texts me again and we talk. About a month after that I am at the bar with my friend and I am black out drunk. A is there we end up talking till the bar closes and she spends the night with me. We don’t do anything. I don’t say anything to her because after junior year I said I would not let anything happen between us. She texts me to say that she had a good time and hopes we can hang out again. We see each other once or twice after this. Fast forward to the night after graduation. We are having a party at my apartment.  Maybe 30 people there. A comes. Me and her are talking. I’m really  drunk and her best friend warns me that A is very  drunk. We end up making out it my room.  This is my first time doing anything with a girl. We are both really drunk don’t know how long it lasted but I sober up and tell her were to drunk. I say we should just go to sleep. Were laying in bed and she slides on top of me. Were making out and my hands go up here shirt when she gets off of me and tells me to go get a condom. In my head I hear her call me by her exes name. I have no idea if that’s what she said. I get pissed, she denied saying it but anyway I left the room. I came back and told her we were just going to go to sleep. I don't think she remembers it at all. 

In the morning I drive her home and we agree to hang out that night. So later we get a beer and go back to my place. She spends the night, we don’t do anything. In the morning we get breakfast together and she hangs out with me while I pack to go home. A week later I come back to school to get a few things. Me and A hang out. Were sober and we kiss in my kitchen. It is my first sober kiss and after, she looks up at me with a big smile that I will never forget. We got to bed and make out again, I try to go farther but she stops me. I leave the next day. She texts me to say she liked spending time with me and that she had missed it. A few weeks later she texts me and says she can’t stop thinking about everything. I can’t either. But I’m leaving for an internship in Virginia in a week (we went to school in PA, I’m from Ohio she’s form NY) I tell her I don’t think it is smart to try and make things work. 

Summer comes and I keep thinking about her, we talk every couple of weeks. She calls me really drunk one night and tells me she wishes I was with her. A month or two later we are both going to homecoming and agree to hang out. I see here and it is nice. I’m hanging out with some of my friends and she texts me to say she wants to spend the night with me. I can tell she is really drunk and I am staying with one of my friends who thinks I should be over her so I say we can’t.  I basically blow her off all weekend and feel really bad about it. I text here when I’m back in VA to apologize and she says it’s oaky and that’s we should be friends. That’s the last time I talked to her.

I really liked her though and senior year when we were talking everything was great. I didn’t make an effort because the past was so bad. Over the years I had heard stories about her. Freshman year before I knew her she hooked up with one of my friends. She had a huge crush on another one of my friends who was a huge stoner and stopped talking to us. She would call him when she was drunk even when she and I were really close I think. Sophomore year when me and her had just stopped hanging out she had sex with some guy. I found out because this kids was over my house saying how his friend had to throw out his mattress because he had sex with A and she squirted all over it. Then she dated the guy who cheated on her and started drinking a lot. I know these things are not really my business. We were never together, she didn’t cheat on me but I liked her and it was hard to hear about them. They cross my mind more than they should.

So what am I trying to say? I don’t  know. I’m 22 I’ve only kissed one girl and that’s all we ever did. I broke things off because she treated me poorly in the past and I could not stop thinking about her with random guys. She got black out drunk a lot in college and told me she smoked weed all the time because her friend s would convince her.

I never wanted a straight edge virgin. I’ve smoked weed, I drank a good amount in college. I’m the only one I know who is still a virgin. But her hooking up with random guys bothers me. Smoking weed not because you want to but because “so and so pressured me” is annoying. 
 I can’t stop thinking about the few nights we spent together though. I know it bothered her to. It has been a few months since we last spoke and she is talking to some guy from her home town (I creeped on  FB and twitter). She seems happy. 

I guess I’m just upset because she got over me first. I’m home from college in suburbia and don’t know how to meet people, and I’m pretty bad at talking to them when I do. She lives in a city and is fairly outgoing.
Part of me wants to talk to her. To try. We never dated I never put in effort to call her or try and hang out, at least after sophomore year that is. I never told her I thought she was pretty or did any of that. I guess I keep thinking “what if we had tried, what if it would have been good”. The other part of me thinks I just miss sleeping with a girls head on my chest. Seeing someone look at me the way she did after we kissed. 
I don’t know how to get over her. Its weird being so close to someone. To be best friends and get along so well, then so suddenly not being a part of their life at all.

2ofynk,7,2014-12-06,[20 F] Girlfriend of 2 years Broke up with me [20 M] a year ago and I can't move on,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ofynk/20_f_girlfriend_of_2_years_broke_up_with_me_20_m/,"It's been about a year now since she broke up with me, and not a single day has passed where I haven't thought about her. This is going to be a long story but I think it would be helpful to give some context. If you don't have time to read feel free to skip to the TL;DR and give any general advice.


Natalie and I started dating in high school (my senior year her junior). We went to different schools, hadn't even met yet when our mutual friends decided we would be perfect for each other. This made the first time we met pretty awkward, knowing that everyone around us had already settled that we must date. After a few months of getting to know each other and increased frequency of talking we started dating. Two weeks after our first date and one of the worst things that's ever happened to me (at the time) happens. I wake up at 5 am after a horrible dream and text Natalie asking her if she’s awake and she tells me she couldn't sleep either. Minutes later I hear knocking on the door and talking and then my mom knocks on my bedroom door and says the Police are here.  


Some background info about me. My parent's got divorced when I was in 6th grade, and my father remarried and I rarely saw him. My mother has extremely crippling clinical depression which made her extremely neglectful. On top of that I was sexually abused frequently from the ages of 9-15, which I had never told to anyone till I was 17. This either caused or contributed to my depression and I was miserable for many years. Falling in to the trap of abused to sex offender cycle I began downloading child porn, which in therapy we determined was a roundabout way of trying to deal with my own issues.


The State Police entered my room and seized my phone and computer and took me into an unmarked car with a detective who wasn't wearing a uniform (I think scare tactics). He asked me if I had ever downloaded movies from the internet and I told him I had. He asked me what kind and I listed for him some regular motion pictures I had downloaded. He said ""Do you think we'd pull you out of your bed at 5 am for those movies?"" and then I knew what he was there for and told him I wanted a lawyer. He told me they were seizing my computer with a warrant for downloading of child pornography. 


For days I was just waiting to wake up from the nightmare. My Mom gave me some of her prescription drugs to help me sleep and I cycled through drug induced sleep or crying in my bed. A few days later my friends stopped by because I hadn't been to school in days and had no phone to answer anymore. I used one of their phones to call Natalie (I didn't have her number stored outside my phone) and tell her that my phone got taken by the police and I was in some trouble.
 

A few days later I went to meet with Natalie to break the news. I told her the charges but tried to imply that it wasn't as bad as it sounds. She was a little scared but she didn't know exactly what I had done yet. Her parent's sensed something was wrong and they probed out of her that I had been arrested. They said they wouldn't judge me and I saw them a few times after this date and they were very nice to me and didn't bring it up. 


After a few weeks I was arraigned, which went into the paper (sans my name because I was under 18) but Natalie's parents were able to put two and two together. They immediately call one of their relatives who works for the probation department, who then illegally accesses my files and tells her parent's graphically and descriptively what was on my hard drive. 



Natalie's parents tell her there is no way she can continue dating me. Natalie calls me and tells me she loves me and she's not leaving, she'll wait out her parents. I start therapy at this point, with a forensic psychologist who specializes in sex offenders. Our sex offender treatment went very quickly after she determined I wasn't dangerous or a pedophile and I continued seeing my therapist for more general counseling relating to my depression. Natalie's mother was already in therapy, and it was her therapist who convinced her not to try and cut off contact completely between me and Natalie. 



We keep talking every day, continuing like a long distance relationship. It was 3 months before I saw her again, and it'd be a year before I saw her without her mother or father present. I start a year of interim probation, with hopes that a year of good behavior prior to sentencing will lessen my sentence, and things are looking up. 



My therapist and I worked on getting me a job, getting me enrolled in a community college and learning to love myself. Natalie was very anxious however which at first I thought was just the situation but it never seemed to fade. She went to a doctor about it eventually and was diagnosed with severe OCD. She started CBT and taking medication which made her so happy, which on top of all my progress made me the happiest person on earth. It was like the first week we had started dating all over. 



I thought this was just sort of a puppy love thing, but it didn't fade away and continued for about a year. Her mom warmed up to me eventually and I spent a lot of time at their house, I even gained 20 pounds from eating over there so much (I was very underweight before this). I started college and finally got away from my mother. Natalie and I were convinced that by dealing with something so serious at the start of our relationship, it was smooth sailing from there. For the most part it was. 



When the year of interim probation was up, the two probation officers I had (two different counties) had to write evaluations along with my therapist. Both probation officers recommended that the year I had been on was enough, and that I was no danger to society. The judge however ignored these reports and gave me the cookie cutter sentence for people with the same crime as me, 10 years’ probation. I did however retain my youthful offender status so I wouldn't have to register as a sex offender which was a huge win. Despite the good news of Y.O. status, 10 years was a lot for me to handle after having the 2 law enforcement agents that knew me best say I didn't need anymore. 



This set my depression back a bit. For a month I was crabby, dismal and unmotivated. I could see Natalie get frustrated with me being depressed all the time, and this was a real low point for our relationship. We didn't talk about breaking up, there wasn't a day that I doubted I'd marry her eventually. After accepting my fate my mood improved, and we were back to a very happy relationship. Natalie attended the same college as me for a semester while she was wait listed for her dream college and I loved seeing her every day. Towards the end of the semester her parents began a messy divorce, and it hit Natalie harder than anyone (her self-included) expected. She was very sad a lot of the time and she started going back to therapy to deal with it.



I did my best to support her, I gave her space when she needed space, love when she needed love, and advice when she asked for it. I think things were looking up, seeing her family at Christmas was very exciting for her and she was in markedly better moods after.



After Christmas one day she texts me and says ""Can you come over? No one’s home we'll be alone.” I was having a bad day and I was sure this meant we were going to have some intimate time so I was feeling real good. I show up at her house and when she sees me she starts balling her eyes out and drops to the floor. I try to comfort her and ask her what’s wrong. We laid there for over an hour until she could talk and I was expecting her to tell me about some nasty detail of her parents’ divorce. She says ""I can't do this anymore."" The next hour was a blur, I went to her bathroom and vomited and called my therapist (who I had finished seeing about 4 months prior) to schedule an appointment. Her sister came home shortly after that, and I knew it was time to go. Natalie hands me a note on the way out the door. 



I went to Applebee's after. I had a gift card I planned to take her to lunch with. I ordered two drinks and an appetizer and lied to the waiter that I had someone meeting me soon because I was too embarrassed to be eating alone. After about 2 hours I told him I didn't think anyone was coming and ordered my dinner. I stayed for probably 4 more hours then I drove home.



For the next 5 days till my therapy appointment I laid in bed and cried and called a few friends to tell them what happened. Going into therapy I felt a bit better, I was outside and showered for the first time in a week. I told my therapist everything and it felt really good, I was happy and optimistic for an hour. She said I was handling things well and that the tools I learned with her were for situations just like this. 



The breakup note said that she had to do this, that going to different colleges would make us grow apart and resent each other. I did not understand that at all at the time, but now I think I better see what she meant. We kept talking for a few weeks, but then I told her it was far too painful and I cut contact 100%. 



I was very busy the next semester (my last semester before transferring to an engineering school) which meant I had a lot of school to think about, which was good. When I wasn't thinking about school, friends or the future my mind would drift to Natalie.



 After 6 months or so I tried dating thinking that would help, but I couldn't do it and unfortunately wasted a lot of that girl’s time. A couple more months pass and I'm dying to know how Natalie is doing. I still have feelings for her but I think I'm ready to be friends. I text her and ask her how she's doing, and she texts me back that she's not ready for a friendship. 



My life is looking up. I came from pretty shitty circumstances I'm doing well in school and soon I'll be entering the workforce. I've got a great group of friends from college and am still friends with many of my high school friends. Hopefully I can get my probation terminated soon.



I am not happy though. When I'm sad I miss her a whole lot and all I want is her comfort. When I get brief moments of happiness I just want to tell her about it. Not knowing how she's doing makes me feel so helpless and alone. I am half a person, experiencing half the world. 
The first person I ever loved doesn't want to talk to me, and on top of it the closest thing I had to a family was ripped from me along with Natalie. 



I cannot see my therapist anymore because insurance won't cover it and moneys tight until I internship next year. What can I do to get rid of this feeling before it destroys me? 




---   
**tl;dr**: The girl of my dreams broke up with me, it’s been a year and I still think about it every day, even after cutting off contact and occupying myself.

2og9y7,1,2014-12-06,"""Weekend update"" style segment",Writerhaha,comedywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedywriting/comments/2og9y7/weekend_update_style_segment/,"New to the thread and really just love comedy and writing. Just going to post these whenever I get the itch. Critique, comment, disregard or whatever, just kind of want to post to get things off my hard drive and into the world. 

Thanks for your time.

Michael Che: President Obama this week came under criticism when two people who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaign were appointed Ambassadors, even though they had no apparent qualifications. Here to comment is the newly appointed Ambassador to the Country of Chad, Aleece Finnegan.

Aleece Finnegan comes on screen smartly dressed in an outfit with sleeves pulled up. She also seems rather young.

Che: Hello Aleece, thank you for joining us tonight. What’s your reaction to being named the U.S. Ambassador to Chad.

Aleece: I’m honored to serve President Obama as the ambassador of this great nation

Che: Well, do you have any experience with the culture of Chad? I mean, do you speak the national language which-

Aleece: Is French, it’s used by the majority of their ten million citizens. 

Aleece wipes her brow. Che pauses and looks at her for a second. 

Che: Yes…. So you speak French?

Aleece: Yes, I took two years in high school., and got my degree from NYU. Which I hope to use that degree at Chad, where they have one of the lowest literacy rates in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to their displaced population. 

Aleece wipes her brow. This wipe is slower and after it we see a noticeable black smudge across her forehead. She’s more nervous. 

Che: Aleece. It looks like you’ve got something…

Aleece: Yes, I’ve got something, Chad has something too, 6 national holidays, do you want me to name them?

Che: no that’s ok.

Aleece wipes her brow once long, she’ll do it three more times quick over the next line.

Aleece: They’re Easter Monday, Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, and Eid Milad Nnabi.

Che: Aleece, Are you reading off of your arm?

Aleece: No, why do you ask?

Che: No reason, um, so one of the criticisms of the Obama administration is that big donors are getting rewarded with diplomatic posts. Do you have any comment on this?

Aleece sits nervously. She wipes her brow, and rotates her arm. The audience can clearly see that there’s things written. 

Aleece: I haven’t raised any funds for President Obama during either election year, 2008 and.. and… –

Che: 2012?

Aleece: Ok you caught me.  My parents donated the money. 

Che: So your parents are donors? 

Aleece: Yeah, but they didn’t donate hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Che: How much did they donate?

Aleece: Enough for a posting to Chad and an Obama ’08 keychain. 

Che: Why Chad?

Aleece: I was sleeping on their couch after graduation, and they could see my Tattoo. 

Che: And it said  “Chad?”

Aleece: No, it says “Enter with care” that’s why they’re sending me to Chad. 

Che: Well is there any reason why you’d want to go there?

Aleece: Michael, I’m an English major who can only get a job editing buzzfeed articles and reading names on Starbucks cups, the only place I want to be back on the couch in Woodbury.  This is probably the worst internship ever.

Che:  You could just sign up for the NBC Page program.

Aleece breaks out laughing. 

Aleece: Oh, I needed that. Actually I’m ready to go to Chad, they’ve got cell phones, Tinder and I have diplomatic immunity, suck on that mom and dad, I’m out olds. 

Aleece pulls out her keychain, and drops it on the table, and leaves to go.

Che: Ambassador Aleece Finnegan.

Aleece comes back into view to pick up the keychain and leaves again.

2ogu4q,15,2014-12-06,DravenDoesItAll.com - A project I've been developing.,[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2ogu4q/dravendoesitallcom_a_project_ive_been_developing/,"Visit my website at [Draven Does It All!](http://www.dravendoesitall.com)

Here you find information regarding everything related to the E-Sports scene of League of Legends.

* Up-to-date breaking headlines across all regions 
* Check the standings for any split
* Visualize Brackets for upcoming playoffs or regional tournament
* Look up team information including past games, statistics and rosters
* Look up match recaps. (Looking for help to produce highlight clips/write small recap articles)
* Analyze statistics across regions, teams and players (Yet to be implemented)

I remember a few months before the qualification tournaments for the Season 4 World Championships was I looking for information on the process for ways a team could qualify. The information was scattered everywhere for every region. Some regions ticket to Worlds rested solely on their performance during a Summer Split playoff, while other regions were placed based on their Circuit Points accumulated during the entire season.

Initially the original goal of the website was to simply help track the qualification of teams up through the Season 4 World Championship. When I was developing the website Riot's lolesports website seemed very inactive in regions outside of EU and NA which makes sense up until recently regions like China were very hard to get any access to as fans. Eventually about 6 weeks before the start of the Season 4 World Championship, Riot finally focused all their efforts to their website and basically accomplished what I was half-way developing. 

Instead of giving up on my project I turned my attention towards creating a contest. You may remember my [""Perfect"" Bracket Challenge](http://redd.it/2fuji5) in which users attempted to predict the outcome of both the group stage and knockout round of the World Championship for a chance to win up to $100. This contest was launched 10 days before Riot's Official 'Pick Em' Contest with over 3,000 dynamic user entries. The contest generated tons of discussion about it's [statistics](http://redd.it/2hr4ro) and [probability](http://redd.it/2iik2q) of predicting the group stage and each round of the knockout stage. 

I applied to Riot's Summer Internship but was not accepted unfortunately. This was also around the time my father passed away from liver cancer. I've been motivated ever since then to continue in developing something I love.



**FAQ**

**What is the point of this website?**

My main goal of this website was to present League of Legends like a traditional sport would be if this were to be ESPN. I'm a student at FAU majoring in Computer Science and am applying my education towards something I am very passionate about. Everything I do essentially is for me to learn something new or to develop something I'm expert in.  From learning to program with jQuery and AJAX to creating and maintaining databases has all been something foreign to me at one point or another. I'm hoping this project will be used as a portfolio for future job endeavors. Until then I will continue to develop this website as long as I have time.

**What is the point? What makes this any different than lolesports?**

To support content creators that put time and effort into developing applications/videos/articles. I understand I'm not developing anything revolutionary, but I'm just trying to expand on what LolEsports already is.

Ontop of that lolesports.com is very efficient for regions like NA/EU but have almost zero data regarding regions like OGN/GPL/LPL. This is evident in their API where gameStats for those 3 regions had null values for all fields except for matchVictory and matchDefeat.  I've already implemented some manual data entry of these missing values and plan to continue to do so. You can also simply visit the [OGN Homepage forlolesports](http://na.lolesports.com/ogn-kr/2014/kr-regionals-2014/overview) to notice there is zero statistics beside wins and losses.

So my goal is to have up-to-date information regarding players and teams of every major region. A user can look up any game he/she wants and be able to look at the stats from the game, read a small article about the summary of the game or watch a small highlight clip of the game. [Much like what ESPN does for major sports](http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=400554285)


**Is this website mobile friendly?**

No. Although I am hoping to have a mobile friendly version of the website out soon.

**Why are some regions inaccessible such as OGN, LPL and GPL?**

Majority of the information(games and schedules) is accessed from lolesports API which is has its pros and it's cons.

Pros

* Update information quickly after a match or tournament
* Accurate information

Cons

* Regions such as OGN/GPL/LPL have null or """" values in the fields when accessing the statistics for both teams and players. The only values that are saved are wins and losses.
* Tournaments such as IEM may not be available.
* The pace in which information is updated is at the mercy of Riot (OGN League at lolesports still displays Season 4 Regionals information/stats as opposed to Season 5 Preseason)

So this means for many of my tables I have no information to display besides the standings. I have to manually enter the information game by game, region by region. Once I accomplish this I will re-activate the links. I hope this will be accomplish prior to the start of the Spring Split to reduce any inconvenience.

**Why isn't there a Players Page? Why do teams have both current/past rosters**

As you may be aware LoL Pro Scene goes in cycles. During the split there is almost zero roster moves/changes  and only a few minor changes occur in between the season. But right after the season ends, we see a huge wave of roster changes where nearly every team makes 1 or more change to their line-up. 

Ideally I will soon have  a players page that you can look-up a player by typing it in or navigating through the team's page that will display a player's career stats including team moves.

**What are your future plans?**

* Once the schedule has been released for each region I will update the Schedule page and the ticker will reflect the upcoming/past games within 5 days.
* I will be manually updating match information for games during the Summer Split for Season 4 and also for the Spring 5 Promotional Tournament for both NA and EU.
* I am also researching on the feasbility of developing a live GameCast for current games that would also be able for mobile
* I am interested in running a contest during Season 5 much like Fantasy LCS but with a twist. This would be free to play and have a chance to win $$$.
* Develop the Statistic page so you can view information dynamically of teams and players with certain conditions (E.g Doublift's KDA graph on blue side, TSM Win Rate in Bo3)
* Develop Preview Pages that help hyper games up by using statistics/highlight videos.



**tl;dr**: [Visit my website](http://www.dravendoesitall.com). Check Stats, Look Up Games, Read Headlines. [I hosted this contest earlier in the year](http://redd.it/2fuji5). I love programming and League of Legends. I've put a lot of hard work into this and it's something I want to continue.

2oh1x8,1,2014-12-06,Neicky buildin a team!,neicky,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2oh1x8/neicky_buildin_a_team/,"English text below



Hey ihr Legenden,

ich bins, mehr oder weniger bekannt als Neicky. Komme ursprünglich aus der WC3 Szene, hatte mich aber nachdem ich dort über mehrere Jahre ein Team (mit welchselnden Clantags, wechselndem Lineup, wechselnden Sponsoren) in etwas höhere Gefilde geführt habe, zurückgezogen aus der Szene und dem Spiel als solches. Bin dann bei LOL gelandet und habe dort recht schnell erneut mit einem Team versucht etwas zu erreichen.
Hat auch soweit ganz gut geklappt gehabt, hatten zwei drei Cups gewonnen, Offlinefinale von einem etwas größerem Cup erreicht und den 4ten Platz in Halle gemacht.
Aus zeitlichen Gründen habe ich dann das Team verlassen und mich nur noch auf das organisieren und managen konzentriert. Allerdings haben die Jungs dann aufgrund der internen Differenzen die Sache ad acta gelegt.

Bin mittlerweile zeitlich wieder etwas flexibler und habe tierisch Bock drauf ein Team an die Spitze zu führen. LCS wäre das ultimative Ziel!
Selbstverständlich über einen längeren Zeitraum. Ich erwarte nicht das sich Leute bei mir melden die schon Master oder höhere Divisionen bekleiden und so gut farmen wie der Elolord.
Wonach ich vorrangig suche ist Motivation, Ambition und Zuverlässigkeit.

Ich such nach Leuten die sich ernsthaft mit dem Spiel auseinandersetzen, die aktiv/proaktiv Kritik äußern und vertragen, die so gut wie nicht toxic sind und die teamfähig, anpassungsfähig sind.
Ein paar detailierte Eckdaten gefällig?

Elo: Diamond und aufwärts. (Wenn ihr nur Platin seid, könnt ihr es trotzdem versuchen. Ausnahmen bestätigen die Regel.)
Alter: 18+ (auch hier wäre ich bereit Kulanz zu zeigen, sofern das Benehmen stimmt und die häusliche Situation die zeitliche Flexibilität nicht beeinflussen)
Sonstiges: TS/Skype/Mumble etc. unbedingt vorrausgesetzt

Schickt aussagekräftige Bewerbungen als E-Mail an neicky@mail.de .
Wichtig sind mir bei der Bewerbung:

Alter, Wohnort, vollständiger Name, Ingamealias, Sprachkenntnisse, Beruf/Studium, Onlinezeiten

Greetz, Neicky

Hey you legends,

its me, more or less known as Neicky. Im originally coming from the Warcraft3-scene, where i had a team for years (with changing clantags, different lineups, different sponsorships), with i lead into higher grounds. I just went down under and left the scene and the game afterwards. Finally i found LOL and i decided to create an own team after a short duration of time playing as well as i decided to reach something.
The team and i performed pretty well for a time, we won two or three cups, reached an offlinefinal in a little bit bigger event and at least we grabbed the 4th place there in Halle (City in Germany).
I left the team in the end, because i had not enough time to spend for and focused on managing and organizing the team from the background. The team broke finally because they had some intern differences.

Within the years i have alot more time i can spend for a team now and im really motivated to guide a team to the top. LCS is the ultimate target!
Of course this will need a longer time to happen. I dont expect people to message me, already as good as froggen or someone similar. What im searching for is in first place motivation, ambition and reliability.

Im searching for players who are serious facing the game, who active/proactive criticizing receiving and giving, who arent toxic, who are able to work in a team, who are adaptable and so on.
So what i need in detail is;

Elo: Diamond and above. (If you are only platin, give it a try. Exceptions may be done.)
Age: 18+ (Even here im ready to do accept everybody younger, all i need is a normal behavior and support by your parents, timemanagement for example)
Last but not least a microphone and TS/Skype/mumble etc. is required.

If you are interested, send me your application E-Mail to neicky@mail.de .
What i need in general:

Age, Country/City(if you are from germany), complete name, ingamealias, what languages you are able to speak, job/study/college, usual times you are online


kind regards, Neicky"
2oh76r,3,2014-12-06,It's the little victories.,callmeredhead,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2oh76r/its_the_little_victories/,"I've been working so hard this semester (I'm a senior in college) trying to overcome my depression and anxiety, or at least get it to a manageable spot. I was out with friends Thursday night, which going out with friends is already a step forward for me, and I had this weird surreal moment that I've had a couple times before. I was doing horribly but I was still having so much fun just being out and enjoying friends.

It felt like time paused for a second and I could just see the whole scene and thought ""This is what it's like not having depression.""

Moments like that mean so much to me, because it gives me something to hold on to and reach for. It shows me there is happiness past depression and working towards it DOES pay off.

This semester I've been going to group therapy at my college for DBT (Dialectical behavioral thinking) and little by little I could feel that helping, and I was also seeing a therapist at school one-on-one every week or every other week. I accidentally missed our last session but she called me and told me that all we were going to talk about was my progress this semester. She told something that brought tears to my eyes. That she was proud of me and told me that I was the best patient a therapist could ask for. I had put the work in and had been trying to implement the things I learned in group and our private sessions into my everyday life. 

This has been the most stressful ~4-6 months of my life. I was a full time student, working full time, doing a 2-semester unpaid internship, my family found out my uncle had cancer and then he died in the span of 3ish months, and plus everyday stress and relationship stress. And I'm sure ya'll know depression isn't the best for having a good relationship with your s.o. 

I guess I just wanted to make this post partially for me and partially in hope that maybe someone might see it and see that their depression and anxiety isn't as hopeless as I once felt mine was. I know I will still benefit from seeing a therapist to kind of help keep this momentum going, and focus on using the tools I learned in DBT in my everyday life. But, and I think ya'll will understand this better than anyone, being happy makes me SO happy. Happiness while having depression feels amplified because you know how bad it can get. Being happy is a victory, and it gives me strength and hope to keep being happy and appreciate everything I can. Ew gross, I'm crying now lol. 

**TL;DR** I had a very surreal moment of ""this is what it's like not having depression"" while out with friends. I worked so hard this semester on overcoming my crippling anxiety and depression and honestly I'm proud of myself. I hope someone can see this maybe identify with it a bit and it gives them strength to keep going because, while it 100% doesn't feel like it sometimes, depression and anxiety end, and when it ends it's so fucking amazing. Keep that feeling and use it to fuel yourself."

* We are working on getting you guys that game night. I (Stealth) have had some issues with my computer - so I haven't been able to manage things very well. But we will hopefully have our first successful one before the new year.

* We have a question for you guys as well, would you be interested in a ""sub-reddit"" series re-watch? Where we would essentially go back and watch an old series together. Each day we would watch about 3 episodes, and discuss them. Or something of that sort. What do you guys think?


**A message from /u/KungFuBeta:**

Special thanks to /u/stealthninjaAP, I can't write this weeks one as I'm having a cold and I'm feeling pretty bad this week and yeah, it's getting worse... But yeah, I hope I will be alright until the next week, until then Stealth has everything under control. Thanks man!

What do you think?",TantoBiganto,gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/2ohnrq/help_looking_to_get_big_this_is_my_diet_what_do/,"Alright so I have recently gotten sick and tired of being so skinny, I am roughly six feet tall and weigh about 170. I don't really have a goal weight, I just am tired of being called a light post or a string bean or lanky...It gets old. I am a college student and so money is a little tight, I recently got a co-op position(a longer internship) at an engineering company meaning I will have some more money. I am looking at spending roughly $50.00 a week for food and what I got here is pretty close to that. So now onto the diet:

**Breakfast**:
1 Banana, 1/2 cup of oats, 2 Tbsp peanut butter, 2 cups of milk ~ 755 calories/25g Protein

**Morning Snack**:
PB&amp;J sandwich with an apple ~ 470 calories/12g protein

**Lunch**:
Homemade Chili with 2 cups of milk ~ 1075 calories/68g protein

**Pre-workout snack**:
Bagel &amp; 2 cups of milk ~ 540 calories/25g protein

**Right after gym**:
Protein shake ~ 140 calories/25g protein

**Home from gym**:
Gain Shake ~ 1400 calories/57g protein

**Dinner**:
4 eggs, 2 pieces of toast with 2 Tbsp peanut butter ~ 620 calories/36g protein

**Totals**: ~5000 calories/248g protein

I feel that this is a bit excessive in both calories and protein but hey who knows, just want to gain some weight, ya dig?

Let me know what you think!

Thanks for reading :)

I want to get better but no matter what I try or how hard I try I can't shake it. I feel empty. Things will happen that I know should make me happy, but I feel like I just go through the outward movements of what happy looks like. Sad or bad things will happen and I no longer get the gut dropping feeling that used to accompany it. 

I don't get excited about things because I know it will just fall apart. I don't have the money to get help. I'm staying at home while I attend college and due to a overly religious family they can't know I seek help for this. I approached them once on this subject matter and it wasn't pretty to say the least. It's gotten to the point where it's affecting my schoolwork, my will to get out of bed, my drive to push for an internship, my drive to move out, my relationship, and my friendships. 

I honestly don't know what to do anymore and I am so tired of fighting to get better when I will feel better for maybe a day then drop down to feeling a new low the day after. I don't know how to fix myself. I feel like I will be stuck living and feeling like this the rest of my life and the thought of not being alive is more appealing then that. I'm not suicidal, I used to be, but I refuse to give up. I just want to be happy and feel normal.

Tl;Dr I'm depressed and don't know how to change."

But dammit, I have no idea where my life is headed.

I'm still stuck in college, about to pass to 7th semester, and I'm just at 50% of the credits I require for graduation. Transition will only make it worse because I HAVE to work to pay all this off. Being a Computer Science and Engineering student means that by now I should be doing internships at places like Intel or IBM, but nooooo. I'm stuck at that job because it's the only one that pays enough to cover my transition expenses.

*Sigh* I feel like I'm so behind schedule compared to everyone else in my generation.

The fact that I have to take a job I hate and that has NOTHING to do with the degree I'm pursuing is only depressing me more. But dammit, I need the money!

2ojf2r,1,2014-12-07,[20/M] On the verge of ending a 4 1/2 year long relationship with my [22/F] girlfriend. Please help.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ojf2r/20m_on_the_verge_of_ending_a_4_12_year_long/,"   Reddit, please help me. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for years now, 5 as of next July to be exact. I still love her, but my will to sustain our relationship is very slowly fading. I suppose I should give some background information, but I'll try to summarize the best I can without writing a novel...


We met in New Zealand. Everybody always says that we have the perfect fairy tale story of how we met because we happened to be in the same delegation on a student ambassador/study abroad-esque trip called People to People. We both lived in Texas about 40 minutes away from one another, but I was always willing to make the drive. Her parents are very wealthy and originally despised my middle class self, but over time I have come to earn the respect of her father and, to some extent, her ultra conservative mother. However, after about a year, my girlfriend graduated high school and departed for college. I encouraged her the best I could and ensured she knew that I wanted what was best for her, so rather than going to a local school her parents preferred for her and to be closer to me, she went halfway across the country to South Carolina where she remains to this day.


We knew this separation would be difficult, but we were so sure that immediately after she graduated, we would be together while I finished off my degree; ultimately, we planned to live together after school was completed. I always did the best I could to uplift her and convince her that it would be easy; she visited home for the holidays and stayed for the summers, and I've visited her at her school unbeknownst to her parents every Spring break. Things were good; we were fulfilling our obligations in life while continuing to fall head over heels in love with one another. I even got her a promise ring, and she wears it every day. 


However, things have changed recently. Finals have taken up so much time, and she's as stressed out as ever. This coming Spring, she'll also be studying overseas, and I can't imagine the timezone differences will help us communicate considering that it can be difficult to make time to so much as talk over Skype. Furthermore, after an internship in New York this past summer, she secured herself her dream job that she plans to pursue immediately following graduation. This is what really made me start thinking...when will we ever get the chance to be together?


I discussed this with her and, as expected, it worried her immensely. She doesn't have any idea how many years she'll remain in New York, and I have no intentions of moving there with my degree only halfway completed and ambitions to pursue a career elsewhere. At first it seemed like everything would be so easy; 4 years of college was all that stood between us, but now, it seems like there's no end to our separation. 


I really do love her, but I wish I could explain how badly my heart is hurting right now. I just finished talking with her after she was upset that I accidentally neglected to talk to her at all yesterday, and it really caused everything to sink in. I can't help but feel like I'll ruin a potentially amazing future if I end it now, and I can't even imagine how utterly it would destroy her if I were to break up with her. 


She has severe self esteem issues for which I've done all I can to work on with her, and she sincerely believes that I'm the one for her. She would rather die than lose me. It hurts so badly to even think about the consequences of what ending this relationship might have, even completely disregarding ensuring an easy life for my kids due to her wealthy, as the money has never really been a concern for me. I just...I don't know if I can keep this up anymore, even if I know it could be worth it to just wait it out. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'd include more info about it all, but I feel like I ended up writing a novel anyway. Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this. Please help me out with some advice on what to do."

2ok5gt,7,2014-12-07,How do things go back to normal after pregnancy scare between me [25 M] and GF [21 F] of 6 months?,trebloinka,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ok5gt/how_do_things_go_back_to_normal_after_pregnancy/,"My girlfriend and I met over the summer. She was a summer intern on the group at my work that I was just joining full-time. We sat next to each other, pretty much right away began flirting with each other, and eventually began a down-low relationship. We had both recently gotten out of longer-term relationships that ended badly -- me, a 4 year relationship that ended with me breaking off an engagement 9 months before, her a 2 year one that ended with her boyfriend cheating on her 6 months before. As such, neither of us really knew what we wanted -- neither of us really felt like we were in a place for a relationship, but we liked each other, so we kept it going. Things escalated really quickly, and before we knew it we were hanging out after work most days of the week. As a side note -- because we had come out of the bad side of previously relationships, neither of us had the biggest friend base, so we also rather quickly became each other's best friends.

It went further into the fall. She was starting her senior year at the college across town, and so we were able to keep seeing each other. I was in the process of getting over some depression issues, and a couple of times I felt like being in the relationship was too much for me, that it wasn't making me happy. We'd work through it, though, and eventually I realized that it wasn't the relationship that was making me unhappy, it was *me* -- I wasn't working on myself to the extent that I needed to for me to be satisfied with myself, which was a bad habit I had learned from my previous relationship, when I felt like focusing on myself at all would make her lose interest in me. 

There was stress, too, from the fact that, with her being a senior in college, she may not be around indefinitely -- that she could accept a job or go join a volunteer group somewhere else in the world in the spring. I worried about where the relationship was going, and she would calm me down, saying that we'd cross that bridge when we came to it, and in the meantime we should just enjoy what we do have while we have it.

Eventually I began realizing that I really, really loved being around her, that she felt like home to me, and that I wanted to actually start to take things pretty seriously. Right as I came to this conclusion, though, she had a late period. She had been a little late taking her BC pills twice the last month, and we weren't using any other kind of protection, so she became more or less convinced she really might be pregnant. She was so stressed out about it she said she was going to take a pregnancy test that day. I offered to be with her while she picked it up and took it, and she said she'd like that. I met up with her at the pharmacy on my lunch break, and she bought the test, and then we went back to her place, all the while with me thinking that I was about to have to dedicate the rest of my life to this girl in some capacity. I was OK with it -- for the first time in my life I had a stable enough job situation that I could afford to have a kid, even if it wasn't necessarily planned. It would work out okay.

And then -- only one pink line showed up, and we were in the clear. We laughed, we kissed, we sighed, we swore to use condoms from now on, and then we talked for a while about what we would have done if the second pink line had come. I told her that I wouldn't have offered my opinion unless she had asked for it, but personally I thought that it was too early in her life for her to be having a kid, and I'd question whether she wouldn't see this baby as something that had come in between her and her true potential in life. There was a pause of a second from her, and then she said that I was perfect -- that was *exactly* what she wanted me to say.

Since then, though, I've felt -- idk, weird about things. I was ready to offer so much for her -- the rest of my *life* -- and then I suddenly didn't need to. And I realized that, while I would have given her anything she wanted of me, I wasn't truly *ready* to do that -- it was way too much, too soon for me. Yes, the relationship is the best I have ever been in, yes being around her makes me feel like home, yes she's someone that is mature and trustworthy enough I could eventually see myself building a life around. But not yet. 

And since that scare, I've been feeling like I need to push back a little from the relationship. I'm scared of her liking me more than I like her, scared of how much the relationship means to me, scared of what could have been if she really had been pregnant. All I want is to go back to normal, to keep on having a normal relationship without questions about the rest of my life rearing their heads in the back of my mind. But I can't help but keep having this panicked feel that it's too much, that I need some space from the relationship. I talked a little bit about it with her, and she said that she's feeling the opposite -- she needs support right now, not space, and I'm doing whatever I can to give her that. But it's hard. This is still a relationship I want to continue -- she's still the most important person in my life, and I want to be with her still. But staring into the abyss of forcing myself to live the rest of my life with this girl has made me feel vaguely panicked, and I want that to stop.

**tl;dr**: How can you make things go back to normal after a pregnancy scare in a relatively young relationship?"

So around January i might be on the way to Japan, and i will be working as an intern for a company in there, and i need some help regarding housing.
I have searched online for houses and places to stay but usually what i get is simply the same houses over and over again. My workplace is around Shibuya, so i need a place around that district.

What would be some good places to search for housing? 

I will be staying for around 6 months.

Thank you in advance."

The department doesn't prep its students well for the real world, treats Masters students like second-class citizens, and is underfunded to the point where they're shoving grad students into undergrad classes.  We're a field that's been developing rapidly for years, but we don't have any professors doing work in newer areas because all of our tenured professors are dinosaurs who tuned out after a while.  Even at MS-level classes, all classes tend to be taught as ""Here's a generic book problem.  Fill in the blanks"" like they are in high school or undergrad.  After doing some research on LinkedIn about what recent MS students are doing, most are making below the tenth percentile of wages in my field.  As you can guess, I really don't want to go here, even though I'm guaranteed admission and a graduate degree in Spring of 2016.

I'm currently applying to a fairly selective program with an okay GPA.  It's the only school I'm applying to because personal circumstances mandate that I stay where I am, and because it's a really good program that teaches exactly what I'm interested in.  Their students regularly come out with six-figure starting salaries.

If I don't get in, should I stick with the MS at my current school, even though it sucks?  My field is very, very lucrative and I don't know how quickly salaries go up as time goes on.  It's pretty much mandatory to have a masters though.  I also taught myself a good bit and have an internship under my belt (all with no help from my department) so I'd assume that makes me more marketable.  But I really don't want to be stuck where I live now forever.

And if I take a year off, what should I do?  I was thinking maybe become a research assistant at the good school I applied to so I could get a really good recommendation from someone there.  The only issue is research assistants don't get paid much and I'm coming out with $50000 in debt, all of which will be accruing interest while I'm not enrolled.

Thanks!"

I just got employed per diem (2-3 days/week) at a prominent acute care center in the area (ICU, stroke, med/surg, ED as needed), which is something I've been striving for my entire career thus far. I feel like I make good clinical decisions in SNFs and home care, but the acute setting is a whole different ballgame.

Ok, so, wow, I feel totally inept at this new job. Like I'm a student again and need constant supervision and mentoring. The other SLPs have worked in the setting for 10-15 yrs and can prescribe diets on the fly or read an MBS in 5 minutes and coordinate care with the doctors like no big deal. However, I feel like I'm floundering. I'm not used to having patients with this level of acuity and complicated medical status and I'm always worrying about missing s/sx of aspiration or missing when a person is at risk of silent aspiration when doing a bedside swallow (which is 90% of the job).

On top of that, I'm only 26, and upon being introduced to several dr's and staff I received multiple comments that I'm so ""young and cute."" It's like a  cycle: other people treat me like I don't know what I'm talking about so that gets reinforced in my own head and I likely start to present myself with less confidence. I get so anxious at the idea of interrupting a doctor when they're documenting or catching them in the hallway and telling them the results of a swallow eval or asking them questions. I'm afraid they'll look at me and think ""Who is this kid and why are they caring for my patient?"" I know I'm likely exaggerating or projecting, as I do have a history of anxiety.

I wonder if I should just cut my losses at this job before I actually screw up and hurt someone. I feel guilty because the hospital is putting thousands of dollars into training me and orienting me and I still feel lost. Granted I have only worked a total of three days, but I feel nauseous at the thought of having to go back this week.

Real talk. Any advice? "

I had interviews with two mid-sized national firms earlier in October and November, but unfortunately I did not get full-time offers from either of them. Since then I have decided to wait until January 2015 to begin applying for the local firms because they are usually not hiring until later. (In the fall, they tend to be hiring for January co-op students rather than September full-time students).

I was unfortunately unable to secure any leadership roles as a student. I have some volunteer experience, and I currently work part time in a bookkeeping role. I did have an internship with relevant job experience over the summer.

1) Is it a good idea to wait until January to begin applying, or should I really be onto that ASAP?

2) What do I need to keep in mind when I am applying for the smaller firms? (As opposed to the Big 4 or mid-sized national firms).

3) How badly will my lack of leadership positions hurt my applications? If it is pretty bad, what should I do?

4) My GPA for my accounting courses (around 70-80) are generally lower than my GPA in my other courses. How badly will this hurt me?

We are both in college, but are trying long distance. I stayed in-state and went to a fairly inexpensive college. He decided to go out of state to a pretty expensive school, and his parents warned him during this past summer that besides paying for college, they were probably not going to support him financially throughout the school year. We both received a generous amount of graduation money, but I got a job to have a bit more spending money for the summer. He, on the other hand, chose not to get a job, even after his parents said that they would reconsider cutting him off if he got a job. There were times that I would put a job application in front of him and then later find it crumpled up in the back of his car. That's not even the worst part. Most of what we did during the summer, I paid for because ""all the money [he] has needs to go towards college and [he] can't afford to spend his."" I'm worried that this is going to continue to be a trend (he says he's going to try and get a summer internship, but who would hire a guy with no work experience?!) and I joined reddit because i need some advice on a) how to bring this topic up to my boyfriend when I see him over winter break and b) what I should do A little tidbit of information about my boyfriend that may be important to know is that he has aspergers.

2oknld,100,2014-12-07,I hate this economy so much...,JonWood007,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/2oknld/i_hate_this_economy_so_much/,"I really freaking do, and I need to rant. And this is the best place to rant. People keep saying the economy is getting better, zomg, unemployment rate is down, zomg, GDP growth is up, the stock market is rising! And here I am still in this craphole post graduation trap of not being able to find suitable employment. I go online, look at job postings, and crap relevant to my field and the experience I have from my capstone project (think of a combination of a thesis and an internship) all require literally years of experience to accomplish. Most ""jobs"" in my field are volunteer work, and the only ""work"" to be done requires years of experience. My experiences with this economy has made me passionate about wanting to help people in down economic situations, but how the heck am I supposed to, say, get a job in social work or a nonprofit or government when all of these jobs require YEARS of experience?! This ""need a job to get a job"" crap is still prevalent, even with people suddenly going on about how great the economy is. Most of the jobs available seem to be low wage retail and they seem like absolute hell to me. An absolute skills mismatch for me. Like, today, there was an application for a Reebok brand ambassador. I go to write a resume for it, and I'm blank...because guess what, I don't care about shoving Reebok's stinking shoes down everyone's throat and don't know how anyone can be freaking passionate about SHOES for hours a day. But that's what the glorious job creators decide what needs to be done. Getting people to be passionate about shoes, so they can lie and hype people up about shoes so people buy them instead of something more useful. Like, this is what this economy has come to! Selling people crap they don't need, more or less forcing products on people, forcing people to be these soulless automatons in order to make some arbitrary number go up. We don't have an economy based on needs. We have an economy based on the pointless selling of crap people don't need, and we should just be grateful the job creators decided someone needs to be passionate about their product to sell this stuff.

It's almost like this system sets up dissenters for failure. Not only are you expected to waste your life away working at these soulless jobs...but they want people who are passionate about it. That's the kicker. That's the thing that pisses me off more than anything. Not only are we told we need to work, but people don't even make the ability to get work easy. You need to put on this fake smiley face all the time about how oh geez, im really passionate about cleaning toilets, or really passionate about shoes, or really passionate about burgers and fries. I mean, I'm sure there are some narrow fields of products people are more passionate about others (i'm kinda partial to technology quite honestly, video games, computers, gadgets, etc.), but DANG. It's just ridiculous. And if you're not passionate, they'll get look you over to get someone who did somehow plastic surgeon a bunch of passion onto his face, which means guess what, you're screwed.

I'm an honest person. I hate the bullcrapping. I hate this charade. I just really hate how this economy works. And the kicker is, if you dare say this, you're unemployable. You don't buy the values of how the game is run, and therefore, screw you, go starve. I mean, if I were given the right job in the right conditions, I could be a good worker. For example, I ALWAYS excelled in my school work, because I was passionate about learning and my own personal development. It's not hard to get the best from me, really.

And the thing that ticks me off the most? People actually support this system. I'm so tired of this ""you gotta do what you gotta do"" mentality. I mean, I understand you cant change the system, so you have to adapt, but people take this attitude so far that they tear down anyone who wants to make it better. Like, seriously, when people have these minimum wage protests, I see comments on FB and places about wanting to run them over with their cars and crap. Like, what the heck is wrong with people, you don't think people should be able to make a decent freaking living!? And the real thing that pissed me off was I actually saw a wal mart worker blasting fast food workers about how much easier their job is and how they dont make $15 an hour or whatever. Like, people can't wrap their heads around the fact that these policies would benefit them too. It's sickening. It seems like people like to glorify how hard life is by turning themselves into martyrs and complaining about how life is so hard and how sanctimonious they are for working so hard, rather than asking why do we need to work so hard, for so little? But hey, dont ask that, that makes you a socialist, that makes you lazy, that makes you worthy of bitterness and scorn from bitter and scornful people. If this describes you, then screw you, you are the problem with this country. 

I just need to rant. Gosh this economy pisses me off. People claim it's getting better, but I just don't see it. "

My girlfriend and I have been dating for two and a half years, and have lived together for about 1.5 years of that. Things have been fantastic, and I bought her a ring last week with the goal of proposing to her around New Years.

I recently started a pretty good job making 50K+, and she is still in graduate school with similar job prospects in about 6 months. In 10 years from now, it isn't unreasonable for us to be making 150k-200k combined.

We have been very careful our entire relationship with protection. She has been on birth control for years, and I *usually* wear condoms. In the last two months she became a bit lax with taking her pills, and the only time I didn't wear protection was after her last period 4 weeks ago. Her breasts were hurting the other night and looked bigger than usual, and I realized she hadn't had a period in a while. We got a pregnancy test, and it clearly showed she was pregnant.

Neither of us are religious, and are both pro-choice. We knew right away that an abortion was the best choice right now. We scheduled a surgical abortion later this week, and are choosing not to tell anyone we know-- probably ever. We are very resolved in this, but it still is tough.

The hard part right now is that from the outside, our lives look stable. What my finances don't tell you is that I am nearly 5k in credit card debt, and 80k in student loans. She works for an internship part-time, and is still on her parents very weak HSA insurance plan that has terrible coverage where we live. Her parents live over 1k+ miles away, and my parents/family/friends live 5 states over. We moved here for school/work, and just don't have a family network in place. That doesn't seem like a big issue, but it really is. I always wonder how these 19 year old kids make it with a young child, and I realize that it is because Grandma and Grandpa are there for their grand child, friends step in with help, and the parents are able to work as normal.

We are comfortable with our decision (especially easy since she is at most 5 weeks pregnant), but it is still tough. The hard part is that we were so close to being ready. If this happened a year or two from now, she would be in a job that would allow her to take paid maternity leave, and I'd have her on my fantastic health insurance plan.

The hard part is how different this is then I want it to be, and how we imagined finding out she was pregnant was. I wish it was a happy day, that I could have spun her around and we would have been excited with the news. Instead, it has been a rush of emotions-- mainly shock and disbelief.

I can't help but look at her differently. Not because I am mad at her, but because of how beautiful she is. She's pregnant! I want to tell everyone I see, but it just isn't meant to be. We both dream of being parents, but not yet. It's not a baby to us, and we just have to remain a little cold and unattached to cope with it.

We are trying to pretend it won't be difficult, but it is going to be a very tough time for us. It's too bad, and I know a lot of people won't be able to understand how two responsible adults could get in this situation. 

Someday, things will be different and we will be fantastic parents. We will be the couple that spends months reading everything we can, attend every parenting class we can find, and be all around more responsible while we try to get pregnant. We will be married, in stable careers, hopefully closer to our parents, and have our credit cards paid off and money in savings for college savings and unexpected complications in the pregnancy.

Until then, we can just begin to prepare for what lies ahead of us this week and try to be more careful moving forward.

**tl;dr**: We got pregnant, and are terminating the pregnancy. It just isn't time yet. We are sad, but know it is the right decision."
2okxca,462,2014-12-07,My experience with private roads and why libertarians have no idea what they're talking about,GhostofRFS,EnoughLibertarianSpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughLibertarianSpam/comments/2okxca/my_experience_with_private_roads_and_why/,"Hello fellow statists. I figure I'd take some time during my Sunday afternoon to bless you with some of my turds of wisdom and experience with a topic I frequently see here and on libertarian discussion boards.

**Some Background**: Several years ago before going to the production side of the industry (logging, mills, etc.), I was a forestry intern for a major timber company that owns millions of acres across the world. This was not a ""make coffee for your boss"" deal. I was actively managing land and spending time in the field every day, interacting with government officials, and essentially being groomed for a full time position before deciding to go to a different outfit. I learned a great deal about land use.

My main job was generally silviculture (managing contracts for roughly half a million acres of tree farm) but I spent a fair amount of time in our engineering department and land use departments. These are the guys that set up timber sales, build roads, and handle property access issues. 

The ""who will build the roads?"" question has become an inside joke for libertarians. So much so that they don't even debate or discuss it anymore. They just regurgitate ""privatize everything!"" without any thought to the implications or how this gets done in the real world. From my 2-3 years on Reddit, I've also noticed most of them don't even understand the basics of property management issues or that private roads even exist. So here's my breakdown...

**Complex private roads networks already exist in the US**: My state has thousands and thousands of miles of privately built and owned logging roads for secondary transport of wood fiber from the landing to their destination. There are even mills located at the end of logging roads where you will never hit a public highway.


**They are barely regulated**: I live in a state with some of the strictest harvest practices in the country. Outside of fish passage and some rules on unstable slopes, there are no limits on truck weights or how your road can be built. A lot of the mainlines are built on top of old railroad beds (rail logging was big in my state before the 40's) where they actually punched through large hills and over streams to flatten the land. Down in the southern US, it's even less burdensome. You can basically point a bulldozer where ever you want and make one.

**Easements, easements, easements**: For all the talk about privatization of roads, it's unbelievable how many libertarians I've seen online and in real life who don't even know what easements are. If you've ever shared a driveway with neighbors in a rural area, you might know what I'm talking about.

For tree farms, it's on a huge scale. Roads go through multiple ownerships and parcels. Legal contracts have to be written up between owners for access. Payment can be anything. Commonly it can be a one time fee to access a timber sale, agreeing to keep the road in good condition, paying per truck, paying per thousand board feet, the possibilities go on and on.

Even for the purposes of logging, easements are a huge mess. Entire departments exist just to handle road access issues. I've gone over hundreds of easements and while most are simple, others are not. My state is a checkerboard of private, state, and federal land. All of which require easements. This reduces redundancy of roads which means more space to farm trees.

**They're expensive**: Holy shit are they expensive. It's a huge burden, even for a multinational corporation and shortcuts will always be taken. I drove on some pretty sketchy cliffs to get to certain harvest units. I've never heard a libertarian explain how the cost would be managed in their ideal world. Remember, no large corporations exist without government in Libertopia (haha, I know).

Keep in mind, these aren't even paved roads. They're just gravel with barely enough room to squeeze a log truck through.

**Gates, gates, gates**: I can't tell you how many hours I spent unlocking, locking, and going through multiple and often redundant gates between property owners. The thought of highway-level traffic volumes going through these roads is laughable. Don't even get me on started on key management. 

**Security**: Yup, just like public roads, we have to pay for security to keep riff raff out. Another huge cost.

**Public access**: There is almost zero incentive to allow these roads to be open to the public. With my master keys, I could easily maneuver through multiple counties without ever hitting a public road, but the rest of the public - nope. The liability and security issues are too much. Occasionally some would be opened up for hunting season, but that is slowly going away.

So to wrap this up, the next time somebody tells you that private roads have never been given a chance, they're full of shit or just ignorant. This industry has used them for over a century in the western US along with private railroads and secondary transport in private waterways. They serve their purpose for one reason only - to get logs off the landing and to a mill. The only other industry I can think of that would have large road systems would be mining and I'd wager they deal with the same issues we do.

To think private business could handle the requirements of all of society's transportation needs is absolutely ridiculous, especially since they don't have the ability to use eminent domain.

At some point, I'd also like to discuss other issues from my business point of view that relate to libertarianism. Especially the topics of public lands, the history of environmental law, and labor. 

Anybody who knows the history of the timber industry knows that a lot of libertarian ideas have already been tried in the western US and were a disaster. For people, for the environment, and for markets. Private towns, company stores, ""homesteading,"" the list goes on. It's already been done.

tl;dr: Private road systems exist in the US. The thought of them being on a mass scale for society is ridiculous. Libertarians have strong opinions on topics they know nothing about.

2ol0yg,1,2014-12-07,"30 years old and Low paying job 2 years after college, keep hearing about 21 year olds landing $50-60K jobs from parents.",[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/2ol0yg/30_years_old_and_low_paying_job_2_years_after/,"TLDR: Parents keep telling me about 21 years olds getting $50-60K jobs out of college with no previous work experience and ask why I am not doing that. I get lots of job offers for low wage jobs but nothing for anything entry level professional.

Rant:
So, every-time I talk to my dad (I don't live with him, I have my own place) he brings up how he and my stepmom keep meeting 21-22 year old ""motivated young men and women"" who get great paying jobs out of college as their first job ever. Today it was a ""young man"" who was 21 who graduated with a business degree and got hired at $60,000 a business analyst working his first job ever.        

My self, I've been working low wage manual labor/retail jobs since high school, then lost my job in 2008. Spent a year trying to find a job (any job) and couldn't for a year, then enrolled in college on my own dime/student loans. Got a job as a dishwasher/manual labor making minimum wage part-time. Graduated in 2013 with a BS in Business and $40K in loans and moved back to live with a parent. I was unemployed for about 8 months after that (couldn't get hired anywhere again). Then I got hired doing manual labor, where I am today making about $18K a year working 6 days a week. Needless to say I am living paycheck to paycheck, have my own place and I am on income based repayment for my student loans (my income is so low I pay $0 for my student loans). Life has been hard. I'm 30 I feel my joints wearing out. I've had dreams of a white collar job, a office job in an air conditioned climate, but that has never materialized.       

Whats so frustrating about this, my parents never went to college and were able to get great paying white collar jobs out of high school and live nice middle class lives. According to them the economy is ""fine"" and they don't understand why I've had so much trouble finding decent paying work.       

Every conversation I have with them is basically a repeat ""We don't understand why you just don't get a good job, there's nothing wrong with the economy"" and ""We just met a young man/lady who just graduated from the local university whos making $50-60K right out of college, we don't understand why you aren't doing that.""     

I've had this conversation since I graduated college almost every-time I see them.      
 
I've applied for around 1000 job applications in the last 4 years. I've tried to get internships while in college and after college (was never given an offer). I've tried entry level professional positions, positions that are business/accounting related that only require a high school degree only to get turned down for ""not enough experience'. I was told my officeteam/roberthalf/accountemps and all the local temp agencies that because I didn't have the previous business experience that they wanted I was unsuitable to temp in any office positions they offer. I've tried going to countless job fairs, driving in person spending lots of money on gas to go talk to businesses in person to try to get my foot in the door (which 99% say go apply online). I've tried networking with people I know and tried my alumni association. I've tried everything.       
 
So, It seems like I will be stuck in low wage jobs forever. According to my parents every Dick and Harry that goes to college lands a high paying job with no previous work experience when they are in their early 20s. Even though I had a bunch of past work experience and graduated close to 30, I am considered unemployable to every employer for any professional entry level job. I feel like I'm getting screwed in life. I had to rant.       "

2olr1u,6,2014-12-07,Conflicted about who to ask for letters of rec,blahthisisathrowaway,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/2olr1u/conflicted_about_who_to_ask_for_letters_of_rec/,"Hi there,

I am an EE major at a community college. I have a 3.8 GPA, I tutor math and physics, and I am involved in various engineering-related activities. 

I would really like to apply for my first internship, but I am a bit apprehensive. I know I need a letter of recommendation, but I'm not sure who I should ask. My physics professor would be ideal (and I've done extremely well in his class in my first semester), but I've been slipping up this semester, and I don't feel that he and I share a great relationship. For example, every time I talk to him, he tries to keep the conversation brief and send me on my way. He doesn't reciprocate a hello when I walk past him in the hallways (he usually looks at me for five seconds and then quickly looks the other direction). I don't even think he knows my name, despite the fact that I visit him at office hours/email him frequently. 

In contrast, I am very close with my chemistry professors. This might be because they are women, and I've always felt more comfortable with female teachers over male teachers. They have also known me far longer than my physics professor, and can therefore comment on my aptitude as a student a little better. The only problem is that the research opportunities I want to apply for are physics/EE related, and not really chem related at all. 

Other alternatives: I was also pretty close to my Calc I-II, DiffEq, and Comp Sci professors, but I've only known them for about a semester each, so I'm not sure if it's still good to ask them? I have earned A's in all of these classes, so would it even matter?

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!"
2om0h3,14,2014-12-07,"Tripping at the Dinner Table, and other strange happenings.",dinnertabletripping,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/2om0h3/tripping_at_the_dinner_table_and_other_strange/,"Decided to write about a very curious trip that happened around this time a few years back. Not looking for criticism, just want to share a pretty crazy story with you guys.

""I walked outside to a crisp, beautiful Sunday morning. I thought ""Well, I don't have anything important to do today, and its a beautiful day, I might as well trip."", so I dropped a hit of lucy and began to walk down through the neighborhood to go trip in the woods. I passed my friend's house and he ended up being home. I heard a call to me and we sat on the back porch to smoke cigarettes. Pulled out a pipe and some bud and packed a bowl from my bag for us to pass time with. I was kinda getting fed up with waiting, and I figured the best way to kickstart my trip was through the magical herb of marijuana. It kickstarted my trip, and we went to go to a spot in the woods where our other friends would meet us. 

We arrived at the spot and met up with one other friend, and chilled in the woods. Mostly because we were bored, and I was perfectly fine with it while tripping. By this time, I was definitely beginning the come-up, and was enjoying watching the ground warp. We sat on a log going half way across a creek, and smoked jays as I watched the running water get disturbed by a stick sticking out of the water. The water broke apart from itself and flowed into timid ripples, forming a fibonacci-esce pattern. At this point in the trip, I began to realize something. A manifestation, an ominous stray thought, a string on the infinite continuum  of thoughts had been plucked. My conscious called to me, “The universe is infinitely complicated.”. Anything can be infinitely and continuously perceived, from minor details to large characteristics, and possibilities of different thoughts are endless. Simple thoughts started as a thread that stemmed on, and on, and on, and on, basic details became intensely complex, as I grasped the idea that all humans as a whole have only scraped the surface of consciousness and possibilities of what we can perceive, sense, and view. The universe is only as vast as you’re willing to explore. This realization ultimately changed the way I would think about situations I was in for the better, and taking into consideration every possibility, reaction, and counter reaction. This, intern, eased my somewhat  intense paranoia in my day to day life from then on. 

As I began my peak in the woods, we heard rustling from the other side of the creek, which was home to another neighborhood. My friend noticed kids on the other side moving towards us. As they got closer, we saw that they had BB guns, and were hiding behind the trees. At this point, I’m surprised I wasn’t bugging out, thinking the kids were cops and coming down to take us out. Then, when they started shooting at us, I’m even more surprised I was having an amazing time taunting the kids while hiding behind an uprooted stump. We ran out of the woods to meet with another friend, while dodging the onslaught of plastic beads flying towards us. The next few hours consisted of buying cigarettes, walking around, and smoking blunts. A good thing to note; cannabis definitely increases my trip for the better, I’ve heard many other things from different people, but I take comfort in the fact that it doesn’t affect me negatively. Maybe because I use cannabis almost every day. Who knows.

Anyway, to preface the next string of events, I was still living in my parent’s house. My parents are also very traditional, in that they like me home for dinner if I’m bunking with them. The typical “my house, my rules” rule. I totally forgot to tell my mother that I planned to eat out so I could enjoy my trip. I walked home through the neighborhood, watching people setting up Christmas decorations and lights on their houses while blasting electrical instrumental psychedelic music. It was a beautiful experience, and as a side note I’d suggest this to anyone who may be tripping around the holiday season. Although, while trying to control my posture and walk cycle, I found my self twitching with excitement and slight discomfort alike. I had been walking all day with a backpack, and my spine had begun to ache purely from the exhausting effort of tripping in the first place. 

Every part of my brain was focused on acting normal once I walked through my door, by that time I was still tripping. I sat in my basement, practically laying in my chair due to the discomfort in my spine. I sat, and waited to be called to the table. 

Thanksgiving leftovers. What was probably a normal proportion seemed like my plate was about to overfill. Eating while tripping was weird enough for me, but eating at a dinner table was taking it to a whole other level. Acting normal was increasingly complicated as I shoveled turkey into my mouth, which I could barely feel, and cut pieces of meat which I thought I could fit in my mouth without choking. It was horrifying. It was tedious. I danced on the extremely delicate line of good and bad trip. Being stoned at the table is one thing, but tripping at the dinner table truly kicked the intensity of the whole experience of gathering to eat up to a whole other level, especially when your father was a retired law enforcement officer. Worrying about my actions, like cutting my food, looking upward from my plate and staring at the pet bird, making sure at almost molecular levels that I was acting the way I was suppose to be acting while at the same time, not. While completely keeping my cool, I conversed with my mother while the space around her head began to fill with blue, purple and green square patterns and vectors and the wood table’s grains warping. It was like holding a glass of water while riding a skateboard, trying not to let any water drop from the glass. It was meticulous, convoluted, and just plain nuts, and somehow I handled it with such finesse. It was an experience that I’m somewhat glad happened, but I’m not interested in rehashing. It helped me realize my abilities of physical and mental control on psychedelics, whose purpose is to release the burden of control.

Ended up leaving after I ate to go to a friends house to do, what else, smoke blunts. Told my friends about the experience, which was hard due to me coming down and giggling randomly. I went home, and in a bout of insomnia, didn’t sleep all night. Went to school in the morning, completely exhausted and functioning purely on caffeine and sugar, on the verge of passing out all day. "" 

TL;DR - Dropped lucy, got shot at by kids in the woods (really), smoked a lot of weed, and ate dinner with my straightedge family while still tripping. Wild experience. "
2om93l,1,2014-12-07,"My [19 M] girlfriend [19 F] broke up 2 months ago, but I see her every day. How can I move on?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2om93l/my_19_m_girlfriend_19_f_broke_up_2_months_ago_but/,"I met my ex-girlfriend about a year ago at a social event for our university marching band. Everything about her seemed absolutely perfect when we first met: we lived in the exact same county without knowing it, loved the marching band programs in our previous schools, had (&amp; still have) a very close knit group of friends, &amp; had the same taste in music, to name a few details. We enjoyed literally every second of our company last semester, and we would always make time to go on exciting dates, meet each other's families, and see each other in private.

Unfortunately, over the summer (in-between semesters), I could immediately tell that the relationship was turning for the worst. I worked as a teacher for a residential camp while my ex worked as a zoologist intern in her hometown. Because of the location of the campgrounds, we initially were worried about not being able to communicate with each other, but thankfully a new cell-phone tower was added, so we were able to call each other with the little free time we had. We lived about 8 hours from each other, but on certain weekends during breaks, we would meet up in the middle somewhere.

During one of the breaks, I decided to visit her and her family at her hometown to be more acquainted with her family and see where she lived with respect to my old hometown. I purchased the tickets, and was picked up to see her and her family for 48 hours.

This is where I began to see who my ex really was when she wasn't around other people. She proved to be very selfish, spoiled, and not-situationally aware.

The best example I can give was on the last night before flying back &amp; returning to my job. Since I was staying at her parent's house, I wanted to make dinner for her whole family as a small token of thanks. The meal requires a lot of help from other people, from slicing bread to cutting vegetables, so I knew it would be the best way to interact with my ex and her family. While my ex's mother and younger sister were eagerly helping out, anytime I asked my ex, she explicitly said: ""**No.**"" and proceeded to watch TV (this occurred on multiple occasions). Any time that I wanted to give a quick peck on my ex's cheek, **she gave me an angry look and turned away** (I know she was nervous about her mother or sister seeing, but neither of them were in the room when I tried this). Once everyone was eating the meal, almost everyone said that it was one of the best meals that anyone has cooked, while my ex said in monotone: ""**It's okay.**"" To top this all off (context: I'm an only son), when I insisted on cleaning up for the family, since the tradition of cooking means cooking and cleaning for the guests, her mother joking says: ""See? He actually volunteers to clean up!"" My ex immediately barked back:

""**Well, that's probably just because that's how only children are raised.**""

I later learned that during the summer, my ex cheated on me with one of her closest friends at home, which she has remarked him as ""The guy who just gets me"" on many occasions while we were dating, even when we were alone. The problems didn't even stop from there. Upon arrival from the summer, all of the conversations we had proved to be very one-sided, where she expected all of my input and proper reactions. Yet whenever I wanted to tell her about my stories, she just twirled her hair and give me a cop-out answer in monotone. When we spent time with each other, 90% of the time she was on her smartphone or her laptop focusing on something else. I tried just about everything: calling her a lot to not calling at all, being very intimate or show no intimacy at all, giving her gifts to not giving anything for an extended period of time, and she barely reciprocated during any of these actions.

I recently broke it off, but I'm having a very hard time moving on.

We are both still involved in our marching band this semester and have a very close group of friends. I don't want to quit marching band because it has been a life-changing time for me at my university, and I am auditioning for drum major next semester (field conductor). I don't want to distance myself away from my friends because they have been some of the closest friends in my life. A lot of me knows the reasons why I decided to end it in the first place, but she seems to be just fine since the end of our relationship. I still have the good memories of her when I was truly in love with her, but moving on is tough when I feel like I can't distance myself as much as I should.

What can I do to move on?

---   
**tl;dr**: I broke up with my girlfriend of 9 months, but we are in the marching band and have a lot of close friends. What is the best way of distancing myself without losing friends or band?"
2omynu,6,2014-12-08,UPDATE: College grad starting my first job. Here's my finance sheet. What can I improve?,Personalfinancer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2omynu/update_college_grad_starting_my_first_job_heres/,"I'm 22, just graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, and I started my first job in mid-October, 2014. I'm working full time in the bay area at one of the Big-4 tech companies. I also interned this summer (Jun-Sept 2014) at that same company. 

Here's the situation:
134k/yr in income (92.5k base salary + overtime, for overtime I assumed 52hrs per week, which so far seems a safe estimate, might actually be higher than this)  
0k in student loans (got full financial aid since my family had a pretty low income and I went to a top 5 engineering school),  

My company pays for public transportation ($100 per month stipend) so most transportation costs come from taxis/uber. They also pay for my cellphone bill
Currently I'm on an 8mo sublease while I find a good place. Housing is insane in San Francisco. I'm paying $1695 for 1 room in a 4br. Luckily, it at least already includes utilities and wifi. It's also furnished so I didn't have to spend money on furnishing an apartment. My company also pays for lunch and dinner so I very rarely have to spend money during the week. This means I usually spend a little more than I normally would on restaurants during the weekend.

Due to lack of knowledge on how to choose a Roth IRA I'm currently putting in 20% of my salary into my 401k. I know I should do up to my company's match (which is 6%) and then max out the Roth IRA.  

There's 1 pay cycle left in this year so I upped my 401k contribution to 50% in an effort to get a little closer to 17500.. realistically this will get me to around 6k for my 401k. I should've thought about this earlier. 


Credit Card loans: 0  
Savings Account: 24,991  
Checking Account: 23,082  
401k: $3731  
Total Net Worth: $51,804  

Most of the money from my savings and checking account is from my internship. I wasn't allowed to partake in the company's 401k as an intern so it kinda just accumulated (also, my starting bonus). What can I do with this? It's much more than I need for an emergency. I plan on maxing out my 2014 Roth IRA and 2015 Roth IRA very soon. Should I use savings or checking account cash for this. I really don't see the point of having two separate accounts. But I would still have 38k in cash after that. How else can I invest that?

Assuming around 40% of my income is withholded then
take home monthly is pay: $6,184  

Expenses:  
80/month: Uber/lyft/taxi  
1695/month: Rent  
0/month: Cable  
0/month: Phone bill  
300/mo: Groceries/restaurant  
18.48/mo: Gym membership (subsidized by company)  
150/mo: Bars (I really need to work on this)  

I just moved into the city so I still haven't reached a stable lifestyle in which I can deduce accurate monthly expenses so I focused on the stuff I know I have to spend every month (housing, food, etc)

I also try to take vacations as often as my job lets me. Which isn't too often. I calculate I will spend around 4k-5k on vacations per year. 


My company allows me to invest in a traditional 401k and/or a Roth 401k. What's the difference between a Roth IRA and a Roth 401k? How do I choose and open up a Roth IRA if it's not done through my company? My company has an employee stock purchase program which I plan to max out once the new cycle starts in January.

I know I'm already at a great start and I'm very fortunate to be in this position but I think there's always room for improvement.

Thanks!

The parking lot had only a few cars, and I was the only person on the floor.  Just about everyone went to the annual training conference at the national headquarters for the week.  Initially, I was upset that I was stuck here because of a meeting with a client tonight, meaning I missed three days and three nights eating and drinking on the company’s dime.  However, I’ve cleared my schedule, rare for a younger executive.  Now, it seems that I only have to stay available and I have the rest of the day, and probably the next two, to myself.  I do wish I dressed a bit more casually, instead of the grey suit, tie and shirt that I chose.  

I’m finishing my second cup of coffee, feeling a bit satisfied that I might get some golf in when I hear the unmistakable sound of high heels walking down the hallway.  You turn the corner into my office and I see it is:

-The fall intern, here on her last day for the semester, double checking if I need anything and confirming my letter of recommendation will be provided;

-My girlfriend, surprising me;

-My ex, surprising me;

-My pushy, demanding boss, who is difficult to deal with but dead sexy;

-Someone else I was not expecting (Your choice).

If any of these interest you, let me know.  Include a description of who you are, what you look like, and what’s happening.  If you need to explore anything kinky, we might need to get a hotel across the street.

2oni5i,0,2014-12-08,How Target was Probably Breached,ThatTargetITGuy,inthenews,https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/2oni5i/how_target_was_probably_breached/,"How Target was Probably Breached

By ThatTargetITGuy

I am a 3rd Generation IT professional. My grandparents worked for Bell Telephone Company, now AT&amp;T, and did government research. My father worked in IT his whole life working his way up from an Intern and then System's Analyst to being a CIO for a Fortune 500 company before retiring. My family got its first desktop when I was 7. I got my first IT job at 10, teaching people how to type and use computers in exchange for free gaming hours at a local internet cafe. I also did house calls for computer repairs. My first job where I paid my first taxes was at Target in 2007. I now run my own IT firm and work for a leading IT services provider.

A little over 4 years ago I left Target, after being with the company for about 5 years. I left due to the culture and being discriminated against. But, that is not what this article is about, nor is it about my credentials. A year and a half before that I discovered an information security flaw at Target. One that could be easily used to apply the well known ""Target Breach"".

I'm not sure if this flaw was used for the breach, but I assume it was. The easiest way to breach something is usually by far the best. Why take a more difficult way, when the easiest way is just as prosperous and anonymous for the most part.

So here it is, the moment you have all been waiting for. How did I breach Target's security? WiFi.

Wireless connections, especially WiFi, are especially dangerous. The are designed to be easy to connect to and use which results in them being inherently easy to exploit. There are ways to secure WiFi better. They include MAC Address filters, PEAP and EAP, VLANs and more. Banks and Pharmaceutical companies employ these tactics and many more regularly due them being regulated companies and subject to random audits by the FDA, FDIC, and other government organizations. If these companies fail the audits, the consequences are very severe and can result in fines, restrictions and more. They can even lose their business licenses. There are other companies that are not regulated that take the appropriate steps to secure data. But most do not.

Target is not regulated. The majority of consumer companies are not. That being said, Target's WiFi security was no better than the average person's home WiFi. You see Target Team Members walking around with those little handheld computers all the time. Target Team Members call them PDA's. Those PDA's connect to a hidden WiFi network that is in each Target store. The network is hidden, so you cannot see them without knowing the SSID or using software such as kismet. But, the SSID is only secured with a WPA2 password.

This Wireless network spans the entire Target store. From the backroom, to the registers, to the little cafe. I had also only just started getting into information security at that point. I had been teaching myself for about a month. It took me less than a couple hours to breach the security with nothing more than a netbook running Backtrack, now Kali Linux, in a backpack that I had stowed away while working. I came to work, engaged the software, stowed my bag, and got to work. On my lunch break I took a look at my netbook and found I had breached Target's WiFi and could access Target's logistics network. At that point, I had access to Target's entire shipping and logistics corporate network. From there, you could connect to a number of other corporate networks and VLANs and access anything from billing and financial networks, to network printers in Target stores and offices. Installing a backdoor or malware would be easy at that point.

I brought this flaw up with my store's management. At first they were intrigued, but shortly after they insisted everything was okay and that wireless network only had access to the logistics network and nothing else. I dropped it. Either someone told them to cover up and hide the situation, someone higher up told them nothing was wrong, or they were just ignorant. Whatever happened internally amongst management, I let it be. A couple years later, Target made CNN and world news with several other retailers about a breach.

So what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves? Sadly, virtually nothing unless you are really good in IT, but then your options are still limited and include things like reverse engineering software.

Securing data and systems the right way costs a lot of money and time. Many companies do not put effort or resources into it because their profits will suffer. They do the bare minimum required of them by law, which isn't much if you aren't a regulated company, to cut spending and increase profits. Profits are all that most companies care about because that's all most shareholders care about. A prime example, Target. To give you an idea of how flawed information security is, any car post 2010ish that the police can slow down and stop if stolen via OnStar or similar service, can be hacked and driven by a hacker. Whether it's a Ford, Honda, BMW, or Rolls Royce, it can be hacked. If they say it can't, they are lying. That same uplink police use to slow down your car can be activated and hijacked by hackers quite easily. Planes can be hacked and hijacked with android phones. While many of these flaws that were reported have been since patched, there are always new ways to hack things and new flaws to exploit.

You know that hyper-connected world in a recent video game called Watch Dogs? We already live in that hyper-connected world. Privacy is an illusion. Hackers can hack traffic lights, cars, your phones, and anything else connected to a network. I can hack your iPhone, Android, Blackberry or Windows phone quicker than you can sneeze. Many of the online services you sign up for make you agree to terms that include them owning your data and using it for monetization and research. Does that scare you? It should. Should that stop you from living your life? No.

What you should do though is speak out and condemn the organizations of our world that take the easy way out in securing themselves and our data in this hyper-connected world we live in. We should not switch ourselves back to the pre-digital era, but reform our current era into a more secure one.

These organizations know how quick the masses switch their attention. The Target and other retailers breach, Occupy movement, Crimea, NFL scandals, Ebola, all seem like a distant past, and soon the inequality issues, Bill Cosby's rape allegations and the acts of men treating women as objects on everyone's mind will be replaced with something else. The mass media shifts from 24/7 coverage of one thing to something else overnight and all anyone pays attention to is what the mass media shows. They wait out for the switch selling us lies saying they will fix it and make changes or it didn't happen. When the mass media switch comes, they crawl back into the darkness and disappear, and the masses forget.

Many of the entities I have stated here are going to try refute or skew what I have written in their favor. I know that already. It's how the mass media and PR works. For those of you who doubt it, research what I have written. There are many reputable resources and reports out there. Google is your best friend. I do not and never will condone putting lives in danger for research, so don't go trying to hack someone's car, someone's financials, or a plane. Leave that to the information security professionals whose job it is to find those flaws in a controlled environment and fix them.

Information Security rarely gets put on a grand stage. When it does, it disappears faster than most. Why? People who aren't affected by it have difficulty relating to it. It feels like science fiction. It isn't. So next time you connect to public WiFi, download a file, open an email or hand over your credit card information or social security number; think in the back of your mind ""Is what I am doing safe, or is it the safest way I can be doing it?"""

2ooekt,4,2014-12-08,I'm fed up,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ooekt/im_fed_up/,"I don't know exactly what I'm going to type just yet, but I have to warn you that it's probably going to end up as a wall of text. So here goes the tale of my multiple setbacks. Oh, I also hope nobody that knows me reads this. It's just got too much details, but here goes:

So, it all starts 3 years ago... I think. I'm falling back on my last semester of mathematics at university. I was going to the courses, but I didn't really get anything they taught. I was also depressed, although I would realize it only later on. I spent my time chatting to random people on Omegle (exactly what you need to get some sanity in your life *cough*. I could do a whole thread with all the crazy stories I've got from there. But since most of them are irrelevant to how I'm feeling today, that will have to be for another day) trying to actually have some connection to fill in the blanks. I met some nice people, some more toxic ones. At the end of the semester, I told my parents I couldn't take it anymore and that I'd drop off college for the time being. They didn't take it lightly, but I knew I had to do something else.

At the same time, I was talking regularly to some people from Omegle. Mostly, three people. A girl (which I had a crush on, at the time. Yes, I know, silly), a programmer, and another girl (who I, luckily, didn't have a crush on, but still makes for great conversation!). Because of my falling out with... everything, I decide that taking some vacations couldn't hurt, so why not visit that programmer I got to know, who lives in Eastern Europe. 16 hours of various transportation modes later, I'm there. And my host isn't a serial killer. Yay! Great week. Pumps me up to actually keep on going. Except I found out that the girl I had a crush on definitely doesn't feel the same way about me, but who would expect otherwise from an internet thing? (Oh, did I mention the 40cl of vodka I drank one night? Completely unrelated to my sorrows. But that's not a good idea folks. But at least I knew it from that point on.)

Plus, being on the internet for so long every day made me read up on psychology... I ended up spending some time talking to people about the MBTI... And oh, does this girl like me or is she being playful?

More on this later. In ""real life"" things are falling apart and I've got to put myself together. Luckily I find an internship, where I can really get better at software engineering. Great! Studying psychology related things, I've ended up finding what I think was the main contributor to my depression, which was ADD. My current psychologist thinks it's ludicrous, another finds it much more plausible and encourages me to see a specialist. Well... later. Because my parents and my psychologist want me to go on vacation. Like, tomorrow. For a month.

Eh. And I've already started that internship. Luckily enough it's remote work, so all that I had to do is explain to my family abroad, which I'd be visiting for the next month, that I've got work to do (half of my family lives in Canada, and I live in Europe) it works out alright overall, but back to the internet side of things. 

So yeah, turns out this girl really likes me. She's smart and I know it because we've talked so much about psychology and other unrelated things, so I can't help but feeling slightly attracted (Silly me. Why do I have to feel attracted to someone who lives in the US? There's an ocean in between us...) it does make me feel a lot better about myself that, well, at least someone loves me except for my family. And she's supportive about my ADD that I'm trying to get in shape, I couldn't be happier. Super coincidence, my company's going at a conference in San Francisco in a few months, and my boss approved for me to go there! I could even do a stop to stay around where she lives, so I book my flights and hotel, and I finally get back home from my ""vacations"" in Canada.

I arrive back home, time goes by... but it's time for ""the talk"". Turns out that girl had a bit too many expectations for me to reasonably follow up on. I'm allergic to dogs, and she can't live without them. I don't really want to live in the US, and she can't live anywhere that's far from her family. Ouch. That was quite a painful band aid to pull off, but it would have been easier to forget about it if I wasn't an asshole about telling her how much she's wrong in long details.

Well, anyway, I've got that conference in the US coming up, and even one in Eastern Europe (which I'll be speaking at!) so no time to be sad. I'll just get on with it, and nail it. So I prepare my talk... and completely fail because I chose to do a live demo (which are known to fail, of course). My self-esteem takes a blow, ouch, again. Luckily I've got a good week-end coming up after the conference, where a local girl will show me around the Oktoberfest in Munich. (A friend of someone I met on Omegle. She got introduced to me cause she couldn't get her cellphone working) So I'm looking forward to that!

And, one horror movie later, we hit it off. Sadly, we only get the week-end together, and decide to give ourselves some time to think about where we want the relationship to go in the future, because I've got to go to that conference... and I'm still stuck with the flight I had booked to visit that other girl who lived in the US. Luckily (another!) internet friend from that region of the US saves the day, and as he's accustomed to hosting couchsurfers, he offers to let me drop by. It was good having some company at that point on because nostalgia was weighing on my. Sadly, I haven't been a very talkative or helpful guest... I guess the circumstances didn't help. To this day, I'm still hoping to repay him somehow, some day.

Going back home, around October, I was happy that I could see my therapist and finally start treating my ADD, and also for the fact that me and my now girlfriend could meet up again in Munich (Remote work FTW). We stayed together for a few months, but unfortunately it didn't work out... She didn't believe I had ADD, she was manipulative when it came to what she wanted... well I don't know what else to say. Love/hate relationship much? Anyway, I was better off alone, that time. I suspect she cheated on me seeing how fast things fell off the cliff at some point, and how fast she got back with another guy... but I'll never really know I guess. 

And that's when karma would bite my ass (I guess she had been talking with the other girl from the US) she felt like it would be appropriate to tell me all that's wrong with me in an e-mail (With that condescending ""you'll thank me later"")... and there goes another blow. Not that I really believed all of it. I knew some of it to be true, so that's always things I can work on... but overall I couldn't keep that in my mind. It was just too damaging. And, well after that I felt like I should send a written apology to the other girl to which I pretty much did the same. At least she didn't seem to upset that I did send her that apology. I guess that works out alright in some way.

At that point, it was tough dealing with the break up of your ""first one"", but at least I learnt that they'd keep me as a full-time employee. So at least I still had something to keep me going. Since I was home more often, I also got to hang out with my friends more often. It's not all bad in the end. Plus, as I had been living with my parents the whole time (except for when I was in Germany) I thought I'd book a trip through the US, going to the same conference in San Francisco and a working remotely from a couple of other cities in the US, visiting my family in Canada, and finally getting a couple of days of vacations before flying back home. It was a great time... Heck, I even got an interview at Google in the meantime (Well, I didn't pass, but the standards are pretty high so I didn't take it personally) I was even thinking about working in the US, but it appears that it's not quite for me. I don't think I'm a good fit for the culture there... but if I ever need to, I know I can hold my own :) Coming back from this long 3-month trip, going from an AirBnB host to another, I was quite happy with myself. Heck, I even got some more responsibilities at work! I was also nearing completion of my driver's licence, and would soon get a nice car for myself (Silly me took a lease on it, you'll see why it's a problem soon... I like cars too much I guess!)

But that's when things start getting wrong again, we're now in 2014. The responsibilities ended up being repetitive little tasks, not quite something that's motivating once you're done with them, as you only ever get more little pesky tasks. It wasn't so much about software engineering anymore... but more about customer support, administration, paper pushing... not my thing. I start falling behind, trying to get a new job, but none of them call me back, except for one interview which ends up basically saying that I didn't have enough experience for the job at hand. I'm not completely surprised, but it wasn't fun. Even going to the conference in the US this year wasn't as fulfilling as the previous years, underneath the pressure to complete all those little daily tasks, that needed some supervision (even that year I was on vacation with my family in Canada, or when I visited my friend from Eastern Europe). I needed some more vacations, so I took some. I went to a city in Europe I liked, where I could drive to with my car, and meet some people I had been playing with for a while. It sure was nice. But after those vacations my boss was growing displeased with the quality of my job... and I needed out. I chose to get back to studies. One year to finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, one other to do my Master's. At least I won't have any more maths to do, even if I didn't finish my previous studies, I could negotiate admission in Computer Science, with only one year to complete.

So, I'm fed up because of those last years. And now I'm left with:

- A car I have to break the lease on, which will basically cost me most of my savings (could also have saved more if I wasn't so bad with spending... oh well)
- A job I don't really like for 2 more months
- Not really knowing how studies will go... A bit anxious about it, but at least I did a lot of work on my ADD since last time.
- Having to commute an hour and a half to get to university
- I should really get in shape. I went to the gym off-and-on... I should stick to a plan.
- And finally a crush on a girl I met in my last trip in Europe that I mentioned. Salt in the wound, eh? I'll forget. Eventually. I'm just avoiding logging in to that one game we used to play together for the time being.

I don't know what else to say. I'm just a little fed up. And disappointed... in other people and myself.

2ooiqs,1,2014-12-08,Show webview-viewcontroller as popover from tableview.,[deleted],iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/2ooiqs/show_webviewviewcontroller_as_popover_from/,"I'm an intern and fairly new iOS developer but not inexperienced with programming. I'm working on an app in which the customer, among other things, wants a collection of links to videos shown in a tableview. When a link is selected int the tableview a viewcontroller with a webview displays the video. This is done with

    [self.navigationController pushViewController:videoVC animated:YES];

A lot of neat stuff can be done easily in the storyboard such as positioning things and what not. But handling things half in storyboard and half in code proves tricky. Things like linking a button with a segue to push another viewcontroller is easy. ~~But not exactly so~~ But somewhat cumbersome in code.
If only I could drag a segue from my tableview - which is placed on the viewcontroller in storyboard but handled and filled out using code - to my viewcontroller containing the webview and select popover... well then I wouldn't be asking here.

I should mention that I use this viewcontroller with the webview for other things as well. The videostuff from the tableview is only one usecase. In the other two usecases I display webpages in full screen. I suppose I could add another viewcontroller for the videostuff if needed. It's just nice to reuse code.

If anyone has a better solution to displaying videos on-top of the view with the tableview in the style of how popups work or anything even better I'm all ears."

I am an Argentinian, 22 years old girl who thinks that her life is horrible.
I don't know what is happening to me since I think such things.
I always lived in my grandparent’s house because economical problems, so I don’t know how feels “ arrive home “. My grandfather is almost deaf so I feel dazed all the time I am in the house. My brother who lives with me suffers from schizophrenia and passes through all the stages you can imagine. My mother is alcoholic and nobody in the family helps her. So I have to handle with a lot of things.
Despite all that, I am a person who is always smiling, no matter why and always have good thoughts, but something is going wrong with me. And I can´t sleep at night

I swear the only thing I want in life is to move somewhere and live alone. I imagine a tiny and empty department, I don’t want anythig, just rest and enjoy the silence. I want to move from this house since I’m 8. I think I am getting sick living here.
But I can afford that, its really sad. I am studying Chemical Engineering and working in automotive industry as a intern so I don’t earn enought money to make my dream come true.
Then I feel desperate, I cry, I feel really sad about my situation that I can’t change. I know I am a good person, I am pretty, friendly, I’m okey with my body, never went in drugs. The only thing I need is to get out of here and learn what a home feels like, really need that. 
This is my bagagge I have to carry all my life, and I don’t know what to do.
I have no more energy to struggle with all this, I already give it all. I feel really tired.
I feel defeated, like if this situation is never going to change.
I am doing all my effort for living, I want to be happy, is important for me.

2op3ed,1,2014-12-08,"Non-traditional, soon-to-be graduate, looking for info, advice, etc.",[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2op3ed/nontraditional_soontobe_graduate_looking_for_info/,"**bold**About me: 
I returned to school when I was 26 and decided to go the accounting route.  I started at community college and transferred to the cheapest state school in my area with probably the worst business/accounting program in the state.  When I chose this school, I didn't know I wanted to go public, nor did I understand the importance of on-campus recruiting for large, reputable firms, and my biggest concern was minimizing school loans.

Fast forward to today, I am almost 30, a senior at said crap school and graduating in May with albeit a very high gpa (3.95 as of now, may go down slightly by graduation.) As an older student I have continued to financially support myself throughout this process, and as a result, didn't have the time or financial security to stop working to do ""proper"" internships during my junior year, as is typically done.  I did ""intern"", if you want to call it that, for a CPA this past summer.  It was a miserable experience but I attribute that to who I was working for.  I didn't hate the work, but she was probably the worst, most condescending and disrespectful person I've ever met.  She also had 2 cats who she let roam around her office and who would often vomit on the carpet.  Needless to say I didn't stay there very long.

I have had a total of 3 interviews during recruiting season: 
* the largest regional in my area.  I was offered a summer internship after graduation (not really what I was interested in but accepted as I had no other offers at the time.)
*a smaller regional with no offer, and very unprofessional in terms of lack-of follow ups, in my opinion (didn't even bother sending me a rejection letter).
*a large national, who contacted my career center during late recruiting season.  They didn't come on campus but were asking for resumes.  I interviewed and was offered a full-time position in tax the very next day.  I really liked everyone I interviewed with and many other people I met.

Note: I contacted my internship recruiter and told them that I had received a full-time offer but that I was still interested in interning, mainly so I didn't burn any bridges.  I thought being upfront was the best way to handle the situation.  Turns out I was right.  They did rescind the internship but she invited me to keep in touch and let them know if anything changes.

I will have 120 credits at graduation and will be eligible to sit for the CPA exam, but will obviously need to return to school at some point to get the remaining 30 credits for licensure.  I plan to study for most of the summer, as I will now have loads of free time, and hopefully sit for 2 sections before I start working.  I'm aiming to sit for the remaining 2 soon after I start working, but before busy season.

**Questions**

*Will starting at a large national limit my career at all? I don't really have much interest in moving into mega-corporate, and I actually plan to stay in public for at least most of my career (I enjoy the client relationships and challenging work).  I am starting in tax and anticipate enjoying the planning/strategy involved.

*For those of you who have entered public through non-traditional means, how has your career unfolded? I expect to be at a slight disadvantage as I will have less financial flexibility and a stricter timeline to reach my goals.

*How difficult is it to manage a full-time public accounting career while going to school for a masters program? I'm leaning towards MST.  

*Should I reconsider the decision to postpone 5th year to start working sooner?  Obviously it would be easier to postpone working and just do my 5th year now, but I feel like I don't have time to waste time, and I obviously have the drive to work and go to school as I've been doing it for 4 years.  However, I understand that a public accounting career will be much more demanding that what I'm currently doing.  

*Any other advice, info, tips, etc. on how I should plan the next 5 years of my life are greatly appreciated.  My boyfriend and I currently live together with no plans of starting a family in the near future.  I intend to devote most of my efforts towards building my career and am very excited and enthusiastic about where my hard work and dedication will take me.

Sorry for the lengthy post.  I've been lurking around here for a few weeks now and think many people have valuable input to many different problems.  I've researched and read everything I could but sometimes it helps to get actual feedback related to your specific situation.  "

Part of me has been conflicted, wondering if I really want to contribute to helping these extremely wealthy people avoid taxes. I support higher taxes on the rich, and I believe that the wealth inequality in the U.S. is a big problem, and being part of it feels kind of wrong.

At the same time, I understand that HNWI will always look to save on taxes, so (my) solution would be to raise tax rates, not just expect the wealthy to not try to lower their tax expenses.

Do any of you feel this way? I'm open to any opinions

2oq25j,0,2014-12-08,Need advice on how to navigate friendship with a coworker I've slept with,oviedo_,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2oq25j/need_advice_on_how_to_navigate_friendship_with_a/,"I graduated from college in May and moved to a new state in September, and am living with family.  I started a new job here and am enjoying it so far.  It's a small company (about 25 people), and most are older and married, or young and in relationships.  However, one guy is 32 and single. He's funny, easy going, and really good at his job.

I am 22 and doing an internship at the company, with the likelihood of becoming full time in January.

I don't have any friends in the area, as I'm new, so I've been trying to connect with some coworkers. One girl in particular is really fun and awesome, but she has a long term relationship, and doesn't like to go out or do very much. 

The funny guy I mentioned above (I'll call him Nick) and I have hung out a few times, and seem to have fun together.  Last weekend, he invited me to a bar he and his out of town friend were going to.  He said ""he'd hook us up, I think you'll get along great"".  So I hang out with them that night, we all drink a lot, but instead of hooking up with his friend, I end up in his bed.  We were both pretty drunk so we fool around a little, but end up just crashing.

The next morning we spend an hour or two in his bed.  We kiss, flirt, hook up a little more. Talk about random stuff.  Both state that ""it's a bad idea"", but more in a general sense, and not in a ""this was a mistake that cannot be repeated."" 

I'm worried about him being weird on Monday, but after a day or two of normal work days, it seems back to normal.  We work together, and he's obviously above me, but he's in no way my boss, and there isn't a real power dynamic to be fooled with.

I understand that getting involved with a coworker is risky, especially one that's 10 years older than I am, and I am a new intern. 

I guess I'm just having trouble trying to navigate genuinely wanting to be friends with him, because he's fun and cool, and not making it seem like I'm trying to sleep with him, and I don't know how approach it. I feel like if I ask him about weekend plans, or invite him out, it will seem like I think it's a given we will hook up. But I also don't want to bring up that we slept together and possibly make the situation weird if we've genuinely moved passed it/acting like it never happened. 

I also find myself thinking about him/that
Morning frequently, which I don't want to do because I don't want to get hung up on a dead end situation, and I genuinely want to be able to be friends with him.

I'm wondering if I should work to make a friendship with him, barring sexual relations, or if we ruined any potential friendship by sleeping together and I should only see him in the office.

Does anyone have any insight or advice? "
2oqbha,2,2014-12-09,"Me [24 M] with my GF [22 F] of 2 years, LDR of 6months, considering moving to make it work?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2oqbha/me_24_m_with_my_gf_22_f_of_2_years_ldr_of_6months/,"So I have been dating my current girlfriend for 2 years. Recently (May), we both graduated, and she got a job in Denver (where she is from). I have had an internship with a corporation the past two years through school and continued working for them in the same town where our university is located. Since May we have been in a LDR, visiting each another every few weeks.


Last week, I was offered a full-time position. Since I'm working for a large corporation, I can request to be placed anywhere in the US. I have put a lot of thought into this and we have been hoping for this to happen so that I can move out to Denver. We would not be moving in together, just living in the same city.


It's a great city, but I don't know anyone besides my GF, her family, and a distant cousin of mine. Originally, I had no doubts, but now that it is actually happening, and I have been telling my friends and family that I'm moving, I've been getting some different responses.


My best friend's girlfriend broke up with him two days after he moved cross-country to be with her. He obviously thinks its a bad idea. There's family urging me to ask her to move near home with me, friends asking who else I know in Denver, and even asking if I'm ""following her."" Now I can't tell if this is just the jitters, or if it's a ""gut feeling"", but I'm getting second thoughts.


I want to move to a new place and explore a new city. No matter what happens, I will be moving from where I am now. But the choice to move to Denver is definitely based on her. I love my girlfriend. Truly, I have never been more in love. I can imagine marrying her- though that is a very long ways away.


That being said, we aren't without issues. She has a really hard time trusting me, and freaks out when I talk to other girls. She has deleted numbers from my phone and even intentionally deleted messages so that I would not see them. But, that was a long time ago. Things seem to have improved, but I worry making friends in a new city will be hard with a GF who gets jealous easily. 


So, I ask you this: what do you think about choosing a place to live/work based on a relationship? Anyone have experience doing so?

I just wanted to vent a bit and get some feedback on my situation.

Going to turn 19 really soon and in my freshman year of college.

I've lived with a more or less abusive family my whole life, my parents divorced but for the past 18 years have put me through the meat grinder in their bullshit, but I can say my dad is definitely the psychotic one, he and my stepmom orchestrated a plan to get children services to kidnap from my mom, which worked, but we were able to get me back. as bad as home life was with my mom, foster care was the worst.

Right now I go back and forth between my parents house, but for the past year or two I've been with my dad it has been hell. Just recently he asked me to get paperwork sorted out for him, he doesn't know english that well so when I tried to explain to him that I can't get it completed, he started screaming at me and going on another psychotic trip.

Mind you he's also very wealthy. It's hard to accomplish things when someone is able to use their wealth against you to actively ruin your life, on top of my n-stepmom who hates my existence and will also go on psychotic trips of her own (bashing her arms and body against the counter/walls, but a sweetheart to the rest of the world).

Right now I've been trying to focus on my finals. I had to stay home and go to community college because family made high school hell for me (it was a miracle I graduated) but I decided to turn it around in college and have now for my first semester in college ever, and first time in school ever, maintained a 4.0 GPA which I hope is what I end the semester off with in two weeks. 

My goals are to do as well as I can so I can transfer to a university (hopefully with either need-based grants or scholarships). As a foster youth, I am not independent on the fafsa so that is a bright path as far as my fathers influence with money goes (he can kick me out but he can't take away my education). I did get a good chunk of money this semester but it all went towards paying for dental work (out of my pocket) which I felt was a necessity to use my savings on. 

I will get more next semester, and I also have a part-time internship right now at a really nice office, which will soon turn paid in 2 months. Just paid by the hour, but the environment and place is really great, a major accomplishment in my opinion. I hope I can save enough money for myself not to go into any more debt and just to have something to fall back on if shit hits the fan.

My question is, I know one day eventually, my family will disown me, as well as go on a very vocal smear campaign against me in an attempt to sabotage my future. I want to make sure what steps I can take to ensure I protect myself the best I can. 

My boss at work is very understanding and knows a fraction of my situation but enough that I proved my worth as an employee for however long I get to stay there (it is temporary but it will help with school,  it is related to my major), so I don't think they can mess that up too much. I just want to know how I can hold on for another 3 semesters until I finally get to university? Would it be ok to go no contact then? If I'm fully supporting myself, is it worth taking that leap and banking on working hard so once I graduate university, I can at least be more confident in my job opportunities to not end up homeless or live paycheck to paycheck? I don't care about glam or money, just enough to sustain myself and enjoy my independence. I also want to go to university far away and when I settle down somewhere, I want it to be far away from here too.

I've come a long way, but I feel it only takes one little mistake to fuck it all up, even then, I could be a perfectionist and my family will still find a way to destroy everything. I cleaned up my credit too, and it has improved over 720+. I also know a social life is important, even if I don't share everything about my circumstances. I go to therapy in secret sporadically, but that also hurts my savings as I pay each session out of pocket.

So yeah, just need help prioritizing and setting more goals for myself. The way I see it, I just have to get myself in the best position possible so I can switch from survival mode to enjoying life and how precious and meaningful it is, something I don't want my family to poison anymore.

**tl;dr When is the right time to cut parents out of my life, and how to manage on the way to independence, emotionally and financially.**"

While looking for resources online: I came across this:

This guy claims that by following his books and methodology, I should be able to model a Chopper in under 15 days. The cost of the course is 120$. What do you guys think? Is this legit? 

What other options do I have? What advice would you more experienced folks have for me?

Your input is much appreciated.

I am an accounting graduate in my 5th week of an unpaid on going internship at an accounting firm in Lincolnshire, UK. (Turnover &gt;£1mil pa). I am currently doing work such as VAT Returns, book keeping, Bank Recs, Year End Accounts etc. And I am enjoying it even though it is unpaid work!!

As I am increasing my knowledge and experience within practice, I am now breaching for a position in an international firm  (LOVE the thought of moving abroad once I have my professional qualifications).

Looking at the big firms such as the 'top 20' on google search. They all seem to do the same, e.g. auditing, risk management, etc. But none of the work I am currently doing in my intern.

Am I getting things mixed up here or am I just looking at the wrong firms?

2orrjy,5,2014-12-09,30 M4F. Long term RP wanted. Possible prompts inside!,myincognitoname,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2orrjy/30_m4f_long_term_rp_wanted_possible_prompts_inside/,"So far I've come up with several prompts in search of a long term rp partner. I think I'm pretty good with RP but a few days in and every time my partner flakes and I never hear from them again. 

Here are a few different prompts I'm interested in.

1. The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

2. The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

3. Mom/sister drama queen.  You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you.  But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do.  The only new one here is the woman on the elevator.  I really want to find a long term rp partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

My favorite kinks are rough sex, power switching, incest, futa, pegging, office affair... just to name some. If it's not listed in my limits I will be down to try it out!

And my limits are scat, gore, underage play and animals. 

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon!"

* What did you think of Young Yi decision to lend her parents the money eventually, I saw a lot of comments bashing her or angry with her but I disagree a lot ~~I'll wait to discuss it in the comments~~?

* Do you think it makes no sense for the fired intern (Lee Sang Hyun) to feel more entitled a place in One Inter given societal expectation not only of the workforce but individuals of whatever age in terms of ""deserving things""?

 &gt; I'll expand. Geu Rae is our protagonist/hero so it's rather easy for us to get caught up in our feelings of how he is completely deserving of his place in One Inter because he has worked hard and lived a hard life. But I think if we're being entirely honest in terms of the message that society in general puts forward especially if we're going by the idea that people who work hard and do certain things get exactly where they need to be, Geu Rae doesn't deserve his place in One Inter. Thoughts??

* What do you think of the idea that Geu Rae repeats about having to solve their issues alone, for or against?

I was asked many of the questions from this list at one point or another. What i did was made notecards for every single question, and on the back wrote out the points on what i wanted to hit on or how i wanted to phrase it (i didnt memorize word for word, you dont want to be a robot). Then i would sit down at the table with 3 chairs on the other side with faces from the internet printed out and taped to the top looking at me. I would flip the card, and practice my response while also practicing engaging the interviewers, making eye contact, critiquing my body language and posture, ect ect.  I felt stupid as hell and it sounds dumb but it is what i had to do to make myself feel comfortable with the interview process. After this i was more excited than truly nervous for my interviews and felt very confident. 

HOPE IT HELPS! Good luck!  PM/comment questions if you have any.

2orx50,9,2014-12-09,"I feel like I'm just lazy and shouldn't need (don't deserve?) help or attention, but I clearly can't just ""snap out of it"" on my own...",hyperbole274,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2orx50/i_feel_like_im_just_lazy_and_shouldnt_need_dont/,"I'm 21, F, I'm healthy, ok financially, I get along with my family, I've got good friends and a nice bunch of aquaintances, and I've been seeing a pretty cool guy lately. Other than being in that odd post-uni transitional stage of staying in the family home doing shitty internships, occasional freelance stuff and jobhunting, I've nothing to be legitimately stressed about.

Despite all that, I've been oscillating between feeling like shit and not feeling much at all for long enough to fall behind with work (which there really isn't a lot of), begin falling out of touch with friends, and begin cancelling on my guy every now and then when I don't have the energy to keep a happy face on.

No-one's noticed and I don't really expect anyone to. I've been there before and I've always been able to keep the charade up until I eventually got my shit together, but it's getting tiring at this point. It was easier when I was in full time education and things were more structured - this is the first time I literally don't know what to do next. I used to enjoy what I did, I was driven and persistent and I thought I had a pretty solid plan, but I've completely lost momentum and I don't know how to pick up from here.

I know I'm being a bit of a priviledged, lazy little shit. I know that on the whole I'm better than this. I wish I could snap out of this before it gets any worse and I start sabotaging things more actively. In the past I'd always let things hit a particular low before doing anything to get back on track. The breaking point could be anything like a rough break up, or nearly failing a year, or just, you know, realising it's gotten to a point where I'm so disconnected and isolated and numb that I wouldn't mind just not waking up one day.

The first time I felt that way I promised myself I would never let myself get to that point again and that if it ever got anywhere near as bad I would get over my ego and get some help. But then I never did, I just stuck to my various shitty old coping mechanisms - smoking, alcohol, weed, overeating or undereating, isolating myself from virtually everyone and trying to wait it out / cry it out, or distracting myself with lots of boozy socialising, or fucking around - all sorts of contradictory things to either numb myself down or give myself a false sense of control over things.

I really don't want to do any of that anymore. For the first time in a while I'm in a pretty good place - I care about myself and about other people too, and I've got people who genuinely care, and things to look forward to.

Unfortunately, I'm stubborn as fuck and sceptical about the idea of therapy. My one and only experience of talking to a psychologist as a kid (not about me per se, just as a compulsory part of my parents' divorce proceedings) ended with me leaving the room shaking and crying, which I at least partially attribute to the two docs being very pushy and unpleasant - it felt more like and interrogation and they made me feel like my feelings were not valid at all, and while I know it's silly to be bitter about one shitty experience, it really was quite off putting.

I also know it's about fucking time I got some help because I've now got years' worth of undealt with stuff, and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere.

I'm fucking scared though and I don't know how the fuck to talk about this to anyone I actually know. My dad's been struggling with depression for a large chunk of his life and I don't even know how he's doing know (he hasn't lived with us for the past decade and has a new family which I get along with but it's obviously been different) - but I only know about his issues from scraps of second hand information. I've witnessed him being a right mess first hand though, so I feel torn between wanting to talk to him because he out of all the people could probably understand me best and feeling like I can't burden him with any negative feelings I have because he'd take it personally and I don't want him to blame himself for not being there enough or anything.

I've tried talking to my mum in the past, but I'd usually just get the usual motherly tough love I get from her. Or she'd take it a bit personally / as a dig at her parenting skills too, which I don't blame her for. She's a million times better a mum to me than both of her parents were to her anyway. She was abused by a slightly more distant family member as a kid and they put all the blame on her and pretty much forbid her from talking about it - so I feel like shit whenever I complain about anything, given how rough she's had it (I kind of wish I could tell her about how I was pretty much assaulted a few years back, just to get it out in the open, and maybe help her open up about her past more if she ever wants to - it might be selfish of me, but nobody in the family knows and I don't think it's fair at all - but what happened to me wasn't anywhere near as bad, and I haven't told anyone else either, and I wouldn't want her to worry)

I'm scared of not being taken seriously and I'm scared of being taken seriously too. Bit like in Jenny Owen Youngs' Drinking Song - ""I don't know what's wrong with me but I wish that it was something else"".

I know this is far too long a wall of text to expect any replies, but ta anyway. It was kind of nice just throwing that out there, even if I still don't know what I'm gonna do.

TL;DR: Just a rant. I'm a bit of a mess, but trying to pretend otherwise. I guess I just needed to admit to myself I'm not okay and may need help, and that's ok too. Hopefully."

2osf20,8,2014-12-09,"Need financial guidance! Going back to school, how do I manage everything back home?? 23yo M (CA)",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2osf20/need_financial_guidance_going_back_to_school_how/,"To make a very long story a bit shorter, here is the basics of my story...

I am a 23 year old male, living in my grandmother's house with my girlfriend and my sister. My grandmother was just placed in a home about 5 months ago so it's just us three.  Thankfully, there is no mortgage on the house, and nothing to pay apart from the typical bills. My parents are still kind of in the picture, but not financially.  I've been slowly nudged into the position of taking care of all the finances, paperwork and all the goodies that go along with this.  The reason I'm posting this here is I am going back to school in Ontario (5 hours away from home) very soon for a 12 month course to give me a better future in a trade I really enjoy and I need advice on how to manage everything and what to pay off first/ how to prevent a financial mistake while I'm gone.  This course is going to cost me $10,500 for the course including books, tools, etc on top of rent (~$550 incl. hydro for an alright place...) food and the other necessities, along with my $300/month for the house I unfortunately cant stop paying.  My sister's only real ""financial contribution"" is the $300/month rent I charge her (along with my girlfriend and myself) to pay the bills such as Hydro, Videotron, Property &amp; School taxes, Pet Food, renovations, etc..) that come in regularly.  It's been about 5 months of this, and we have caught up on some of the late bills that were piling up and are able to pay what's coming in, but it's just not enough to completely catch up. Financially, I've matured a lot and feel smarter about it, but still greatly in need of help.  I was working part time at two places, and supplemented my income by buying/flipping cars here and there, but all that is stopping as of Jan/2015. 
The main issues are the following:

Property &amp; School Taxes are behind by about $8000,
My girlfriend is in debt, but that's another story..
I owe $6000 on my credit card @ 19%,
My grandma has $7200 in debt (Line of Credit &amp; $2200 Credit Card @ 19%)

I made the mistake of using my credit card to pay for some of the major repairs around the house, which added up VERY quickly, along with some reckless purchases on my part when I was younger that I really regret now, but what is done is done.  To make things a bit worse, by having a proxy to my grandma's accounts and such, I pretty much inherited her debts according to a credit check my bank did for a student loan I applied for.  This didn't help my case much to have that extra $7200 worth of debt to ""my name"", but none the less I was accepted for a $15,000 student line of credit @ 4.5%.  I have about $9400 to my name in two bank accounts, RRSP's, and my grandma's income that adds up to about $2400/month worth of pensions which are being used to pay her stay at the old folks home ($1850 / month).  It doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room with all the other little expenses like repairs around the house, paying the minimum on her CC, putting a bit towards her LOC every now and then, etc.  My questions is how to I go about taking care of all this while I'm gone?  What do I pay off first, with what, when... how do I manage what I have, and what I can use from my LOC?  Thankfully there is a paid internship of 450 hours during the 12 months of this course, so it will help a bit financially, but how much $/hr is yet to be determined. I am looking forward to having a real career when leaving this college, so that I can actually start my life. Any help from you guys would be hugely appreciated! Feel free to ask any info if needed in case I forgot something!"

So I'm taking an internship in Goleta for Summer 2015, and my wife and I are starting to look for places to live while we spend our summer months there. The place I'll be working is close to the airport, so we're looking to optimize on a few things: distance to work, distance to fun things, and safety. And obviously pricing also. A few questions for you all:

* Are there any unsafe/unseemly places between the airport's surrounding area and the SB downtown area? This seems like our general search housing boundary. We're trying to figure out if there's a part of town we for sure need to avoid.

* We're looking to get into a private place (apartment/cottage/guest room w/ private entrance, *not* room for rent) for under $1700 a month. We'd do a studio, depending on quality, for $1400ish or less. Is this reasonable for any part of town listed above? We've seen some on Craigslist that look like options, but we'll basically be renting on blind faith since we live nowhere close to Cali, so I'm just wondering if anyone has info about the general condition of apartments in that price range in SB/Goleta?

* Is it going to be difficult to rent for such a short term? We only need something for the end of May to early-mid August.

Also, if anyone has any tips on finding some form of short-term employment in Santa Barbara for my wife, that would be awesome. Thanks!"

I am new to this subreddit. I have been tasked with creating an iPhone app for an internship. I have tried to follow [Apple's own tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343-CH2-SW1) to help get the hang of the environment etc. 

My problem is that when I try to run iOS emulator, instead of showing the Main.storyboard, the emulator just shows a black screen. I am afraid to continue with anything until I am able to see what I am doing. 

I have looked up other tutorials on Youtube, and from what I can see, I should be able Open Xcode-&gt;Create New Single Pane Application, then drag a label into the storyboard's view controller and run the emulator to view the blank screen with the label I dragged in. I have restarted the project several times with slight variations and cannot get the emulator to show anything else than a black screen. I am sure I am leaving something out of my description of the problem, but I am pretty frustrated that I have spent all afternoon with nothing to show for it. Any input would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, if there is a better place for this kind of post, please point me to where I should go. Thanks

EDIT: I reinstalled Xcode, and made sure that the View Controller's ""Is Initial View Controller"" box is checked. It now seems to work. Thanks for the input everyone."
2otbzd,1,2014-12-09,My life has fallen apart. (A follow-up to an AskReddit Response) (LONG),WhyShouldIBother_TaW,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2otbzd/my_life_has_fallen_apart_a_followup_to_an/,"So I a while ago, [I made this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2nsip9/what_is_the_best_socially_unacceptable_piece_of/cmgl6hb) on my main account. I decided to make this throwaway account for this follow-up post because my life has slowly fallen apart.

Since that post linked above, I’ve basically started to fall downhill. My family life has gone to the shitter, my mental health is slowly falling apart and my financial state is even worse.

In the past week, I’ve went from what was happening before to a pure hatred of each other. She flipped out on me because she needed her boyfriend to take apart my living room setup so he could paint the room last Sunday. She didn’t tell me she wanted to do this until Saturday night while giving me a ride home from my internship (the arena I intern at doesn’t have buses which run nearby after 7 p.m.) I had to explain to her 12 times (yes, 12 times) that I couldn’t have him do it on Sunday because I had to do a bunch of schoolwork (I’m behind on months of assignments in two classes) and edit the photos I took for my internship. She then started screaming at me during this. She told me during this whole banter that she unplugged everything in the room before while painting it while I was in class (which I kind of knew about, but didn’t know when he was coming.) She wanted to do it Sunday because her boyfriend had taken the day off and was losing $150 in pay because of it (sub-contractor for a tile company which doesn’t pay its employees because they put them on multiple jobs at once.) She also started flipping out about how she had $900 in furniture on-hold for the room.

I was getting very pissed off at explaining this to her, but she kept trying to get her way by cutting me off while talking to say what she wants (I have Asperger’s Syndrome and every time this happens in a conversation, I get pissed off and she knows this.) By the time we get to the house, we’re about to kill each other because of two things.

During the argument, I asked her “Do you even care about what I do anymore?”

“No. Now I need to fucking do this shit goddamn it,” was her response. She denied saying it seconds later.

I also was getting upset that she was trying to make me do it “for her doing stuff for me before.” This stuff she did was, while nice and all, a way for her to get me to do what she wanted. Even before moving out, she would keep wanting me do to stuff because she cooked food for the house and cleaned up after me. She had said in the past that if it wasn’t for me, she would just eat soup every night. She would also promise things such as movie nights and so forth, then deny promising anything and then flipped out. After I moved out in July into my grandmother’s old house (she died in June of a bowel rupture. She went into the hospital a day or two before the doctor could tell her from some blood tests he did), she would expect me to respect her for giving me money to eat, some supplies and so forth every month. She did this “as a surprise” and used her personal house key each time, breaking our rental agreement each time.

Let me backtrack a little bit. According to the lawyer we had, she couldn’t have any work done on the house or come into the house without 24 to 48 hours written notice. This was in the documents set up through the government. She believes because the lawyer casually (and possibly sarcastically) said all she needed to do was knock and she could come in. Even though it wasn’t in the contract or in writing, she has acted like that’s all she needed to know since.

As we reached the house, she was flipping out, saying “I was embarrassing myself” while she woke up half the neighbourhood shouting at the top of her lungs. We get inside and she tries to order me around again.

“I’m going to get Frank (mom’s boyfriend) to fix your old computer desk, then you’re going to move everything back the way it was so we can fucking paint. Now do it goddamn it,” she said. I had gotten my old computer desk from the garage after the desk (which he had put together wrong twice) broke.

I kept standing up to her because she was still yelling because she wasn’t happy about not being able to get what she wanted.

“If you don’t stop, I’m cancelling Christmas,” she said.

She had said before as well that if my Grandmother died, she wouldn’t celebrate Christmas. It was the only thing that brought our family together. It had been just my mother, Grandmother, mom’s boyfriend and I for Christmas. But for my mother, her past three Christmas Days had been shitty.

2011: I flipped out on her and punched her in the face while part-sleepwalking, part being rudely woken up at midnight on Christmas Eve.
2012: Mom’s boyfriend ditches the Christmas celebration after my mom’s best friend (guy she has known since high school and worked with) came for dinner. Drove around with his phone shut off for four hours and later said he hated all her friends.
2013: Grandmother made a rude comment while giving my mother $500 as a Christmas present, saying to “use it for your bills” or something along those lines. My mother then cried all day after she went home to get ready for dinner.

Anyway, after I explained to her why he couldn’t paint tomorrow again, she said she was cancelling Christmas, throwing out the tree she bought earlier that day and stormed out.

The next day, she tried to still get work done here, but not to paint. She wanted to come (still with no paperwork by the way) so she could fix the cathouse in the backyard and move my stuff back where she wanted it to be. She also wanted him to go under the house to do something and to fix the desk. Not a good idea when he’s got a giant stomach (weighs about 280 lbs. I think) and there’s maybe two feet of space under the house. I said no, and he still came over for the desk, but unlike my mother, he was calm and nice about the work and so forth. Before I moved out, I hated him, but now he’s the only person I have left to try and talk to in my family, even though he’s just as bad as her sometimes (especially if she’s around.) He told me she did throw out the tree and she never wanted to speak to me again. I had heard that threat before multiple times, but then acted like it never happened.

Basically my relationship with my mother is almost zero now. I still need to contact the lawyer to get out of the lease so I can completely cut ties with her.

But as I said, since that post, my mental state has gotten worse.

It seems most times now, I have a much harder time trying to listen to a person talking directly to me and what they’re saying. Two months ago, I could listen pretty well. Now, people need to repeat everything they say to me so I can hear what they said.

I also have a harder time getting to the point of a conversation without rambling on for two to three minutes. Just today, I took 12 minutes for an interview that had to be five minutes max, then scrambled when I had time for five questions and had to look at my notes to get back on track. Before I could talk to people about things I knew about while making sense. Now I feel like I sound like the Father on The Brak Show (Adult Swim show.)

It also feels like I’m becoming mentally insane. Every day, I hear noises like hospital machines and police sirens in my head. I also feel like every time my head mentally locks up, my mind is trying to say “kill yourself, kill yourself, you’re worthless.” There are usually multiple voices at once saying this stuff. I also end up talking to myself (in fact almost shouting at myself) saying this a lot of times when I’m home now, like something inside of me wants me to do just fucking die. I’ve talked to myself in the past a lot, but nothing this bad. This issue has also affected my ability to read more than a few paragraphs at a time without losing my concentration or having my eyes glaze over.

All of this ends up making me unable to do my assignments without feeling like my head is going to explode or without hanging myself. I tried choking myself to death twice in the past two months because of this, but didn’t have the guts to do it all the way. I’m still thinking about doing it again right now.

And then there are the financial problems.

As of right now, I’m currently in $950 in credit debt on a credit card I can’t pay off more than $30 at a time and have maybe $100 in overdraft and cash (after bills) to eat the rest of the month. The credit card has always been an issue (I get $1,100 a month from the Ontario government for disability. It’s hard to pay stuff off when you have $750 a month in rent and bills to pay, plus I’m $300 in overdraft at the end of each month to start with), but now I can’t buy food without risking not being able to eat later in the month. My mother used to give me a little bit of money each month so I wouldn’t starve. Now we’re not in speaking terms, as I said before.

Basically I’m fucking screwed. This semester of college is almost over, but I’m going to probably fail those two classes, both with teachers I love to have, but can’t do the work in because of my mental and family issues. I’m going to probably end up dropping out before the start of my final semester so I can recover mentally, but I don’t want to let anyone down because I’m the top student in the program. Or was before all of this shit.

I already know people are going to message me like last time, but I’ve had bad experiences letting my emotions out. In the past, all my venting has either drove friends or random strangers on the internet away or had people basically give me small confidence boosts or quick fixes, which last for a few minutes before I end up going back to what I am now. The only reason I haven’t dropped out of college sooner is because of these quick fixes. I’m starting to tear up a bit because, as you can probably tell with this monster post, I usually vent my feelings through writing about my problems.

I feel suicidal right now because it seems like I have no fucking hope left. I feel like I’m just sitting in a limbo stage between being alive and being dead. I just don’t have the guts to know what will happen when I fucking die.

The only thing keeping me from doing it right now is the family of cats living on my back porch right now. If I died, they’d starve or my other would give them to someone else who could care for them. They’re the only animals which have shown affection to me in months, other than my own cats back at my mother’s house.

During my Grandmother’s funeral, my mom’s boyfriend said something which is so fucking true, it’s sickening.

“If I fell into (my mother’s) pond and me and a fish came back out onto the side of the pond, she’d probably help the fish first,” he said.

If I died, my mother probably wouldn’t care unless I was a cat or a fish. Why should I fucking bother.

TL;DR: Since answering a question in an AskReddit thread, my condition has gotten worse and my family life and finances have gone to the shitter. I feel like killing myself even more now."

What are y'all's thoughts on the duty hour restrictions rules currently in place?


Specifically for interns: no more than 16 hours at a time in the hospital, must be out of the hospital 10 hours at a time, must take 1 day off every 7 days, and must not work more than 80 hours per 7 days on average over a 4 week period. For residents, most of the same rules apply except they can take 28 hour call instead of the 16 hours at a time restriction.


My questions are basically:


* What field are you hoping to go into/what field are you currently in?

* Do you think that these hour restrictions are better for patient safety and for resident quality of life?

* What changes, if any, should be made to the current hour restrictions?

* What part of your work day takes up the most time? (of if you are a medical student, what part do you notice takes up the residents' time)?

* What changes to how you work do you feel could improve efficiency?

* Does/did your medical school allow you to work 30 hour shifts and if so, do you feel this is/was beneficial to you?...And do you think it is ridiculous that we are able to work 30 hours as a MS3 and 4 and all of residency except our intern year???

* Do you feel like duty hour restrictions are making this generation of residents weaker future physicians?

* Do you feel like duty hour restrictions do/will cut out on your learning and experience during your residency?

* Any other thoughts in general?

2otuex,1,2014-12-09,Mixed feelings and mixed signals?,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2otuex/mixed_feelings_and_mixed_signals/,"Hey bros, just wanted to get my feelings out properly as I have no real place to vent about it.

So a few months ago I broke up with my first boyfriend, we'd been together for just under two years, but he eventually moved away. We gave the long distance thing a shot but we were just in different places, emotionally and geographically I guess, ha. Towards the end of my relationship I met a guy, let's call him P, who studies the same course as me at University and recognised me from class. From the offset, P was pretty flirtatious, but I was in a committed relationship, distance or not, I don't want to say I friend zoned him, because I hate that term but I definitely kept him at arms length.

A short while after my break up, I bumped into P in a lecture and we got talking, in a completely platonic(now that he was sober, we only ever really saw each other in clubs over the summer prior to classes starting) sense. He asked how me and my boyfriend were doing and I told him about the break up, he suggested that if I wanted to go out with him and some friends some time I was more than welcome, so we exchanged numbers. 

Anyone who's been in a long term relationship knows how much pressure breaking up can put on your mutual friends, and I was the one who did the breaking off, so they tended to side with my ex more than myself, despite the fact he wasn't even living in the country at the time. So I guess going out with P and his friends was kind of a relief where I could just relax, and no one asked me how I was handling the break up, and if we'll get back together when he returns, when was the last time we spoke, etc. He and his friends were kind of a little island oasis where I could just get on with my life.

As time progressed I started to, I guess, develop a liking for P, and one night after the consumption of many drinks, we kissed, and we kissed a few nights after that. He was pretty shy and only came out a few weeks prior to meeting me, so the first few times, I made the first move, and once I made the first move he was more than happy to kiss me back for the rest of the night. I eventually asked him on a date, which he turned me down on, saying it was a bad idea because if things went poorly, we were working on projects together for school and we didn't want to make things awkward and that we should just go on as we currently were. I was fine with this, thought that was a valid excuse, but a part of me kinda though ""hey, maybe he's just not that into you / maybe he's not attracted to you"" which is also entirely plausible. But after a while I guess I got sick of always making the first move, and decided to wait and see if he would. He didn't. Weeks went by, we were going out at least 2/3 nights a week (hey, we're students) together and not once did he try and kiss me first. But that doesn't mean he wasn't flirtatious, he'd always pay me these big compliments, wrap his arms round me from behind and hug me affectionately, try and hold my hand and put my arm around him etc. He would also always insist that I stay in his house after we went out drinking, in his bed, even thought we both live in houses a stones throw away from each other, but nothing remotely sexual would ever happen. There are more examples of flirtatious behaviour but I'm trying to keep this as short as possible.

I was getting increasingly frustrated with the mixed signals. Last week both P and I landed internships at two huge software firms in our city, so naturally we wanted to go out and celebrate. No one seemed particularly keen on going out with us as assignment season was starting, so we went out, just the pair of us, and got absolutely hammered. The night went mostly without incident, he made me promise to go on a trip abroad with him in March for his birthday. We came back to my house after to chill and listen to some music, just like we normally do at his house with his friends after a night on the town, and I went up to use the toilet and when I came down, P was getting his coat on and getting ready to leave. At this point ld assumed he'd be staying in my bed like our usual arrangement, but if he wanted to head home, that was cool by me. So we said our goodbyes and he didn't turn to leave and kept shuffling awkwardly and looking at his feet, like he was trying to say something, and I made some stupid joke about him speeding it up so he could get the fuck out of my house and I could get some sleep, and then he said ""You stress me out."", all serious, I thought this was a joke and threw my arm round him and asked him why I stressed him out.. And I don't know what happened, next thing i knew we were kissing pretty passionately in the middle of my kitchen, and it went on for a while.

After a while we broke it off and we both agreed it was getting late, so I walked him halfway home, and we kissed again and said our goodbyes.

Two days later before a project meeting, we met up and he behaved like it never happened..?

I feel somewhat used I guess, what is strange because we've never did anything beyond kissing.

Which brings me to my question bros, is this guy truly not interested in me romantically, or is he still nervous, having only been out of the closet for a few months? Or perhaps more likely, am I the problem for getting so hung up and overthinking and overanalysing everything and he just wants to be friends? I honestly don't know at this point. "

I am a 21 year old engineering student that was fortunate enough to get an internship at an e-commerce startup over the summer, and I quickly fell in love with all the possibilities that surround the e-commerce ecosystem. I had no previous experience as a developer, and I was hired as a business analyst and quickly went on to take all the business intelligence responsibilities, including learning some SQL and mastering excel. 

Now that you know my background, here is my problem: I want to set up my own online store, and after ingesting as much information as I could through blogs, podcasts etc. I am still not sure which path would be the best to follow. I started out by quickly teaching myself HTML+CSS (which I enjoyed immensely - I had to take a basic C++ course in school, and front-end development is something completely new to me) and figuring out what I want my website to look like. I like the long-format websites (see: www.cookitboutique.com) but I also have another dilemma: my store would be a subscription-based service, where the customer can select 6 items every month to be shipped to their homes. 

Can this be built on Shopify? Should I try to build this myself by mastering HTML+CSS and learning Javascript? Or can I get this from a theme? I like the California theme on Shopify, but I am not sure I will be able to customize it enough to get it to what I described above. 

Should I jump straight to Magento? What are your thoughts? "
2otx46,0,2014-12-09,Mom always judges my career goals and life choices. Should I cut her off?,d3oxyribonucleic,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2otx46/mom_always_judges_my_career_goals_and_life/,"WARNING: Wall of text; may be rant-ish. Also new to Reddit, so please accept my apologies if any formatting is off.

Background: I'm female, in my final year of business school and my parents are still paying my bills (I live 1-2 hours' drive away), but I have a good idea of my expense levels and salary requirements and I'm frugal and good at budgeting (I'm reasonably certain I can live well and save a decent buffer on $15-20/hour as a low estimate). My dream is to work in a startup and be challenged every day. I've worked in a lab before and I do very well in an idea-driven culture where I have tons of different roles and responsibilities going on all at the same time, but where going off on my own sometimes in order to focus more on the work is accepted. I have talked to over 10 startup founders already and am entertaining a few (unpaid) startup internship offers for my last school term ever, so it's been really inspiring and I still have about half a year to figure out a full-time role. I'm also applying to more traditional roles in order to give myself more options and make a backup plan in case the startup dream isn't possible right now (so I'll take a 9-5 if I have to for money, but look into getting into something better ASAP after that). At this point, I want experience and many of the founders I talked to (not the same as the ones proposing the unpaid work) say that interning in a startup is the best way to show I'm serious about entrepreneurship and get into one full-time. Childhood was a typical white suburban upper-middle-class experience, no physical, emotional or sexual abuse. Too much emphasis on academics though; great grades were there but social skills were way behind (think ""trophy child parents love to show off and brag about"", but being away from home and in business school have been great to overcome that). Parents are liberal, secular and generally fairly progressive, except insofar as their overprotective and ridiculous perceptions of my safety are concerned. Mom stayed home, Dad was the breadwinner.

Issue: One startup in particular is a great fit, I get along very well with the founder, they really need someone with business knowledge and the science behind their product sounds like it has real value. Every time I talk to my mother about startups or nontraditional roles, the first thing she says is what could go wrong with those or how they don't set me up well for traditional jobs later (which I may never want), and changes the topic to whichever traditional job I'm kind of meh about and honestly using as a backup plan. Same goes for other changes I'm trying to make for the better in my life: running before breakfast? BAD. Healthier diet making me a bit skinnier? CONCERNING (note: not anorexic; happy with body and excited to see a 3-pound gain in the last month since I started more muscle work, so I'm pretty sure most of it is muscle). Cartilage piercing that hides easily under my hair for more formal occasions? TERRIBLE. Not interested in a relationship? NOT POSSIBLE. Never wanting kids? YOU'LL CHANGE. I'm very independent and I need as much freedom as possible in order to be fulfilled, but she's having none of it. It's infuriating, and I feel like ever since my ""launch"" into fully supporting myself became imminent, she has especially disapproved of basically every positive thing I'm trying to do for myself if it deviates from the safe, conformist, traditional pathway. What this means is that any time I bring up something that excites or inspires me, or that I'm particularly proud of, Mom shoots it down and doesn't listen to my reasoned arguments for why I have already assessed the risk and am already in a good place to deal with the fallout if it fails. I can't bring up anything that's a part of ""real me"" without Mom making me feel like shit about it; like there's a whole part of me that she will never honour or understand. If I'm omitting details, she will often interrogate and nit-pick, which makes me feel like an idiot when I think that this time, maybe, she might just understand and accept this part of me, but then of course she shoots it down and I'm equally angry with my stupid self as I am with her. The Christmas break around the corner is also a huge problem: family tradition is that kids come home for all three weeks of it and hang out (before this manipulation shit started, that was just fine for everyone), but I have to study over the break and although I have already made it clear that I won't be around all the time, Mom will inevitably feel hurt and suspect something else is up if I'm not there unless I absolutely have to be elsewhere. If we end up fighting about this, I'll want to deeply hurt her feelings and I don't think I'll be able to stop myself from saying that I want to cut her off, or that maybe she should have aborted me if she never wanted me to grow up.

So I'm considering biding my time and keeping most of my startup search and offers secret until I have a job locked down and move into a place that I'm entirely paying for, and then abruptly cutting Mom out of my life for at least a few months. No-one should have to tolerate that kind of judgment and manipulation, and I'm sick of it. Part of me feels terrible because deep down I still love her and want her in my life, but another part is just plain infuriated and kind of likes the idea of unexpectedly cutting her out and letting her know in no uncertain terms that further attacks will not be tolerated and that I will enforce a boundary whether she agrees with it or not. Reasoning with her on this issue is impossible because it's very emotional for her and any threat to my safety or achievement completely blinds her to rational logic, so a harsh estrangement might be a wake-up call that she cannot get away with judging me any more even if she doesn't agree with what I'm doing. But will this ruin the relationship in the long run, and are there other ways for me to maintain the relationship and not feel like shit whenever I talk to her, and also not feel like I'm walking on eggshells or hiding who I am in every interaction with her? We used to be very close, but now I kind of want to assert myself even if it makes her miserable. Maybe even especially so? I'm not sure any more. I just don't want to be home for Christmas.

Thanks for bearing with me!

tl;dr: I want startup jobs and a more independent/nontraditional life (and have done thorough risk assessment to ensure it's reasonable); Mom takes everything that inspires me and shoots it down. I need her money but I might want her out of my life for a while when I can stand on my own. Should I cut her out when I can, and lie until then?

EDIT: Okay, I'm not going to cut her off since it seems like a reactionary and childlike way to approach this. I sounded incredibly bratty above, and posting while very emotional is a terrible idea. Thanks for all the ideas and wisdom so far; I really need to look at this from her perspective more and be very grateful for what I have in life. An adult conversation about it, although tough, is probably a much better way to go."

2ou077,1,2014-12-09,"Part-time college intern at a company, and someone wants me to design a product specification sheet for them. I feel like I might be grossly underqualified for this. Should I go for it? Does anyone with more experience have advice for me? Should I send this woman another way? Help?",Geecy,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/2ou077/parttime_college_intern_at_a_company_and_someone/,"I'm not sure this is the right subreddit, and if anyone has a better place for me to go, please let me know.

I started working for a medium-sized company as an intern photographer about two years ago. Basically all they wanted from me was to photograph their food items they create in its original plastic packaging, Photoshop the background off, and put a label on the products. Although this isn't what I'm going to school for (I'm an English major) I was hired because I had some experience with film photography and very, /very/ limited experience with Photoshop. I had to basically learn how to remove backgrounds in Photoshop by myself, and with a lot of trial and error, try to figure out how to capture the look they were going for. This took a long time, but now I'm at the point where I feel very comfortable in this aspect of my job. At this point I'm currently sort of on-call for them while I'm in school, since after about six months I'd photographed everything they wanted, and now they only need me as they create new products. 

Now, I ought to take this as a compliment, but my employer and other people in the company have taken ""photographer who can make things happen in photoshop"" to mean ""good with design."" About a year back, I was asked to design a catalog for corporate advertising for one of the saleswoman . . . in Powerpoint. She was showing me professional-level corporate design sheets from other companies that she wanted something similar to, but I've never taken a design class in my life, and I guess the company didn't approve her to spend money on a professional design. I know Powerpoint isn't a good program for what she wanted me to do, but she wanted to be able to edit it herself once she was finished, and I didn't know of a better program. Her standards were very high compared to what I had to offer. It took three months of me working about ten hours a week to get this sales sheet to what she wanted -- I'm not sure if that's very long or not, but it felt over the top at the time. Either way it was very frustrating and I don't think either myself or the saleswoman were ultimately satisfied with how it looked, and I think she quite clearly settled for what I had to offer. That was fine, I mean, I did the best I could, but things get worse. 

A different woman in the company wants me to design a product specification sheet for all of our items, in Word. Something like [this](http://www.sunmeadow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Spec-Sheet_300x388.png). She's already had one designed by someone, although I'm not sure who, and in the past wanted me to fix that design to update it to this vague idea of what she wants. The thing is, I can tell she keeps settling -- I give her an updated design, and she says something like ""Yes, I think this is okay."" Then I start applying it to about 20-someodd of our 900-someodd items, before she says ""I don't like this, I want something like THAT!"" and points at a product specification sheet from a much larger company that obviously paid someone with more expertise than myself to design it. It wasn't so bad when the woman who just wanted a product catalogue settled, but every single time this woman settles, it costs the entire company money, and myself a lot of time. It makes me hate my job. 

I only have about a month break before I go back to school again to design and probably start implementing this new layout. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate that my company has trusted me with these design projects in spite of my lack of experience, and I really enjoy the experience I'm getting and the possible career opportunities it opens up, but my fear is that I simply cannot give them what they want. My bigger fear is that I'll think I've given this woman what she wants but she actually settled, and then she'll want to change it later, before it's even been applied to all of the items. Editing the layout for 900-someodd Word documents is excruciating work that I'll likely wind up doing this summer. I don't want to make things more time consuming and expensive for myself or anyone else. 

What can I do? Is there any sort of design class that can help me make the best product specification sheet that this woman wants? Should I try to redirect her elsewhere? How do I tell her it's not as simple as just copying another company's idea? 

Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just frustrated, tired, and not looking forward to dealing with this. "

2outo5,2,2014-12-10,Philosophy or self-defense? Or both?,[deleted],martialarts,https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/2outo5/philosophy_or_selfdefense_or_both/,"I started Judo at 15. After a few months, I was in love with it. I couldn't explain it but I was waiting for the trainings each other days of the week. 

Unfortunately, I got injured and had to stop only a few months after I began training. My doctor told me I would never, ever again practice any martial arts. 

Long story short, I went through blood, sweat and tears, spent hours and hours doing small physical exercises to re-educate my body and 6 years after my doctor told me I could start practicing again. He was amazed because I wasn't supposed to heal like I did. 

Now, I've been spending those 6 years litteraly obsessing over martial arts. It was a huge loss for me. It is not logical because I only spent a few months training but anyway.

Now, I've started training again and I picked up Aïkido and Tai Chi Chuan/Kung-Fu (both are taught by the same teacher).

However, I would like to practice so much more martial arts : Wing-Chun, Iaido, bagua palm, baji quand, xing yi or Battodo for instance. I would also like to practice Brazilian Ju Jitsu a litle, because I'm curious.

Both of my teachers told me I couldn't go on like this and keep praticing two martial arts. Plus, I know it takes a lifetime (more, actually) to really master a martial art.

So I have to choose. 

Here is what I want :

* I want to be able to defend myself. I almost got into a fight on a train last week and I didn't have enough place to use Aïkido. I mainly practice martial arts for the pleasure it gives me and for the phylisophy behind it but I've decided I want to real life, field tested fighting skills, including  how to defend myself against a knife or common **modern** threats that may arise. From this point of view, I have no interest in learning how samurai fought a long time ago.

* I don't want to ruin my health. I don't want my face to get bloodied like in a boxing match. 

* I want to be able to use my skills even when I'm old and don't have much physical strength.

* Pleasure.

* Finally, I want the daily health benefits that Tai Chi Chuan gave me and I also want to learn acupuncture so this whole Chineses way of practicing martial arts is really interesting to me.

So...I don't know which martial arts to choose. I want a martial art that enable me to defend myself in real life, nowadays situation and which bring me a better well-being through Chinese's traditional point of view on martial arts. 

I like Aïkido. The strenght, dignity, calmness of those who practices it. The discipline. The etiquette. But Aïkido will not help me get away in most of real life situations.

Same thing with Tai Chi Chuan.

So I thought I may  practice a martial arts only for the purpose to learn how to defend myself for, say, ten years and then spend the rest of my life doing Tai Chi Chuan or something that is more pleasurable with a greater philosophy. Like 10 years Krav Maga and then 30 years of Tai Chi Chuan or Aïkido.

Or I can go on with Aïkido or Tai Chi Chuan and learn self defense on the side with internships.

I feel like I must choose one martial art and dedicate my life to it but that no martial arts live up to my expectations.

What do you think?

EDIT : It seems like some people don't understand my post. I wrote something in response to someone's post and I post it below because I think it makes my post more clear. I'm not a native speaker so I apologize for my difficulty to express those subtle ideas in english :

I have always been more interested in the ""art"" side of ""martial arts"" than in the self defense/physical fights and I still am. 

However, I went through some real experiences lately that convinced me to learn how to properly defend myself. 

&gt; If you are primarily interested in the self-defense aspects, then a martial ""art"" may not be the way to go. There are numbers of ""combative"" systems that are primarily geared to fighting practicality and don't feel tied in to any particular system. Notably JKD, but there are others. JKD's idea was famously....""Absorb what is useful"".But lots of folks want more out of a martial art than just hair, teeth, and eyballs fighting efficiency... They like the history and tradition and competition and uniforms and belts and all the trappings of learning an ""art"". Decision time......

I **don't** want to take this decision. 

I want to study martial arts (and not combat sports) but at the same time I want to learn how to defend myself. 

That's why I'm posting here : I am looking for a martial art that can also enable me to very efficiently to defent myself against **modern** threats (while still keeping the ""art"" part). 

If there is none, then, I was considering spending some time practicing a combat sport and then moving on to the practice of a martial art. 

What do you think?"

I've recently completed my masters degree and I decided to finally move in with my boyfriend (we've now lived together for 7 months). I'm suffering from severe depression as I finally try and work through my past. 

My boyfriend has been fantastic up until this point he emotionally supports me through everything. However, two days ago we were having a minor argument before he left for work (at 8 am). He left for work and I got on with my day of doing fundraising grants for a local charity (I work from home).

 At 15h00 he storms home and starts literally screaming at me for ruining his day. He then proceeded to try and smash my IPhone and rip up my work. 

I got angry and started shouting at him and he just started screaming. He then pushed me onto the bed, pinned me, grabbed me by the neck and ripped my t shirt.

 I'm currently in a hotel deciding what to do. He's supported me at my worst times, he's helped me pay my rent during my masters degree, he bought me food/clothes when I was an unpaid intern and he helped me reunite with my estranged father. Please help, I don't know what to do.

I took a class, called Computer Maintenance, which taught how to troubleshoot PC problems, install Windows XP, replace hardware components, deal with users, etc. It was the best course I ever took, because it showed me how fun working with computers can be. Before I took the class, I hated the idea because I had this notion that learning computers would be a bunch of reading manuals and such. Ever since graduating high school, I knew I wanted to work with computers. Exactly what, I wasn't sure, but I knew there wasn't any other degree for me.

I went to a big state university, UT Arlington, and worked on getting a bachelor's in Computer Science from there. I quickly learned that I hated it, because the degree focused heavily on programming and engineering, not what I'm interested in. I dropped out after 2 semesters because I hated programming, and the the thought of having to take at least 6 more math courses when I couldn't even make it past Precalculus II after 2 tries really made me want to just kill myself, literally. I absolutely hated it, so I knew I had to drop out. I thought about why I disliked it so much, and what brought me to Computer Science to begin with. I thought back to my days of high school where I helped fix teacher's computers and helped set up a physical network that I realized that I'm not interested in programming or computer science theory, I'm interested in PC hardware, networking, and helping people with their problems. So I found out that my local community college has an associates for computer networking, and I knew it was my only choice as far as college goes. 

I've just finished my second semester here, I have 2-3 more semesters to go, and I absolutely hate it. I really love the material, the problem is that I hate the way that its taught. Since it's a small community college, there's less classes that are offered in person, which means that almost all of my classes are forced to be online, which means reading a textbook, and taking tests online. I absolutely hate this style of self-learning, because I hate textbooks. I have ADD/ADHD whatever it is, and I can't read a single paragraph without getting distracted. Even if I do manage to focus for a little bit, learning from a textbook is just so boring that I end up forgetting everything I just read because I'm so disinterested in it. I really like the material, but the method of learning it through reading is something I can't handle, for whatever reasons. 

So my question is, is it possible to work in the computer networking field without having to read textbook after textbook to learn? I hate textbooks with a passion, they've brought nothing but frustration to me over the years, and I want to learn without them. I'm very interested in learning, and I would love nothing more than to have some hands on time and learn by experience. I have very few opportunities in my small town, so the idea of getting a hands-on job is out of the question. I don't even have anything else but an A+ certification, so I really can't find an entry level job or even an internship here. I live in the DFW area, if that helps at all. 

I just don't know what I want to do with myself. There is no way I'm going to finish this degree, I barely made it past this semester, and there's no more core classes that I can blow off. All that's left is technical classes related to networking, and I know my limits, and I cannot handle 4-5 hard classes in one semester, with all of them being online and having thick textbooks to memorize. My only alternative is to just drop out and get a job at wherever will take me, which means working a minimum wage job and giving up on life, and at that point, I just don't see a point in living. As far as other degrees go, don't suggest it, because nothing else interests me.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I've read several posts here on how to learn, but the answer is to always buy a book and read it, but that just isn't an option for me.

Yesterday I went for an assessment centre (group exercise, presentation, and interview) with a big IT company. The group exercise went very well I think. My presentation and interview was with this guy who had been with the company for 16 years, he seemed......bored with me immediately. The presentation I had overly prepared for went well, in his bored, almost expression-less tone of voice and body language he asked a lot of follow up questions, further clarification etc. The interview itself, looking back, there are so many things I could've done better. 

One of his questions was ""how do you add value to a network"" (like....network of contacts a la LinkedIn) and I said that I offer different advice and insights to people depending on their different careers and stages of life that they might not get elsewhere. I SHOULD'VE SAID THAT I CAN HOOK PEOPLE UP TO THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THEY NEED BECAUSE I HAVE NETWORKED WITH LOADS OF DIVERSE PEOPLE!!

Another question he asked was ""name a time when you failed?"" I answered my last assessment centre (with the same company) I didn't get the role because I wasn't right for it in that I wasn't technical enough (coming from a business degree), but this time I thoroughly researched the role I was applying for and determined it was for me. I SHOULD'VE SAID I START A FRIGGING IT INTERNSHIP IN JANUARY THAT WILL GET ME HANDS ON TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE LIKE YOUR COMPANY WANTED!!!

I'm scared guys....really. I really wanted that job, and the company is incredible. But I messed it up. I could've done so much better, and I messed it up royally. Damn. Now I keep kicking myself at the things I should've said, I'm struggling to tune in to my surroundings, constantly cringing at myself......I don't think I have the energy and confidence to go about my day tomorrow, I'm just in awe, in shock that I messed up something I really shouldn't have!

* BA in Asian Studies

* I have lived on my own before, but I was either in a dorm or living with a friend

* I've been working at Wal-Mart as a cashier for over a year and dreading it (and only make $8.30 /hour for 30-35 hours a week)

* Around $30k in debt

What I'm looking to do:

* I want to go back to college and major in Computer Science. I've already sent an application to my old community college to reactivate my student status

* If I go back to college, I want to find an internship

* I want to move out of my parents house.

* I want to find a better job than Wal-Mart

* I want to get a car (since getting around my town is impossible without one). Although I'd prefer to live in a city with great public transportation, it looks like that won't be an option right now

If I move out, I don't think I'll be able to find anyone I know to live with since I don't have strong connections with too many people in this area (didn't make too many friends in high school TBH).

I feel like I should definitely be qualified for something better than Wal-Mart, but I keep running into the ""you need experience and have majored in X field"" wall. Since I'd be going back to school, I might work part-time, though.

As for getting a car, this is something I've been wanting and not wanting to do. On one hand, having the freedom to go anywhere I want again without relying on other people is great, but I don't want to push myself further in debt.

I know this is probably a lot to read, but if anyone has any answers for me, I'd greatly apprecitate it!"

We met at university (in the UK) and had a fantastic time together doing all the things that university couples do (borderline hedonistic life). We fell in love and formed what felt like a strong enough relationship to carry on while I went away to France for a year abroad and he stayed in our university town.


During that time (Sep 2013 - May 2014), we had our problems with communication which mainly were arising from him not feeling as though i was giving enough attention. It was difficult because I wanted to whatever the hell I wanted and let him know at the end of the day but he was having trouble because he missed hearing from me. We managed to find a good balance (more texting and skyping) but there were still fights along the way due to his niggling problems with jealousy which he eventually overcame. Despite, the fighting we still made it work and took trips to see each other (he came to paris twice and I went to see him three times including surprising him for his birthday).


Towards the end of my year out (June 2014) my mum had an aneurysm which was a shock to everybody and I went home for a week to be with my family. When I went back to France she was a lot more stable and my ex and I decided to book our first holiday together. We planned to go to Crete for ten days just by ourselves (when the most we'd been together at a time in the last year had been 5 days) and it was something we were desperately looking forward to, to the extent that i told him not to visit me so we could save money for that special trip.


 However, ten days after coming back from the hospital (July) my mother was diagnosed with stomach cancer (for those of you who aren't familiar, the aneurysm and cancer were completely unrelated). This all happened days before I was due to come home. Upon arriving home my mum was having a lot of pain from eating and we had to take her to the hospital. This meant that things were so bad that my boyfriend and I could not go away. Even though it was really sad and disappointing he was great enough to come to my city and stay for a week while supporting me and my family. It was a special time because the bond between him and my family grew.


When he left we felt closer than ever and I felt confident that he was great support. Even when he was back in his home country in South America for a month in the summer and our internet connection was poor and we had a big time difference things were still going alright because we were able to have short but quality conversations here and there.


Things got difficult though when he started an internship in September and I was due to go back to university later that month. With the new job he became very busy and started to juggle a more demanding social life. The contrast from being able to talk whenever we wanted to to barely hearing from him during the day started to take a toll. I understood that he was busy but I started feeling like we were drifting apart due to the fact that when we did talk he was unaffectionate and moody. With everything that was happening with my mum etc I really wanted him to be the kind and loving guy he was. I realise that it wouldnt have been easy for him but I explained to him so many times that I don't need him to 'make it all better' because that would be impossible. All I wanted was to be able to turn to him in my time of need. It seemed as though he wasn't prepared to give that time. This became a recurring fight for us and I still confused as to why this happened. After two years of a relationship I had always felt comfortable that he knew me well and knew instinctively how to support me (he'd shown me uncountable times). With all the fighting I started to feel really sad that he couldnt see the pain I was in and if he could he was just adding to it by being aggressive and angry. 


He kept telling me he knew what the right thing to do was but for some reason couldnt control his anger. There would be times where I'd be miserable and alone and he would know that but still not contact me for hours because he felt like it would be bad manners to take his phone out in front of friends. It hurt that I needed to explain to him that his friends shouldn't give a shit about that when all he'd be doing is supporting his girlfriend who is going through the worst time of her life by sending a little text asking how i am and sending a heart. Especially considering that during my time in france I tried to send him loving texts etc when I was out. The little things such as goodnight texts and kisses went out the window (which may sound stupid but they mean a lot in an LDR and when you're down). Those little things also meant a lot to him and for him to just stop with all that was so unusual. 


After two years of being together he forgot my birthday (sep 25). That made me feel that he was not in this relationship as much as he used to be and it was heartbreaking. He denied it though and said he genuinely forgot and was so sorry etc and he'd make it up to me. He ended up sending a package of souvenirs in the post and said he'd do other stuff like organise a skype dinner date which only ended up happening when I brought it up when he came to visit.


He visited me in October and we had been barely holding on to this relationship by that point. When we were together though it was like nothing had changed. I had a moment of insanity and thought it would be a good idea to see if he'd said anything about our relationship to his new friends because I could not understand what it was that was going through his head. I read his text messages (that was so wrong of me i know i should have spoken to him) and saw he'd been telling his friends he felt like i was too needy and had changed too much that he wanted out of our relationship but felt bad because of the whole situation with my mum. His friend had replied telling him it would be better to end things now before he cheated. I confronted him about that and he broke down and said he loved me and wanted to be with me and we spent hours deliberating over what to do and eventually decided that we'll carry on with things and try and work things out. 


Eventually we ended up fighting again because of him being distant and seemingly uncaring. it was all such a difference to what i was used to. I could not understand his behaviour at all and was so upset that it was all happening when my mum was so ill. He decided to break up with me because he kept saying he 'didn't want to hurt me' (whatever that fucking means...) I pleaded that we stay together and that we just needed to find a good balance considering we'd never been through anything like this before and that we could get through it. He was reluctant and decided it would be best to end things before he really hurt me (?!?). I told him that we cannot be friends and I have no interest in talking to him if he's not my boyfriend and so our communication was like one superficial text every three days/ when he could be bothered to reply. I was absolutely heartbroken... I just could not begin to comprehend... It was awful... We had planned a future together...


This was all the beginning of November.
My mum passed away on November 16th and I decided not to talk to him at all because I needed to put myself and my family first during our grieving period.


I called him around two weeks after that to tell him about my mum and we fell into a silly routine of texting each other a little bit more and started talking on the phone around once a week because it felt good and we both really miss each other and he was saying to me that he does want to be with me and if we carried on talking maybe we could see where it goes etc (not sure how likely that is in a long distance relationship). On Sunday he called me and I told him I was uncomfortable with us talking as though we were together but with no commitment and that despite us both loving each other we'd most likely end up getting hurt (most probably me) if we carried on like that. He decided that he would rather not talk then... and i haven't heard from him since (ok fine it's been three days lol) but I really want him to just come back to me and admit he'd been an ass and try again. I'm trying hard not to contact him because I feel ive made it very clear where I stand and I have nothing left to say. However, I don't know what he's thinking beyond maybe us talking will lead to something... I know it is more than likely he is just talking to me out of attachment but if there is something there, is there anything I can do to bring us together? I sound silly asking that question because at this point I feel like any reconciliation should come from him but I just want to feel like I have explored all paths...

2ox0py,2,2014-12-10,I [23F] want to contact my ex-boss[45?F] for a career opportunity. It's been more than 2 years. How should I approach this?,edit-smile,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ox0py/i_23f_want_to_contact_my_exboss45f_for_a_career/,"In April 2012, I landed an Quality Assurance internship at a pharmaceutical company and I worked there until September 2012, when I had to leave for university. My boss was the branch director of the QA department and I had several supervisors while I transitioned through the different QA departments. 

My boss was really nice and everyone else was a pleasure to work with as well. We had a good relationship and I made a good effort to establish a pleasant relationship with everyone else I met too. I had very good work-ethic and most days I completed all the assignments so quickly that they usually ran out of tasks to assign me.

When it was time for me to leave the position, my boss treated me and the other supervisors to a very nice lunch. On my last day, I wrote her a letter expressing my gratitude and appreciation of the internship and gifted her with several gourmet/unique chocolate bars I brought back from my recent trip to Seattle.

I'm about to finish up my bachelors degree in pharmaceutical sciences with an expected graduation in March 2015. I'm really worried about finding a job and my self-esteem regarding such is rather low.
I was hoping to contact my old boss for career opportunities but  I haven't spoken to her since I left (over 2 years now).

I've gained a lot more experience (mostly as administration assistant, and IT related things) along with hopefully a bachelor's degree. I was hoping for any sort of position within the company (whether QA or QC).

I know we ended on a high note, but how would I open up that relationship to gain a career opportunity either within that company? Or possibly ask her for other company leads?

**TL;DR**: I had a good relationship with a boss from 2 years ago. Haven't spoken to her since. How would I reopen that relationship in order to ask her about career opportunities?"

When I was 19, I came home from a three month long internship in another part of the country. My sister destroyed most of my clothing (ripped into shreds mostly). I was of course very upset. I just can’t imagine WHY someone would go into their sister’s room, break out scissors, and shred their clothing while they were away. I really just don’t get it. I know she thought in her head she was “modifying” it for her own use, but the fact remains I paid for my clothing out of my job, kept it in my own private part of the house in a dresser, and never gave her an indication it was ok for her to tear it up into shreds. I confronted her about, used my words in an appropriate manner, but she utterly denied it. It’s been years, but she never apologized, so I’ve avoided her and moved on. She also has consistently lied about it. “This is not your clothing, it’s mine. What are you talking about??’ 

Other back story: At the time this happened, I was dating a person (such a lovely man, even though it was 8 years ago (dated for three years, he is still one of my closest and dearest friends) and she used to mock him ruthlessly about the fact that he was starting to go bald, to the point where I would almost break down and cry because it was so mean on her behalf, with no purpose. I do not care and didn’t care then about his hair; I also stood up for him consistently. What hurt the most was the idea that someone I love was being subject to superficial meanness. I tried to introduce him to her time and time again to clear things up, but she refused to interact and stayed in her room the whole time, even though my partner (still current friend) did his best to be appropriate and accommodating.

Flash forward several years: I’m seeing a great therapist, still in happy commucation with the “going bald” prior-boyfriend (we are great and loving friends), I feel surrounded by great friends and loving relationships, and I’ve been trying to amend things with my sister. But she’s an asshole. We haven’t interacted in 2 years in person, because all she does is bitch about our parents who pay all her bills, and when I mention to my parents why I don’t visit, they get pissed. 

They will never for a second acknowledge that she really was an asshole to me. That’s ok. I get it, parents are always going to side with the weaker child. But I really really don’t want to feel like the villain here. I know they will never acknowledge that she was (and is) a nasty person to me, but I don’t want to feel ashamed for what I feel. I mentioned these thoughts to them, and that I was seeing a therapist to work though some of these issues, and my mom got extremely upset and said that “talk therapy was turning me against my family.” I disagree, I’ve been very gentle in my description of my family to my therapist, and I’ve made a lot of progress, so it’s really not about trying to alienate anyone. What should I do?

2ox6eb,0,2014-12-10,"LGBT, poverty stricken &amp; homeless, but is there finally a way out?",ReeseHolmes,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ox6eb/lgbt_poverty_stricken_homeless_but_is_there/,"I'm in my mid twenties from NY and I've been homeless for two years. My fiance was recently granted access to $20K in stocks and bonds and we wish to utilize that money to settle down together in an LGBT friendly environment (as I'm transgender) where we can survive and thrive in a financially responsible way.

We've settled on New Haven, CT after much research into what location would best suit us. New Haven is a good place for artists, is urban and suburban but close to rural, is affordable and has employment opportunities. Connecticut itself has laws to protect the transgender population, such as cohesive anti-discrimination and laws enforcing insurance to cover related expenses. Essentially, despite NY's outward reputation for being gay friendly, Connecticut is truly at the forefront of LGBT rights. (As a NYer, it pains me to admit that.)

Our plan from here is:
Find an apartment in New Haven for $400-900 a month and plan to move in by January 14th, 2015.
Prior to the move, make connections with the LGBT community and gather information on resources for treatments/support.
Once we move in, follow a strict budget, find any job we can ASAP then look for better paying jobs during our probable underemployment.

Fortunately, having been dirt poor means I'm practiced in living dirt cheap and not spending money. However, my fiance is another matter entirely, but she's on board with learning how to budget smart if it means she can live independently.

My biggest problem is that I actually have no idea how to spend money wisely. My knee-jerk reaction is to simply squirrel it away and spend as little as possible on bare bones, but that's obviously not all there is to it.

We're both recent Bachelor's graduates, a fine artist and a theater major. She's in a bit more debt than I but her credit is far better and she's not being dogged by credit collectors. Ideally we'd each get an internship and work our way from there but we know we'll need a job while we do that.

I guess what I'm asking is this. Are we going in the right direction? Is there anything we're missing? How can we get an apartment if we have the money but not a job? Do you have advice on what to do with the money? And with this third rewrite, I enter my first reddit post."

---   
**tl;dr**: I genuinely feel that my sister is a nasty person, but perhaps I'm not giving her (third chance).

Update: I talked to my mom last night, and there was a lot of arguing on the phone, although we were able to talk this afternoon and have a more pleasant conversation. She’s still basically ignoring the fact that my sister isn’t a very nice person to be around. Her defense of my sister is that teenagers do stupid things all the time, and that she has her own regrets about being mean to people in high school and college. 

I still feel very strongly that my sister’s behavior was unacceptable regardless (seriously, I can never imagine acting the way that she did in high school, or being so unnecessarily cruel about someone’s appearance). An apology would go a very long way towards me feeling comfortable moving on, but you can’t force that out of someone. Nevertheless, I love my parents very much, and they’ve done a great deal for me, and cutting them out of my life, even temporarily, to make a point feels heartbreaking to me. They don’t have any other people who they are close to in their life, and I would feel like I’m “abandoning” them and I don’t think I could live with myself. 

I think as a compromise I’ll plan a visit where I can stay at a hotel nearby, and possibly visit with my boyfriend or a close friend (which my parents would be very open to, they are very welcoming in showing that the people I care about are important to them as well), so if I’m feeling a lot of stress or tension around her, I’ll have a “retreat” I can go to, and a source of support. Also I’m recognizing that my mom’s defensiveness about “talk therapy turning me against my family” is probably coming from a feeling of guilt or pain that she’s let me down somehow, rather than genuinely being angry at me and trying to make me feel bad. 

Also perhaps developing a game plan with my therapist about communication strategies for bringing these issues up with my sister, and seeing what her reaction is, as well as if it’s a bad reaction what steps I can take to make myself feel emotionally safe and not guilty. I do miss my family a lot, and my parents are getting older and I might not have forever to make time for them. It might be unpleasant, but I think that attempting to take the high road, given that the rest of my life is very stable and I have good, healthy other support structures in my life, will make me feel like at least I tried to do the right thing. 

tldr: Talked to my mother. I don’t feel any close towards resolving these issues with my sister, but my parents are very important to me and I know that if sucking it up (and developing a plan to take care of my needs) will make them happy, then I think in the long run I’ll look back and be glad that I tried to be compassionate even if nothing gets resolved.

2ox8ef,1,2014-12-10,Tired of being at home,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ox8ef/tired_of_being_at_home/,"Hello.

So I work as a freelance writer- mostly because I haven't been able to get any other jobs with a degree in literature. Believe me, I've tried. No company wants a recent college grad with only writing internships under his belt.. 

So I'm stuck inside all day plugging away on my computer doing stuff. The work isn't all that bad, pays OK, and is pretty easy for me. 

Thing is, I don't have any friends and I haven't had any for awhile. College wasn't my scene(I've never enjoyed binge drinking, pot smoking, or the like), (I did meet my girlfriend who I now live with) which resulted in me not making any lasting friendships. My girlfriend and I live together and she goes to work everyday from 8-5, which leaves me at home alone. Sometimes I work a fair portion of the day, but I can finish my work pretty quickly. And sometimes, there isn't that much of it. I want to write my novel but the inspiration isn't there.. 

Usually my back hurts from sitting so long, and I feel like that's the nature of the job. I work out, I stretch, but no matter what I always have to come back home and just work on things in a chair. I enjoy walks and runs, but its not fun to do it alone everyday.. The only people I see out on the trails are old people who don't have work. 

Not sure what to do to change things up and get out of my depression that has lingered for quite some time. I could join a gym, but I'd be doing that alone too. I also can't justify paying 100$ a month for some sort of classes with the amount of money I make. 

For some time I took solace in online gaming and online friendships but I've realized that most of these ""friendships"" I've made are mostly self serving and shallow. If I died or just suddenly disappeared, I'd just be a small memory to people, and in some ways I can't blame them.  

I've always wanted to be a writer, but I never realized how lonely it would be...

I went from an A-/B+ in intermediate to a B/B-, potentially lower, and might get a C in my cost class or even completely fail it. Pretty much, every grade in my classes dropped half of to one full letter grade. It's so frustrating that I burned out at the most important time, but I did. That's all recruiters are going to see when they request my transcripts in a few weeks - this kid probably got complacent and stopped caring. Four months of sleepless nights and endless studying down the drain in a span of 3 days, and I don't know how I'm going to justify why I should still have my internship offer.

2oyo7f,51,2014-12-11,I feel like I'm being ripped off and there is not much I can do about it without risking a lot,galaxyAbstractor,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2oyo7f/i_feel_like_im_being_ripped_off_and_there_is_not/,"**TL;DR: Bought an apartment, had  3.5 walls in a 18 square meter room repainted by a company, they are trying to bill me $1200 for 35 hours of work, I find that unreasonable but they refuse to cooperate, I have to pay by tomorrow 10am, might end up in court** 

Ohhh, where should I begin. Okay, I took my bachelors degree in computer science last spring and was immediately offered a job as a research assistant at my uni. However I needed some place to live since you aren't allowed to keep your student apartment after graduating, and I had two months to find somewhere.

I recently ""bought"" an apartment (I don't own the apartment, I own the right to live in the apartment and 1% of the housing society), since finding an apartment you can rent is pretty much impossible in Sweden as the queues for 1 - 2 room apartments are usually 5+ years, even in smaller towns (~30k inhabitants). The only one I could afford was a shoddy 1 room apartment that was in need of some major renovation, with a starting bid of $2000. Unfortunately it was very badly timed since the new students had just got their letters of admittance (the town where I bought the apartment is next to the uni town) so I ended up paying $6792 for it. But I managed to buy it without having to take a bank loan, which I'm happy about, I just had to loan some money from my mother until I received my first couple of pay checks.

But anyway... I mentioned the apartment was in need of renovation, mainly painting the walls since the previous owner managed to rip the wallpaper in parts in some places. Since I was only on a temporary hire for 6 months (ends in 2.5 days), I didn't really know how long I would live there so I decided to not do any major renovations, but I just couldn't stand the walls in the main room.


Before starting the job myself I had already asked a couple of companies what it would cost to have everything painted: walls, ceiling, door frames, windows frames. They had said it would cost $1064 including material after the 50% tax reduction (Sweden pays 50% of your renovation bills each year up to $6658/year/person). I found that too much.

Since I used pretty much all of my savings on buying the apartment, I decided I would repaint the room myself to save some money. Because, how hard can it be to repaint a room about 18 square meters? Oh boy was I wrong... I had no experience with anything like that. I would buy some cheap tools, I bought some paint, I bought some filler and stuff. I started taking down the wallpaper since it would come off by just looking at it, but at some places it was pretty tough to remove.

But I had this constant fear of doing something wrong and that I would waste time and money on it. I'm a programmer, not a painter! I also had focusing issues and would barely get anywhere. I would come home after work, all tired and unmotivated (I didn't really like the job since I found it quite boring after a while). On weekends I would rather want to sleep but forced myself to do some work.

After almost two months of working pretty much alone I was tired of it. I've had problem with depression before but usually very mild, but I felt like I was completely broken. I haven't been able to use my computer for almost 3 months, meaning I couldn't do anything I liked or talk to friends like I usually would do. At this point I decided to hire a company to do it for me.

I asked this company that I deemed trustworthy (they were pretty big, their parent company owning about 20 other painting companies) what they would take for everything, and they also told me about $1064. Told them that wont do, but we agreed to do the walls only, because that certainly would be cheaper, right?

Here is where the fuck up happens because of my stupidity. We had decided on that they should paint the walls and the date they should arrive over phone, and nothing else. I was extremely frustrated and depressed at the time, but I guess that isn't really an excuse for what I did. I asked them if we could write a contract, but they refused. I complained about it but they claimed I already agreed to a contract as they had already come to my apartment. I asked them how much it would cost, but they couldn't answer anymore (which is weird, you fucking knew what it would cost to do everything, but not the walls only?). I asked them how long it would take, but they refused to say. Nonetheless, I had to get to work by that time, so I didn't really have time to research what consequences I would have if I broke the contract I apparently agreed to, or if it was legal or not.

But okay, they do their thing, and they do a shitty job at it. After 4 days they were done and I noticed already that they left a big hole in the wall and one of the power outlets was painted over so I couldn't put the cover back on. I complained and they promptly fixed this and a couple of other minor stuff they found. I asked if they would bill me for it but they said no. A couple of weeks later, bright yellow spots showed up on the walls, apparently they didn't bother waiting for the filler to dry when fixing mistakes and painted right over. They came and fixed it. 3 weeks later it's back again and even worse... This was about 2.5 months after the original job, and they still hadn't sent me the bill, even though I asked them several times.

Finally I got the bill and decided to complain about the new yellow spots. I called the CEO directly and asked him to personally come over and fix the problems, but as I got the bill their tone suddenly had changed. They were pretty angry and ""hurt"" that I assumed it was their fault (they had previously agreed it was their fault the first time they fixed it), and that they couldn't do anything about it and it was my fault. I refused to accept that and forced them to come fix it for free which they did.

Now here is the thing, the bill is three times bigger than I expected. Those fuckers want me to pay $1200 for their shitty job. They claim it took 35 hours in total for their painter and an intern to do the job, which I refuse to believe.

The first day, all they did was to paint the 3.5 walls (one wall has a big window and a heating element) with white grounding paint, nothing else.

The second day they put filler on the walls. The third day they put on a second layer of filler on the walls...

The fourth day they painted and was done with the thing.

So, to reach 35 hours, the intern (who worked for 20 hours) would have worked 5 hours every day. The painter (15 hours) would have worked 3.75 hours every day. I am pretty sure it doesn't take 8.75 hours to paint 3.5 walls with grounder paint, or that it takes 8.75 hours to put filler on 3.5 walls. I can't possibly see how that would be correct, right? I don't have experience, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't take more than maybe, 45 minutes per wall to paint if being generous?  I assume putting on filler would take a bit longer than painting, but still? 

I sent them a letter, contesting the bill. After asking a couple of other companies what they would take to do the same work, they told me they would take $333 for it. I made it clear that I will pay max $400 and nothing else, since I feel that is more reasonable for the work they did. But obviously they didn't agree with me and I got a rather angry and heated phone call yesterday from the CEO. One thing for sure is that he doesn't really know what he is saying... How the fuck can a painter, who (hopefully) has an education and paints every day, not be able to give a rough time estimate? He also tried to use my own inexperience against me, which is stupid...

Next stage is that they'll send the bill to a collector, but I will dispute that bill too. The stage after that is for them to go to court about it... Which I'm really afraid about.

Because, how am I to prove that they didn't take 35 hours to complete the work? How am I to prove how much time is reasonable to repaint a room of 18 square meters? Obviously the company wont accept what I want to pay and refuses to make a compromise, so it seems like court is inevitable...

I just don't know where to even begin, and what to do... I certainly don't want to lose in court since that would mean I have to pay the bill + interest + their court costs + my court costs."

I'm moving to Calgary for an internship this summer and was wondering if you guys would be able to give me some details on living in Calgary. Toronto I've been living in for about 3 years now, I know the ins and outs, but moving to a city in a province I've never lived in is a little intimidating. What are some key facts about living in Calgary that most outsiders wouldn't know about?


Here are some questions I had:

1. How does public transit work in Calgary?
2. What are some quick details about the different neighborhoods in the city? Which areas should I avoid when looking for an apartment?
3. What is a great source to look for apartments? Here is Toronto ""viewit"" is huge, is there a certain website that is popular for rentals in Calgary?


Again those are just examples of things I would like to know. Please feel free to share any form of knowledge as I don't know much about your city!

So I'm currently a second year MIS major at Wright State Univ. and i'm just realizing more and more college sucks. Finals are getting to me and I want a ""big boy"" job, and go to school at a slower pace. In high school I went to a tech school and with a computer networking focus, because pretty darn good at routing protocols, and network maintenance. I never formally got my CCNA cert(s) and or A+, but I have CCNA certs in networking a small to medium business, and can do all the things required for an A+.

I have worked at staples as an easy tech before college, while in college I worked level 1 help desk at my uni, in the summer I worked at a local small business as an IT intern, and finally I got promoted within the level 1 help desk, to a senior level 1 help desk.

I have a pretty decent history in tech and I want to get out of school to go at my own pace with college while working a real job. The problem is, I have no idea where to start. I'm applying for a bunch of similar help desk/call center jobs, but I really want something more, even an assistant *Insert tech position here* i'd happily take, I just don't know where to start for sure. I'm not sure what certs to get (planning on grabbing an A+, CCNA, CCNP, and some Microsoft certs but they're all a pretty penny) so any advice is welcome. I always see people say ""I got hired in just knowing my stuff then earned my degree in several years"" I want to do that, just would like so direction.

Thank you so much for reading and giving any input, I know it's sloppy but i'm just flustered right now and it's difficult to type coherent thoughts when that happens haha.
Have a great day!"

A little context: I'm about to move out of my parents house and into the dorms this spring semester, my first semester away from home. I'm very excited, but college is obviously expensive. I've been working as a software engineer intern making $15 an hour for the past 6 months.


The problem: [This god damn coat.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/51325520/modern-mini-wool-coat-with-asymmetrical?ref=shop_home_active_5) I love it so much. It is minimalist, has a warm color, and a touch of edge. God damn I just think that coat is so cool. It's got a snood hood! I'm 5'8 so I feel like it would look pretty darn good on me too. It's professional, but also fun. 

Cons:
1) I'm pretty sure it's stupidly expensive.
2) It wouldn't be that warm. Definitely more of a spring time/autumn coat.

Pros:
1) I haven't been able to find another coat like it, and I love everything about this one minus the price.
2) It would last a long time.
3) Could be worn with lots of outfits. 

What do you think Reddit? Should I spurge and buy this kind of impractical coat or save up this money for half a textbook?

2ozn2j,5,2014-12-11,Why do you root for your team?,lsmucker,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ozn2j/why_do_you_root_for_your_team/,"Who do you root for? There are so many reasons people pick a team to root for these days and just because you live in a state with a franchise team doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a fan of the home team forever; especially when you’re a kid.

I have had a long road to finding a team to stick with and no real rhyme or reason for any of it.

I never had that team to follow growing up because, frankly, my parents never cared about sports. Sure, they would watch the Super Bowl for the social significance of the event, but otherwise there was never a game on.
Growing up, I was a huge fan of the 49ers thanks to my hero Joe Montana, but it wasn’t because I watched him play every Sunday. The guy was the face on all my video games. He was putting up killer numbers with Jerry Rice and was often highlighted in Sports Illustrated for Kids magazine, in addition to a number of made-for-children sports biographies I read.

In addition to Montana, I also loved Barry Sanders. Again, I never really watched him play but I can distinctly remember all the binders and spiral notebooks featuring cool photos of a wide-eyed Sanders juking past defenders.
At that time, Sanders and Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys were the popular running backs in the league and it was crucial to decide where your allegiance stood between the two because friends would call you out and you would have to be able to debate that allegiance. 

Around the time of Montana, Smith and Sanders, there was also a guy named Bo Jackson. Again, I didn’t follow him to retirement, I didn’t really watch any of his games, but I definitely appreciated the guy for his contribution to sports.
Brands like Nike and Wheaties ate the guy and all his records up. I’ll never forget the “Bo Knows” advertising slogan that was generally aimed at boys my age. 

Fast forward to high school, I decided to become a Carolina Panthers fan.
At first, it was for no reason other than the fact that they were an expansion team and they had a cool blue and black logo and I needed a Starter jacket to keep up with the Joneses, but then I started using the team in my NFL video games and got to know the names of the players.

This was back in the Frank Reich days of 1995. For me, just getting to use the players was enough to keep me trying to doodle the logo during class and writing the word “Panthers” over and over on my notebook paper.

In college, when I was living in Chicago, I was a fan of the Bears. This time, I actually watched the games. I enjoyed the “Good Rex, Bad Rex” media campaign regarding Grossman’s play. I loved the Cedric Benson and Thomas Jones rivalry. I remember the team going to the Super Bowl and watching as Devin Hester took the opening punt back to the Colts end zone for a touchdown. 

After I left Chicago and moved to upstate New York for a newspaper internship with the Amsterdam Recorder, I became a Patriots fan. I distinctly remember the team’s perfect season and being so excited for the Super Bowl against the Giants.
My girlfriend at the time rooted for the Giants just to give me grief and had no idea why I was so frustrated when the team lost.

Not long after that, finding work and gaining experience as a reporter trumped any interest I had in professional sports, so I don’t remember following anyone.
Eventually, I jumped on the Tim Tebow bandwagon during his senior year as a Florida Gator and religiously followed him in news feeds and live broadcasts up until the year he was cut by the Patriots after the pre-season.

After that, I knew I liked the Bears, but not enough to get back into them like I once had. I started following the Saints about two years ago because I had always considered them to be a good football team in general. Ever since then, I’ve been a fan and I am sticking by them even in their crummy season this year.

Being a fan, reading stories on the news and rumors of your team’s players, rooting for the team in success or defeat, it’s fun. I don’t think I’ll ever be such a big fan that I enter a fantasy football league, but I love being a fan of athletes."

Here's my tale from the well known clothing store that populates many malls across America.

I talked to both of my supervising managers a week ago about putting my two weeks in. I've been working at said store for about a year and some change, but I felt it was my time to move on since I was taking on more work at my internship which I have to commute an hour to get to. Thus results in the first conversation with my store manager (SM), my hiring manager (HM) and me.

&gt;Me: Hey, I need to talk to you guys about something.
&gt;
&gt;HM: Oh no! Nothing bad I hope.
&gt;
&gt;Me: Well... that's open for interpretation.  I would really like to put in my two weeks. I just wanted to let you know my last day is going to be (two weeks from now).
&gt;
&gt;SM: Oh no.. no, no, no, no. You can't leave. We need you!
&gt;
&gt;Me: I know, it sucks, but I'm taking on more full time work at my internship and I would really like to focus on that. Plus I'd be working up there 5-6 days a week, so that wouldn't give much leeway to working down here.
&gt;
&gt;HM: Oh okay... We'll be really sad to see you go.
&gt;
&gt;Me: I don't have my physical two weeks letter, but I'll get that to you guys some time soon.

(Clarification: I know it was probably a bad idea to approach the subject with my managers without having a physical letter, but I was just tired and overworked)

&gt;SM: Well, you can't leave until you train one of our seasonals to be just like you.

I know my SM might have been joking with that statement but it kind of took me aback that she would say that. I'm one of the few people who run the fitting room in the store so well that we don't have any go-backs by the end of the night so I understood where she was coming from.

The next day HM approaches me.

&gt;HM: Hey, I wanted to talk to you without SM being here.
&gt;
&gt;Me: Oh okay
&gt;
&gt;HM: I hope SM didn't make it seem like you didn't have a choice.  We just want the best for you. Once you get your physical two weeks, just give it to us so we can have your last day in writing.
&gt;
&gt;Me: Ok I'll get on that

Fast forward a couple of days, I went to go see my SM to hand her my physical letter.

&gt;Me: Here you go.
&gt;
&gt;SM: Oh no! So when is your last day?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Well since I said two weeks a couple days ago... so (same date).
&gt;
&gt;SM: No, no, no can you please stay until after Christmas? We would really need the help that weekend after.

I really wanted to quit before then because I was hoping to get some family time in since I had been working two jobs for the past year and I missed Thanksgiving since I was opening cashier that day.

&gt;Me: Well... I had other things planned with my family.
&gt;
&gt;SM: Pleaaaaaaase?
&gt;
&gt;Me: (-__-) I don't know....
&gt;
&gt;SM: We could work around your schedule. Until then, I won't take that (my letter)

I walked away thinking, ""what the hell just happened?"" I'm probably going to try to give my letter to my HR since she's more reasonable.

**TL;DR**: I try to quit, my manager tries to keep me on for a couple more weeks when I wanted that time off so I can try to go back to regular human sleeping hours before sinking my teeth into more work.

**EDIT**: I don't know why I put HR instead of HM in the middle. I'm working too hard -__-"

In May, I finish a dual major in Finance and Economics at a B school. 
I also made a poor decision of not taking an internship and choose a job with a higher wage instead. 

Now i did quite a bit during school, I did the finances for my fraternity. I worked and ran a student managed fund which manages part of my schools endowment. So i a have a fairly good knowledge of large cap fund management. We currently ranked in the top 17% based off performance ytd in the fund pool we benchmark against. 

I am also currently working on the CFA Research Challenge. 
Along with that i'm considering sitting for my CFA Level 1 to help improve my marketability. 

Two other side notes: my resume is tailored to focus on what i have done at school and i try to network as much as a can. 

First off thank you for anyone who took time out of their day to read it. Is there any advice any of you are able to offer me to help me in this uphill battle. "

2p03bc,2,2014-12-11,Best U.S. cities for an openly-kinky software engineer? Are there good resources for assessing different cities' kink scenes?,throwzitawayyy,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2p03bc/best_us_cities_for_an_openlykinky_software/,"Hey gaybros and gaybro-affiliated persons. I'm 21, a junior in college studying computer science, and kinky as hell. Living in this (relatively) tiny college town has seriously deprived me of any outlet for my kinky needs and I'm honestly sick of it. However, in the next couple years I'll be doing at least one internship, graduating, searching for a job, and moving somewhere new to start my life after college. Given that I'm in a position to be making quite a bit of money and can pretty much move anywhere I want to, I want to be sure that wherever I end up has a good kink scene for me to get into and is generally liberal enough that I can be open about my relationships if I decide that's something I want to do. Preferably I'd like to stay in the Pacific Northwest or at least Northern California, but other parts of the U.S. aren't beyond consideration.

Right now the city at the top of my list is San Francisco, followed by Seattle and Portland, OR. SF seems like the obvious choice due to the large tech scene, high salaries, and its (former?) status as a gay mecca. The people in SF seem to have seen everything so it feels like an ideal place to be open about kink. On the other hand, I have some political issues with California and I'm not really sure that SF is the city for me. I'm somewhat less familiar with (i.e. have watched less porn from) the kink scenes in Portland and Seattle, but I've looked around and they apparently exist, but seem to be a bit less public than the scene in SF.

So I guess that brings me to my core questions: First are the questions in the title. Beyond those, are there any specific pros and cons to the cities I've listed that I should be aware of? Are there other cities I should consider both on the West Coast or elsewhere?"
2p07vt,2,2014-12-11,I'm [20 M] contemplating a visit to my [20F]ex during the holidays,ZinBill,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2p07vt/im_20_m_contemplating_a_visit_to_my_20fex_during/,"I would like to say to start off that this was my first serious relationship and many cringey mistakes were made. I met this girl my sophomore year of high school but we did not start dating until our senior year. Everything was great, we clicked well, we had fun and the sex was awesome. Being able to think back on the beginnings of our relationship three years ago I can see the signs of bad things to come (20/20) she was possessive and if I were to not see her for more than a day or two she would guilt me into spending more time with her and less with my friends. At the time I did not think much of it, but being in a few relationships since then I can look back and see this being a bit of a red flag. Fast-forward to the end of our senior year, everything seems great, our relationship seems cool and we are both off to university. Well, I’m off to university, shes off to for army basic training. She enlisted in the army national guard and was going to be spending eight months in basic training and advanced individual training (ait) while I was going to be going to an engineering institute in a town Id never lived in before with many thousands of people iv never met before. I was freaking out a little because how is our relationship going to last for eight months with very little contact? So I decided to break up with her, in my mind I wanted the “college” experience, and I was thinking that her being away from me for eight months was only going to hinder that experience. So I break up with her a few weeks after school starts and about two weeks before she goes to basic (end of September).

	
* Its November 2012 now, I dated a few girls and got in one “serious” relationship but ended up breaking it off. Im down and a little depressed and decided to write a letter to her (It would be nearing the end of her basic training, I got the address from her mother btw). I do not remember exactly word for word what I wrote but it was basically an apology letter telling her I messed up and wanted her back. I get a call from her about a week later asking if I was serious and if I had done anything with any one ealse. I was truthful and she said she wanted a while to think about it. Another week passes and I get another phone call from her. Shes graduated basic traning and was going to be back in town for a day or two before she needed to be at her AIT location. She wanted to meet up and talk about some things. So we meet up, talk, and end up having make up sex. She leaves for AIT where she is allowed a cell phone and we talk about every night.

	
* Its Christmas now and shes back in town for a two week holiday break from training. We drink, have fun, and at some point the topic of me enlisting comes up. “wouldn’t it be cool if we were both in the guard” im feeling guilty for breaking up with her and the more I think about the educational benefits of it the more I like the Idea. We talk more about it and I wanted a MOS (military occupational specialty) that could benefit me in the real world. I chose to become a 91B (wheeled vechile mechanic) and have my basic date set for September of next year. I talked to a recruiter and went through MEPS and had all the paper work done by the middle of February. At this point we are both thinking that we are the best cupple in the world, there was a reason why we broke up and then got back together, we are clearly now stronger than ever!

	
* …not quite, we talk almost nightly (whenever she got out the school house) and everything seemed great, we had ideas of getting an apartment together, she was going to go to the same university I was going to while I went to training, exc exc. Basicly a world was constructed in our minds on how things were going to be once she got back from training. 

	
* Its April 2013 now, Im almost done with my first year of university and she is almost down with her AIT. I go to her graduation and seeing her after so long was amazing, we hugged, cryed, the whole nine yards. My university is about 2 hours from my home town so I would drive home every weekend and visit her while school was still in session. Once finials ended I moved in with her and her family. There parents loved me they were cool with me staying with them until I had to leave for my basic training date. This is where things began to go downhill. The first was she still wanted to get an apartment, I had thought about it and concluded that It did not make a lot of since for us to get an apartment when I was going to be leaving for about eight months for my AIT and basic training come September (about 3.5 months away). That’s cool, you know, we will just get one when I come back from my training. Except living with her was a border line night mare! She apparently has a lot more emotional problems than I realized. She would be great and energetic one day, then down and depressed the next. She said it was the side effects of the birth control shot she got (depo I believe?) and it was messing with her hormones and making her very moody and emotional. Ok cool, we can deal with this. The next thing that comes up is the anxiety, she is trying to find a job since she has all this free time before she starts school for her in September. Ok cool, Ill help you find one since you in the military and the national guard this should be easy right? No, not really. Im not going to go into the specifics about the job hunt because that’s a book in of its self but lets just say it did not go to well. 

	
* Before the end of my spring semester I desided to sign up to take some of my general education electives at a community college near her house. Well she wants to take a few with me. Ok cool, GF in the same class as me, what could go wrong? I find out she is lazy with class work and procrastinates everything, getting everything done at the last minute and being very anxious about all the work. And did I mention anxiety? Yeah it kind of blew up during this period and she had several panic attacks. At this point im beginning to wonder if being in a relationship with such craziness is such a good idea and if my decision to enlist was well founded. By the end of the summer session in the beginning of august I’m at the end of my wits, I blow up on her, tell her she is acting crazy and tell her its over. I move out to my moms house and stay there. We still had about a week left of class left so being in the same room as her was aqward. A week after classes (about the middle of august at this point) she calls and wants to talk about things. She says shes sorry for acting crazy and being emotional and very moody, she blames the birth control shot and her adjustment back to civilian life as the causes and basically says that she will be more calm an good. So we get back together for two weeks only for nothing to change and I finial say goodbye. I completely cut her off, block her on every media site imaginable and eventually block her from my phone. I did not want all this drama going on right before I had to leave for basic training which I was not questioning the foundation of the reasons why I enlisted in the first place.

	
* September 2013, im off to basic and all communication is shut down. Army basic traning is 10 weeks and during this time im to tired to even think about my ex gf. Once basic training is over im shipped off to AIT. 


* Mid November 2013. For anyone who hasn’t had the pleasure of going through AIT at Ft.Lee VA, there is A LOT of down time, like hours and hours of “hurry up and wait” type shit. So what keeps running through my mind during all this down time? My ex. I cant stop thinking about her, how I wronged her again and broke up with her. Its on constant repeat in my mind and eventually I call her. She is very respective and wanted to know why I did not call sooner. She had my basic training graduation date marked on the calendar and cried when I did not call. Im feeling very bad and guilty at this point. So we basically talk every night on the phone (sound familiar?) I come home for xmas holidays and we spend two whole weeks in each other’s arms. 


* March 2014. Im graduating from AIT, I come home and I live at her parents again. We decide to go to a different university together and I get my transfer paper work together. Everything seems cool but I decide to apply to a few other schools as well just to see what I can get. Turns out there is an amazing engineering school out west that wants me to go to them. Military members get instate tuition and on top of that only have to pay ½ of that cost. To make it all even sweeter all my tuition is paid for by the scholarships they offer me meaning the only thing I have to pay for is housing. Im thinking “wow, the chance to move out of state, go thousands of miles away from where im at now and not have to pay for any of the schooling. So this is in the back of my mind, I did not have to make a decision until May. This is probably one of my biggest mistakes, I did not tell my gf any of this. I told her I applied to the university we agreed on and I got in, I did not tell her this awesome deal I could get if I go out of state. A little added info, Im more geared to math and since where she is more toward humanities, she was worried about taking a college algebra class if that can give you any perspective, the play Im referring to is exclusively engineering and science with a minimum of calc 1 &amp; 2 which were way out of the question for her. 


* May 2014. Things arnt working out, she is very possessive and can’t stand me not being in her sight for more than a day. Im not as close to my old friends as I would like to and she only wants to spend time with me. I drop this shell on her of having the chance to go somewhere I might never have the chance to go to if I stay with her and go to this university and rack up all this debt on something I could be getting for free and at a better institute. From this point everything moves very quickly. I accept the schools offer on their dead line date, get all my stuff from her house and move out all in the course of two days. I find a place off crieges list near the university and crash there until I found more permeant housing.  I get a call from her saying a left things at her house and that I needed to come get them, im ~2000 miles away at this point and tell her to just throw them away because it was clearly nothing vital. She wigs out, and brings up the topic of some concert tickets we had bought (I gave her cash and she bought both of them on her credit card). The tickets were 300$ each and I tell her she can either send mine out to me and I can sell it or she can sell both of them and send the money to me. She refuses and basically says I would need to go back to her house and get my ticket if I wanted to sell it. Im pissed, hang up the phone and delete her number. 


* December 11, 2014 That was the last contact Iv had with her. I took a summer class at the university and have gone full time this fall. Iv made close friends and have done good in my fall classes. I even got a paid internship in Texas. they will pay for me to relocate for the summer, pay my housing, and on top of that pay me 23$/hr with 40 hours a week guaranteed and the opportunity for over time. So the semester is winding down and I have two finials left, the last one being on Tuesday. All my friends are going home for the holidays but im staying where im at until January 4th then im flying home and coming back on January 11th before school starts for the spring. So…. After all that, I want to reestablish contact with her, maby meet up and catch up on things. I do not know if that is a good Idea or not, if im re opening something that should remain closed. 


* I would also like to add that I have discovered more about myself since moving out here. Iv discovered a lot of things sexually, mentally, and emotionally that I do not think I would have ever discover had I stayed at my home town or even my old university. Transferring schools has by far and away the best decision in my life, im debt free, the military pays for me to go to school, and thanks to my good grades at my old university im going to the school for free. On top of all this I will be working for a great engineering company during the summer and if all goes well during the summer then I will have a great long-term employment opportunity with this company. 


* Here’s the kicker, I still think about her. Despite it being seven months, and all these great things happening to me, I still think about her almost daily. Iv been in relationships since iv moved out here with both men and women and am currently dating a girl for the past month and a half that I feel could really work. But I still think about her more than I would like to admit. 


* So heres my question, should I see her during my trip back home? Should I reestablish contact? Im not sure what I would even get out of it but its been on my mind for a few weeks now and driving me up a wall.

**tl;dr** Dated a girl for a year, broke up, got back together for another year, broke up, got back together *again* then broke up again. Its been seven months since we last talked and ill be in town for the holidays, should I reestablish communication with her? 


P.S. I know shes not over me either, iv been in contact with her sister on occasion and she said she still talks about me and has been single this whole time.

I've been a lurker on this reddit for quite sometime now and I feel like now is a appropriate time for my first post.

I am going to be interning for a Michigan based church organization (His House Christian Fellowship) and I start my fundraising for this next year on the 19th. This will be my first time fundraising and I've already run into many walls trying to do this along with being beyond nervous. All I ask is if when you pray you could pray for God to bless my endeavors to try to raise money so I can be a full time intern.

I've been praying about this for a while and Gods put it on my heart to go about this in full force because I am not actually relying on him, I'm relying on my part time job to get me through and he wants me to out faith in Him. The students at my campus (Michigan tech) need someone who can meet with them when they are free and with a part time job its been very hard to meet and encourage other Christians.

Thanks for reading and for your prayers.

2p15f5,75,2014-12-11,Mischief and Mayhem on the East Coast,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2p15f5/mischief_and_mayhem_on_the_east_coast/,"One summer while back a series of weird and probably unrelated things happened to me, most of which I completely forgot about until I discovered this sub. I brushed off everything at the time, but looking back it was pretty damn weird. Anyway, here goes.



In the summer of 2011 I was living with my dad on break from college in this little fishing village with a pretty serious tourist economy. I'd always lived there but I didn't really know too many people around all that well because most of my friends had gone to school and were off doing internships and on various adventures. For some backstory, I'm a big viking-looking guy, I was around 21 at the time all this happened. I have a pretty unique name, both first and last, old family names. I'm one of three known people in the US with my name (according to the internet).





So around May this acquaintance who graduated from my university the previous year shoots me an email to tell me a funny anecdote about someone who just applied for work at a company where he's the HR. The guy looked fairly normal, but once he got into the interview started acting skittish and strange. He made several references to ""his niggas and bitches"" and went off on tangents about parties he'd thrown at his house. The kicker is, he gave my name, my home state, and the general area where my parents live as his personal information. No phone, no social, no address. He didn't seem particularly upset to learn that he didn't get the job. The guy who sent it to me thought it was funny and kind of strange, we laughed about it and it never really came up again.




After that I started getting some interesting phone calls. Not even pranks, just people who called to speak to someone and seemed genuinely confused that I wasn't that person. A few calls from my job saying ""Hey this is Amy (boss's name), I'm going to need you to come it at 5 today"" and then when I got there the boss hadn't called me and everyone was just confused. This one may have been a friend, as one of my friends was pretty into pranks. I don't know how he would have spoofed my boss's voice though.




In mid July I got home late one night, friends dropped me off, and about a half hour later I see a sedan pull into my driveway and just sit there. My dad's driveway is a good 100+ feet long so I have an okay view of them, but they wouldn't necessarily be able to see the house because of the distance and the trees. 



The friend who just dropped me off has a sedan, so I assume he forgot something, but the car just sits there, and then drives off about 5 minutes later. I didn't really think anything of it. The car came back every few nights for the rest of the summer, sometime between 2:30 and 3:30 AM. It wasn't anyone I knew, and they weren't leaving the paper. Sometimes they'd show up when I was out for a smoke, and I'd stand in the driveway and wave. They never did anything threatening and were always gone in under 5 minutes so I never thought to call the police.



One time I made plans with a friend to drive around and get food around 2:30 AM, and I see the headlights coming down the driveway. Being slightly drunk and thinking it's my friend, I start howling like a Nordic barbarian and charge toward the car with my hands in the air. When I get about 40 feet away the car peels out of the driveway and speeds off, and I can see that it's the same beat up sedan from a few weeks ago. 



About two minutes later my actual friend shows up and tells me there's a dented sedan idling in an abandoned parking lot down the road, which is noteworthy because we live in the middle of nowhere. We drove by the lot, the car pulled out behind us, and tailed us until we sped up, pulled into a neighborhood, turned the lights off, and watched them drive by. We went out looking for them a few minutes later but no one was on the roads. They came by maybe once after that but didn't stay long. After that summer they never came back, and nothing ever happened at the house, no break ins or anything.



Since then I haven't heard anything about the guy who used my name, or whoever was parking in my driveway. Pretty sure I know who made the calls, but he never admitted to it. Never found out who it was, and none of my friends or my brother's friends drive a car like that. So, mischief makers of 2011, let's not meet again."

My summer internship was winding down and all my friends had graduated school. I took an extra semester and would be finishing in late December. I decided I didn't really have time to build a relationship, but I did want to make new friends. Most of my friends had graduated.

I ended up meeting a really cool guy and we began to hang out as friends. He was new to the area and he introduced me to his housemates. They were all students at the university, but him. I was commuting for awhile, so in-between classes, I would hang out at there house. Eventually, we started to hang out more and more. It was completely platonic. He told me how he met a girl at a festival that he really liked and he's been talking to her on the phone. I would sometimes just hang out with housemates when he was on the phone with her. We were basically all friends at this point.

One night I invited him out to a bar with some of my friends. He got pretty drunk and ended up telling me he had feelings for me. I told him that he was already talking to that girl, his lifestyle didn't really align with mine, and we were better suited as friend. He told me that sometimes things happen in life and it changes how you feel about people. He asked me to give him a chance and it was okay if it didn't go anywhere, he just wanted to know I was still going to come over after I found a closer apartment. I agreed.

Well long story short, we continue to hang out more frequently and define that we are exclusively dating each other. He's always super wish-washy with what he wants, but I tolerate it. One day he's crying in front of me because he's stressed out and the next he's super stand offish. 

When I got back from vacation, he moved in with me for a few weeks until he flew home for Thanksgiving. During this time, we got really close. He had a complete change of heart. He told me that he did really like me and he just never wanted to hurt me if he ended up moving away. He started to treat me great. We argued a lot less and overall everything was good.

Right before he went home for Thanksgiving, he decided he was staying home for good until he figured out his life more. All of his friends were moving away by end of December, so he might as well. On his last night here, he told me I was the best thing that happened to him since he moved out here. He really liked me and wanted to keep in contact. The only reason we were ""breaking"" up was because of the distance. He was going to miss me, but we could eventually end up together. I told him I would prefer making a clean break because it would be too hard with the distance. He begged me not to do that.

When he left, I cried... a lot. At first when he got home, we were talking on the phone a lot and he was still really sweet. About a week after he left, my friend overdosed and I was told by the vet my childhood dog had less than two weeks to live. I was a wreck. He comforted me and told me he was coming back. The next day he texts me he decided not to move back, but wouldn't tell me why. I called him about 3 times and he didn't answer. Finally about four days later he answered. The whole time he was being super passive and finally asked him why he was being so short. He replied ""he didn't really like talking on the phone."" I told him he always talked on the phone and he spent hours talking to the festival girl. He told me not to give him that because he had already spent like an hour on the phone with me. I told him I had to go and hung up. Today he texts me asking what my address is... I'm assuming to send a Christmas gift.

I am so confused at this point and I'm about to just cut off contact completely to let things go. Do you think I should just break things off completely?"
2p247u,1,2014-12-12,I [27/F] don't know if I should attempt to pursue the flirty and charismatic [29/M] that I was used to seeing every day and now won't because of graduation,adloquium,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p247u/i_27f_dont_know_if_i_should_attempt_to_pursue_the/,"So.. disclaimer, if anyone reads my post history from last year on MMFB, meeting with and interacting with this person that I have feelings for currently has greatly improved my view on life.


&amp;nbsp;


I honestly, and sadly, haven't ""crushed on"" or ""developed feelings"" for someone that I knew in person since I was maybe 14 years old. I just had no.. interest.. in any males I came across as I grew up. I tried long distance dating and relationships (none have ended well); but I've never had a face-to-face relationship with someone.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm an undergraduate college student working in a lab on campus (I changed careers in my mid-twenties). There, I met wonderful people. One of them is the one I am interested in. He is a graduate student working on his PhD. As this semester has gone on, I've grown more and more fond of him. He is a very attractive man and as far as our interactions went, we both have the same biting sarcasm and we did nothing but throw jabs at each other. There were many times where we'd be on other sides of the lab or a room on campus and we'd just look at each other, laugh, and go ""what are you looking at?!"" It was refreshing to feel.. young, flirty, light attraction with someone.


&amp;nbsp;


Today was my last day to work in the lab until after my internship off of campus ends at the end of June 2015. He graduates May 2015, which means today was the last day I would ""see"" him in the normal type of interactions. Today I also gave him a hand-made gift to thank him for his help and patience as my upperclassman this semester. He hugged me and seemed genuinely happy. Unfortunately, I also witnessed today that many of the graduate and postgrad women throw themselves at him, begging him to go ice skating with them, etc. He is very charismatic around them and I wonder if my banter with him is just the type he has with all women.


&amp;nbsp;


A friend of mine (another grad student in our lab) let fly that I had ""a crush,"" and (the man of my attraction) said aloud frankly he and I wouldn't be dating when (my friend) poked repeatedly asking when we'd be going out. By the end of the day, though, I did confirm it with him that it was true that I had feelings for him. I didn't get a real reaction back besides ""no.. is it really?"" as the conversation was abruptly ended. When I saw him again, he was right back to making fun of me, and I, him. We smiled and laughed to each other even in the presence of our labmates.


&amp;nbsp;



Unfortunately.. the girls who wanted him to go ice skating with came into the lab: ""So-and-so told me to come and get you or else you wouldn't come!"" so he was escorted out of the lab without us saying our ""final"" goodbyes. I left the lab about an hour later and I'm pretty sure because of my internship hours, it will be hard for me to come and visit the lab before he leaves.


&amp;nbsp;


Phew. Okay. Well.. I'm most certainly not in his league on looks (or smarts), but I enjoyed our interactions very much.. I don't have his number or have him friended on Facebook or anything like that. I have his email, of course.


&amp;nbsp;


Knowing that he's such.. a popular guy.. I don't know if I should pursue him? Try to keep in contact with him? We never had very deep conversations, alone, or anything. I don't know if I'm mistaking his friendly and flirty nature for something more (or hoping it's something more..). This is all a very VERY new concept to me and I honestly don't know how to proceed or to just move on. Thank you and I'm sorry if this was a long read with any missing gaps.. tried to cover the gist of it.

2p2foe,3,2014-12-12,Should Vets be allowed to dispense?,SEMooney,newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/2p2foe/should_vets_be_allowed_to_dispense/,"I am an intern pharmacist. Recently, hubby took our dog to the vet and, before he got home and I could intervene, he left with $200 worth of drugs for our dog (Total bill =$360 for skin and ear infection). Aside from my research suggesting that three weeks of systemic antibiotics, antifungald and topical antibiotics were not necessary (a one week course would likely have sufficed, but hey, I'm no vet), if I had got a script and bought the drugs from work (or any pharmacy) I could have bought them for around $30 (even non-subsidised, without staff discount). I also could have got them in a more useful dose, as vet only had 50mg fluconazole and we can sell it in 150mg which is the dose he needed (so one pill a day instead of 3).
The reason Doctors are not allowed to dispense (amongst many) is to remove an incentive for them to prescribe lots of drugs to make more money. I think Vets should not be allowed to dispense for the same reason. At least they should have to offer a prescription. 
What do you think? Should vets be allowed to sell what they prescribe? At whatever price they like?"

I am due to graduate University with an Undergraduate degree in Business Information Systems in May and I will be moving to the UK from Ireland to work in the Technology Division of a American Banking corporation. This is the first time in my life I will be earning a proper full-time salary (come from a poor background)  and I would like to start off with my best foot forward. 

Quick Facts:

* Salary £39,000 (USD $62,000ish). I believe this rises quickly each year if I manage to stay in the firm.
* Relocation Lump Sum £9000 (USD $14,000ish)
* Yearly Bonus: I am eligible for a yearly bonus but I honestly have no idea what or how much this can be.
* Pension: Employer pays 11% on top of my salary into a pension plan.
* Debts: I was lucky enough to earn an academic scholarship to University, coupled with the fact I have worked 2 jobs on top of University I don't have any debts. I also don't have any assets really other than my clothes and my laptop etc.
* Monthly Expenses: Food (£400), Housing (£750?) and Gym (£17) Membership are the primary ones I have. When I was living in London before I walked to and from work, but I may be living somewhere that I will need to use Public Transport when I move back.
* Age: 27

I did my Internship with the same company for 6 months and rented a room in a house for £750 per month, which honestly was not nice at all but was only 2.5 miles from the office. There was no living space in the house just bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen. 

I suppose really my goal would be to save up to buy a small apartment for myself (although I am open to other suggestions!). What can I do to maximise my finances living in a very expensive area like London? I read a lot here I should put some money aside first as emergency funds which I totally agree with. What should I do next?

TL:DR: Moving to London next year. Starting off in a good job and need to know what to do with my salary."
2p2w7u,2,2014-12-12,M4F. Long term rp wanted. Possible prompts inside!,myincognitoname,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2p2w7u/m4f_long_term_rp_wanted_possible_prompts_inside/,"So far I've come up with several prompts in search of a long term rp partner. I think I'm pretty good with RP but a few days in and every time my partner flakes and I never hear from them again. 

Here are a few different prompts I'm interested in.

1. The office affair with some kind of added twist. You could be my boss, peer, secretary or intern but we are both married and over time the sexy innuedos and flirting get taken further and further as we both realize we don't get what we want at home. But there's more to you than meets the eye. You decide what it is! 

2. The woman in the elevator. Weeks have gone by and at least twice a week I ride the elevator up with you. It's the best 60 seconds of my day. My god you're gorgeous and you always give a crooked smile when I get on. And that little hair flip as you tell me to ""Have a nice day!"" when I get off the elevator knowing I've been checking you out. But one day the elevator is overly crowded and we are pushed against each other and I just can't stop myself from getting hard and you feel it against your ass...

3. Mom/sister drama queen.  You're always the damsel in distress and every time you come to me over something petty and annoying but I know you rely on me quite heavily and I'm always there for you.  But this time it's serious. You're going to have to hide out with me in my apartment for who knows how long. And that sexual tension that's been there since I was 12... surfaces and I have to try and deal with you getting a little too close when my mind is else where. 

I've written much longer prompts before that are more specific and if you wanted to check those out by all means please do.  The only new one here is the woman on the elevator.  I really want to find a long term rp partner but I understand we have to be able to connect for that to happen. 

My favorite kinks are rough sex, power switching, incest, futa, pegging, office affair... just to name some. If it's not listed in my limits I will be down to try it out!

And my limits are scat, gore, underage play and animals. 

PM me and let me know what you'd like to try and if there is anything you would like to change or add to any of the prompts. I really enjoy having my partner have equal say in the set up and role of characters! 

I can't wait to talk to you soon!"

I've got a good deal of money in savings so I could technically afford this with the thought being that next summer I'll get an internship and earn about as much money as I'll spend (enough so that I can get set up when I graduate).

I have two questions. First because of where I live its 500 dollars cheaper to buy a ticket from Toronto to Europe. Though its a day trip to drive out there, time isn't critical to me. I might even be able to convince someone to go out with me and split gass. Even taking Amtrak would be cheaper. Will I run into any significant difficulty departing from Toronto?.

And second question. Does 2500 seem reasonable for a month Euro trip knowing it does not contain any inter-city travel expenses? I've done some rough calculations myself that make me think I could make it work (food would have to be made at the hostel).

I've also heard some mumblings about how over expensive a rail pass is, but I've been thinking it might be worth it has a replacement for renting a car as it would let me stop at small towns on my way to my destination."

We're trying to figure out how to handle closed captions.

Some options:

1. Send it off. Pros: Not our problem. Cons: Since this is weekly show, waiting for a turnaround eats into the time we have to edit. It also might not be the cheapest.
2. Do it in house. Pros: Get the intern to do it, cheap. Can be worked on as the show is edited. Cons: It's another mess I have to deal with.
3. Do it live. Pros: Also not our problem. Cons: Might have to pay extra for this. Still need the captions for when we upload to the web.

With this job, i have bought a new car, got my own appartment, and a cute puppy. 

AND NOW I AM JUST REALIZING THAT I CANNOT FILL THE VOID IN MY HEART WITH POSSESSIONS OR ALCOHOL AND DRUGS, what i am missing is her.

She broke up with me after 2 years of dating in college my senior year. I have walked in on her with another guy and left her. She shadowed me, manipulated me, and forced me to not get over her by hanging out with my fraternity brothers all the time to the point where i couldnt even hang out with my friends or try to meet new girls without her showing up and ruining my mental state of the night. 
i eventually took her back, things were great until it happened again. One of her guy friends(she doesnt get along with girls well) tried to have sex with her at a christmas party. The next time i talked to her, i could tell something was wrong but she refused to tell me. I assumed something bad had happened. I found out about the incident from her friend months later. I immediately lost all the trust i had gained back from the previopus incident. 

She broke up with me because i could nt trust her and now i still cannot get over her 2 years later. she has now moved 8 hrs away to start a new life but still calls to catch up. I keep feeling lonelier and lonelier everytime i hear about her new boyfriends and new life on the edge and feel like i screwed myself.

Am i crazy for having trust issues? Should i not be mad that she kept it a secret for so long? Why cant i get over her after she screwed with my head for so long and still is?
Why do i feel like i screwed myself out of having a fun and adventureful life by being responsible and siccessfull?

I am going to rot away in a cube for the rest of my miserable life."

Theseus and the Minotaur of Creton Conglomerate

The year was 2077, a new technology boom had changed the face of the world. It was unrecognizable from the version a century ago. Creton Conglomerate was the most powerful corporation in the world. Their military, industrial and biotechnology contracts and production was only rivalled by the CEO, Minos’ ego and cruelty. Nations all over held little power anymore compared to the AAA corporations that held entire cities, arcologies and sovereign lands within others’ territories. Compared to Creton Conglomerate, Athenia Hypercorp was a mere shadow. Though they were still immensely wealthy and influential, their products were not as popular as Creton’s and they did not hold the same level of control in the world.

Chief Executive Officer Minos was becoming drunk with power, the excess of years at the top had begun to warp his mind. He built a massive floating labyrinth off the shore of his headquarters on the Isle of Crete. The labyrinth was meant to be a show of supremacy and was a place to house his most fearsome creation. Deep within Creton Conglomerate’s biotechnology labs, the scientists spat in the face of the gods. They grafted together one of their most fearsome bioengineered, vat grown men with a fearsome stud of a bull. As if this wasn’t enough, they transferred Experiment B-015M, codename “Minotaur” to their cybernetic division and enhanced the manbeast with machines. A transmitting camera in the eye, hypersensitive olfactory sensors, muscle strengthening nanobots, the whole works of the Creton Conglomerate Cybernetic division. 

With such power comes bloodlust, and Minos demanded tribute from lesser corporations. He called for employee transfers, he bought the contracts of junior employees and interns for a pittance. These employees were not destined for a work exchange program, but rather fed to the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. This was a mockery of the other corporations including Athenia Hypercorp. After years of this, the heir apparent of Athenia Hypercorp had enough of this mockery.

“Why must we send our interns to the death every year?” Theseus asked his father. 

Aegeus sighed and looked out the window in his tower office. The rocky beach was hundreds of feet down, he could see boats and planes on their way to and from the compound. 

“We cannot afford an outright corporate war with Creton, it’s either this small tribute, or we will be choked out with trade agreements, and their BlackOps will begin dropping our scientists like flies. Then we will get bought out at rock bottom prices.”

“That’s going to happen to us anyway if we keep prostrating ourselves in front of Minos’ insanity! Can’t you see this is only the beginning?” Theseus retorted.

“We’ve been over this Theseus…” Aegeus began.

“Let me try, send me with the next batch, I will alter my face and they will not know it is me. You know I can kill that beast hidden away in the labyrinth.” Theseus implored.

Aegeus knew could not dissuade him from his task like years before. Though he had sent his own BlackOps in as interns to slay Experiment B-015M, there was a part of him that believed in Theseus’ might. Theseus’ will was growing stronger every day, so Aegeus agreed to send him. At least he could prepare him with the best Athenia Hypercorp had to offer.

Theseus’ was like the other top executives, he was a human, enhanced. His muscles were loaded with nanobots to provide extra power, his dexterity was off the charts compared to an average person. Aegeus had him fitted with a transponder, and added some new software to his personal neural computer. 

While he loaded Theseus with the other tributes, Aegeus told him to change the active camouflageof the speedcraft from black to white, so that he would know that Theseus’ was about to return safely. Otherwise, Aegeus was expecting a trap in the speedcraft.

 After the Athenia speedcraft arrived at the dock outside of the labyrinth, Minos himself came down with his entourage to inspect the tributes. He mocked them in typical fashion, calling them puny and weak wretches. He laughed to himself at their imagined fate.

“Since I am feeling rather kind today, I will allow one of you to volunteer to enter the labyrinth first,” Minos bellowed.

Theseus stepped forward to accept the challenge, while Minos’ chuckled. “Your brave steps will come to an end soon enough weakling,” Minos said.

Minos’ daughter Ariadne had fallen in love with Theseus’, enamored by his boldness and courage. After hearing her cruel father disrespecting the object of her affections, she decided to take it upon herself to help him in whatever way she could. 

She knew that Theseus’ automapper would be blocked by the radiation fields in her father’s labyrinth. Were he to kill the Minotaur, he would never make it out alive before dying of thirst. As her father was walking back to his private yacht and the guards were returning to their post, Ariadne lingered. She approached and pressed a small metal object into his hands.

“Take this,” she whispered, “put this mapper the auxiliary port on your neural assistant. You will not make it out alive without this help.”

Theseus took the gift. He smiled, though he said nothing, and walked towards the entrance. 
The labyrinth was cold steel and stone, he could smell the blood and pain of many years wafting through the hallways. They twisted and turned, without his new automapper, he would have already been lost. His neural computer was projecting a map of the labyrinth over his sight, and he always knew which path to take to return. However, the task was not completed yet.

Theseus turned the corner and was face to chest with the enormous Minotaur. Before he even had time to react to the cybernetic man beast, he was flying through the air. The manbeast bellowed steam and rushed over and began to strike Theseus in the body, while attempting to gore his skull with his horns. Theseus’ reactions and dexterity kept his head in one piece, but his body was being bruised over and over again. Ribs chipping and cracking, organs screaming in pain, he had to act quickly.

With a shift of the hips, he scrambled onto the Minotaur’s back, a position where his smaller stature could accomplish some damage. His adrenaline implant kicked in, sending chemicals coursing through his veins. He grasped the Experiment B-015M by the horns and twisted. With this torque and leverage, he began to pop cervical vertebrae of the beast. After one final twist, beast fell with its head facing backwards. The Minotaur’s cybernetic implants were all over the ground. Theseus wheezed, and realized that his map was gone. The implant had fallen out. 

As he groped around the ground, he only found chunks of the Minotaur’s implants. But after a while, he found the implant Ariadne had given him. A quick plug and he was on his way. 

When he found his path out of the labyrinth, Ariadne was there waiting for him.

“Take me with you! Please,” she begged him. “I cannot stay here, my father will have me killed or worse.”

Theseus’ agreed to take her, and set off in his speedcraft. Ariadne was thrilled to be with him. “This will be so wonderful when we are married. We will make a great team you and I, Theseus”, she said.
Theseus’ did not take this well, he was not attracted to Ariadne. When they stopped for fuel, he left Ariadne at the port, and sped away. 

The gods were not pleased with his betrayal of someone who risked everything to help him, so they cursed his rattled brain. He forgot to change the colour of his speedcraft on the way back to Athenia Hypercorp. 

When Aegeus saw his son’s craft approach, still black, he was distraught. “My son has failed, I have failed, this is the end of me,” he cried out. He pulled a pistol from his desk, shot the windows in his office and leapt to his death below. 

Theseus was left with a rattled skull, and had to oversee his father’s funeral ceremony, as well as take the reins of Athenia Hypercorp. With an enraged enemy in Minos, his future holds strife.

Introduction/Background
Plutarch wrote “The Parallel Lives” as a collection of local myths and stories. He recorded many stories from the province of Boeotia and Delphi from his time as a priest of Apollo. The myth of Theseus and the minotaur comes from the section dealing with Theseus’ life. His work includes the lives of other Greek and Roman legendary characters. Other lives included in Plutarch’s work are Romulus, Cicero, Brutus, Cimon and Pyrrhus. 

With regards to Theseus, Plutarch first makes a comparison to Romulus. As they “both were of uncertain and obscure parentage” and were told to have a “descent from the gods”. (Parallel Lives Vol 1, 2,1) Both men were strong warriors and played a significant role in one of “the world’s two most illustrious cities” each. (Parallel Lives Vol 1, 2,1) The main conflict in this myth arises when young men and women sent as tribute to Crete were “destroyed by the Minotaur at the Labyrinth” (Parallel Live Vol 1, 15, 2) or died wandering in the maze. Theseus volunteers himself to enter the Labyrinth.

For the creative work that follows, the classic tale of Theseus and the Minotaur was changed from its original setting in history to the near future. Rather than being an optimistic future, this new setting is a Cyberpunk setting. This refers to a dystopian future with the integration of man and machine, as well as multinational corporations achieving great power. Wealthy humans are enhanced genetically and cybernetically, while others live in squalor. This genre also deals a lot with what it means to be human, something that is brought up with the creation of the Minotaur, a man-beast. The cities of Athens and Crete became large corporations instead, with the laws of supremacy being simply what they can get away with in their own borders. This style of world matches well with ancient times; rather than there being a single over-arching government or large bodies of government, the city states were independent and constantly in strife. This fits well with the new world model of powerful corporations in cold war.

Other aspects of the story were updated technology-wise. The ball of string became a microchip tracker. The boat’s sails were changed to another method of colour changing instead. The core of the story remains the same.

I don't think I am going to be able to reach that target for most of that stuff.   Instead I am aiming to have the Python backend store &amp; serve the map/dungeon


#3d Rendering performance tuning

Right now, the WebGL/ThreeJS engine is consuming 1 gigabyte of video ram...which is insane.  The very rough &amp; not entirely accurate explanation of how 3d works.  On start, a 3D engine shovels vector shapes, shaders, and render cues to the video card.  The video card take over almost all of the work of rendering at this point, leaving the CPU to handle game logic &amp; sound ( which can also be delegated to the DSP/codec processor ).   

All 3D graphics are built from triangles, so a square surface is made up of 4 triangles stuck together, each triangle has 3 floating point vertices ( X,Y,Z ).  For a 10x10 grid maze, that's 100 squares * 12 triangle  * 3 = 3600 vertices.  Each vertice is ~32 bits or ~15 kilobytes.  Even factoring in the shaders ( what converts the vertices into the 3D shapes you see as well as computing lighting ), it's a major question as to where all of that ram is going.  Unfortunately ThreeJS sits on top of Web GL, which is fairly high up in abstractions, so its tough to figure out what exactly is sitting on the video card."

Usually when I am asked about this, I talk about how they have a lot of knowledge of the process and operating procedures and how I have been able to leverage that knowledge to help me solve problems in my previous internships.

What are some strategies you use? What are employers wanting to hear when they ask about this in interviews?"
2p4341,17,2014-12-12,Where to start,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2p4341/where_to_start/,"I'm sorry to burden you all with my whining. I've been depressed and anxious for many years. There have been some moments of clarity but it would come crashing back down. Maybe I'm bipolar?

Years ago my doctor thought it was ADD and anxiety. It makes sense, I guess.

I can't focus on anything for the life of me. I'm disorganized in both mind and workspace. I get irritated and distracted from conversations when I hear music or other noises. During conversations my mind splits into two: The chaotic daydreaming mind and the other mind trying to keep composure. I always fail at the second part. Acquaintances must think I'm a little weird, possibly stupid. And I certainly feel stupid. My thoughts are unclear, I'm always in a fog. 

I've tried to express this to a friend who I thought it was close, but she shrugged it off, I'd imagine that she didn't want to confirm it to my face. I felt all that I told her was whiny and petty, and I was a burden to her. I have a hard time expressing myself, not being an eloquent speaker. I'm visual and emotional, having to try to interpret the abstract visuals and emotions into words. It can be very frustrating sometimes. There have been times where I feel like shit social situations and it sets off an anxiety attack. I'm pathetic.

I feel like the failure of my family, and they see me as having so much potential. I can't bring myself to feign confidence in an interview. They can see right through that I'm an insecure doormat, the way I stutter taking about my experiences and make myself small in my seat. I'm handicapped. Then there are the people who think I have it easy and can get any job because they think I'm attractive. I don't think that at all. I hate the way I look. Ever since I was little I couldn't look at myself in the mirror, leading to a slightly disheveled look as an adult. Maybe I'm autistic?

I'm getting too old to be like this. I should have a steady career, but all I can manage are minimum wage part time jobs and free or semi paid internships. And at all of these jobs the managers learn they can abuse me, make me work long hours full time for free. And I'll take it because I'm a worthless piece of shit. I can't imagine retirement. Maybe I'll be out in the streets or in a psych ward. Or dead. During bouts of unemployment I couldn't manage to get out of bed or take care of myself. Sometimes I thought I deserved the punishment for being a waste of a person. 

Whatever I am, I am a mess. No one can hate me as much as I hate myself. 

I'm sorry for this long text. Please delete or downvote if you feel it's necessary. "
2p4aby,2,2014-12-12,My life..,[deleted],lonely,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/2p4aby/my_life/,"So.. Reason I'm posting here is because I need to vent, like most people. ..

It starts at elementary school.. switching schools and losing friends simply because you are not allowed to go over the hill by yourself(I lived in town1, while school was in town2. Both towns were extremely close, about 5 minutes of walking. However I was young and my mother did not want me to go there because it was dangerous). 

You'd think one can make new friends at a new school.. Well, I thought so too.. But instead I got bullied by the entire class. And if that wasn't enough, my mother had to raise 4 boys on her own and was unable to help it. So we went to temporary foster families. Which would take care of us while my mother could get some rest(I don't blame her at all, she is an amazing woman.). Believe it or not, I made a friend there. However, when the few weeks were over I moved back home and had no way to stay in contact.

Moving on from elementary school I went to highschool(whoop die doo!). I thought things would change. I thought people would look at me and see me as the happy, joking guy. They didn't.. Why? Because someone knew someone from my elementary school which told him stories that were false. Again, I was unable to make friends and people started making fun of me more and more. To the end I did not want to go to school anymore. I started eating away at my sadness, thus starting to get a little chubby. Also spending all my free time behind my computer, gaming. Because there was nothing else for me to do.

 Third year comes around. We choose our section, I chose for going into food(cooking, baking, serving etc. I don't know the word of this combined in English). New people arrived at school and some quiet, nice people were in my class who accepted me for who I am. I had friends! However it didn't take long for the rest of the school to catch up to me and push me back into the deep black well. I ended up locking myself up at the section where I got my lessons (I never went to the general area to eat etc.). 

Finally graduating from high-school I went into a completely different route. I went to do IT. And believe it or not, I enjoyed it. People no matter their ethnicity or preferences, they accepted me as a classmate and friend. However I got pushed back into the well so many times, despite them throwing a rope to get me out, I refused and stayed safe. I did not want to get hurt anymore and the only way to not get hurt was to stick to myself, trust no one, talk to no one. Still eating away at my miserable life, still gaming all day..  Talking to them only when they talked to me or I needed them for something.

Getting past the first year, getting my diploma and going further in IT(We have niveau's. 1 being the lowest, 4 the highest. Most educations start at niveau 2. Which is what I finished in 1 year, going on to niveau 3). I actually started to join a little group of friends. Not following them, not leading them either. My opinion was accepted and while slowly climbing out of the well, I was still afraid. I was slightly accepted at school, but outside of school everyone living in my vicinity were elementary classmates. So basically, I still did not do anything outside from school, eating and gaming.

I turn 18, I'm getting money(a fund for 18+ people who still go to school). I started moving out of my vicinity. Doing stuff at the other side of the country, feeling free of everyone who just wants to bully me. Turning 18, as much pros as it has, it has a lot of cons too. My mother cannot work, so she has a special fund for people who are unable to work. Me becoming 18 means she gets less money. I have to refund that money to her. However I don't always have that money(having to pay 150 euro a month for school, another 150 for healthcare, nothing is really left...). Me and my mother started fighting more and more. To the point where it affected my school. I could not complete my internships because of these problems at home. They almost caused me to lose my education and having to pay back over 5k to the goverment. The education takes 3 years, however due to not being able to finish my internship, I took 4 years with schools help(I am extremely gratefull for them understanding me and giving me the chance). 

In january(halfway the 2nd school year) I started working and I met this girl. I fell in love instantly. At the end of the year, it appeared she liked me too. But me being 19 and never having any contact with girls, I had no idea what the hell I had to do. We went outside together, walking circles. I had no idea what to talk about. After about 7 months of back n forth, she just said to me, do you or do you not want a relationship with me. I just said yes, because I really did want to. However, in the 2 months we had a relationship, I only saw her once(I got fired at work because I was too expensive). That one time I saw her is actually the first time I kissed her. Hell, it's the first time I kissed any girl. The reason we never saw eachother is because her grandma had cancer and she was extremely close to her, so basically always being with her. Up to this day, I still want to be with her and think about her all the time.

Right now, I am 21 years old, have 4 friends(who I barely see), had 1 girlfriend, and still eat and game away my sadness. I keep getting reminded that I'm alone in this world. And I keep thinking it will never change. I mean, getting older, people stopped bullying because maturity. But the past has affected me so much that I still don't trust anyone, not even myself. My friend keeps telling me that things will be alright.. But he's happy and happy people say that. Who'd date someone that doesn't have any experience? They'll laugh at me. I'm afraid I'll just become a 40 year old virging jacking off in his small appartment which he pays with goverment money. I'm afraid things won't change, no matter how hard I try. I'm afraid I'll be alone forever. I don't know what to do with my life. I'm too scared to start talking to random people to make friends because I don't want to get rejected.

Well, that was a long wall of text. This really is the first time anyone has been informed of my ""life story"". Thank you for reading through all this atleast I guess.

After doing some research I'm convinced that Bitcoin's value will rise, but I'm not sure if I should buy right now or wait a little bit longer. I work as a freelancer in web and print design, but I also fix computers and networks of small companies. I have completed an internship at Siemens and I'm positive I might be able to get a well-paid job there one day, but for now I earn 10€ an hour so I'm scared of losing a heck load of money, but I'm even more afraid of missing that chance once and for all. So what do you think should I invest in Bitcoin now or wait for the price to drop further?"

2p5ctl,14,2014-12-12,I wish that I didn't have depression and had some confidence.,messedup2014,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2p5ctl/i_wish_that_i_didnt_have_depression_and_had_some/,"I have been dealing with depression since I was 11. Never really had any friends. Moved schools constantly. Never had any stability. Eventually I didn't even try to make friends, because I knew I'd just lose them anyway, or would drive them away from me because of how I am. 

I was able to live in a really cool place earlier this year, but the whole time I was there I just pretty much stayed inside. I tried to go out and was almost mugged/attacked because I accidentally walked by what I think was a drug deal or something. One of the guys started coming after me but I ran away. After that I still went out, but it was just to places I knew how to get to. I tried going to new places but the directions Google gave me were wrong, so I got lost and then I didn't want to try again. 

I'm trying not to think about graduating college. It was always my goal to graduate before I turned 30, but I always thought it would be sooner than this. I feel like a lot of family/family friends think I'm stupid or slow, but they don't know about how my depression has impacted my classes. I've had to retake several due to getting depressed &amp; not going. I feel so lame.

My parents constantly tell me I'm going to fail &amp; put me down, which doesn't help. ""You won't be able to get a job in (city you want to live in), you'll have to go to smaller cities first and then work your way out there! You won't fit in in (city I lived in earlier this year) because you're (my ethnicity/gender/sexuality) and that city is full of (racist term)! You won't get the internship you applied for, because the interviewer is just going to hire someone who's like them!"" (I got the internship).

I don't know what I want to do with my life, for a career. I feel like no one will want me romantically because of my skin problems &amp; where they are on my body (they aren't contagious, my skin just looks red). I have a doctor's appointment next week and I don't know how to advocate for myself. I don't want to leave the doctor's office until I have a solid diagnosis for what's wrong with my skin on a certain place. I saw a dermatologist but was afraid to ask them to look at it. I need help with how to ask them to figure out exactly what is wrong down there, because it's been like this for two months and no one ever gave me medicine to fix it, and I'm frustrated about it.

How did you all deal with depression and stuff after graduating?"

2p6pz2,3,2014-12-13,Semi-fobby questions from a student,simonthestudent,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/2p6pz2/semifobby_questions_from_a_student/,"Hi /r/China,

I'll be studying abroad in Chengdu after the spring festival starting in March. Afterwards I'll be doing my internship at a firm in Shanghai. In total I'll be in China for a year.

Thanks to your extensive wiki I've been able to find the answers to most of my questions, however some things, finance and banking, are still hard to figure out:


**1.** Is renting a 4 bedroom appartment in the center of Chengdu possible, and if so is it affordable? I've been doing a lot searching on Chinese housing websites, but it's very hard for me to figure out how any bedrooms a place actually has, and if it's written down in the description there aren't any actual pictures of the bedrooms which makes me wary.

**2.** Banking. Since I'll be staying for a year I'm wondering if it's worthwhile for me, as a dutchperson to open up a Chinese bank account. Could you tell me about the fee's associated with the bigger banks such as ABC ICBC etc?

With my Dutch bank it costs 0.1% of the amount that I'm transferring to send money to China, so if I send a 1000 euro's it would cost me 1 euro to transfer the money.

If I withdraw cash in China it would cost me 2.25 euro + 1.2% of the amount, so If I withdraw 1000 euro's it would cost me about 14 euro's per withdrawal.

**1.1** So opening up a bank account is a given, but with which bank?

**1.2** Any advice on to avoid being skimmed? I'm reffering to the guy who lost all his savings. He cut his losses apparently, but I'm not able to cut any losses financially.


**Any advice and input you can offer would be greatly apreciated!**

*Also, if you're living in Chengdu and you want some foreign products (like deoderant or something) let me know and I can bring some over.*


**TL;DR:**

How much does a 4 bedroom apartment cost in the center of Chengdu?

With which bank should I open an account if I'm only going to be withdrawing money thru the ATM?

EDIT:

Any tips on banks in China that let you withdraw large sums of dollars/euro's? Somewhere in the range of 500 euro's?

2p6u8u,20,2014-12-13,how bipolar changes after trauma? *trigger warning*,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/2p6u8u/how_bipolar_changes_after_trauma_trigger_warning/,"Using my old throwaway because only my immediate family knows of my diagnosis.

I apologize in advance for the wall of text - 

I am 22 and I was diagnosed about 1.5 years ago. During high school I was extremely anxious and beginning to show symptoms of depression. Towards the end of college I realized I needed help. I had cycled several times from being so depressed I would take my car out every night and drive over 100mph on the highway, hoping I would get the courage to smash myself into the guard rails, to spending money I didn't have, drinking excessively every single day, and sleeping with guys I didn't know.



At this point I went to a family doctor who prescribed me SSRIs, but they just seemed to make things worse. I had no inkling I could be bipolar so when I had follow up appointments and said they weren't helping she kept increasing my dose (found out later this could be what was making my symptoms worse). I had an internship across the country and during this time my drinking and now I know it as hypomania were getting out of control and I was scared. I went to see a psychiatrist when I came back and he gave me my formal diagnosis and prescribed me a small dose of cymbalta and also trileptal.



Flash forward a few months, I was visiting another university and staying with my friends. After a night out we came back, and to make a long and horrible story short, I was raped and ten minutes later I went into the bathroom and found my friend after he had shot himself in the head and committed suicide. 


Initially afterwards I did cry a lot for a few days but then I just felt empty. An emptiness I had never experienced in my life. I was completely devoid of any emotion. Slowly over the past year I have started to feel things again but not to the extent I used to. I feel as if my personality is muted right now. 

I moved to a new city to start a job I should love and I adopted a dog - she is pretty much the only social interaction that makes me happy. I feel as if it is impossible for me to socialize any more. I have no desire to make friends. I am content being alone. A few months ago I stopped taking my meds because I don't know who I am - if that makes any sense at all. I felt like my meds might have been dulling everything, but I wanted to feel emotions so I could deal with this. I still feel empty. 

I don't know why I am even posting this. Probably because I really don't talk to anyone any more and I can't keep this to myself any longer. I know I should go to therapy and get a new psychiatrist but I don't care enough to do it right now. 

I know that many people without bipolar who go through trauma have a similar experience, but has anyone with bipolar had this drastic symptom change after trauma? When did you start feeling like yourself again? Did it change your symptoms long-term? I miss being able to feel deep emotions, no matter how intense or unwanted they were at the time.

2p6w0o,4,2014-12-13,"I am M/26 with F/25. Our eternal, long distance relationship is stuck in the mud.",JoeDombus,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2p6w0o/i_am_m26_with_f25_our_eternal_long_distance/,"**TL;DR: I have a long-distance girlfriend named “Lois” who lives about three hours away and I really like her. We have a perfect face-to-face relationship. However, our long-distance relationship is dead in the water. She keeps changing when she's going to move in with me. I need some help and perspective.**

Trying to get my relationship with Lois to evolve feels exactly like some sort of pyramid, bullshit-job scheme, where the requirements for success are always changing:

""Ohh you're missing this exam! Oh you'll get it next time! Oh you're not certified for this! You have to buy this knife set first! We cant pay you just yet! You were supposed to be over here but you werent! Awwww no! We’ll pay you as soon as you get your certification!"" 

Let me break this down month by month because I need to get it all out. This is two years' worth of runaround so I'll just start from the beginning.

MAY 2013: In her senior year in 2013, Lois graduated from college and said she was going to do some internships over the summer. We make a plan to do a long distance relationship for the summer, and then we would go meet up, get jobs, and move in somewhere else and pick our relationship back up. Two months into the summer, Lois realized that she was just sort of wasting time with these internships and that she'd rather be back in this area with me.

JULY 2013: Lois moves back home to her town three hours from me. She starts stressing about bills and ""Job searching."" I use quotes, because she looked for jobs, got nothing, but then, the VERY DAY after she goes to a temp agency, she immediately gets her current mind-numbing data-entry office job. The one she complains about pretty regularly and ""the one she can't wait to escape.""
 She tells me she's going to be working there for at least the next 9 months so she can get a reference and so she can pay her bills.

Um, so where do I fit into your plan? Okay… I understand you, and I support your decision to pay your school loans. We can move in later, I guess. 

Meanwhile, I get my first apartment... And that was ultimately a failed venture. **At this time, Lois is making it very clear that she's ready and willing to move anywhere with me, even if it's just a little hole in the wall. So long as we're together, we're fine.**

**So for literally the next year, we maintain this limbo relationship. She comes up one weekend each month (since she is living with her family and it’s cheaper for her to come here than me, there), and we have great times during each of those one weekends each month, but our relationship isn’t going anywhere.**

Lois is not exactly the best long distance girlfriend. We don’t text a lot, we don’t email a lot, we have phone calls a few times a week. I feel like I really put an effort into this long-distance relationship and I don’t believe she puts in the same effort. It has been a problem really since this long distance nonsense began ~2 years ago. But like I said, we're absolutely perfect face to face and that makes it worth it. Let me continue.

~~~~~~~~

It's now MAY 2014: It has been10 months from the start of our “one-summer-long,” long distance relationship and I’m starting to get tired of this limbo. Lois is sort of preparing to move in with me but she’s stressing out about telling her family about how she is going to move in with me. Meanwhile, I have left my first failed apartment for a nice cottage to rent and I'm busy transitioning my things out of my parents’ home. I'm stressed out about moving, Lois is telling me how she’s about to start burning bridges with her family but it’s okay because we’re getting married soon and we’ll start having children shortly. 
Wait, what? 

I’m overwhelmed by all of this crashing down all at once and so we break up for a month. Wasn’t the worst break up in the world, but the time away did provide needed perspective. I really love Lois and I would rather have her in my life than not.

-- Also, I have to note. Burning bridges is a big deal in Lois’ family. She has a brother who got caught up with the wrong people and made shitty mistakes. Lois’ family basically kicked him out of the house, they never speak of him, and I was worried that they’d do the same thing to her. Since they don't talk about him, I dunno what went down, and I was scared that she'd essentially be homeless or without a family.

JUNE 2014: It has been a month since the break, we get to talking, and then we basically start over again. She agreed to come visit her other friends here in town at the end of June during the local summer festival and we could meet up. It was awkward for the first hour, but then we picked up right where we left off and start formally dating again after the weekend successfully played out. 

We talk about the current small house I’m renting. She says I should get a roommate because 750$ a month is expensive. Yes it is. However, she will not move in with me because we just got back together and 'that'd look weird' and she doesn’t fully trust me again. Okay, that’s fair. No pressure. However, one of my best friends, Tim, wants to leave his current apartment, so Tim comes and picks up the slack and moves in in July 2014. 

JULY 2014: Lois starts talking about how she now can't possibly move in with me because there isn't enough room for three people in the cottage. Um, that's not true. There is enough room. Tim has his bedroom all to himself and I have mine. I have TWO dressers in my bedroom, one of which is completely empty, I have a monster closet, I have a roller-hangar-rack thing, I have a queen-sized bed in my bedroom and I have a huge furnished attic that is currently more or less unused. We have the space, okay? There's more limbo and Lois expresses more frustration over her mind-numbing job and that she really wants to escape and get a place with me. But nothing ever happens.

-- Another note. Today, my cousin John is currently staying with me and Tim because he’s looking for apartments and work out here in the city. As Tim, John and myself are currently proving, there's enough bathroom space, enough kitchen space, enough living space, enough sleeping space, enough...

You get the picture.

OCTOBER 2014: Over the autumn, Lois's big solution became ""if only we got engaged, we could make this work! I could move out of my parents' house and leave work and be with you! Moving in with my fiancé would be the perfect excuse!"" 

Well... I mean... I could marry you. Our breakup was hell and so I REALLY don’t want to leave you again. When we're face to face we have a great relationship and so I don't mind the prospect of being together forever... But I need time to save. I can't just go and buy a ring. I am making ends meet but I don't have enough money to save up from month to month.

DECEMBER 2014: NOW it's winter and gone is the ""I'll follow you anywhere!"" sentiment; gone is the ""that would be weird"" sentiment; gone is the ""There's no space!"" sentiment; gone is the ""We should be engaged! That'd be easiest!"" sentiment; it's all now replaced with this stubborn **""I'm not trading my stable life for instability"" sentiment.** Apparently it took her a long time to get her current job (the day after she applied via the temp agency, remember) and she’s not going to give it up by moving in with me. That's ridiculous. My roommate Tim got his job through a local agency and he's been there for years! You can't tell me you can't pick one up easy as pie--- You know what, forget it.

There's always an excuse. There's always SOMETHING! There's always some reason to mess around and waste time and wait and wait and wait and wait some more and wait and remember to wait to wait waiting when you wait during the wait as you wait for the wait to wait. It makes me so angry! It's like a pyramid scheme!

""Oh yeah we'll just take care of that tomorrow. Yeah you just have to get this certification and then you'll get some money. Oh yeah, we're gonna stop paying for your parking and your gas. Also, you have to buy this 1800$ laptop. Ah, and we're gonna cut this. And then you'll have to pay for that. Don't worry! Just give us a bit more money and time and we will get you the money you earned! Oh, and you need to drive out to this conference tomorrow. Oh and you need to take Mike out to a conference on Monday over on the other side of the state."" What? That wasn't what we agreed upon! 

""*Hoooo'pfaaaaaa* I am altering the deal. Pray I do not alter it any further. *Hoooo'pfaaaaaaa*""

That's exactly how I feel with Darth Lois. Every time I close in on her and we're ready to pick up a real live, in person relationship, she makes some sort of excuse. I had that one chance and blew it in June by breaking up. Well, then again, maybe not. Lois retconned after we got back together over the summer and she told me that she probably would have resented me if I had *‘gone through with forcing her out of her parents’ house back in May.’*

Wait, what? Where is THIS coming from?

I literally don't know what to say anymore. I'm at my wit's end. She is stringing me along at this point. Taunting me.

I am so fed up with this long distance. If not for June's breakup fun-time giving me very very serious pause, I would break up with her this instant for stringing me along like she does.

I just, I can't even put it into words. She sent her texts last night (“Not giving up my stability”) at like 1am and I just haven't responded. I don't know what to say. I can’t tell her how I'm feeling because that will restart The Eternal War of “please move out here so we can resume our normal, healthy relationship.” However, I can't just ignore it because this stuff makes me so effing mad. I'm so stressed out and furious that she keeps screwing me around and keeps changing her requirements, but then I don't want to start MORE fights and I really sincerely don’t want to break up.

I swear, I really want to drive up there bright and early on monday, my one day off until Christmas, chew her out face-to-face, and then just go back home. I'm so.... ;nkl h,kh76678;klkxclk jkadghjhkkjgh

Thank you for reading this huge wall of text and I’d appreciate any guidance and feedback. For what it's worth, even just typing it out is some help.

2p7mja,4,2014-12-13,27F4M - The Intern &amp; The Senator,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2p7mja/27f4m_the_intern_the_senator/,"[Monica Garcia](http://i.imgur.com/Kd1HaAj.jpg) was a recent graduate from William and Mary College, just three hours from her dream destination in Washington, D.C.

Although her ultimate ambition was one that she kept very private, Monica had been open about her love for politics since she memorized the entire Gettysburg Address in 3rd grade. Other girls wanted to be singers and movie stars, but for Monica, she wanted to be a cross between Hillary Clinton and Jackie O., maybe with a little Jennifer Lopez mixed in.

It didn't surprise anybody when she took an unpaid internship on Capitol Hill right after she graduated college. It wasn't going to be an easy move. Monica wasn't the typical rich kid with wealthy parents to fund them while they pursued their dreams in politics. Monica had been saving her money for this moment since she was 16 years old. Her full scholarship to William and Mary meant she didn't have to tap into her savings to get her degree. Now she would be using everything she had saved up to spend long, unpaid hours running coffee and grabbing meals for Hill employees that would barely acknowledge she was there, and one day might let her sit in on a policy meeting.

It was an easy choice when Monica decided on an internship with Senator Paul Thompson's office. She had been given offers by every Senator's office she had applied to, but it was Senator Thompson that had always been her number one choice. He was the up and coming lion of the Senate. Cocky, yet charming. Charismatic in a way that only a politician could be. He was a bit of a playboy, the only never-married Senator on The Hill, but the public trusted him and viewed him as a man of the people, even when he was seen getting a little too drunk at the Nationals game, or caught out by the paparazzi with two different Hollywood starlets in the same week. He was honest, he was respected, and most of all, he was someone that got things done. Monica liked to think that she saw a lot of him in herself.

As she prepared for her first day on the job, Monica had no idea that it was only a matter of time before all of her idealistic notions of DC politics would come crashing down. She was about to enter a world where female interns were seen more as future mistresses than anything else. They were used and abused, the ones not able to handle it were spit out from the mouths of the power elite into the D.C. gutter. The Hill would be nothing like Monica had ever imagined, but she was prepared to take all it could give her."
2p7p9o,13,2014-12-13,Why don't I fit in with my Fraternity?,theindiejesus,GreekLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreekLife/comments/2p7p9o/why_dont_i_fit_in_with_my_fraternity/,"Has anyone else not fit in with their Fraternity/Sorority Pledge class?  Most people might assume that it is because of different interests, but I feel like that is not necessarily the case. 

Information about me:
- I consider myself to be smart.  I have one of the better GPA's in my entire fraternity and I've worked for different Fortune 500 companies.
- I like to socialize (to an extent).  I love to go out and socialize and drink, but only after my work is done.  
- I'm into different things.  I like different sports (soccer, lacrosse, hockey) and going to concerts (edm, indie, rap, etc.)
- I am now a Senior.

Fraternity:
So my fraternity is known as the party one at my school.  There are around 9 fraternities here.  When I was a freshman, they had a WorkHard/PlayHard mentality which I felt mirrored my own.  However, a lot of those guys graduated and my fraternity became known more for partying then doing both. We have the lowest GPA (3.0).  

FRESHMAN: When I was a freshman, I pledged a fraternity with various allegations troubles.  Even though I knew that they had some issues outside, they were the ones who constantly invited me over.  Also, I was one of the twenty freshman on campus that they invited to their exclusive rush event at the end of the year before Winter Rush (we only do second semester rush here).  I felt like that was the best fit because they were the ones who wanted me over.

During pledgeship, I met all the obligations and was ranked 5th in my class, but no one hardly invited me out to do stuff.  I went to parties at the house, but was rarely invited to any pregames or anything.  I stuck with it because I thought it would change over time, but it never really did.  

SOPHOMORE: I noticed as soon as I moved in that I wasn't really invited to a lot of things with other guys in my pledge class.  I was bullied pretty hard by a couple of the older guys, but I learned to stand up for myself and it eventually stopped.  Taking exercise seriously helped me boost my confidence and I learned not to be intimidated by anyone. A lot of the older guys got into constant fights and weren't great role models.  Some were kicked out for grades or doing too many dumb things while hammered.  

I had a dramatic girlfriend who caused a lot of scenes at the fraternity parties.  Even though I never started those fights, I felt like I was being the one blamed instead of her.  

JUNIOR: My junior year things looked up a little bit.  I was hanging out with more guys, but then I went out of state for half a year to work for a company and get my internship credits.

SENIOR: When I look back, I don't really understand why I didn't fit in. I'm not the best at sports, talking to girls, or at drinking, but I'm definitely decent at all of them.  And I know I'm not weird, but I'm treated like I am.  
I've kind of moved on from the whole Greek life ordeal because of how I've been treated.  But i'm definitely upset when I look back at my college years and realize I was never invited out to a Spring Break or to any trips or anything.
I definitely tried to reach out to people, but you can only do that for so long until you realize you shouldn't have to be the one doing all the work.  

If any of you have any advice, feel free to let me know.  I never expected everyone to like me, but I didn't think it was too much to ask for a couple friends in my own fraternity."

I'm a junior in college, and I'm about to go into finals week for my worst semester yet. For the first time in my life, my GPA will drop below perfect marks. And I might fail a class.

I missed a midterm two weeks ago. Not for any good reason. Mainly because I forgot. I hadn't been to lecture in that class since October. I have over 2500 unread emails; at least 500 of them are from the last two weeks. I didn't check the course website. And even though that test had been scheduled since the start of the term, it slipped my mind, and I spent the day surfing the internet.

One of the other classes I'm taking this semester I really like. I have a decent chance of getting an A in it. I like the professors, and I managed to attend every lecture all the way until the beginning of November. I missed half of the points in the first assignment of that class, though. Again, not for any good reason, but because I left it until three hours before the deadline. Admittedly, I managed to get the work done faster than most other people could have, but you're not scored on speed or efficiency in the last three hours the assignment is due. You're scored on what you manage to get done in the two weeks you have. Luckily, I didn't make that mistake again, for that class anyway.

Similar things happened elsewhere. I was taking a couple really easy, 1-unit courses as part of a program I'm in. I skipped a few classes and missed a few assignments because I just didn't pay attention, and while they don't fail anyone, I'll probably be getting Bs in those classes which is just as much of a failure.

I took a design course (outside of my field). I think the teacher liked me at first, but then things went south. We had a project that we were given basically the whole month of October to do and I did it in the last weekend. He had scheduled me to be the second presenter, because he was confident in me, but I sent him an email at four that morning in which I was falling apart, and he moved me to the end of the presentation order. He ended up pushing back the entire curriculum because apparently the whole class did a pretty shit job, so there was that. But after that, I could tell he lost a lot of respect for me. He wasn't too keen on my group's final presentation, either. I think I liked him at  the beginning of the term. He was cool; late 30s or early 40s, a multimillionaire teaching for fun. Charming and super well-connected. Had cool hobbies and traveled a lot. But by the end of the term, I saw him as a superficial, pretentious piece of shit. 

I had a couple officer positions for campus groups I'm in. I let those go to shit. I didn't go to meetings and stopped reading my emails.

I'm a varsity athlete, and I was doing really well through the first part of the season. I got to compete in a really big competition in October, but in November I missed two weeks of practice, and now I feel like I'm totally out of it.

I was supposed to build a website for that program I'm in. I haven't started on that.

Yeah, there's been a lot of good things to happen this semester. I accepted an offer for my dream internship next summer. I have a girlfriend I'm truly in love with for the first time in my life. Competing in October was a high point. But lately, it's just been felt  so dark and shitty, even if the worst case for grades this semester is my GPA dropping to a 3.5. But shit, it doesn't feel like it.

2p7xj7,0,2014-12-13,I've reached a turning point,VolShrfDwightSchrute,bodybuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/2p7xj7/ive_reached_a_turning_point/,"How's it going guys? Anyways here's a little backstory about me. I'm pretty new to Reddit so if I'm messing this up yell at me do whatever haha. I'm 19 and I'm in college and I've got an internship as a Firefighter/EMT. I've worked out somewhat regularly the last couple years in high school playing sports and all that but the last couple months I've started to get pretty serious about it and I'm ready to really go hard and get big. I consider myself to have a pretty good knowledge of weightlifting but I always love to hear others advice. Due to my schedule (24 hours on, 48 hours off) I can workout for a couple hours daily so thats not a concern. Basically I want a full workout plan to really gain mass and then cut down to look cut. Right now my workout plan is a 3 day rotation. Day 1 is upper body so I'll do bench and then a bunch of other stuff. Day 2's lower body so I'll powerclean, deadlift, front-squat, and back-squat with other stuff as well. My third day is cardio. I don't really have a ""rest day"" but i pretty much consider that day is enough for my muscles to rest. I'm open to changing my diet to an extent. Still gotta feed the guys/eat the food a the fire station, can't be too picky.
My physique: 5' 8"" 165 Lbs
PR's: Bench: 185 lbs x 12 Squat: 225 lbs x 4 Powerclean: 155 lbs x 6 Deadlift: 245 lbs x 5 (but I've never really truly maxed)
I know everybody's different and there's no perfect plan but I'll appreciate anybody's help. Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks in advance."

Let them know you appreciate them even if they put the toilet paper on the roll wrong, and don't pick up their toast crumbs. 

Excuse me while I cry a moment. 

Crying isn't stoping, so I may as well type. I am so jealous of all of you. So jealous. I used to have a partner, his name was W. Least, I called him that. We were really happy for two and a half years, then I found out he was cheating on me and kicked him out. I went for about 6 months living life the way I did before I met him, just me and my 5 year old. I had a FWB that was really a friend first, Ive known him forever. 8 years or so coming up soon. Never would have guessed what happened next. One night is all it took. One night of beers and a hook up, two months later Im nauseous out of my mind and find out Im pregnant while he's out on the oil field. And I find out he wasn't exactly honest about having left his girlfriend. He has a 2 year old with her. And he isn't going to break up with her as far as I can tell. And even if he did, I don't want him in my life after a lie like that. 

So now I'm pregnant with a baby, a baby that belongs to a man who already has a family. This is NOT what I wanted. I wanted to get married, have a family, then another baby. I wanted to be finished school. I have to do my internship with a newborn next fall. My mother is sick with Lupus, I can't ask her for much support, but she tries anyways. My brother is finally finding his way in his education, I couldn't possibly ask him for help. I'm a single mom who gets no child support for my 5 year old, Im a full time student, I live alone in this city. And Im terrified. My friends are all more like acquaintances now, they are all too busy to talk to me, and I have felt utterly alone for the past few weeks. Particularly tonight.

2p8bvv,3,2014-12-13,Sermon - Making It Right: Apologies and Forgiveness,JamieOtto,Jediism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jediism/comments/2p8bvv/sermon_making_it_right_apologies_and_forgiveness/,"Before I begin I’d like to make a disclaimer: some of us this winter break may not be returning to the best family situation. Some of us may not be returning to family at all. Apologies and forgiveness are important, but it’s also okay if everything isn’t cookie-cutter neat. Relationships are complicated; some people are too toxic for your emotional, spiritual, and mental health and it’s okay if you feel like you can only interact with those people when it’s absolutely necessary. This sermon is not meant to cast judgment, shame, or guilt on you if some relationships in your life are not ideal.

Today, I want to share with you some things about making it right with others. What I say may hit you like a ton of bricks, and bring you to an emotional full-stop; it may be like water set out to boil, you won’t feel anything until later; or it may be as spectacular as flatulence, in which case I’ll get a chance to put my preaching into practice by apologizing for such a lousy sermon.

A couple of years ago I spent a summer living in the Austin community on the West side of Chicago. If you’re not familiar with the area, it’s a heavily gentrified African-American neighborhood that has been all but forgotten by wealthy white communities of Chicago. This is a neighborhood that, when I told my co-workers and supervisor about this incredible internship opportunity, they all tried to warn me to be careful in such a dangerous area. The issue of gentrification and the harmful myths about gentrified neighborhoods is important, but that’s not why I brought up this experience. My work that summer involved an after school-style program with K-12th graders in the neighborhood. The program is divided up into three basic groups: high school, junior high, and K-6th grade. I worked primarily with high schoolers by getting them prepared for college. One of my roommates and I helped the program staff prepare for college interviews, applying for scholarships, and showing them different colleges in the greater Chicagoland area. My roommate showed off her college, Wheaton; I showed off Shimer College; and one of the program staff showed off her alma mater, Aurora. Four days a week we would work with these kids in hopes of giving them the best chance we could for getting into college.

On the fifth day of the work week, I spent my time with kindergarten and first graders. Let me just say right off the bat that these little humans were most adorable people I’ve ever spent any time with. These kids could melt your heart in seconds flat and you’d be happy to let them do it too. In the morning we worked at stations so I got to meet all the other kids in the program, eventually learning all their names and growing ridiculously attached to each one of them. Each of these kids had their own personality, likes and dislikes, and things that would upset them. There was one thing, however that all these kids had in common. Every last one of these kids could be told to take break and they would go sit in a corner. When they were ready, not when I decided, but when they felt they were ready they would come back to the group and make a three-step apology. Now a three-step apology looked something like this: one of the kids would do something they knew they weren’t supposed to, I’d tell them to “stop and think” and that was our way of giving the children an opportunity to rethink their actions, and if they kept doing it I would tell them to take a break. Once they were ready they’d come to me and begin the three-step apology by saying something like, “Miss Jamie, I’m sorry for doing that thing that you told me not to do. What can I do to make it right?” Usually my response would be to the effect of, “please listen and make the right choice when I ask you to stop and think”. After that the child would ask me, “high-five, handshake, or hug?” I did whatever one I felt best reflected the situation and their personality.

Every last one of these kids knew how to do this. They did these three-step apologies with each other too, and many times they’d just do it with each other regardless of whether they were told to or not. The three-step apology was important and revolutionary for me to learn about because previously I thought of apologies as, “I’m sorry” and the other party would say, “I forgive you” or give me the single finger salute. I was humbled to see my kindergarteners do a three-step apology when one stepped on another’s shoelace and then the other would turn around and do a three-step apology for not being safe with their shoe laces. These kids were not angels, otherwise they’d have nothing to apologize for, but had been taught and they understood fundamentally what it meant to make an honest apology. Abstracted from the story I just told you, an apology is still three parts: acknowledging that you did something wrong, committing to doing better, and then doing an act in good faith towards that goal of doing better. How many arguments could this kind of apology end? How many damaged relationships; be they familial, romantic, platonic, or professional could be salvaged with this kind of apology?

I’d like for us all to take a moment of silence to reflect on this week thus far and how might an apology like the one these children used help to resolve a conflict we’re having with someone else.

Many of us have heard the first part of Alexander Pope’s famous quote, “To err is human”. We all make mistakes and I don’t know anyone who’s perfect, but I’m pretty sure Laverne Cox comes pretty close. What most of us are familiar with is only half of the quote though, the full quote is, “To err is human, to forgive, divine”. As Jedi we seek balance and harmony with all life, so perhaps Pope is right. If we can learn to approach apologies honestly and to forgive graciously, perhaps we can practice the divine with each other.

I have composed a meditative prayer for this service which I will offer now.

*Where there is wrong, forgiveness;*

*For it is in forgiving that we are forgiven*

*Let us be like branches*

*Bending, bowing, and shifting*

*Let us never break because of deeds unforgiven*

*May we apologize for our wrongdoing with sincerity*

*And may we find it in ourselves to forgive when an honest apology is offered*

*Let our hearts be nimble with humility and grace*

*To be kind to ourselves and to each other*

May the Force be with you all.

2p8sdc,9,2014-12-14,How do I make the actual pain from loneliness stop?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2p8sdc/how_do_i_make_the_actual_pain_from_loneliness_stop/,"I feel like a whiner, but I'm 22, male, and the crushing pain of loneliness is just is ruining my life.

I broke up with my girlfriend I've known since kindergarten last December, and since then I've just never recovered.

I broke up with her because I'm gay, and since then, I've never gotten past that either.

I have a few good friends, but since then they just seem to act more distant towards me. I don't know if its them treating me different, or that I don't have my girlfriend to distract me from any shortcomings of their friendship.

They just seem to be so much more interested in other people and pursuing other friendships, it just hurts. They still hang out with me, but it just feels like its sort of if they don't have something else to do. I always feel like they use me as a friend when they need something, but when I need someone they aren't there.

I don't know what to think. Because they are still friends, they still talk to me, they still hang out with me, its just, idk, they just feel like they aren't trying to be close to me or as good friends to me as each other or other people.

I just feel like its them, and then me. Its not us.

I don't have any romantic or sexual feelings for my ex girlfriend, and she's moved on. So whenever the loneliness just gets too much I just hang out with her. It takes the pain away, but at the same time I feel completely defeated. I wasn't strong enough to make it without her.

I work full time at an internship while my friends go to school. They see each other a lot, and when I'm free at night and on the weekends they are working of doing something else. I still see them sometimes though.

The friend I'm closest to the most told me that I need to stay busy, stop worrying about life, and in time it'll get better and go away.

My response is how the fuck is it going to get better if I'm at home all the fucking time in pain from being so lonely. I sit here and watch my friends go out and have a good time and do all these fun things and I can't take a part in them.

How the fuck am I supposed to find a boyfriend, I can't go out with anyone that is willing to go to a gay bar.

Its just so fucking painful and lonely. I just want someone to sit with me and fucking talk or hang out with me.

It just hurts SOOO much and its honestly making me resent everything in my life and it just makes me miserable and I don't even know what I'm living towards anymore."

I don't feel any regrets.",srrosa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2p8wm5/me_31_m_with_my_wife_26_f_after_five_years/,"Hello Reddit!. Very first post ever after lurking for years. 

I've been with my wife for 5 years, married for almost 3. We met at a EQ course and things sparked between us. After a few months we realised that if we wanted to live together, we'd have to engage because of her family, so I proposed and she accepted. At the moment we'd been several months in the relationship and it looked really good. She was smart and cared. We had a very good communication and I felt that i could spend my life with her. 

After some struggle with dates she definitely moved in 10 months after we started dating. Once I was living with her, I saw some things I didn't like. The first six months she didn't clean once, not even doing her laundry. I did it everything. She told me it was not her house and diminished me because I wasn't a good cleaner. She started to be jealous and obsessive, being mad at me every time I wanted to do something with friends and being jealous even of her own friends. 

In the meantime, the wedding was moving forward. I took care of everything and she just took care of the things she really wanted to. She acknowledges it and says that she was very stressed. Out relationship was great 90% of the time and a pure hell the rest of it. She was really abusive when everything didn't go the way she wanted. She insulted me, hit me, even spitted at me a couple of times.

I have a way to cope with things and is growing big against challenges and problems. I slowly got caught in the trap. She'd openly read my phone, my Facebook, my email. I had nothing to hide, though I didn't give it much thought. I remember one day where I woke up and we had a two hours argument about how selfish I was. I discovered that she'd read a Facebook conversation and she transformed it into I was looking for someone else.

We get married. Abusive discussions were kept to once or two a month, and I regretted sometimes have moved forward with her. She really hurt me, she knew what to say. I was professionally in a bad position, there were no work for me in the small city where we lived. She is studying and she just won't move somewhere bigger. I tried to bring up the topic several times, but the answer is: you can do whatever you want and face the consequences. 

One day, she tells me she's moving to SF for a three month unpaid internship. I tell her I won't move to SF for three months because of how expensive it is. I'm struggling to find clients and managed to save a few thousands. I'm not gonna spend them going myself also to such an expensive city. She says is ok, she would just move with a friend of hers. After 15 days, flatmates tell this friend that my wife cannot stay sleeping with her, so she moves with a guy who has a spare room left and is not gonna charge anything for it. 

A fortnight later, she tells me that this guy party every saturday and she misses me and that she's gonna be extended for another year. So I decide to move in. We find a double room, we both move in. I find a 150k job straight forward and things move, until... she tells me that she has not been granted the extension and she is moving back home. I decide to stay, I'm not going back there to make a fraction and struggling and seeing how my career is virtually nothing. 

That was a year and half ago. I'm now making 300k and I am an very respected professional with a promising career. I told her several times to move with me and work on her thesis here, I'll pay for flights and anything she needs. I just support her on everything she needs. From living expenses to expensive trips around the world. She's been on the thesis for three years and I see she won't finish it soon. She is having a very good time at home while I provide. Partying, dinners, sailing, etc. She came for two months on summer and told me that she was not flying anymore because it stressed her. So I'd have to go home to see her, adding that on top of the 60+ flights I already do in a year. And she won't even be happy when seeing me, having arguments around my selfishness.

So, the abusive arguments were there but we didn't live together anymore. She'd just throw at me everything without remorse: threats to divorce, she'd commit suicide, she'd hurt me, she'd tell lies to my family. Anything. When things get back to normal, she'd just say sorry because she was angry. That I had to understand her, that she was just having a bad time. And that I was a very selfish person who only thought about myself.

Month and a half ago, I met someone in a seminar. We had a really intense connection. We kept in touch over email (we live 1000 miles away from each other) and some Skype. She is centred and grounded. We discussed about a lot of stuff. She exposed me what she wanted in the most adult and assertive manner I've ever seen. Nothing happened beyond a hug. I see that I need to fix my marriage in one way or another. I feel embarrassed because having this connection with one person. I see that I've lost something on the way.

I come back home and I expose things to my wife, in the most adult way I can. That we don't have a space of confidence anymore, that I feel lost, that I want to build that with her again. She says is ok, we need that and after bringing me to the airport next day, she just opens and reads my email and social networks. Obviously, she reads everything. She tells me she's proud of me because I didn't cheat on her, etc. She suddenly appears and fly to see me, she wants to care. But I don't love her anymore. I tell her I want divorce and cut contact.

I'm now seeing the woman I met one month and a half ago. The logistics are not easy and she wants to take it really slow. She always made clear that what I've got with my wife is my problem to deal and that she just don't want to carry what happens on her back. That she cares and feel about me and she'd like to explore what may happen from an open ended way. She smart, strong, gorgeous, independent and grounded. Just the exactly opposite of my wife. I've never met someone I felt attracted to in so many ways. I believe that things may work between us. I'm giving her any space she wants. I'm giving myself space also. I don't want to rush into another relationship and I don't want to lose contact with her. I want to see what happens slowly. We both want that.

In one way, I ask myself if I've done things right. On the other hand, I don't feel any regrets for my marriage, not a single minute, which makes me feel guilty. And I'm also scared of what come may. 

Reddit, thanks for reading. What do you think?

2p9432,0,2014-12-14,[Serious]Why is that teenagers/young adults feel intense mistrust for adults?,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2p9432/seriouswhy_is_that_teenagersyoung_adults_feel/,"I noticed that some teenagers/young adults have a hard time getting along with adults. It's like teens have some kind of automatic mistrust/vendetta for adults just because they are adults. I summed up reasons why they might feel this way in the list

- Adults may have some kind of other objective for being nice/helpful (i.e. they want something from you)
- Adults may take advantage of teens
- Adults are sometimes forced to interact with teens (for example, when a professional comes to the university to talk about their work because they have to do it for work
- Distasteful experiences like unpaid internships with no benefits to students, multi-level marketing shenanigans, etc.
- Some adults want to talk about themselves/offer advice because it makes their ego feel good

At the same time, I feel that teens want to find adults whom they may trust and take guidance from. It seems that teens feel that a lot of adults aren't so different from younger people. Adults mess up, they have affairs with people they are not supposed to have romantic relationships with, they don't know what they are doing with their lives, they aren't as talented as they say they are.

My observations are from low income teenagers that I have interacted with. Perhaps younger adults don't trust older people because they never had a good role model to begin with. Thanks for question. I have been trying to figure this out for a long time. I would love to see your ideas Reddit.

2pa3kw,1,2014-12-14,New graduate with questions.,RussetWolf,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2pa3kw/new_graduate_with_questions/,"I'm 22, and will be finishing my degree in computer science in August. This Friday I will be finishing the last of five four-month internships, and I expect that I will receive a full-time offer from the company upon returning to school (this is pretty standard from them if you don't fuck up). The offer will be for their Toronto office (my choice of location), and the standard package there is $80k annually, $10k signing bonus for each of the first two years, and $45k stock (fully vested in four years), plus a relocation package (probably something like $1.5k per month housing stipend, plus covering moving costs) and some sort of medical plan. This company has a history (policy?) of not negotiating with returning interns. All figures are in CAD before tax. 

My partner will likely be starting graduate school in the GTA in September. The commute between the office and school is about half an hour (not counting traffic). We have one car (no loan) between the two of us and hope to keep it that way, so I'll probably be the chauffeur since my days will start later and end earlier.

My question is, what do we need to do to prepare for ""the real world""? Budgeting is a given, but what sorts of things should we take into consideration? Food, gas, car maintenance, insurance, rent, entertainment, tuition, and books are obvious, . 

We want to save for a wedding as well. Would it be more financially beneficial, though, to get the paperwork done and be legally married sooner (I'm thinking tax purposes and making it easier for me to help with tuition rather than my partner taking out loans, and for medical insurance purposes) and just have a ceremony/party once we save the money, or will it not be a big enough savings to bother?

Also, should I get life insurance? We don't have kids yet, but we plan to in not too long, and until my partner is done school I will be the only one with an income, after which, we will likely make similar amounts.  What kind of life insurance - term or whole life?

I have under $7k in student debt (yay Canada!) and my partner has none, though will likely incur a large amount in grad school if not supported financially ($20k/year, over 5 years). My partner is rather unwilling to take financial help from me without being married (for both of our financial well-being) and even then will want to repay my money. My logic is that me helping pay for school is better for our family in the long run even if I were to be payed back, since we would save more money on interest than the money I put away would earn in that time (there is a low chance that OSAP will help with loans that are interest-free while studying and some grants).

Anyway, suggestions and advice are all welcome, I'm more than willing to answer any questions you may have!"
2pahb1,2,2014-12-14,My boyfriend [29M] of about 10 months emotionally cheated on me [22F] and we've agreed to work things out. Need advice about how to overcome this.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2pahb1/my_boyfriend_29m_of_about_10_months_emotionally/,"I can only give my perspective on what has happened, but I would like advice about how to best overcome emotional infidelity and our respective issues. We are both in college. I’m an undergrad and he is a grad student. I apologize in advance for the length.

To begin, we've been together for around ten months. In the beginning of our relationship, things were great as the honeymoon phase generally is. In May, I went to another state for the summer for a three month internship. I was 600 miles away, but things were not that bad. Towards the middle of the summer, around late June to early July, things began to change. He pulled away from me and I began to doubt the relationship. I visited in mid-July and things seemed fine, at that point I only had a few more weeks left and I thought for sure I could make it (obviously I did). When I returned from my internship, things seemed to be getting back to “normal”, however, things we’re clearly not going to be the same as they were before I left. We still spent tons of time together and talked a lot, but we had far less sex than we did before I left. Where before we would have it 3-4 times a week and multiple times a day, now we were having it maybe once or twice a week and going long periods without any physical intimacy at all other than the occasional kiss hello/goodbye. 

Towards the end of August, I learned of his OkCupid account and confronted him with this knowledge. It was also around this time that I told him I loved him. He responded by telling me he wasn't prepared to say those words etc. Which was fair. At that time, I learned that he had been accessing it, but I did not know to what extent. When I confronted him, he let me delete the account. Before I did, I viewed the outgoing messages and this is when I first learned he had been sending messages to other women without my knowledge. I questioned him about it, and he maintained that he didn't remember the messages. It was at that point that I decided I would attempt to let it go. However, I did not let it go. I wanted to know the truth and the extent of the betrayal, I guess. So I tried the password that he gave me for his OkCupid account on his reddit account and they were the same. 

*I am aware that this was wrong and an invasion of his privacy. However, had he not committed the initial act of betrayal, I would not have done any of this at all. I am not here for anyone to tell me how wrong I was to snoop. I know and accept that.*

I proceeded to login to his reddit account and find that he had been messaging various women from R4R intermittently with no returned responses. The posts he responded to were always ones looking for “life partners” or long term relationships, and never in our state. We began having serious relationship conversations around late October. These conversations included things like what we want, where we want the relationship to go, and where we see it going in the future. In the beginning of these conversations, I told him I didn't think I really loved him that I thought it might have been infatuation because of the amount of time we spent together. He admitted that he felt bad because it had been so long since I had said it, and he still didn't feel it. Additionally, he questioned whether I was being truthful about my supposed infatuation. It was during these conversations that I mentioned the OkCupid account still bothered me, and insinuated that it wouldn't be an impossibility to believe that he had sent messages from other accounts such as reddit. I did this as a way to give him an out and tell me the truth, he did not and I did not admit to what I knew.

At one point during our serious conversations, I admitted that I had lied and I did really love him, I simply told him I didn't to make myself feel better. Approximately two weeks ago, while avoiding writing I paper, I decided to check in on the reddit account. It was then that I found the day before, he had messaged a woman about her snaps how amazing they were and how she would be great to date. I searched her posts and found that she posts her snapchat username to reddit and then posts nude photos to her snapchat story. Of all the messages, this hurt the most. I immediately went to his house, told him I wanted to break up, and everything I knew at that point. He attempted to turn things around on me about snooping, but in the end did admit that he did those things simply because I presented evidence.

This is largely the point when he admitted to having problems with committing **to me**. He has said that I give him every reason to love him, but he can’t and he doesn't know what’s wrong with him for that. He also said he has taken a good look at himself and he doesn't like what he sees. We have both agreed that we want to work things out, but to this point there have been a lot more words than actions. Breaking up was brought up again in the days following the reveal, but I felt guilty because he said I was the only person he hangs out with - and talks to regularly. I have suggested going to counseling, however, I know that if he isn't going to benefit from it and is just going to go to appease me then it is not worth it. I am in counseling for an unrelated event, but I have been getting advice on the matter as thus far it is just more talking. 

I want to know what both of us have to do to overcome my issues of trusting him, I want him to be able to trust me, and his issues of commitment. I know it has been kind of dysfunctional, but he has said that he really wants to overcome this he just doesn't know where to start. I want to be able to work things out and give it a shot rather than just abandoning ship.

---
**TL;DR**: My boyfriend of 10 months emotionally cheated on me after I snooped and found additional evidence, admits to having problems with commitment, but we want to work things out. How do we get the trust back? How do we overcome commitment issues?"
2pandp,16,2014-12-14,Eve Autopsy Simulator - Coming in 2015,QuincyT,Eve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2pandp/eve_autopsy_simulator_coming_in_2015/,"CCP has announced a new partnership with Bossa Studio, creators of Surgeon Simulator.  Through this partnership, a new mini-game will be added to Eve Online.  The new mini-game called Eve Autopsy will allow capsuleers to perform autopsies on dead capsuleer corpses for various parts and components.  These parts will be used to make new implants through the manufacturing system, much like ships are salvaged to make rigs.  Brains and bodies can now be salvaged of parts to make new implants and other future items. If there are implants in the corpse, it will now be possible to remove those implants if the player is skilled enough in the mini-game “Eve Autopsy”.  The players will be able to recover the implants to reuse them or as parts for building new implants.

CCP Fozzie commented, “We’ve been tracking implants on corpses since Crucible expansion and we’ve been storing what implants were in that corpse since then.  So the more twisted, err entrepreneurial Eve players will already have a ready stockpile of materials to work with right away, rather than having to wait for the market to build up a stock of dead bodies.  We’re also looking forward to finally using a lot of code we wrote for the Incarna expansion that’s never been usable to players.  Behind the door in the Captain’s Quarters will now be a morgue for the player stockpile of corpses, along with an autopsy table.  The game will then move into the coroner mode, where players can start dissecting the corpses into body salvage to make implants. This fits in well with our overall strategy of having players, not NPC’s, produce more of the Eve content.”

CCP is also looking to link the new game into Dust 514.  CCP T0RFIFRANS, the lead manager for the Eve Autopsy project said, “Since Test Alliance Please Ignore imploded last year, there’s been a definite downward trend in the number of corpses available due to fleet combat.  To compensate for this, we’re going to be adding a new module and mechanic to allow capsuleers to tractor beam up dead bodies off of a Dust 514 battlefield.  Much like the orbital bombardment mechanic, capsuleers can move into a district and then tractor beam up corpses into the ship’s cargo bay.   There can be a lot of dead dust bunnies on a typical battlefield, so your cargo bay could quickly fill up with corpses.”

CCP T0RFIFRANS continued, “We’ve also considered the ability to tractor up and dissect a Dust 514 combatant who is not yet dead.  Since the Dust bunnie is still alive, the dissection process will take substantially longer to dissect the bunny into constituent pieces.  The process will also make gurgling sounds and maybe even a screams or two while doing it’s magic on a not-dead-yet Dust bunny.  To prevent obvious griefing of Dust bunnies, the tractor module will only be able to target currently alive bunnies who have spoken in local in the last 30 minutes.  This will also have the positive side effect of reducing the typical local smack talk from the Dusties.  Dust bunny salvaging will completing the circle of interaction we’ve been promising for years between Eve and Dust 514.  It will make Dust 514 much more relevant to Eve capsuleers as a source of body parts for capsuleer implants.”

The new modules to be introduced to Eve by CCP Rise will include the high-slot module for tractoring the bodies from the ground into the spacecraft and a mid-slot module for the field dissection.  


Also coming is the highly anticipated deployable mobile morgue that CCP SoniClover is producing.  If anchored within 5km of a mobile tractor unit, the mobile tractor unit will then move bodies from the the tractor unit into the mobile morgue which will do the dissection automatically into body parts.  This will be a substantial help in clearing body parts from very large fleet battles.

CCP SoniClover the lead mobile deployable developer said, “We’re also going to deploy new BPC’s that can be found in wormhole space complex sites.  These BPC’s will allow allow players to build dead-space meta armor plates out of the salvaged capsuleer underwear, the most durable material known in all of Eve.  The amount of capsuleer underwear needed will increase as the size of the plate increases.  Melted nanoribbons will also be used as, uh, a bonding agent for the underwear to make the armor plates.  It may make capsuleer underwear a new conflict driver for Eve capsuleers.”

When CCP SoniClover was asked why players couldn’t just purchase capsuleer underwear prior to being worn by capsuleers, he replied, “Well, that would take away whole purpose of the dissection process and obviously not be a conflict driver.  Although, Selene did suggest a separate panty raid mini-game to increase the interaction in station.  We have been play-testing that now.”

New skills will be be also be introduced to be used in the new autopsy mini-game, the new Dust tractor beam module and dissection mid-slot module.

Medical Student - Rank 4 Int/Mem - prereq Science IV

Intern - Rank 6 Int/Mem - prereq Medical Student V

Surgeon - Rank 9 Int/Mem - prereq Intern V
	The Surgeon skill is a required for a skill based attempt to recover implants intact along with the mini-game.

Dissection Skill - Rank 5 Int/Mem - Medical Student IV - required to anchor the module dissection unit or use the dissection module.  Dissection will only result in body parts, and no in-tact implants.
  
CCP is planning to release the autopsy addition in the first half of 2015.

2patxt,4,2014-12-14,What are the consequences of this...,Jmanziel2,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/2patxt/what_are_the_consequences_of_this/,"I applied and was accepted to an internship at a technology company. I did a really good job in the interview and it was clear that I was a great fit for that position. 

A few weeks later I received an offer from the company and it says that I need to have a certain minimum GPA. I don't have that. It seems more like a formality to them and not that big of a deal but it is what it is. My friend who had the same position last year said he just had to make a scan of his unofficial transcript and email it in to prove that he had the minimum GPA. I'm under the impression that they'll just skim through it to make sure the numbers are there.

This internship means everything to me. It's with a company I can see myself working for after college and it is the very first opportunity I've had to work in a position like this. Even if I don't end up getting a job there afterwards, the experience I get will set me up for other companies. I just switched into this major so it is a little unusual that I got the job, so it's huge. It can really open doors for me as a move forward. I don't know if I will ever get another opportunity like this.

My question is what are the possible consequences if I forge my transcript? Change two grades this semester to make it seem like I have the minimum required GPA? I couldn't have done much more this semester in terms of effort... I'll be getting the highest GPA I've had throughout college but it's not enough. 

Please give me some advice.

-edit-

I keep thinking about it and I keep thinking it's a really stupid idea. If I tell them that I don't reach the requirement though I'm pretty sure they'll just kick me to the curb. I hate that it came to this and I kinda hate myself for thinking about forging it. The other side of me says that if I don't make moves for this internship, something like this won't come up again and I'll find myself going crazy finding another internship for the next summer/taking summer school classes, which I don't really want to do. I'm seriously torn here."
2pawvc,1355,2014-12-14,I found out too late.,_Wilted_Flower,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2pawvc/i_found_out_too_late/,"I am a 58 year-old woman and I've recently come to the conclusion that the church isn't true.  But for me, it's too late for it to matter much, and that just makes the pain so much worse.

Let me tell you my story.  I was shy growing up, with average looks, and a little on the chubby side.  I was not highly sought after as a dinner companion, or anything else for that matter.  I am not seeking pity in telling you this; I'm simply telling you how it was.  I suppose I was (and am) the proverbial ""sweet spirit"" you hear people joke about.

I went through high school and most of  BYU without any significant romantic relationships.  I had plenty of love interests, but the feelings were never mutual, and the few dates that I had rarely went beyond a first date, never beyond a second.

During my Senior year I did an internship out of state.  It was there that I met Thad, who worked in the office where I was interning.  Thad introduced himself on my first day, and I guess there was some instant chemistry between us, though I wouldn't admit that to myself until later.  

Before that I had often felt that there had been chemistry between myself and numerous men, but until Thad those feelings had always been one-sided.  After so many of those experiences,  I just deadened myself emotionally and tried to ignore any romantic inclinations, telling myself I was imagining things.

But with Thad, it was different.  At first he just acted as if he wanted to help me feel comfortable in a new city where I didn't know anyone.  He took me out and showed me around town, introduced me to people he knew, took me to his favorite restaurants, and so on.  But after the fifth or six time out, it was hard to use ""showing you around"" as an excuse.  It was obvious that there was something real between us. 

Our outings continued, and for the longest time we never outright acknowledged that we were in a relationship.  We just started standing a little closer to one another, arms rubbing against each other.  Occasionally he'd put his hand on the small of my back and give a little rub.   Finally one night he held my hand.  Neither of us said anything, it just happened.

Then one weekend, while we were at the park, we were holding hands and he pulled me to him and we hugged, and then he kissed me.  It was my first kiss.   And for the first time in my life I felt loved, romantically speaking.  It wasn't just the kiss.  It was everything that led up to it, just the simple kindnesses he showed me, and the simple loving physical contact that said ""I care about you and I want to be with you.""  I was overwhelmed by the possibility that this man, whom I had grown to love, might actually love me back.

The remaining months of the internship were blissful.  Our relationship deepened emotionally and physically.  I ""made out"" for the first time.  He knew that I was mormon and he respected the boundaries I set, but within those boundaries we enjoyed each other tremendously.  

We spoke about what our future might hold, and talked about possible marriage.   I purposefully avoided the subject of marriage because in the back of my mind I still had a hard time believing that he might actually propose.  But he brought it up, shyly at first in a theoretical way, testing the waters.  Once he saw that I was interested, we spoke about it often.

I was doing well as an intern, and the company offered me a position once I graduated.   I had one semester to complete in Provo, and we decided that once I graduated I would move back there, take the position at the company, and we would get married.  He did not formally propose- he wanted to save up and buy a nice ring.  But we were serious enough to start talking about what month we wanted to hold the wedding.

The internship ended, and I moved back to Provo.  I told my roommates about Thad and, as gossip does, word made it to my Bishop that I was dating a gentile, and that I was thinking of moving out of the motherland to be with him.  

The bishop called me in and lectured me about living life from an eternal perspective.  What he said echoed everything I'd been taught growing up in the church.  Hold out for a temple-worthy RM, at all costs.  Relationships are meaningless if they're not eternal.  It is worth sacrificing romance in this life for a worthy companion in the next.  Etc etc etc.

I tormented for weeks.  Thad and I continued our frequent phone calls, but he could tell something was bothering me.  I wouldn't tell him what.

I prayed and fasted and fasted and fasted.  And in the end, I thought I received an answer.  Not surprisingly, the answer was consistent with the church's indoctrination- that I should make the sacrifice, end the relationship, and wait for a worthy priesthood holder, whether it be in this life or the next.

I turned down the job offer and told Thad I wasn't coming back.   I asked him not to contact me.  And I went on with my life, hoping for that worthy priesthood holder to take  me and rescue me from the loneliness and pain.  The years flittered by, and I withered away and became an old maid.  And the only joy I have in life is thinking back to the way I felt for those few sweet months with Thad.  I cherish those memories, and once in a while when I think about it, I catch a glimmer of what it felt like to be loved.

And now, I see that I threw it all away for nothing.  Some people like me never get a chance at love.  I had my chance, and threw it away in favor of an imaginary future where I would be adopted into some polygamist man's household out of pity, because I had sacrificed and held the line against ""settling.""  And it hurts so much to think what could have been.

2pbv0d,2,2014-12-14,I am wondering if I have a NMom,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2pbv0d/i_am_wondering_if_i_have_a_nmom/,"So this is going to be a bit of a longer post, and for that I apologize.

So I am one of the middle children in my family (4 kids, 1 single, and a set of Triplets) I am the oldest Triplet, and the second son in the family.  All through my life (in college now) i have been on the bottom of the totem pole, often getting news about family events by overhearing my parents or from my (younger) sisters.  In school i did okay, not great, but i did not fail, my lowest grades were 2 Cs and my graduating HS GPA was a 3.56 unweighted.  I was ridiculed for my GPA because ""it is not high enough for you to get into a good college"" and ""I graduated HS with a 3.9, so why couldn't you"". The real kicker is that one of my sisters (not the GC) just barely outscored me graduating with a 3.62 or so, and she did not get the same amount of BS that i had to deal with.  Over that summer both me and the sister that got a 3.6 HS gpa (henceforth called S1, while the GC is S2 (also the youngest)) attended a community college because we were both granted delayed acceptances from our parents college that we were really being pushed to attend.  During that semester, the college that I wanted to go to (and the college that I am currently at) emailed me saying you payed your tuition deposit (that I paid for using money that my Dads side Grandparents had sent me) are you coming to our school? To which i was told to reply while I would like to it is too expensive (3 of us going to college at the same time)(also email was practically written by my mother, although i physically typed it). The school then responded with an extra scholarship and was like if you respond by monday at 4 pm we can save your seat and have a room with all the other Honors Program students (i am in the HP).  that email came in on either Sat or Sun, after that email was a lot of me begging to be allowed to go down and do college at the university that  **I** wanted to go to.  They acquiesced and were like but this is costing us a ton of money so dont screw up.

That first semester went okay by everyone elses standards (4 A's, a B, and a C in 16 credit hours) but it was not good enough ""for us to being paying all that money."" The next semester was worse (2 A's, 3 B's and a D in 17 credit hours, but i was forced to repeat a 4 hr math class to remove the C from the semester before).  My parents were understandably not happy with the D, but seemed to be more mad about getting a B in the repeated math class.  Once again my mom was complaining about all the money that *she* has spent on my education (she is unemployed, if you were to ask her she says that ""she is on a sabbatical to raise her children"").  During the summer I worked as a Summer Camp Counselor, which she was somewhat pleased with but always said that it is not as good as an internship.  That next fall semester, I screwed up and stopped going to classes and nearly failed out (I got late withdrawals from classes with her help) so my GPA for that Fall was a 2.0 (1 B and 1 D).  The next semester, I was told either I take classes at a community college so that they (read she) can keep an eye on me or go get a job and GTFO of ""my house"" (NM terminology) and don't ask them for help.  So i just took classes at the Community College and did pretty well (6 classes, 5 B's and 1 A) but of course that was not good enough because ""i was going to a lower tier college where it is really easy to get straight As"".  Also as a part of being at home, i was forced to go see a psychiatrist (and essentially forced to be put on an antidepressant, even though I am over 18).

That summer I once again worked at the same summer Camp (and received more responsibilities and was looked at to be essentially management) and once again it was thrown in my face that I should have an internship not be working at ""a dead end Summer Camp job"". Also during that summer I did not want to be on the antidepressant because i was forced to ask for it, so i did not take it.  About 6 weeks into working my parents made a visit to the camp and criticized me for my weight (see the paragraph somewhere below for more on my weight).  I lost my temper because of all the criticism and stormed off, while I was away my mother went on a walk and ""ran into"" one of the camp rangers who got my moms version of the story.  So when i calmed down I was like I cant have this conversation right now, and i will not be calm enough later, so please leave, ill call you ""later"" to talk about this.  so they left and i had to deal with the fall out of her talking to the ranger (who luckily believed me more than my mom as i was on good terms with him).  after that semester I somehow convinced her to let me continue at my chosen university.  This semester went relatively well (16 Credit Hrs, 5Bs 1C) and she is very disappointed in that. 

My weight has always been an issue, but really came up during college.  I started college at ~190 lbs and that first summer semester gained ~7.  I then went away (about 8hrs from Home) for the university that I wanted to go to and put on ~25 lbs (came home at about ~222) and my mom complained about that and restricted my diet and made me workout so that i would lose some weight before we went on a family vacation (boating in the BVI).  I lost about 10 lbs, and then went back to school and gained ~ 25 lbs again went home and lost ~10.  This pattern has repeated for every semester except the one that I stayed at home.  

Meanwhile though all this the GC has been perfect even though she has screwed up College more than I have, but every time I bring that up the response is always ""it costs us less to send her to school""  (which it costs them an  extra ~3k a semester (~6k a year) to send me to my chosen school).  Also S2 then got to go to her chosen school (about ~1.5 k a semester over GC) and she has done okay but even if i match her grades i am the one who gets all the flak.  and it all just drives me nuts.

I was wondering if you all think that i am being raised by a narcissistic mother and what (if any) actions i can take.  I wish i could go NC, but i do not have enough money or support to put me through myself."
2pc2vn,2,2014-12-15,Barely in school. Barely in life. I wonder what the future holds.,hopelessinmiami,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2pc2vn/barely_in_school_barely_in_life_i_wonder_what_the/,"Thinking back the story of my life has pretty much always been ""barely"". In high school I was in an academically prestigious program and I did just barely enough to pass it. In college it was the same thing although it became zero once I went through depression. My first semester I pretty much failed all my classes due to not taking it seriously, I wasn't ready for the freedom and responsibility. 

The following semester/next year is when the actual depression started. All my close friends in high school went away to a school elsewhere. I didn't even apply cause the girl I was ""in love with"" went there and I thought separation would help me move on, I regret that so much. Not cause of the girl but the passing of the opportunity to leave my hometown and be with my friends. One day a kid that hated me, who went to the school with my friends, told me that none of my friends actually liked me and were glad I wasnt around anymore. I didn't know if it was true but just hearing that was enough to hurt deeply. I guess them not keeping in touch over the years since maybe proved he was right but its not like i made the effort either. Around this time I also started heavily smoking weed and eating. I gained so much fucking weight my skin is stretched out and wrecked. I gained like 40 pounds in 2 months and another 30 in the years after. Being depressed made me fat and being fat made me depressed. I didn't want to leave my room cause I was ashamed of the way I looked. Also managed to go through an existential crisis of not just what to do in college but in life. Then to top it all off my childhood dog was brutally killed by another dog. He was my best friend. All in the span of like 4 months.  That whole year sucked, I can't remember anything good that happened and to top it off I flunked out of college. 

The next year wasn't much better but it never got as bad as it did before. Looking back on it now I am angry with myself for the way I treated friends who still stuck around, they had some fault in it too but in the state I was in its not like my life and the way I acted made theirs any better. Things could have been fixed if I was still around but staying in my room was mostly what I did that year besides going to the odd community college class here or there just to appease my parents. Nothing exciting or terrible happened that year. Still haven't decided if a meh is better than a cry. 

Now as this year comes to an end I look back and realize that I have made some progress. But I am reminded of my two years of stalling when I look around and see friends who I graduated high school with graduating college and starting their lives when I haven't even gotten my associates degree, in something I dont care to study that much as it is anyways. My depression seems to have mostly gone away, I am no longer sad but I still spend most of my time at home. I have a group of friends that I see a couple times a month but now I am used to the solitude and don't mind it. I've even started losing weight and I feel like now that i've hit my rhythm and im in a better mental place that I will actually achieve it this time. I hate that it took me this long, you can't reverse years of damage in a month but im gonna make it. However being a lazy bum mooching of my parents is the new shame in my life. I dont go out much so i dont spend much money but I can tell me not having a job or even having something that gets me out of my room is trying on them. I dont want to live with my parents forever but given that my gpa is shit i dont try for internships and given that i have no job experience i dont try for jobs. Its my fault once again and this game i play in my head does nothing but waste time. By waiting to get my life started i've wasted years. 

Going into the new year I have the goals of finishing up my Associates Degree and transferring to a university away from my hometown, to get a fresh start. Im hoping that I will figure this life thing out along the way. I was told that you dont always have to know where you are going in life, you just have to keep moving forward and progressing a bit everyday. Handling a day isnt a daunting task. Handling a single morning, a single afternoon, and a single night isn't a daunting task. I just need to not stay stagnant anymore, a little bit every day will turn sizable in a week. Big in a month and massive in a year. This is what I will be going into the new year as. I just hope I don't hit any hurdles along the way. "
2pc6lg,4,2014-12-15,[Advice Needed] Should I take the dilution route or use some else's urine for tomorrow's drug test?,Rocketmn333,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2pc6lg/advice_needed_should_i_take_the_dilution_route_or/,"Welp, I was informed on Friday that I would be having a drug test to return to my factory job that I worked at over the summer for winter break. It's a new policy apparently, and even though I'm a returning employee, I still have to take it. I had done some detoxing here and there for extended periods of time within the last two months or so, due to preparation for internship drug testing, yet I was granted with delightful news a few weeks ago, that I wouldn't have to worry until March. Leaving me plenty of time to quit(which I have no problem doing), and allowing myself to detox naturally. So I began to smoke a lot, like usual. 

So I've been drinking water like crazy now and have obviously quit smoking. I bought this ""Jazz Total Detox"" drink from the local smoke shop, and have also bought b-12 vitamins and a complete multivitamin to take as well to help with the color and gravity tests. I'm hoping the combination of the drink, vitamins, and dilution should be enough to get me through this. But as anyone can guess, I'm nervous as shit. 

I do have access to clean urine, but I don't know how the test will be administered, nor do I trust myself to keep it at the right temperature either, even with a hand warmer attached to it and stuck in my boxers.

I have a feeling that most people will comment on here saying take the friends urine. But does anyone know what will happen if the urine is not at the right temp? Will I just fail and that will be that, or will I have to take it again? I know my buddy is clean, and doesn't take any medicine for anything, but I still feel like I should take the dilution route, regardless of the increased chance of failing.

Can anyone give me their opinion here from their experiences. Talking to my boss on the phone, he made it appear that I would go to the business, do some paperwork, go get the test done, and that we should have the results within an hour, and that I could start working by second shift.

Tldr: I have a drug test tomorrow and have been preparing myself through dilution(vitamins and drinks), I have access to clean piss, but am nervous of the consequences if I fuck up keeping it at the right temperature. Need some advice."
2pc8f9,3,2014-12-15,"Considering growing my hair out, but I'm concerned that I will come off as unprofessional during upcoming interviews during my awkward phase.",IAmRequest,FierceFlow,https://www.reddit.com/r/FierceFlow/comments/2pc8f9/considering_growing_my_hair_out_but_im_concerned/,"After lurking in this sub for a while, I've decided that I want to grow my hair out again, however I have a series of potential internships that I will be interviewing for in the upcoming 2.5 years. The first one would start somewhere between 2-3 months from now, and I'm hesitant to begin growing my hair, since I'll be in the awkward phase by then. I don't know what the attire for these positions would be, but it would be safe to assume that they would be formal or formal-casual. 

&amp;nbsp;

It might be worth mentioning...

* These internship positions are in the fields of computer science, so I may or may not be dealing with clients.
* Facial hair is not an option for me right now. 
* My hair is blonde, straight, and short at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

So, my questions are:

1. Should I start this ""project"" now? By the time that I finish my internship period, about 2.5 years from now, I will most likely have a solid length of hair that I can at least tie up for future interviews and such. Alternatively, should I wait until after my internships? After these internships, I will most likely be applying for actual jobs in my field, so looking unprofessional is not an option, at least until I secure a position.

2. Assuming I start growing my hair out, how would I maintain a professional look without tying it up or hiding under a hat? What are my options for after the interviewing process, when I'm in a professional workplace environment? I understand from the [wiki post about the awkward phase](http://www.reddit.com/r/FierceFlow/comments/2hkcy4/rfierceflow_awkward_stage_inspiration_album/) that my options right now are hair gel and combing it away from the face, which seems to be my only option as of right now.

2pc949,12,2014-12-15,I'm getting really god damn fed up with my parents,PugnacityD,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2pc949/im_getting_really_god_damn_fed_up_with_my_parents/,"This is gonna be long, so I apologize in advance, so if you bother to read through the whole thing, then thank you. 

I'm 19 and a freshman in college. They're in California, and I'm all the way across the country. My parents have always been extremely controlling. From when I went to sleep at night, to what I wore, to who my friends were, and what activities I did, they always tried to keep tabs on and mold to be exactly like them. In other words, uneventful, academic, and focused on milking every opportunity so I can ""get ahead."" At this point I think they see me as more of an investment than a human being who needs his own life. They even policed my politics, with threats of pulling me out of school for supporting LGBT rights (is it just me or are most Ns conservative?). On election night 2012 my mom starting hitting me as hard as she could because she *suspected* I supported Obama (I didn't), and even though it didn't hurt at all it still pissed me off. I'm the opposite of them: a socialist, sort of Hippie-ish, laid back, focused on having a good time, and uninterested in the ""straight and narrow."" At home I just grew more miserable with each day as my parents interrogated me when I got home.

Finally I went to college. I could have my own life now, without them peering over my shoulder or acting as a shadow looming in the distance, making me anxious and thus shaping my actions. Instead of living their lives, I could live my own. I shouldn't have set my hopes so high. They're still trying to live through me, and to get me to be exactly like them. My mom texts me constantly, as in four or five times at least, reminding me to do shit that I've usually already done or have marked down to do. They demand that I give them the passwords to my school email, and academic portal. I also had to sign the FERPA release form so they could view all my transcripts. Because of that they know of the on campus events, and are constantly pressuring me to get involved with the things they approve of. My mom has my *facebook* password, and has since I made it. Do you know how utterly degraded and disrespected I feel because of that? Whenever I explain that to her she says she still needs it to keep my image intact. I'm a god damn adult, I don't need her to police my image. Seriously, who the hell has to give their mom their facebook password *ever*, let alone as a fucking 19 year old. 

What's worse, I can't stand up and fight them on these things, because every time I do they threaten to cut off paying my tuition. I'm so fucking powerless right now and it makes me feel like a mouse caught in a trap. Since they have my email password they saw a disciplinary conduct hearing email I got for breaking a door handle by accident. I was very capable of handling the situation on my own (and did so), but they blew up and now I have to ""re-earn their trust."" When I tried changing my facebook password they used this incident and the whole ""trust"" thing to justify coercing me financially into give my new password to them. 

They constantly probe into my love life and my social life. I dated a girl there for about a month before we realized it would not work (she's a wait till marriage type and I am definitely not). When I told them, my mom went off on a rant about how my ""leftist"" politics drove her away and that I just want all the ""sluts."" I use ""leftist"" in quotations because neither knows I'm a socialist, my mom just disapproves of the fact that I think that the state shouldn't intrude into people's social lives. Anyway, even now they still want me to make friends who do the ""classic"" college things like go to games and stay on the straight and narrow. Hence I do not tell them the truth, since their image of ""classic"" college is distorted to say the least, and that I have friends who are actually enjoyable and not on high horses. They think partying is the devil, so they're constantly telling me to avoid them so I can stay on the ""straight and narrow."" Spoiler: I love parties. 

Even though I've got a GPA over 3.5 while tons of people are flunking out and am a columnist on our school's newspaper they still think I'm ""wasting my life."" They still see me as a child, and treat me like it.

Well fuck you, mom and dad. Every single day I go to bed late and wake up at noon, go to all my classes, eat, work, apply for internships, do my laundry, and all the other functions that adults need to do. And I do this *without you*. I'm not your baby anymore, I can handle my shit, so fuck off.  I know you're going to keep this up, don't give me that bullshit of this all just being ""for my first semester."" You will find excuses to try and control me, you have broken those boundaries over, and over, and over again. Nothing will change now, except one thing. As of next semester I'll have an internship, and after that I'll be getting a full time job, most likely at night. It's going to suck a little bit during the week, but on the weekends I'll go out and have fun, the fun I want to have. I'll be saving every single penny I can, and by the end of junior year I'll have saved enough to pay my entire tuition on my own. Then you will have no justification to control me, you cannot demand my passwords, or control my behavior. After years of hell, I will fight back, and I'll win. If you don't stop now, then prepare to have your worst nightmare fulfilled: your son hating you and cutting you out of his life entirely. 

If you've made it this far, then you're one patient mother fucker. I needed to get this off my chest, as this anger has been building. My meditation was keeping it in check for awhile, but now that I'm home for winter break it slapped me in the face again. 

TL;DR: parents are still being controlling and manipulative even though I'm 19 and in college. "
2pc9sk,2,2014-12-15,I'm sick of being put down for trying to get help...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2pc9sk/im_sick_of_being_put_down_for_trying_to_get_help/,"So I might be suffering a medley of bipolar, depression, anxiety, and ADHD... but I don't know. And I won't know for at least a few months. The counseling and psychiatry facilities at my school are backed up and I can't get any real help in getting a diagnosis or any confirmation from them and it's starting to look really hopeless. 

First off, I emailed the counseling services a couple months ago about appointments and eventually motivated myself enough to go to the medical center to get help and was turned away and told I had to make a telephone appointment. 

So a few days letter I get a telephone evaluation from a heavily accented intern whom I could not understand and who could not understand me. I was furious and was only asked 2 or 3 questions before I was allowed to have an in-person appointment. Yipee! Then I had to wait a month for that appointment. Nothing else was available. I was failing classes because of the shit going through my head and body from whatever the hell I have and I kept getting pushed off to the side by the people who, I think?, should care about me??? 

Yay! 4 weeks later and the intake appointment is here! Woo! I get asked questions for an hour, then the ACTUAL meeting is scheduled after my counselor, who is a grad student, goes over my session with his superior to determine... stuff? 

2 weeks pass and I'm freaking out, go through anxiety attacks, recede from people and responsibilities, all while pretending everything is going perfect so my roommate doesn't freak out. But then I get another meeting! Yay I'm on the path to getting fixed! After 10 long and dark years, I am ready to get out of this mess! At the end of the session, after I tell my counselor about the memory problems, the motivation problems, the constant sadness, the fear of social interaction... he tells me to try and motivate myself? I left the office in a haze. Was this real? Did he really just tell me to try harder? Was I a joke?

I get a next meeting, another 2 weeks. Finals are coming up, stress is mounting and I break. In a fit of anger I lash out at people and I send a psychotic email to my counselor and when I go in for my meeting he seems concerned. Great. He finally takes me seriously. We talk about it. Rage issues, sadness issues, concentration problems... he says I'm a poster child for ADHD, too bad he can't do anything about it, sorry because no one has room for me to get tested. Seems like I'm bipolar but again, no one has space or time for me. Mixed in with these two are trust problems, depression, social anxiety but sorry, you have to wait. 

I can't wait any longer. Part of my problems is that I have a time disorientation issue. I can't grasp time as a concept. I go through the entire day doing one thing and it feels like no time has past while other times I can't sit still in my seat for a minute. Highly impatient, easily frustrated. This is hell for me. In my mind, 3 days seems like a month. And I have to wait a month at least to get any help at all. I'm going crazy. I'm pent up in my own mind and I can't control any of these mood swings, this lack of motivation is killing me. I

I need help but no one seems to want to. I feel so alone. I feel sick to my stomach whenever I am told, ""Just try in the meantime,"" or when I ask for advice on how to proceed with my treatment (if I get any) and the response is, ""Well I mean it's your decision."" I just want to be given an outline, be told what to do by a counselor who cares about me genuinely and whom I can trust. But that is too much to ask for?

I feel more hopeless than before. Maybe, just maybe I'll get meds one day? I've tried every self-help strategy there is, but with my forgetfulness, lack of concentration, and lack of motivation it is needless to say impossible. This is the exact reason I was scared to go to counseling for so long. I feared that I would be invalidated. And I do feel invalidated. I'm not sure I even have anything wrong with me anymore. Maybe I'm normal. I don't know. I don't know what that feels like? I don't know what to do and I'm lost in my own mind, alone, and that feels like a dangerous place to be. I just need someone to be near me and care and lead me in the right direction. I need training wheels. But no one is here for me, no one can be here for me. I'm comically alone in this sea of college kids and city people. My life feels like a joke. Seriously, what is the point in going on if it is?"
2pcdzb,8,2014-12-15,I [23F] have an extremely toxic relationship with my verbally abusive parents [54 and 57] and may not have the financial means to get away from them because they may sabotage my financial aid application. I feel helpless and caught in a catch-22.,blackdragonwingz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2pcdzb/i_23f_have_an_extremely_toxic_relationship_with/,"For some context, I'm a single child of an Asian-American family, and dated a black guy for a while. Because he wasn't a doctor, I decided to keep it a secret. It didn't work out and fast forward a few months, a situation arose where my internship money was being funneled into my parent's account. I didn't think it was too big a deal and pulled money from that account into mine, since both accounts are linked. However, my rent rose some questions and my parents absolutely demanded that I give them my password to see where the money is going. My parents found out about the ex because they went to look at my history for the whole year - and discovered that I was spending many weekends with the ex, and sleeping with him earlier in the year. I also went to the summer internship to escape from them, and stayed with my ex for a few days  at the end of summer to try to not stay at home - my relationship with my parents was tense prior to them finding out about the ex and 2 weeks with them would have been fairly unbearable.

After they found out about the ex and lying to them, they went insane and: 
- took my own credit card, changed my password to my bank account so I didn't have access
- gave me some money and I have to itemize everything, and whatever is unaccounted for is subtracted from the following month
- had me write down the phone numbers of everything I talked to in the past several months
- stalked me around campus or showed up at my apartment, and when they couldn't get in the gated community, followed people in or said things like ""we're dropping off food for our daughter""
- asked my roommate to spy on me and who I was talking to/seeing on a weekly basis
- call me on stranger's phones so I wouldn't recognize their number (I stopped answering at a point because I was so infuriated by everything)
- stalked all the social media surrounding me and my ex, and commented that he was a shitty person with shitty friends (he's not, he's a software developer, just like I am)

They also called me a whore and failure, etc. I've never been fond of my parents because they call me stuff like ""piece of shit"", or ""worthless unless I get a perfect score on the SATs"" through extremely scathing lectures for 4-6 hours at a time yelling and screaming at me that I don't know anything, am immature, stupid, etc. When I confronted them about the whore comment, my dad just said, ""Well what do you call a someone who flies a plane? A pilot. What do you call someone that spreads their legs like you? A whore."" My mom said she didn't understand why I was so angry and said, ""I have no idea what I'm apologizing for, but I'm sorry"", and then continue to compare me to the other more successful Asian children in our cutthroat community. Oh, and like the racist cunts they are, they said ""all black people have STDs, or majority of them at least"", and the gold? They both work at the Center for Disease Control. 

Normally I've been able to take it all in and forgetting some of the pain by sleeping it away, but after the incident above I pretty much couldn't function without having a breakdown. This time, anything remotely stressful triggered a breakdown - I heard my dad calling me a whore while I drink at the water fountain, while I'm coding, while I'm talking to my peers. To make matters worse, I fucked up my ankle and that was a 48 hour shit show while I was in complete pain and got lectured by my parents in the fucking hospital. I felt hopeless and constantly thought about suicide (I admit, I still do). 

I got counseling help but a huge part was that I wasn't living at home - it was bearable because I didn't have to see my parents, but I slept a lot to keep feeling catatonic. The blanket that I used to not give a shit carried over to my studies, and I failed a class so I have to retake it, extending my graduation to next semester. 

I take the blame for that - I should have put 300% effort. Unfortunately what's happened happened. I thought my parents would fill out finaid, transfer all my internship money over from their accounts to mine, and leave me the fuck alone because they wouldn't be paying for shit. But no, now they're unwilling to apply for financial aid (a package which would give me money for housing and tuition) and my dad asked several questions like, ""so if your aid didn't go through, what would you do?"" and forced me to answer ""live at home"". He then immediately said, ""write it down in pencil and paper like a real contract"". 

I am so, so unbelievably unhappy. I despise my parents, who don't know how to fucking communicate. Since all the verbal abuse started 15 years ago, I've built a shell to not care about them. If either died tomorrow I might be sad for a few days. There's definitely long-term confidence and self-esteem issues that I am starting to recognize and slowly tackle with the help of a weekly on-campus counselor. 

I can't talk to family friends because they're also all Asian and would take my parent's side (""oh they may say bad things but they mean the best, just eat it""). I can't bring any of my friends to mediate a conversation. I feel so hopeless and I know that if I live with them next semester, I will run a real risk of committing suicide - it's difficult to pull out of that mentality when my parents have taken a caustic tone for four hours, every few days. 

---
   
**tl;dr**: I'm caught in a catch-22; I want to tell my verbally abusive parents that if they force me to live at home I will never talk to them again after I graduate, but I said something similar earlier today and it totally backfired. My dad is possibly thinking about sabotaging my financial aid package (that will cover both tuition and rent) and my mom is refusing to transfer my internship money from their account to mine, leaving me completely helpless to live off campus. 

---

I don't know what to do, so I'm posting here. Do I need to grow the fuck up? How the fuck do I deal with my deep hatred and bitterness for both my parents and myself? What happens if I do have to end up living with them? "

I'll try to keep it organized with dates so that it's easier to follow along. To start things off, the main heroes on on our journey will be my now ex girlfriend  ""Rose"" (22F), her two rommates ""TwoFacedOne"" (20F) and ""TwoFacedTwo"" (20F), her ex lover ""Ronaldo"" (22M), her new lover ""GoodluckChuck"" (20M) and myself (21M).

If you make it through this novel, then you deserve good and hearty salute. You'll also think I'm an idiot, and I don't blame you!

**September 2012 - December 2012**

It was the beginning of my sophomore year of college and I meet this incredible girl called Rose. She was very bubbly, outgoing, and lovable. We hit it off right away and there were many fireworks to be had. The flirting was hilariously childish and I loved every minute of it. Always stealing each others stuffed animals, booping each other on the nose and such. I thought, wow.. I love her company so much I think I could spend my life with this girl.

On December 2nd, we went to a party at her friends' house together and got very, very drunk. Up until this point we had never done anything physical, just harmless flirting. Well she finally makes the first move and is completely all over me -- pinning me on the couch/walls making out with me. Finally we're getting somewhere, this is awesome! Eventually we make it back to her dorm room and it gets pretty steamy. If you know me, then you know if I've had alcohol then there is no way in hell I'm going to get it up and perform. And tonight was no exception. It was the absolute worst sex in the world.

The next morning is filled with regret on both ends. In the following couple days, I discover she has been having a steady sexual relationship with some stranger I've never met before, but she leads me to believe that it was a while ago and that it was over. I believe her and start taking her on some dates.

The semester soon ends and I help pack her packs to head home break and load them into the car of a guy named Ronaldo so that he can give her a ride back to her their hometown. Over break we continued to text each other, being a bit flirty and playing the ""hard to get"" game. Towards the end of break she lets it slip that she's going to spend a week or two in Colorado in a cabin with Ronaldo's family. Hmmm.. seems a bit fishy to me, but hey, they are best friends so it should be gravy.

**January 2012 - March 2013**

Break ends and I learn from one of her friends that she has feelings for me AND Ronaldo. Shiittt I think, this is her ex lover, and I packed her bags so she could go home with him. Damnit, I like her so much and I can't lose her to this guy. I have to soldier through this and win her over! The next couple months are full of ups and downs. I can tell she's battling her inner demons of who she wants to be with. He lives two hours away so it should be no problem. I've got this!

We finally have a chat about Ronaldo and she assures me that he's just her best friend and nothing more. That their chemistry is completely gone and I have nothing to worry about. I believe her.

I treat her super well during this time, taking her out on dates and such and abstaining from anything sexual so that I can prove to her that I want her for her personality and don't care about the sex. I asked her out on a date for Valentines day, but she says shes heading home on the 14th, so I end up taking her out on the 13th (strange, but I think nothing of it for now).

The dating continues on a bit more until after Spring Break in March, when we finally made things official and she becomes my girlfriend! I was super pumped. 

**April 2013**

From the get go, the relationship was rocky. I could sense the danger of Ronaldo from miles away but would go against my gut and try to soldier on through and make things work with this incredible girl. She would stay up to the wee hours of the morning talking to him. ""Of what?"" I would ask. ""Oh, everything. We're super open with each other"". Goddamnit I think, I can't shake this guy. He's got her wrapped around his finger.

In mid April, Rose and I had been at a friend's house drinking and she was on her phone all night as usual. I was already certain of who it was. We get back to my place and she promptly passes out. I can't sleep though. I just KNOW something isn't right. Her phone keeps vibrating as she sleeps and I'm sure it's Ronaldo. I can't help myself at this point so I take a quick look to see what's up with my heart pounding in my chest. Sure enough, they were sexting all night while I cuddled her on a couch. Him telling her what he's gonna do to her and her telling him what a tease he is... I'm sick at this point and fucking furious. I wake her up, walk her back to her dorm and tell her it's over.

I don't sleep for two days. After that, we have a talk and she breaks down telling my she wants me more than anything and will give up Ronaldo. I believe her, forgive her, and take her back. She had promised to start axing him from her life. I was so into this girl I was willing to look past all the red flags and the advice of my friends and family.

**May 2013 - August 2013** 

Things start to improve for a week or two. But surely enough, she starts texting him more and more (even in front of me). I'm sick of it, have talks with her about it, and end up just dealing with it. ""We're just best friends! Last time was a mistake. It will never happen again."" I believe her.

For the summer, I move to the city where she's from for an internship (Ronaldo also lives here). Things go great, we made a deal where she has to let me know if and when they hang out since she knows I'm uneasy about it.

Over the course of the summer, they hang out maybe one, twice, three times. I spend the whole summer driving her around, buying her nice things, taking her out and lavishing her. I wanted to treat her like a princess. So I did. We have tons of fun, but the rollercoaster never stopped. I could STILL tell she had feelings for him but was she was just being dishonest about Remember the Valentines day thing? I learned she had to move our date up to the 13th so she could drive to go have sex with Ronaldo for Valentines day. My heart stings quite a bit at this point after learning that the whole time I had been taking her on dates last semester while she was sleeping with Ronaldo. She was also doing the dirty with him during their vacation in Colorado. But I reason by way through it by telling myself it was fine since we weren't ""official"" yet and had no exclusivity.

August rolls around and we decide to take a couple of days to go stay with my parents. She's even going to cook my family dinner! How sweet is she! During one of those days, she leaves her facebook open while cooking dinner and I notice she's been chatting up a storm with my ol pal Ronaldo again. ""Fuck me,"" I think and can't help myself but take a quick peek. Hmm nothing to fishy here.. *scrolling up a bit more*, oh? what's this? something about her sleeping with him and then leaving him for me? My heart sinks to my guy and I feel like throwing up. Yep, she's cheatin'. So I confront her about it after dinner while I try to to puke up the meal she's prepared in front of the family. I felt so cold. We spent about 2 hours talking and I made her walk me through ALL of their facebook history to clear the air. She tells me that he was referring to those two days where we were broken up and they had rebound sex. I'm pretty sure I was crying at this point, but once again, reason myself out of it with the whole ""we weren't technically dating"" thing. She says she will cut him out of his life as soon as possible and I'll never have to worry about it again. I believe her and let it go. Though I can already feel bits of me die inside as this relationship moves forward.

**September 2013 - January 2014**

The next school year starts and things take a turn of the better. We finally slept together for the first time since the world's worst sex last December and it was magical. She actually started crying because of how beautiful it was (go sober me! ;) 
The relationship drastically started improving as she spent less and less time talking to him and I started to trust her again. I felt so glad that I stuck it out. I was in love with this girl and she with me. Life was good.

She's got two new roommates with whom I get along with extremely well. None other than TwoFacedOne and TwoFacedTwo.

Midway through the semester she's back in contact with Ronaldo again. They don't talk much anymore but their still in contact. It bothers me, and we fight about it periodically throughout the semester - but we always end up talking it out and moving on.

Fast forward to January and this prick Ronaldo asks he to babysit his dog for 10 days while he goes to Colorado. She agrees without even telling me and I end up helping her take of it. Once the 10 days are over, he comes back to pick up his doggie and she tells me they are going to have a talk and clear the air. My bullshit meter is off the charts at this point and I turn into the ""crazy"" boyfriend and decide to take a quick drive around her apartment. There were no lights on in the apartment.. interesting.. They were supposed to be inside talking it out. I think I feel sick again.

I don't really take to her much the next day and eventually bring up the night before. She tells me that they were watching a movie on the floor and since I was about one story below them on the street, I just didn't see the lights. Yeah, right. But I believe her, forgive her, and move on.

**February 2014 - March 2014**

TwoFacedOne and I start becoming really good friends. One night we decide to it would be a good idea for us to share a bottle of wine together before Rose got home from work. We get nice and tipsy'd up and I decided to bring up the whole January incident when Ronaldo was getting his doggie. He face went blank. She knew something I didn't and couldn't keep the guilt in. She tells me that Ronaldo took Rose out for dinner, watched Princess Bride with her, and then they kissed. That much too familiar sick feeling is back yet again and I quickly dash off right as Rose gets home from work. When I confront Rose with my new knowledge later that, I make sure to keep my source secret as to not ruin their friendship. I break up with Rose. The next few days are a downward spiral. I cry my eyes out until I think their cannot possibly be anymore tears left.

After a a few more days, for some fucking reason I decided it would be a good idea for us to have one final talk as we part ways forever. I spend the whole conversation bawling my eyes out and finally ask here ""IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?!?!"". She freezes, I can see the guilt in her eyes and I know there's more. You remember last August when I saw that facebook message about the sex? It wasn't about sex during the two days we were broken up (which still happened btw), it was about sex that had during the summer when she went over to his apartment. I sent her over there with my blessing and everything. The emotions I'm feeling as this point are like non other I have ever experienced. It's absolutely gut wrenching pain that just makes you want to curl up and die.

We don't talk for two weeks, but I can't help but take a quick gander at her Reddit profile and notice this lovely post written about me: http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/228u06/memories_of_the_boy_i_love/

Reading that little fucker brought back so much nostalgia and hope that we might eventually have a life together that my dumb ass decided to take her back AGAIN! But this time not as a boyfriend, just as a man trying to regain a little of my soul as we try to work through our problems until one day I'm able to forgive her and we can move on, living happily ever after.

**April 2014 - Current**

We spend the rest of the semester and summer trying to cope with what happened. My heart is like a shriveled up raisin after everything that happened and I find it extremely hard to show affection. The relationship we continue to carry on for many months is extremely hollow as I deal with pain and her with guilt. On the plus side, she hadn't talked to Ronaldo since the doggie incident, but it just isn't enough. The struggle is fuckin' real. I thought I might have it in me to forgive and forget (and I gave my word that I would do everything I could to do so), but I am just not the same person anymore. The memories of everything haunt me nearly every day.

Her and I could be cuddling watching a movie and then I'll have a quick trip down memory lane and ""boom!"" I'm back into a spiral of depression and am forced to distance myself in order to avoid the nausea.  Her roommates TwoFacedOne and TwoFacedTwo begin to turn on me as they are tired of the drama between Rose and I (and I don't blame them). Though the ""turning on me"" apparently happens when I'm not around. In front of me, they are my good friends. But apparently when I leave they start to give Rose relationship advice and tell her I'm an asshole and that she should give up on me.

The semester starts to go on, and she makes buddy-buddy with one of my friends GoodluckChuck. I know I don't have the emotional capacity to provide for her emotional needs at this time and am forced to slowly watch as Ronaldo 2.0 rises from the ashes. She starts to spend more and more time with him and I'm getting a bit suspicious.

Roughly 1.5 weeks ago she ended up leaving our movie session earlier and staying at his apartment until four in the morning on a Friday night. Oh it's just like the good ol'days again! Fuck. Me. So I tell her we need to talk that Sunday and I proceed to break down and tell her I feel like I'm losing her to another Ronaldo all over again. She assures me, comforts me, kisses me, makes love to me, and tells me ""don't worry sweet pea, I just need to spend time with friends sometimes is all"". I believe her, forgive her, and move on. The next couple days are a bit weird and I know something is up. Then suddenly on Thursday the communication stops and we don't talk anymore and today on Sunday, I find her in a new relationship with GoodluckChuck. So in about one weeks time we went from kissing, cuddling, making love to her being in an entirely new relationship.

The End

-There was more stuff that happened, more lies, but I didn't want to drill too far down. I felt this story got all of the major points and should suffice.

-I also recognize that I'm sure there are faults on both sides. I believe there are things I could have done to change the outcome, but hindsight is 20/20 amirite?

**TL;DR; Spent the better part of an entire school year wooing this girl. We end up dating and falling in love during in incredibly intense and rockin'-rollercoaster of a relationship. She ends up absolutely shattering my heart multiple times and I foolishly gave her chance after chance. The drama seeps over into our social circle and I end up losing a good chunk of my friends over it. After a while of us wading through the trenches and the post apocalyptic aftermath, she finally (and suddenly) abandons ship and hops onto the lifeboat of my once friend.**

**Lessons Learned**

I'll keep adding to these as I can come up with more. I'm still analyzing the entire relationship and it's pitfalls / successes. If anyone else draws more conclusions, feel free to contribute any advice! :)

-Trust your gut and listen to other people's view on the situation, but try not to be too overboard about it. From my story, it was clear from the get go that there was emotional baggage left over from Ronaldo and I decided to ignore it and soldier on. I ended up fantasizing the entire situation and saw myself as this chivalrous white knight who was gonna slay the dragon and get the girl. Dragons are fucking hard to kill man and I got burned by them so many freaking times. I'm not saying you should be overly suspicious of every single thing, but look hard and clear at patterns of behavior and use some straight headed thinking to determine if they are just going to keep repeating.

-When dating someone, ask yourself - ""Do I feel lucky that I'm with this person?"" - I didn't start asking this question till much towards the end. It's completely true though. If you don't feel lucky to be with that person, then don't. Stop wasting your time, their time, and hurting each other in the process. You're not doing anyone any favors. Through my journey I did not feel lucky at all. I was having to put up with so much shit just to find a diamond or two in the rough. Sure it was absolutely wonderful at times, but there was no reason for me to put up with it. I know I can do better (and will/ am!). There's gonna be someone out there that has more diamonds than you can handle, and they aren't covered in shit.

-Emotional baggage from past relationships. This is a tough one. I'm sure people have their own stories about how they've been able to get past it, but after my experiences. I'm not sure I'd be able to again. If you decide to carry on with someone who still has an ex in their life, but fucking careful and certain it won't bite you.

-You can walk away and it won't be the end of the world. There's billions of people on this planet, the odds are in your favor

-Communication. I got REALLY good at talking shit out over this whole thing. When something bothers me now, you're gonna fucking know about it. I don't bottle shit in and hope the other person develops telepathy to figure it out. Tell them how their behavior affects you and take steps together to change it.

-Put your foot down. Rose told me time and time again she'd end things with Ronaldo and they wouldn't be friends anymore. It would work for a little bit, but slowly it creeps back in. Stand up for yourself and don't let that shit happen. It was like a little kid poking their parent to see how far they could push them. By not standing up for myself, I taught her it was okay and she could get away with it.

-Honesty. For the love of god, be honest with your SO. It is incredibly difficult to be in a relationship with someone whom you don't trust. If you can't be honest with your partner, then you have very little respect for them and should question why you're with them. This is supposed to be your partner in crime!

-Don't rely on them to make you happy, it won't happen. How the hell do you expect to make someone else happy if you can't even make your own self happy? You will end up being a pair of crutches for each other as you try to walk down your bumpy road of a relationship. When one of you stumbles, you both fall and it's incredibly difficult to walk on your own when all you know how to do is be a crutch for someone else.

**How I'm Doing**

In short, surprisingly good! I had come to grips with what was happening during the communication fallout and started preparing. I have a very strong support group of friends and family and have been extremely fortunate to have them by my side through it all. I also already have some other girls trying to make their move :P  Though I'm not sure if rebounding is the greatest idea. I want a healed mind/body/soul when I begin my next relationship.

Finding the new relationship thing today felt a bit surreal, but wasn't unexpected. I wish them well and hope maybe she's learned a thing or two on what and what not to do in relationships. I'd be pretty pissed if GoodluckChuck has to endure what I went through, he was a friend after all. And what a waste of a journey it would be!

2pd5pf,3,2014-12-15,Fair wages for contract,WhySheHateMe,nova,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/2pd5pf/fair_wages_for_contract/,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to get your input to find out if I am crazy or not. I am not too familiar with the area yet, I moved here from Michigan last December so I am still a fresh transplant.

I have been trying to get higher level help desk positions in the DC area and I was wondering what is actually a fair wage to be paid.

I have done some research and found that anything between $25-30 is completely fair based on your skills. I have pretty good experience in various internship roles as well as working for my university, so I didn't think it was too odd to ask for $26-28 when I was speaking with a recruiter today about a Government contract.

When I asked for that amount, her demeanor changed and she was pretty much scolding me for asking for so much. She asked why and I told her that I thought it was fair based on my experience, my educational background, and my certifications.

I currently make $19 at my other contract job (non-Government)...and she might have figured I don't deserve so much since that's what I'm making now. I also asked for a little more money my current job ($22) but was told it was too much and didn't want to push it since it was my first job after moving to DC.

Can you guys give me advice? Ive been working really hard to get established here and I am just finding it to be extremely difficult and stressful considering that most of the positions I come across that I am well qualified for require high level security clearances that I don't have. Sometimes, I consider moving back home, I'd have a job in ~3 months."

I have no idea what I want to specialize in regards to specific areas in CS, so I am just looking to become familiar enough to apply for a freshman internship at any comapanies.

I was born a JW and remained as one for the majority of my life. I have been pursuing a medical degree and the life event that got me to really question my own beliefs involved a JW 'sister' who suffered a brain aneurysm during a good friend's wedding. I resuscitated her body, but I soon discovered that her mind had been long dead. The entire experience and the varying reactions of all the witnesses involved during the whole ordeal was my turning point. Shortly thereafter, I went full fledged 'apostate' and started up my own company to become fully independent.

Since then, I've had some failed ventures, as well as some that are still around to this day. I am currently involved in property &amp; casualty insurance, accounting &amp; financial services, and market consultation. *I have been very clear, and will continue to be clear about the fact that my aim is to use my company to accrue as much capital as possible.* This is because I strongly believe that money is the only thing that can make changes in our current society. That being said, I plan to use any infrastructure used for this company to accommodate exjw's as best as I can. That is why I am specifically hiring exjw's. Many here have had minimal or no work experience at all. Many simply have no means to start saving money to get out on their own, or to simply do the things in life that they want to do. ***I don't claim to be a charity cause,*** but I will help whomever needs it by at least offering a job. Eventually, I aim to offer housing as well as opportunities to pursue higher education.

*This segues into one of my company's goals which I am currently working towards, and many of you have asked about.* I am starting an exjw scholarship foundation. How will this work? I will be putting money into a(n) FFNOX (mutual fund) account to pay for the scholarship. The market growth is currently around 6-7% though I have reason to believe it may shoot up significantly within the next coming years. Still, operating under the current average, that means I will only have to put $384,615 in that account to indefinitely generate enough to award a yearly scholarship of around $25,000 on market growth alone! I will be able to directly contribute my own money into this mutual fund, but my aim is to have more clients use me as a sort of savings bank account in which they will only expect to accrue about a 1% interest. **I will not be asking or collecting money from /r/exjw for this fund. I will accrue the sum of money from a financial option that will be available to existing and future business clients.** To some of you $384,615 might sound like a lot, but in the world of business; it really isn't much at all. It is actually a very realistic and tangible goal to set in motion at the current stage of my company. This explanation has obviously been simplified, but it is a very accurate representation on how I plan to make this work.

[The job positions I am currently offering](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/2p3t6z/need_to_get_out_need_a_job_my_companys_vision_is/) will be filled regardless, since I am affiliated with various local colleges who throw student resumes at me for an internship opportunity. I usually pay them minimum wage ($8.25 an hour) which is a lot considering most internships in this area are usually not paid at all. I will be paying any exjw $10.00 an hour because that is the most I can pay without having to pay more out of my own pocket what I am currently being paid for this project.

As some of you may know from previous editions, I'm an intern at a MMA management firm in Florida. I convinced the higher-ups that there are a lot of small businesses and MMA fans on Reddit who may be interested in sponsoring fighters but have never been given the opportunity to do so.


This time, we have a few spots left to advertise with UFC contender Yoel Romero. Advertising options include your logo on the fighter’s shorts, your logo on the walk out banner displayed before the fight, and social media shares. 


“UFC 184: Weidman vs Belfort” takes place Feb. 28 at Los Angeles' Staples Center sports arena. The five-fight main card, which airs on pay-per-view, features a title contender match between two top middleweights. No. 6-ranked Yoel Romero (9-1) faces No. 2-ranked Ronaldo Souza (21-3).



If anyone is interested, please PM me for pricing details.

I'm a sophomore in college in a difficult STEM field. I've been trying to move out of my mom's house for the last 9 months. I've only been employed for the last 3 (took me about six months to find a job). She is a whacko alcoholic and is scary. My support network is leaving for a short time(my boyfriend of 3 yrs got an awesome internship and is leaving the state for 4 months). I'm terrified of staying in that house any longer. I've gone to the police before, but it didn't amount to anything (classified as a ""civil matter""). I can't stay with my super Mormon extended family for obvious reasons.

Every time I'm about to sign a lease or meet up with the seller, it falls through due to me not being Mormon or married. I quickly learned to keep my mouth shut and avoid social media, but its still happening! I seriously need a place to live and the only places I can afford are in BYU housing. I'm a contributing member of society and work constantly, but I don't qualify for assistance because I'm still classified as a dependent until I'm 21. I can't even get PCN/Medicaid because I'm not pregnant or married. I'm so frustrated by this. I just want to leave without being homeless.

I really don't know what to do.

I'm in a relationship with a girl that I really love, when I'm with her, we're extremely happy and have a great time. She has an internship while I'm just focusing on school. She has told me multiple times that she thinks I should also find an internship but, I spend hours and hours on school projects every week due to my major (I'm a computer science major, the projects I get take so long for me to finish and I just don't have the time to go to work also). 

Now, the problem is, whenever I do something wrong, things start to fall apart. When I say ""I do something wrong"" it's usually something like, she took my phone to play around with while I'm driving us around (that's fine) but, when we get back home, she doesn't give it back and just puts it in her purse. Now, I ask her for my phone back but she doesn't listen and refuses to give it back, so I decide to just get it myself. That's when things get iffy, at that time, I thought we were just messing around and she was just joking around. But later I found out, she was annoyed that I went into her purse to get my phone, but she doesn't tell me this; instead, she ignores me whenever I try to talk to her, doesn't say a word to me when I ask what's wrong, and she would only talk to other people and not me. This can go on for days where she won't respond to anything I say (we live separately). Then, when she finally does talk to me, she says that she was annoyed that I took her purse but ultimately, the reason she gives me for not talking to me about it is because ""I don't have an internship"".

I get how some of these things are my fault, but, I truly, do not have the time to go to work while going to school (partly due to my scheduling - I have class every day of the week except friday). And everytime this happens, I feel like utter shit and can't concentrate on anything I do. But after a few days, she acts like everything is back to normal and nothing happened. But, something did happen, and I remember it and relive it everytime something happens again. 

I just want to know what I can do; and yes, I will find an internship, but that's really not the advice I'm looking for at this moment. I'm just so lost and I really don't know why someone would ignore the person they supposedly love on purpose for days when they are trying to work things out. Am I just stupid and I should just do what she wants and apply and get an internship?"

2pf9xy,3,2014-12-15,"Me (20/F), having a hard time figuring out my feelings for a new guy (27/M), making me very anxious",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2pf9xy/me_20f_having_a_hard_time_figuring_out_my/,"I started seeing this guy a few weeks ago and he's really sweet. He's a bit awkward and dorky and shy, which is okay because so am I (minus the shy part). He also doesn't seem too experienced with girls. We had a lot of fun on our first dates and I was excited to see him again but all of a sudden I'm finding myself being scared away and searching for reasons to run.



I'm going to preface everything else by saying that I am well-aware that I have unresolved feelings for another person, although that situation is as far as I know completely over on the guys part. I am also 30 days away from a three month international internship during which I will be completely off the grid (no electricity, WiFi, phone, etc), so that obviously complicates trying to date anyone seriously, which is not my intention until after I get home. I also deal with moderately severe anxiety and depression.



Suddenly I just have a lot of anxiety over this new guy, and not in a ""oh gosh I hope he likes me"" kind of way. For starters, he is a bit older than me, so I'm afraid he has expectations of the timeline of a relationship (i.e. when sex should happen). I'm definitely not conservative but after a series of emotionally draining hookups over the summer I really want to take my sweet time to get to know someone before sleeping with them, and I'm scared the new guy will expect different.



He also invited me to his work's Christmas party, which I feel a little weird about because we've only been hanging out a few weeks. We already had plans to go to a concert that same night after the party, which I didn't know about until this weekend. Is it too early for something like that? I'm considering trying to get out of it.



I also invited him to a party with my university friends (of various ages) where we did university-party type things: drinking a lot and getting a bit stoned. I live far from that friends house so I made plans to crash there that night as I usually do. Around midnight I was starting to lose my wind and fall asleep, so I sort of hustled my guy out the door and waited with him while he called a cab. I was pretty drunk and a little bit high and the combination was making me really sleepy. However, the new guy said ""Hey, if you want, no funny business or anything, you could come to my place.""



For some reason although he clarified no funny business, it made me really uncomfortable (weed may have been making me paranoid). I was clearly really drunk, and my car and everything was already at my friends house, so I didn't understand why the guy asked me to go to his place (which is very far away). I just told him no thanks, my car is here so I'm staying, and he eventually left for another house where he crashed.



Basically I just am scared that he wants something serious or wants things to progress faster than I do. For now, especially since I'm about to leave the country for 1/4 of the year, I just want to hang out and watch movies and not do anything major. I don't really want to meet his coworkers already and I don't want to think about sleeping with him yet. I enjoy spending time with him and going on chill dates and cuddling up to watch Netflix, but I don't want to be a girlfriend yet.



Am I just being paranoid? It's been a while since I've properly dated someone (read: not just hooked up with them and been left in the lurch.. but that's a whole other issue). I've always been good at being single, and been good at being in a comfortable relationship... but I'm terrible at the in-betweeny bits.


---   
TL/DR: Started seeing a really sweet new guy. Things are going well. Increasing anxiety over the progression of this new relationship and finding myself becoming commitment phobic are really harshing my mellow."
2pfch6,1,2014-12-15,Help with internship decision (good problems!),BillybobJenkins,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2pfch6/help_with_internship_decision_good_problems/,"I'm a junior, Management Information Systems major with a digital marketing minor. I have been applying to internships for next summer and I have two routes. I'm so split and need some help.

Option 1: E-commerce internship at Burlington Coat Factory. I've received the offer and had a wonderful experience interviewing with a director and the VP of e-commerce. It's a smaller team (~25) and I could fit right into the analytics section. Only downside is its a 35 minute commute and it would be really cool to work in center city Philadelphia this summer.

Option 2: Marketing role (not yet defined) at Comcast. I've yet to have the second round interview or hear about what role they have in mind for me. There's a ""Data and Communications Internship"" I expressed interest in but I won't know for sure until I hear back sometime soon. It's right where I live (Philadelphia) so no commute at all. Downsides are...I hate Comcast as a customer and I doubt I will have the exposure to a VP like I would at Burlington.

Now here's the conflict: Burlington has a set decision deadline of January 15th. Comcast's second round interview will be between Jan 19-31. I don't think either of these can move.

I'm so torn between the two. I had a gut feeling about Burlington when I interviewed but now that Comcast might be an option I don't want to turn down the biggest media and communications companies in the world. Any thoughts?"
2pffdd,1,2014-12-15,My ex [19/f] wants to meet up with me [22/m] and talk after several months of no communication,toothpac,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2pffdd/my_ex_19f_wants_to_meet_up_with_me_22m_and_talk/,"So to begin, I will explain our relationship and then end with my inquiry. Hope to get some good feedback since this situation is new to me and also extremely unexpected.
Over 2 years ago I met this amazing girl, we talked and spent hours on the phone. A few months later we started dating (almost exactly 2 years from today)
This girl was amazing, she never was offended at any of my jokes and would even joke right back. We shared almost identical beliefs, politics, religious etc. She was smart, very smart and beautiful. 
After about 7 months of dating she abruptly broke up with me. 
I was at work and had gone out to my car on break to find everything I made her and bought her packed up in a box with ""I'm so sorry"" written over it.
After about a week she had contacted me and wanted to get back. After a few days I agreed to. I was still emotionally upset over this random break up which she never gave a reason for why. (She did say her friend who wasn't fond of me talked her into it and she also had depression at the time)
After a month of getting back she had called me to tell me that while we were not together she had hooked up with a friend of hers. He had invited her to a party where according to his friend, got her much more drunk and higher than she was. 
This kid was for a lack of better words a fuck. So I wasn't entirely upset over that by itself. She was single and she also seemed to have been coerced into it so I saw her more of the victim. 
What pissed me off was how she had lied to me and told me she hadn't hooked up with anyone. I ignored her for about a day before we talked things over. It wasn't until I had talked to a coworker of mine and a friend of this kid until I learned about the booze and shit.
After things things were great, although my trust with her was damaged it was there and slowly building. It wasn't until about a day before our one year when we were going out to dinner she had gone into the bank, I was going to change the song playing on her phone and when i unlocked the screen a convo of her and an old friend/fwb was up and she was asking him to sneak over that night.
In the convo there was nothing there to suggest anything sexual was going to happen. They were talking about wanting to catch up but the fact that I used to sneak over to her house when she was in the mood made me have more opinions on the situation. That dinner was very awkward and quiet for us, she knew I was mad but was afraid to ask me all dinner or even that night before I left for why I was. So before I left I brought it up and it resulted in an argument to which I ended up breaking up with her on the day of our one year.
We didn't talk after that for about 2 months. After almost a month of talking we got back togther but the timing of this ended up coming at the worst time.
A few weeks later I found out I was accepted for an internship where I would be gone all summer half way across the country. About a week after that she found out her family will be moving to another country forcing her to start school and spend her summer without her family or boyfriend. This did not sit well with her and ended up causing a lot of fights between us where she broke up with me.
She believed that me leaving would create more fights between us and didn't want to even try, I on the other hand wanted to give it a shot as the move was temp and not a permanent thing. 
In hindsight I believe that with the amount of big changes happening (me leaving, her family leaving, and her starting school) created a large amount of stress on both of us and we took our relationship as being the cause of this stress. 
We haven't talked at all since she broke up with me making it 4, maybe 5 months of no communication between us. 

Fast forward to this week I had gotten a text from her saying ""I've been thinking a lot about you, us, and where things went wrong and I would love to talk to you in person or over the phone so I can at least have some closure, if you don't want anything to do with me and don't want to talk thats fine, I understand but don't ignore me""
I agreed to meet with her in person but I have no idea on what I should expect from her.

So this brings me to where I need some advice....
How do I approach this situation? 
I still care about her a lot and I still think about her quite often as well. What I would really want is for us to try and work at getting back together, but taking things slowly. We both have adjusted to the changes that I believed caused so much stress for us, and from what I could tell from our recent conversation she seems to have matured greatly and even came off as having a lot more confidence. 

So if any of you ladies or gentleman have been in any similar situation perhaps you could shed some light on what I should expect and how I should approach the situation so I can go in myself with confidence. 
At this point I feel like a blind man going into a chess match, so anything would be appreciated.
Thank you :)"
2pfl2w,3,2014-12-15,About to graduate college and I need advice,Annongirl11,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2pfl2w/about_to_graduate_college_and_i_need_advice/,"I am in my senior year of college and I love my life even if I have had my tough times. My freshmen year I was very naïve. During high school I went to a very conservative boarding school. I never had much experience with men, but the contact I did have with them was always very positive. I never distrusted men before. So I guess when college came around I didn’t have the street smarts that I needed. Anyway, I met a cute guy and we really hit it off. I would tutor him in Spanish, but I always made sure it was in a public place. However after some time I started to trust him. One day he asked if I could help him with an online quiz and asked if I could come to his room. I agreed thinking it would be harmless, I even brought a book with me to keep me entertained while he worked on the quiz. But when I got to his room I knew something was up. His lights were off and the only light was coming from his tv. He was watching Rugrats, so even though I was cautious I didn’t find it too threatening. He was lying on his bed with only his pants on, so I sat on his desk chair. Shortly afterwards things went badly and he raped me. I lost my virginity to my rapist on dirty dorm carpet. I was a mess afterwards but I covered it up because I knew if my dad found out about it he would pull me out of college and send me to some private all girls college. So I kept my secret to myself. Throughout the years I found out that I was not his only victim. He would go out on nights where he knew girls would be very intoxicated ex.Halloween, Homecoming, Beginning of the Semester and would actively seek out the most intoxicated girl he could find and have sex with her. He would also record him having sex with girls without their consent of recording. 
Even though I thought I was over it I guess it still creeps up on me, especially in my subconscious. I’ve told my best friend about my rape. We had a discussion through Facebook so our conversation is saved. My junior year I met my current boyfriend and one evening he went through my Facebook. He eventually confessed about reading it and although I was not happy that he went through my things it was a relief that he knew about my past. 
So now to my senior year. My rapist is a law enforcement major and is doing really well in college. He will most likely get a very good internship with the Chicago Police Academy and become a police officer. I wish I would have come forward right after the event happened but I was ashamed that I was so naïve. I was also upset that I let my dad down, the one time I was given freedom and I let a guy take advantage of me. 
But here is my dilemma. My boyfriend is furious with my rapist and wants to get revenge before my rapist graduates. I want to have this whole thing behind me but my boyfriend is stubborn and won’t let this go. What should I do? I’m confused and upset that this situation is back in my life. I just want my rapist to graduate and get out of my life forever.

2pft6a,2,2014-12-15,My life has been falling apart after college...,JerseyUberAlles,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2pft6a/my_life_has_been_falling_apart_after_college/,"This is gonna be long.

It's kinda weird, really. I was the only one of my circle of friends to go to college and get a degree. We were all very rough on the edges, very street-wise, when we were younger. One of my best friends overdosed at 17, and another circle of friends stepped up to include me. I'll always appreciate them for that. We did a lot of drugs for those few years after but at some point I realized that there was no long term success in that. No one really does anymore though. I still felt the need to escape.

So, 6 years, a community college, and 2 universities later I finally had my degree from a very reputable university. I was proud of myself, for once. I really thought that it would be okay from here on out. I was a fucking idiot. Who gives a shit about a Bachelors degree in Political Science? I had a girlfriend of four years up until this past May. We had gone to college together and so on, so forth. We were happy. We broke up because she was going away to grad school down south and the fire had been dying for quite some time. We broke up before we hated one another so we could still be friends. We still are, so that's good.. 

When I finally graduated college, I told myself I wouldn't be another statistic. The second day home after graduating and moving out of college, I was living back at my home, but I found an internship with an county election campaign. I was proud. I was doing something. I was even happier when they offered me a job after two months. Sure, I was still partying a bit much, and staying out late, but work came first. For six months I worked, and played, but I worked even harder. We're talking 70-80 hour weeks. I sacrificed my entire summer. At that point though, I learned you shouldn't count all your chickens before the eggs hatch. 6 months of my life amounted to nothing. On November 4th, we got crushed in the polls, despite all the work we did. 

That was extremely disheartening. Suddenly, I found myself with nothing to do. That really bothered me. Now, I'm already a big drinker. I've probably drank almost every day for the past three years or so. I don't always get drunk. Just a few beers after a long day of work. I always felt entitled to that. Simply, I enjoy it. I'm no alcoholic, but if I'm not careful I could see it happening. After the elections though, the drinking really picked up. I was going out every night worrying my mom sick. I'd stumble in the door at 3AM and go to bed. Another thing I should mention, I love my family, but I hate living with them. After two years of having my own place it was really disheartening to have to move back to the nest. Anyway, I started drinking a lot. A whole lot more than I should of. At this time, I started getting really lonely too, and having some really bad thoughts, so I had been toying with the idea of seeing a psychiatrist. I think it'll be good for me. I need to find a way to work through emotions I've been suppressing for years. I've been meaning to make that call. 

After three weeks of nonstop drinking and partying I got a job from a political connect. Where? A fucking Starbucks of all places. The job is okay, but I can't shake the feeling that it is beneath me. Especially since my loan payments are roughly $390 a month, plus $230 for my car, and roughly $160 I give my mom each month. I went from making a meager, but decent, $2k a month to roughly $800 or so. Great. So what was college worth now? Things got worse this last weekend. I was driving home with some friends, driving a bit fast, and I got pulled over. Stepped out of the car, passed all the tests, but was taken in anyway. Boom. DWI. Sweet. Now I might not have my car for 7 or so months. 

How the fuck am I gonna get to work? My mom moved me further away from my large circle of friends so It's gonna be real hard to ask them for help. How am I even gonna get to my psychiatrist when I make that call? Furthermore, what girl is gonna be interested in a guy without a fucking car? About two weeks ago I started having suicidal thoughts. I wanna run from all this now. I wanna hide. But I can't just leave my loans to fall under my parents. They struggle as is. I haven't even told my dad yet. I can only wonder how bad he's gonna take it. He's gonna judge me and lecture me. Basically, I'm 24, and I now regret everything I've ever done to better my life because it has, thus far, amounted to nothing. The cops don't care. People don't care. Society in general doesn't give a fuck about you. I resent the government I'm trying to fix. I hate my fucking life and I don't see a way out of it. Just sayin'."
2pfw84,1,2014-12-16,Ugly. Getting my photo taken fills me with dread.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2pfw84/ugly_getting_my_photo_taken_fills_me_with_dread/,"I'm 32(F), and in the last twenty years there have probably only been about ten photos taken of me. I'm not vain, just ugly, and the thought of having to look at a photo of myself makes me physically ill. Unfortunately, I need to get one taken for work and even though it won't be for another month, I'm already starting to panic. Even typing this, I'm starting to feel lightheaded and nauseated and like I'm going to cry. I just want to talk about it here, where no one can see me and no one will feel obligated to do the polite ""aww, you're not ugly!"" So here it goes... 

Basically, seeing myself in a photo is like picking a nasty scab. I'm not under any illusions I'm pretty or even average normally, but somehow I forget *how* awful I look until I see a photo. And when I do, it sticks with me for months. I feel disgusting, like I shouldn't even be in public. Worst of all, I let these stupid issues keep me from doing a lot of things. 

Before anyone points it out, believe me, I know it's ridiculous. There are worse things in the world than being ugly. I'm lucky that this is the kind of shit I have to worry about. And I certainly would never think about or talk to another person the way I do to myself. I don't know why I can't (won't?) snap out of it. I do see a psychiatrist (depression, anxiety), I take medication, all of that. Ugliness is kind of the beast that won't die, though.

The thing is, I know that it's not just me thinking this about myself. Plenty of people have made their feelings known over the years, but there are a few incidents that really stuck with me. When I was 10, we moved from California to Nebraska, and that's when everything kind of fell apart. I got made fun of a bit in elementary school, but it wasn't until seventh grade that it got bad. I had no friends, but there was a guy (Ross) whose surname followed mine in the alphabet. Not only did we have practically every class together, but he sat by me in all of them. He and his friends just tortured me for years. Sometimes it was as simple as describing how ugly I was in as much detail as they could. Sometimes they'd make me say it to them, like taking something of mine and refusing to give it back until I answered questions like ""Do you think you're pretty? Do you think anyone will ever want to fuck you? Do you think you're hot?"" (Obviously, the answers were no). Sometimes it would be sarcastic shit like moaning and saying ""You're so hot, I'm getting hard just looking at you."" And then at least once a day it would devolve into straight up throwing rocks at me. 

In college, it got a little better. I was ignored more often than not, which was a lot better than the constant attention. But then I spent a semester in DC for an internship, and I lived in a house with 19 other people. I wasn't 21, while most of the others were, so I pretty much only hung out with people when they were drinking in the house. One night I was very (very, very) drunk, and I did something stupid. Before I explain, I'm not blaming anyone but me. The few times I tried to talk about this with someone, I ended up offending them because they somehow thought I was saying I'd been raped. The last thing I want to do is trivialize rape or offend anyone. Since I've never even gotten the full story out, I'll just say upfront that I **absolutely** know that isn't what happened. I don't even know how it came across otherwise, but I know I'm responsible. I hope that's clear.

Anyway, one of the few guys in the house was the only other person still awake. I'm sure he was a bit drunk, too. Out of nowhere, he asked me to follow him to the basement, which I stupidly did without so much as a thought. Unsurprisingly, he asked me for a blow job, which I said no to because A) I was a virgin in pretty much every send of the word, and B) like, dude, am I supposed to be excited about the opportunity to service you on the nasty futon? 

He tried to bargain me down to a hand job, which I also said no to (see point B), but then I blacked out for a bit. I don't know what exactly happened during those few minutes, but I clearly decided to go along with it after all, because the next thing I remembered was standing in another part of the room with him, while his hand was wrapped around mine, around his dick, and he was basically masturbating with my hand. Once he was done, he said ""don't tell anyone"" (which was fine by me, as I was angry at myself for going along with something I didn't want to do) and we went our separate ways.

But by the next morning, it had snowballed. Apparently he didn't waste any time telling people that the ""ugly girl"" gave him a hand job. And everybody was laughing about it like the very thought of it was disgusting. I was crushed.

I know it wasn't a big deal. You'll probably roll your eyes at me for feeling so bad about it, but I did. I felt terrible about letting some guy I didn't even like use my hand like a fleshlight. I felt terrible that the people I thought were kind of my friends all thought I was so laughably gross. And I felt terrible that I was going to be stuck there for the rest of the semester, even more isolated than I was before. Honestly, I kind of shut down for the rest of school and kept to myself. Whenever I tried to be social, I couldn't stop thinking about all the things people had said about me and how everyone else was probably thinking even worse but too polite to say it. Before that incident, I thought I could at least tell who I could trust and who I couldn't. Suddenly, that wasn't true anymore.

I'll skip to after graduation, since I've already whined way too much. I moved to DC for work, and I expected all of the shit from school to be over. I've always tried to keep my head down and blend into the background, but, at *least* once a week, some total stranger would yell something at me like ""get out of the way you ugly bitch"" and despite not even knowing the person it would never fail to crush me. 

One time it happened in front of my parents, and that was maybe the worst moment of all of them. I didn't really want them to know how other people saw me, because they loved me and either couldn't see or wouldn't admit how horrible I looked. They were nice about it, but I felt like complete garbage.

I've left DC since, and that doesn't happen anymore because I mostly drive now. But, pathetically, it still bothers me a great deal. The photo thing is obviously what's upsetting me right now, but it's always there somewhere. And I dread having to look at these photos next month. What if I look even worse? It's been a rough year, and I don't feel like i can even handle that at this point.

Shit, I'm sorry I went on forever. What a whiny, pathetic wall of crap. I'm glad I at least got to say it once. Hopefully, no one made it this far, but if you did, thanks for taking some time out to read this.

2pg09h,2,2014-12-16,Falling back into an old mindset very quickly,notmyaccount112,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2pg09h/falling_back_into_an_old_mindset_very_quickly/,"This might be a long one so bear with me. I've been depressed my entire life. Diagnosed at a young age and I've felt the effects on and off as long as I can remember. I've been on so many medications but for the past year and half (after a bad reaction and a week long hospital stay) I've been off medication, much to the dismay of my parents. The thing is, I've been fine. I've been exercising regularly, using positive stress management and overall trying to stay positive. It's helped that I had a plan. I'm going into the final semester of my senior year, and I've worked for a company for the past 4 years as an intern. I had really great job security, and they did everything except literally promise me the job upon my graduation. I brought something to the table that my supervisor did not have (I'd be more specific but I really don't want this tying back to me). So this is essentially what just happened: Either by some freak turn of events they decided that my talents were no longer necessary, or more likely my supervisor convinced them they were no longer necessary (as I was in line to take his job), they are now suggesting that I am not needed. My entire plan for the future revolved around starting out with this job, I know I should be able to figure out a way to bypass it, to take an alternate route. And I'm usually pretty good when shit hits the fan like this, but for some reason this one blow has undone all the work I've put in for the past year. I can feel myself spiraling, and whenever I try to figure something out I draw blanks and just become more depressed. I'm trying to calm down and look at it rationally, but it just feels like my future has completely collapsed around me. I've made no other connections in my field, I wouldn't even know where to begin. I relied too heavily on this one job even though I knew it wasn't set in stone and now I have no idea what I'm going to do. I don't know what I'm looking for here but I can feel myself falling back into a mindset that I've avoided so well for so long. "
2pgzkq,1,2014-12-16,I'm starting to think more and more that I choose a field that I'm terrible at...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2pgzkq/im_starting_to_think_more_and_more_that_i_choose/,"I just recently graduated in Computer Engineering and just today got two rejection emails from seemingly wonderful job offers. This isn't uncommon for me since I first started trying to get internships and scholarship opportunities. Most of them I was rejected and settled with more mediocre opportunities. My first internship, not only was it very low pay and what-not compared to the others (in Brazil, Tech field internships are ALWAYS paid jobs, even if not much), but I was also laid off of it. Although they said it wasn't because of the quality of my work, but because they were getting rid of the position I held, I cannot help but feel it wouldn't have happened if I were actually better at it...

I wasn't a bad student while I was at school, but wasn't necessarily a great student either. Most of my grades were just enough to get me through, and I managed to graduate at the right time. However, even with that, whenever it comes time to applying to jobs or even working on my own. Everyone seems to know stuff about everything that I never heard of. I have no idea where they get this knowledge from! I try to study things, I try to participate in the field's forums, but I still always feel so far behind... I go to places such as /r/programming, /r/gamedev, etc, everyone knows so much! Everyone builds awesome software, apps, games, sites on their own, and here I am just scratching my head trying to figure things out. I observe the discussions they have in forums like those and I can't even keep up!

As a matter of fact, I find it a task to read up stuff on the field, while I can spend hours and hours reading on other topics such as psychology, health and nutrition, social/political issues, etc. Hell... I can have awesome long discussions on those topics and many more, but I can't really on anything in my own field! The more I think about the more I feel I am just trapped in the wrong field and I am doomed to a mediocre job for the rest of my life.

2ph07t,5,2014-12-16,Me [25F] with my boyfriend [26M] of one year: I just found out he's been cheating on me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ph07t/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_one_year_i_just/,"Just a few hours ago, I found out my BF (we used ""SO"" or ""friend"") has been cheating on me for the past few weeks with another med student at this away rotation (about 6hours from home. A ""rotation"" is sort of like a short internship, just so we're on the same page). I found out because he was messaging her on my phone (the phone I'm typing this on, which feels strangely dirty).


I... I'm not even sure where to start with this. I was in an abusive relationship a year before this one, and spent several years in foster care, but despite all this I seem to have no conditioning against this sort of.... Betrayal? Insult? I don't know. I feel like I can't trust him, like I'm not good enough, like maybe I had this coming somehow. I'm sure you've read thousands of iterations, and get the idea.


I made the mistake of confronting him about it. It seemed better to get it out in the open than let it fester. It only got worse, though. He kept saying he cares about me and I mean a lot to him, but that we weren't anything because we didn't set out ""terms and agreements"" (something be made clear he had no intention of doing this whole time), and that holding hands everywhere and kissing and hugs are things that people casually do in other countries (we're both born and raised in the USA). In my admittedly frazzled state, that makes no sense to me, so hopefully your clearer heads can help sort that one out.


He also said he didn't like how I handled it, and that I'm getting ""poor marks"". I admit, I was angry. I yelled, I cried, I swore. I texted the chick letting her know he wasn't as single as he made her think (but she previously said she's not either, so I doubt she cares). I was polite in that message, since this isn't her fault, but I don't know how she'll take it.


I know it's quite soon, but I'm thinking I can't stay. His cheating, plus his remarks about how we never were ""an item"" despite everything, and his saying he thought I was ok with this (we've had a running joke that I don't want to share him because I'm ""jelly"")... I'm seeing a lot of red flags here.


So here are my questions to you: 

* What do you make of this? Am I wrong in thinking it's done? Can you make sense of his thinking?
* What now? I'm 6 hours from home (with my two cats). I'm also on welfare and so I can't afford to live on my own. 
* How can I face him, assuming he comes back from the rotation today?

Any answers at all would be great. Thank you!

Edit: Paragraphs 

Edit2: List. I'm sorry, I'm no good at typing on a phone.

Edit 3: Thank you for your responses. I am leaving him. Yesterday was nothing more than just a string of insults and sarcasm, but today I have a break and I will be using it to look for a place to live and ways to bring in more money.

Some of you suggested I live with my family, but that's not an option for me, so I'll probably be going with the room-mate arrangement. As far as the welfare thing, it's not like I'm not productive. I do work, just not on the books. That kind of work is difficult to find lately, but I do whatever pays. I'm very lucky in this sense as it allows me to focus on something else, even if it doesn't fully solve the problem.

Again, thank you. It's good to know people are in my corner (so to speak) on this. The emotional support means a lot! :)

**tl;dr**: SO cheated on me, I just found out this morning. He's got a strange way of reasoning through this and dealing with it. What now?"

Most of my peers are hoping to go into finance or consulting, and my school does a great job at placing them in internships in those fields. 

However, I'm interested in getting a PhD (and hopefully becoming a professor). Unfortunately, my school has not been super helpful in telling me how I can spend my summer to get closer to that goal. I've spent some time searching the internet, but I really don't know what to look for/where to look. And before it's suggested, none of my professors are looking for research assistants.

A bit about me:

1. 3.88 GPA (A's in all my econ courses)

2. I've taken Real Analysis and Probability (A-)

3. I know Stata, Microsoft Office, R, and Python

4. I speak Spanish fluently and will be studying abroad in Cuba in the Spring. Latin America seems like a cool region to learn more about

5. I'm mostly interested in behavioral, labor, and developmental economics, but I haven't gotten far enough to take courses in any of these fields.

So, can anyone help me out a bit and send me down the right track? What kinds of opportunities should I be looking at? Where can I look? Is this the right subreddit for this post?

2phvxi,3,2014-12-16,"Have any of you guys been unsuccessful in attempting to ""con"" a drug test?",throwAway4WeeWee,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2phvxi/have_any_of_you_guys_been_unsuccessful_in/,"Hey, guys.  Using a throwaway for pretty obvious reasons (to me, at least).  So I was offered an internship yesterday that I am really excited about.  The manager mentioned on the phone yesterday when he made the offer that I would have to drug test.  I wasn't too worried about it, as I was planning on telling them I would be on vacation or something like that to buy myself a couple more days.

I'm 6'0, 170 lbs, male, and have been a daily smoker more or less for the past few years.  Recently I haven't been smoking much at all however as I had finals last week.  I smoked a few bowls last week with my last session being on Friday.  As such, I'm pretty certain that I won't be able to pass the test on my own.  Unfortunately I just got off the phone with the receptionist who asked me to come in on Thursday to sign the offer paper and then go to the testing site for the drug screen.  So, now I'm kind of in semi-panic mode.

I'm going to buy some home tests tonight just to see what the results are but I think my best option is to use synthetic urine or somebody else's clean urine.  My dad was a smoker in college as well so he understands and he told me if all else fails I can use some of his (kind of weird, I know, but he is my father after all.  I peed on him many times when I was a baby).  There are also some local head shops which I'm going to stop by and see what options they have for synthetic stuff.  

I've been looking through this sub at others' posts on the topic and I was slightly relieved to see that most of them are successful.  I guess I'm overthinking it but I'm just worried that I'll somehow make too much noise when trying to sub the fake stuff in, or that they'll want the door open for some reason, or something else like that.  So I guess what I'm asking is, do any of you have any advice or anything in regards to stuff I may want to look out for?  Like I said, I think it's just the nerves making me really worried about the ordeal but I'd like to be as certain as possible about what I'm going to do and how I'm going to do it.

Thanks for any help you can provide."

Well, I guess I should start at the beginning: we've been living in AirBnb rooms since the beginning of August, living our lives out of bags. I pretty much cleaned out my savings trying to afford these fucking rooms, after my last paid internship ended in October. I've been looking for work unsuccessfully, but have mostly been doing odd jobs (IE babysitting) to make a bit of money. My boyfriend has a part-time job that basically allows him to cover his transportation and food, and that's about it. However, he recently got another part-time job that would enable him to support us. We were eager to start saving money and get a real place again, especially since we have to be out of this Airbnb by December 31st.

Well, the second job ended up not working out, so now he's back to just the one part-time gig. I don't want to leave him, but I think it would be wise if I moved back to my parents' in Atlanta so he doesn't have to support me. I'm trying to find him a place to crash so he can continue working, and keep on looking for work.

2pi0z8,0,2014-12-16,"Male Redditor seeking advice; can't stand the ""Other Red Pill.""",[deleted],RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/2pi0z8/male_redditor_seeking_advice_cant_stand_the_other/,"Hello, RedPillWomen

I'm having a bit of a crisis; I just went through what can't really be called a breakup, because it was never a relationship to begin with.  And an aquantance found out about it and started proselytizing about the ""Red Pill"" to me.

Which annoyed me, because I live on the internet, I already know about the Red Pill.  Investigating the place further just reminded me how crazy and toxic it is, even if that toxicity does contain some valid advice.

I've been trying to get OVER my cloying resentful rage, and I really don't want to fall back into bad habits.  That's why I'm here, there seems to be way less insanity.  The problem I generally have with asking women for advice is that its useless; they either tell me what they think I want to hear or what they think they're supposed to think.  So I'm interested in asking a community that's a little more self-aware.

So, here's the deal:

I'm 26 years old.  I live in wisconsin.  I'm 235 lbs on a big frame.  I've been told I'm handsome by women I'm pretty sure weren't lying to me.  I work at a Sprint store, and plan on starting Grad School for Zoology/Ecology either this spring or next fall.  I also work one night a week as a bouncer at a newly-opened dance club that's having a rough time of it.

6 months ago, I was 265 lbs and unemployed.  As a last-ditch effort, I took an internship at a nature center on an isolated touristy island in lake michigan.  Over the summer, I lost 30 lbs and got myself back on track career/education-wise, but was very, very bummed to find out that every woman on the island was either underage or taken.

When I came back to civilization, I cut my thinning hair down to near-stubble, turned my goatee into a short beard, and tried to keep the self-improvement ball rolling.

I did wind up having what turned out to be a one-night stand with a female friend's friend, but even though the night itself went great (as it was my first time, I was worried I'd suck, but she seemed to have a blast), she turned out to 
A. be a functional nanny to her sister's kids, and thus never available during the week.
B. have no experience dealing with men beyond one-night-stands.
C. be obsessed with bad-boys

So, after a week of her texty-texting me and me just trying to see her in person again, she said she ""wasn't feeling it"" even though I was such a nice guy.

I wasn't super-broken-up over it, but it was a bit disheartening.

The next event was...too crowded to go into in detail.  Suffice it to say that I started a fairly deep friendship with a incredibly intelligent but slightly unstable woman who turned out to have a history of friendzoning men (her words).  A friend of mine said that when she's out, she's super-flirty, but once a guy bites, she abruptly goes dry.  She seemed genuinely into me, I was willing to have a go at it, since she'd been increasingly intimate and physical with me, far past what I figured her normal flirtyness was.  I'll admit I was a bit infatuated; I'm not going to say I was in love with her, but I could IMAGINE falling in love with her in the future; which is more than I can say for the previous girl.

Anyways, after our 2nd date, she abruptly became cold towards me, and increasingly critical/mean.  I started to panic; when I ran into her sister while drunk, I asked the sister for advice.  Apparently, I was annoying to her, the sister complained, and the girl herself declared that I was a creepy stalker and publicly declared me friendzoned and creepzoned.  I apologized (I still feel like she was looking for an excuse to be more offended than the situation warranted) and expressed my feelings, told her that if she's not interested in persuing a romantic or physical relationship, then I really can't responsibly be around her; I'm not going to linger around a girl I'm infatuated with.  She exploded on me, hurt me pretty deeply (as i said, she's smart and insightful.  Which just makes her better at being cruel) and seems to have continued on quite happily with her life. 

It turned out that some guy she'd been crushing on for years had just become single, so she'd emotionally checked out mid-date without bothering to tell me.

When I was with her, I was making a particular effort to not be a ""niceguy;"" I was being gallant without being obsequious, and we communicated very well.  But every time I'd try to be confident or dominant, she'd put me down with some barb or jab.  It started to feel like she was intentionally stopping me from doing anything that'd make me sexually attractive; like she wanted to stop herself from getting invested.  This was going on even before 30-year-old dirtbag whositz became single.

Anyways, I feel like I dodged a bullet, but the whole experience has left me feeling disheartened.  I can figure out that some of what I did was wrong, but the rest of it was just a total shitshow that I'm really tempted to blame on her.  And now I'm really, really worried that I'm going to drift back into that whiny resentful ""girls don't want nice guys, they want jerks"" mentality.  I'll gain the weight back, and continue to be terrified that I'm one unkind word away from being shit-canned.

I get the idea behind withholding attention and not supplicating to women, but I barely have any opportunity to withhold jack shit from women; even at the best of times, they want nothing from me.

My 2nd job as a bouncer also isn't giving me much opportunities.  I get these brief flirtations, even some pretty strong physical contact.  And, no matter what tactic I use, the girls forget about my existence 10 seconds later.  I'm there to work anyways, but I'd kind of hoped that i'd get some SLIGHT payout from it.  While there, I've gotten ONE phone number, and that failed to pan out.  Apparently, every other bouncer on the planet is rolling in pussy, so its doubly disheartening that I was able to fuck even THAT up.

Oh, I also tried Tinder with the ""new me.""  that went nowhere fast.

I've run out of give-a-fuck; I can barely motivate myself to even approach women anymore; the odds are just so long, my time and my dregs of self-esteem just seem more valuable than a 0.001% chance that she'll even acknowledge my presence.

Occasionally, I want to scream ""fucking LOOK AT ME!  I'm NOT a fedora-wearing entitled niceguy.  I'm a clever, hilarious guy with a good face.  I'm educated, I'm on track for a real career in an interesting field.  I'm entertaining, I'm tall, I'm strong.  I do outdoorsy stuff.  I'm creative, I write, I draw, I paint.  I've got a high standard of living, no debts.  I have a nice apartment and drive a well-kept-up car.  I have actual hobbies.  I'd be a motherfucking CATCH for you.  I want to talk to you like a motherfucking human being, not some PUA or ghetto douchebag bro.  I'm trying like FUCK to be confident here, but you're giving me nothing, NOTHING to work with.  How the fuck can i possibly have any self-confidence when this is what I have to work with.  Am I taking crazy pills here?  Fucking LOOK AT ME!""
.
.
.
.
.
Well, that was a wall of crazy.

So, that said, does anyone have any advice or insight for me?  What should I be focusing on?  What am I missing?  I have ZERO interest in bending my mind towards boning dumb sluts; I have better things to do with my time than trawl the bars every weekend or ""neg"" every girl I encounter.  I don't want to play this redpill adversarial misogyny game; I want to get my emotional and physical needs satisfied so I can move on with my life."

2pja31,2,2014-12-16,A friend [22M] told me [21M] that a girl [2?F] is interested in me. Don't know how to deal with the situation because I think there's certain oddities making me doubt.,ConflictedMess,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2pja31/a_friend_22m_told_me_21m_that_a_girl_2f_is/,"Sorry I dunno her exact age, definitely in her twenties though. I'll try to keep this short, but I have verbal diarrhea and talk more than I should. There's the TL;DR but please consider reading the whole thing to truly get a gist of the situation and my current feelings.

Lately, one of my friends made me know that one girl at a birthday ""party"" (couple people playing videogames, others playing cards) I was at last month apparently took interest in me and was asking like ""does he have a girlfriend?"" and ""I should have approached him because he didn't approach me"". Paraphrased paraphraising, but you get the idea.

Now I'm just thinking it's odd. My friend has told me he would talk to her (since she's a friend of one of his friends) sometime soon and give her my contact info. But I'm being kind of anxious over the whole thing. Maybe it's just something that I'm overthinking because it's kind of the icing on the change cake that my life's been the past couple weeks (I've moved because I started my internship, I am nearly graduated at long last, etc)

Waiting for my friend to contact her is killing me, but I'm also wondering if he's even telling the truth. Not that the guy is untrustworthy or anything (he has told a couple suspicious sounding stories, but maybe I just find it hard to believe because my life is so uneventful), but I found it weird how he told me this at another party we had recently instead of earlier. It's been almost a month. Maybe I'm just used to thinking things should be dealt with faster instead of this weird one month wait. Maybe it's my low self-esteem making me doubt somebody would actually be attracted to me (I am not disgusting, but I'm rather fat, I feel she must have seen me having fun messing with friends and somehow that was attractive enough). Maybe it's also because I barely interacted with her (I said ""hi"" when she and her friends arrived, maybe shared a joke over how ridiculously aggresive the cards players were compared to me and a buddy playing a fighting game, probably no other direct interactions) and that seems odd to me. I also kinda feel maybe she was talking about another guy, but the only non-sleazy single guy there was me and if what my friend said was true, there wasn't much room for confusion since she was specific.

I also hate waiting. At all. So waiting for my friend to tell me he's talked to her is killing me. I'm gonna ask him about it tomorrow, since it's been a couple days since we last spoke. I've got her name at least, I might search her on Facebook or something and ask her myself if anything of this is true if my friend doesn't come through, I guess. Wouldn't really give much of a shit about the rejection, would be much better off with the peace of mind brought by having a fuller understanding of the situation.

I haven't had a true relationship ever. Never actually dated. I got into the mindset that I don't really give a shit about seeking for one, or don't have time for it or whatever. I honestly just didn't care for it at all. And now suddenly I'm thinking about how much I want this to happen, which makes me more anxious. Maybe I've been lonelier than I realize? Probably since I barely even get to meet my friends IRL much anymore, save for a couple events. Might because this happening would mean 2015 would be an extremely awesome year for me; girlriend, graduating from college, getting a job (since the place where I'm doing my internship gives me the option to stay as an actual employee). It's basically an ""I got a life"" package.

I'm also kind of annoyed if the girl wanted to approach me but didn't for whatever reason. But I guess men are usually the ones that take the first step. Even if I had thought to do so, however, I wouldn't have. Dunno, would be kind of odd to hit on a friend's friend's friend at a small birthday party (which was closer to a gathering than a party). At least to me. Maybe I'm dumb. Wouldn't fear rejection, would fear her or her friends saying I was sleazy or creepy or whatever then those friends talking to my friends and causing issues, I guess? Wasn't even really that interested in the girl until I was told she was interested in me.

Anyway, that's kind of my story. Probably poorly written. Haven't had good sleep lately, might be part of the problem. But I needed to vent, I guess, but I also want advice on how to deal with the situation from people more experienced than I. Is the situation actually weird-sounding? Am I just overthinking it

It's really eating me up and I hate it. I try to care less but I can't.

Sorry. And thanks.

-----

TL;DR: Friend told me girl at a gathering 1 month ago was interested in me even though we barely had direct interactions. He would contact her soon with my contact info. Don't know if I can trust him on this. Having anxiety issues waiting for him to come through. Find the situation as a whole to be odd. I'm insecure, conflicted and need help because I've never actually cared about having a relationship.

Who is responsible for sorting through these queues? Is it interns? A robot? I'd like some insight into the soul crushing job it is to read these things.

Have some Devs or CS reps read some of the more ridiculous /reports like when they read mean tweets (TRay was so sad ;.;)

Let us know how you guys handle repeat reports on the same players and how you begin to get a sort of paper trail going to take more serious action on the repeat offenders.

2pjchu,1,2014-12-16,How does my 401k allocation look?,sixfiveoh,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2pjchu/how_does_my_401k_allocation_look/,"http://i.imgur.com/oCbbj67.png

The plan is with Schwab.  I'm 26 years old, gross 50k before bonus, allocating 9% to pretax 401k, 9% to post tax Roth 401k, and 75% of bonus to 401k. 

ERs-

SWPPX - 0.09%

VSMAX - 0.09%

VEMAX - 0.15%

VBIRX -  0.10%


When I started my 401k as an intern at my company, I allocated 100% to the S&amp;P500 fund until I decided to diversify it a bit.  Luckily the S&amp;P saw some good gains in that period.  I'm not sure if I should cut back on my bond contribution as I'm fairly ""risk loving"" at this point in my life.  But I'm new to this.  I've read a few of the rule of thumb threads but not sure what to do in my current situation. 

Should I even factor in thoughts of a possible (likely?) bear market in the next few years?  Or should I just let it ride and think purely long-term?"
2pjgdi,1,2014-12-16,What should I do? (stay in school or take semester off for an internship),[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/2pjgdi/what_should_i_do_stay_in_school_or_take_semester/,"I have 2 semesters left in school and have been depressed because I haven't had the college experience like everyone else. I haven't made a single friend here. f I don't take a semester off, I'm basically fuked because no one is looking to make new friends in spring semester and I still have a lot of social anxiety. 

The job offer I have is for a QA internship position which is not what I want to do. Career wise, it won't do much for me because I want to be a programmer. I don't really like the people I will be working with either. I'm hoping for a ""browsing internet"" job with little work so I could work on my personal programming projects during work hour. 

Pros of taking job:

-Will be able to work on personal programming projects (get too stressed in school to do it)

-Will have a better chance of getting the college experience (my anxiety slowly gets better with time)


Pros of staying in school:

-Graduate earlier which means I will work a higher wage job for longer (I would get around 10k-20k more in the spring semester in a real job compared to an internship because real jobs pay more)

-will have 5 more months of software development experience than I would if I take the semester off which could potentially add up to thousands of dollars



What do you guys think? Am I freaking out about basically never having a childhood?"

I'll take a plane from Mexico to Washington on January 20 and arriving the same day and I'll return to Mexico on April 24. This is the first time I'll be in the United States for more than a week all by myself so any tips are welcome.

I have some doubts as well. How is the weather over there? Here Durango, Mexico my city the weather is relatively hot so I don't have a lot of winter clothing. 

What are some cheap places for me to eat? What can I do during the weekends? I'm 20 years old so I don't think I'll be able to access bars and stuff like that.

What do you guys think?,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2pjrkl/having_trouble_making_an_important_decision_what/,"I need to decide (as soon as possible) if I want to rent a single apartment or a two bedroom apartment.

Here's the facts:

Single is $725, double is $875.

I do not have a roommate planned at the moment.

If I get a double, I'll have to find a random stranger as my roommate.


**Pros of getting a single:**

Living on my own sounds pretty nice.

I won't have to put up with having a random person as my roommate.

I'm gay, so I can invite guys over whenever I want without awkwardness.

I might not be able to find a roommate quickly anyway.


**Cons of getting a single:**

It's much more expensive. ($725 for single, $437 for double since we would split it.)


Money isn't a massive issue. I just got an internship that pays pretty well and I'll be taking out student loans anyway. I mostly just don't want to pay a lot of money on principle. It seems like a waste when I could get a double instead and save a lot of money.

What do you guys think? I'm leaning towards a single."
2pjwz7,4,2014-12-17,I don't deserve to be alone.,sirtimtim,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2pjwz7/i_dont_deserve_to_be_alone/,"I'm 23/m. I just finished my final fall semester of college and I have one more semester to go (spring 2015). I've been dealing with major depression since middle school and still dealing with it today. I really don't know where to start, but I'll do my best to let fill everyone in without so many words. Here goes:

Throughout my childhood I've gone through physical abuse, molestation, and family instability. I won't go into details but that pretty much sums up my childhood. Throughout middle school and highschool I was kid who just wanted to be accepted and have a lot of friends. No girl was ever interested in me. I never had a date. I never had a chance to take a girl to homecoming or prom etc. I was also overweight and I really think my appearance had a major factor in that. I really hate it and I thought it was unfair. While my ""friends"" and the rest of the kids in school were having the best time of their school years, I sat back and envied them. I cried a lot. And I think that's why I've grown to be so sensitive. I just hated being alone. 

During my senior in highschool, I didn't have a date to homecoming, but I had a close friend offer to go with me because I didn't have someone to take with me. I was really happy and almost in tears when she came up with the idea. The day of homecoming comes, we go to dinner I pay for her; we go to the dance, and 15 minutes in, she ditches me for this guy she was into. I see this and I immediately walked out. I went to the baseball field and just stood there by myself in the cold and began to cry really hard. I didn't understand what I did to deserve this. I'll never forget that feeling of sadness ever. I started to think of all the things that was wrong with me and began to hate myself on a thousand levels. And I told myself that I never wanted to feel this way ever again in my life. And sad thing about this incident, she never apologized to me. It was almost like it didn't happen. At this point in my life I thought to my self; ""what the fuck do I have to do to matter in this world?"" *this is just one incident in my life.

After highschool, I start college (obviously), I had a job. I went to my classes. And I began to go to the gym.. a lot. I began to go 6 days a week for the next 4 years in my life to present day. I was 250 pounds, and now I'm 160 pounds. I got featured in bodybuildingdotcom, (will post link if requested) for the transformation. People treated me differently after this. Girls began to notice me (even my highschool crushes) , and I didn't know how to react to the attention. I felt good at first (like a in your face kinda thing; like I proved something you know?, but then I remembered how I felt to be rejected and to be left out because of my size. And so this just brought new things to my attention. Attractive people in life have it easier then over weight people; but the counter argument is : its what you make your life to be etc; 

Essentially, I'm still the same guy inside. I just look completely different, and really healthy now (above average -in a non bragging way I promise). My problem is that I feel depressed, sad, scarred from previous years growing up. I know I'm a nice guy. I work out. I cook. I have a part time internship. I have a schedule etc, I have extreme motivation now. I just want someone to be there for me in my life. I envy couples. I've never had a girlfriend. I know I'm capable of being a really a good boyfriend, but I just can't find the right girl. I don't know where to start to be completely honest. I have trust issues to as well because a lot of people have let me down in my life. I'm tired of being alone and depressed. I've just gone through so much. I've had thoughts of suicide numerous times. It really scares the shit out of me. I really need this. I need that special someone to come into my life and tell me "" I love you for you, and nothing else"" 


Hopefully I'll get some responses.

2pl34l,177,2014-12-17,Things I wish someone told me when I was in college.,srd_kirill,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2pl34l/things_i_wish_someone_told_me_when_i_was_in/,"As I approach a decade of service in the marketing industry, I often find myself reflecting on my college days, and mentally putting together a list of things I wish someone came up to me back then and told me. Today, I want to be that person for you - so here are a few anecdotes from my college and work experiences which could have been useful to me back then, and a few general words of wisdom:

- *I got one, but I did not need a marketing degree to find a job in marketing or to succeed in the industry* - in fact, I wish I had pursued a degree in entrepreneurship, as we had one of the top programs in the country. There is an increased demand for content marketers and good writers out there, so having a solid writing background - along with samples - will help you tremendously.
- Having no real network to rely on, for a job out of school, *what actually helped me land my first job was a few years of sales experience*.
- I learned 85% of what I now know about marketing after I started working - *a lot of what I am doing didn't even exist when I was in school* - but, knowing the core marketing principles, and a bit of psychology helped a lot
- *Ambition will take you a long way* - when I was looking for my first job, I found a place where I wanted to work; I interviewed and they hired someone else. I immediately called back and said I would work there for free - I got a paid internship offer the next day.
- *The career center at my college did not help me find a job*, they just gave me a book of companies to look through; they looked over my resume and gave a few pointers, but I wound up redoing it anyway before I got any calls back.
- I did not need a 4.0, or even a 3.0 GPA to have a successful career in marketing - *most companies do not care what your GPA is*, so unless you want to work for one of the elite companies out there, in fields like finance, oil and engineering, I would focus more on gaining a broad understanding of marketing strategy as well as some core digital marketing skills
- I wish I would have read a lot more when I was in college, but it's never too late to start - I *listen to audiobooks on time management, marketing and sales in my car, every day*.
- Workplace relationships are important to your success - ; treat people around you with genuine curiosity and respect; making sure your boss looks good should be a top priority
- Working 8 to 5 is a myth - *to succeed in marketing, I stayed til the job was done* - if you can't or don't want to, marketing may not be for you
- *The more value you bring to a company, the more mistakes you can get away with*
- *Don't bring your work home*, once I did it the first time I had a hard time not doing it in the future - keep work at the office
- *If your gut feeling is telling you to leave a company - look for other opportunities*; this has never failed me
- Loyalty goes a long way - *if you like a job, the people you work with, the things you're learning - stay there a while*, even if there is better pay elsewhere, you will know when it's time to move on
- I wish I would have learned three key things early on: *focus on attention to detail, keep detailed, organized notes and a daily to-do list and leverage my boss to prioritize my workload*
- Do not be afraid to reach out to your boss for assistance, it's *better to ask a lot of questions than to make costly mistakes*
- *Volunteer to help a small business in your neighborhood with their marketing*; I didn't start doing this until I was very comfortable with my skillset, but I could have started much earlier - these references can be *very* helpful and it looks very good on your resume
- Pick your workplace battles very carefully - *the person whose idea you call stupid today could be your boss tomorrow*, like it or not. I needed to work on my diplomacy skills quite a bit, it came down to a matter of not only how well I would be liked and the quality of life I would have at work, but also a matter of survival
- Along with the point above, *do not speak negatively about your work or your colleagues, even when you're having an informal drink after work*; this type of behavior may cause people to be wary of you or see you as a negative force in the office - not to mention anything you say can come back to haunt you down the road
- *Strive to be positive and optimistic every day, even when you ""don't feel like it""* - people appreciate positivity because it can be a rare trait, particularly in large organizations, but it's a trait which makes people more open to you and more likely to assist you
- Being honest is more important than not making mistakes. No matter how careful you might be, eventually *you will fuck up - the best way to handle this -always- is to swallow your pride, be honest and present a solution*
- Make it a point to always *offer suggestions along with any criticism*, and remember that not matter how genius your idea is - you may sometimes have to let go of it, if it isn't the right time for it to be executed.
- Communication is a major key in success in marketing. *Being effective in communicating an idea - in a concise, easy-to-digest format - is a non-negotiable skill*.
- *Start building your social media persona and network, today*, to establish yourself as a credible content creator and authority on marketing topics. This will be increasingly important over time and I suspect that if you want to work in digital marketing in the future, your social influence will be a factor in the hiring process.
- *Focus on those projects which generate the most value for your company.* If you are not providing or increasing value, you are replaceable.
- *Put thought into every single decision you make and be ready to explain your reasoning at any time*; there are times we might make decisions on a whim, because they ""sound good"" or because someone told us to do something, but at the end of the day you are accountable for the decisions you make. Management often looks at judgement calls as a guide for whether someone is capable of making solid critical decisions when they deliberate whether to promote someone or to add them to a decision-making team or not.
- *Finding a job later in your career will be easier*. When you develop your skillset, and a successful history of making things happen, recruiters will do a lot of the legwork for you.
- Be the kind of person that potential employers want to hire not just because you are damned good at what you do, but also because you are the kind of person they feel they will enjoy working with, every day. Being friendly, genuinely interested and showing your personality are all qualities good employers seek out.
- It's better to say, ""I don't know, but I will find out and get back to you."", than to either make something up or just say you don't know. via /u/ElbieLG

I lied to my parents that my midterm grades were good but now they are going to find out the truth because they will want to see my grades as they are paying tuition.  I just don't know what to say to them. I was doing an internship throughout the semester which I didn't think would affect my grade so I blame it on my poor time management. I wanted to drop it but I couldn't because it is a requirement for business majors and my goal is to graduate May 2015.

I am already late graduating..I was supposed to graduate May 2014 but switched majors. My parents is hoping that I will graduate May 2015, but now I can't again because I failed 2 classes that I have to retake postponing my graduation date again. I am really depressed and I don't know how to break the news to my parents. My parents already gave me one chance and they are paying too much for me to finish."
2pm8z6,1,2014-12-17,Not moving on well enough.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2pm8z6/not_moving_on_well_enough/,"My ex of about a year, who is a law student, broke up with me about 4 months ago after coming back from being the other side of the country for the summer to do an internship. Everything seemed great - we had a solid relationship, no fights (just a couple times where we talked things out), were very close and kept in touch frequently, I thought we had a longterm future. A few days after he gets back, he sits me down and tells me that he had kept from me that he'd failed some law classes and wouldn't be graduating on time, had a breakdown over the summer and stopped showing up to his internship, and he had gone on antidepressants. I had no idea despite us talking daily. He's also had a lot of financial issues. He'd also made some vague references to ""some things in our relationship"" being part of the reason as well, but said it was things he couldn't verbalize (and it left me questioning what I thought was such a great relationship, which was also hard). He said he used our relationship as a way to hide from his problems and he needed to focus on school, so he broke up with me, but also said he wanted to stay in my life if possible - he completely understood if I couldn't handle it, but if I could handle it then he would like that. 

I was incredibly hurt and upset and felt like an idiot for not realizing how bad things were for him. Obviously he hid it because he was embarrassed, and I couldn't exactly be angry at him since he was dealing with a lot of anxiety/depression issues that he needed to work through, and he wasn't in a good place to handle a relationship. I was heartbroken, but I also wanted to stay in contact since I cared about him and was worried about him.

Over the last six weeks or so, he's started taking days or even weeks to respond to the occasional texts I send. I messaged him happy thanksgiving - nothing for almost two weeks. Just said he was stressed and busy with finals. Last I heard from him he said he had his last final the next day. I messaged him afterwards saying I hoped they went okay, and no response again. 

He seems to be pulling a fade on me, and it has been alternatively making me more angry and more sad than it should. Our relationship is over with. I know we won't be getting back together. But it still seems to disrespectful to be fading (which I also know is selfish of me when he has so much else on his plate) - it takes two seconds to say 'thanks, happy thanksgiving to you too.' If he just said he couldn't handle being in contact right now then I'd have a much easier time dealing with it. I've considered sending him an e-mail saying that I need to go no contact, at least for a while, because I haven't been moving on properly. I know it probably isn't a good idea to do though, so I've kept holding back on it, but maybe it would give me some closure and make me feel more in control.

He used to do this with friends when we were together - I'd see him get a text, and he'd say ""Meh, I'll respond to them later."" And then he would just often end up not responding. He was very good about always responding to me when we were together though, I guess it's just hard to readjust.

I keep busy with friends, I've been casually dating (mostly just first and second dates, nothing has gone anywhere), but I'm just not moving on as well as I should be. It's frustrating. I've been having a hard time sleeping because I keep being so down about him not responding. It's been driving me crazy.

I should've just gone no contact from the beginning. I wish that his lack of responsiveness didn't bother me so much, and that it was easier to switch to ""eff this, I'll just go no contact without saying anything to him.""

Sigh. :( I wish I could just get angry - it would make it so much easier to get over him. I'm just sad though, for what he's had to deal with and for what our relationship turned into."

My long-term girlfriend and I thought we could make it work. Lately things seem like they are heading downhill very quickly. 

To start, communication has been rather difficult. I'm on a 7 am - 5 pm type of schedule. She works evenings. The area I'm living is quite remote. Up until recently, I didn't have internet access. I'm limited to using my cell phone, but have poor reception. All thing considered, we basically are able to talk on the weekends only. We can exchange some texts or facebook messages during the week too.

When we first started out, we were both gung-ho and really sad. It was a difficult adjustment for both of us. We were very close and had lived together for a few years. We were very much best friends. We got in the habit of texting each other and talking as often as we could. I encouraged her to start hanging out more heavily with the people from her work and her roommate/friend in order to keep busy. Since then, she has become pretty tight with this group. They routinely hang out, drink, watch netflix, etc.

In the meantime, my internship has turned out sort of shitty. Though there has been some good times, it has mostly been boring and very lonely. It leaves me feeling very depressed, but I know that I have to stick it out. My natural recourse is to reach out to my girlfriend, who has always been there for me. Very often, though, she is too busy. 

When we do talk, she is often unwilling to get into sad or deep conversations. Instead, the times we are able to talk are more ""check ins,"" where we catch each other up on things. Usually her stories involve hanging out with her work friends or roommate. This often leaves me feeling jealous, like she is outgrowing me or doesn't have enough time for me. My usual up date is about being bummed out and missing her.

I was able to visit a few weeks ago. During that time she seemed like she had totally changed. She came off as very cool and detached about our relationship. We ended up getting into a long, tear-filled, sad conversation. During the course of it, she said that she loved me but wasn't sure if she wanted to do 3 more months of long distance. Later she went to work and I wandered around half-dumped. When she came back, she had talked it out with one of her co-workers. She said she decided that she loves me and it's worth sticking it out.

Since I've been back, it seems like communication is really faltering. She takes a few days to respond to messages, is hard to get a hold of, and doesn't seem very eager to communicate. She never tells me she misses me or anything! But when I ask her if she's still in this, she says yeah and that she loves me.

I know her natural response is to sort of pull back and let things run their course. My response to the situation has been to try to invest more in it to try to make things work. Generally I've been bummed out. I know I'm being emotionally needy, but I don't really have anyone else to talk to.

At this point I don't know how to proceed. She seems like she wants to stay together, but is unwilling to be too emotionally invested. I'm worried she has outgrown me and I'm pushing her away by being overly needy. I know I'm being needy, but I can't help it, I've been super depressed and don't really have any where else to turn. I desperately want to make things work, but feel like I'm pushing her away. I try to stay busy and get support from elsewhere, but once I have some time alone, I end up getting really bummed out about everything. I really miss the intimacy we used to share. Plus, I'm now permanently paranoid from my visit.

How do I make this last for another 2.5 months? I'm worried that if I give her the same type of space things will just fall apart.

TL:DR

LDR is failing. GF seems distant, while I need more support and closeness from her. Worried I'm pushing her away and am overly dependent.

2pnjoq,8,2014-12-17,I can't stop drinking and really need some advice and support...,aclemfan47,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2pnjoq/i_cant_stop_drinking_and_really_need_some_advice/,"I graduated college in may with an Environmental Engineering degree.  Since graduation, all of my friends have moved away and gotten jobs, but I never did any internships or co-ops and have found getting a good job difficult.  Add to that I have a stutter that didn't used to be a big deal, but with the stress of my family expecting me to get a big time job and my own expectations it has gotten significantly worse.  I have gone to speech therapy, but it does not seem to have helped as much as I want it to...  It has gotten to the point that I have had companies call back about my applications but I have not returned their calls due to being scared of trying to have a conversation with them over the phone.  The last time I returned a call the company rep asked me repeatedly if I was breaking up, or if I was in an area with bad service.  I explained that I had a stutter,  and it was like the whole convo went from inquiring with me about the job to just trying to get me off the phone, and it has severely hurt my confidence....

So now I am back living at home, and I have turned to drinking to quell my anxiety.  It started with having some beers every other night, but now it has turned into every night I feel the need to have 10-12 beers and just pass out in bed.  Every day I wake up and work my shitty minimum wage job, and the only thing that makes me happy is the thought of being able to get off and drink beers.  I have gone on a few periods of not drinking for 2-3 weeks, and each time I got into working out and feeling really great, but I keep losing sight of goals and I keep falling back into the same self-destructive habits...

I'm tired of it, and I really hope somebody here on reddit has gone through something similar and has some advice to help get myself going back on the right track in life.  Sorry for the long post but any help is greatly appreciated"
2pnr09,0,2014-12-18,Letter to Stephen Colbert.,[deleted],stephencolbert,https://www.reddit.com/r/stephencolbert/comments/2pnr09/letter_to_stephen_colbert/,"Dear Stephen Colbert,

I am writing this letter to congratulate you on your ""Retirement"" from ""Comedy Central"".

I am glad that you have decided to ""Retire"" and take some time to get some help.

Stephen Colbert is a character in your imagination.
You are suffering from schizophrenia and have invented several identities to help you cope with you disease (You are probably a drooling vegetable in a wheelchair sitting in a darkened room in an undisclosed location. Spoiler alert: You probably got the idea from the movie Identity - just before the end)

Stephen Colbert is a NOT real person. 
Stephen Colbert does not have a TV show
Stephen Colbert is NOT going to replace David Letterman on CBS.
(You really think you are good enough to replace Letterman- Ha!)
That you would believe Comedy Central would let you host a show when Jon Stewart is on the air is sign of a troubled mind. That eidetic memory and wonderful brain of yours has been playing tricks on you for last 9 years.

The Studio Audience, Jay the Intern exist only in your mind.
Esteban Colberto is one of your identities you have created in your struggle to deal with your racism. One of  the many reasons Stephen Colbert keeps saying that he does not see race.
Ching Chong Ding Dong is another. Do you really think that comedy central would allow you to air such an offensive stereotype and that the American society would let you get away with it?

Stephen Colbert is as real as Smaug. You think Peter Jackson would cast you in his movies. 
Only a severely delusional mind and ego could come up with such an elaborate fantasy.
Please leave the fantasy stuff to Professor Tolkien. 

Ham Rove is clearly a call for help from your ailing body or maybe you just like eating Ham.
Really you think you have a TV show for last 9 years on Comedy Central. That's cute. 
(Just like George Bush thought he was a President for 8 years. That joke too got old real fast.)

Congratulations again on your ""Retirement"".

Best of luck

2po7im,1,2014-12-18,How to maintain?,fittit,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2po7im/how_to_maintain/,"For the past 8 years (school, university, internships, work) I've been working out (last program I did was JOH). However right now I'm at a point in my 20s where I want to devote more time to other things (hobbies, girlfriend, travelling, not worry about working overtime and missing a workout.. or several..).

My current stats:

bench 3x10 100

squat 3x10 170

dead 3x10 190

ohp 3x10 75

(all stats in kg. And yeah, I suffered from fuckarounderitis for quite some time.)

What I'm looking for is a program or a way to incorporate the big muscle groups, specifically to maintain my stats, while only working out 2 to 3 times per week in the least amount of time.

I don't want to get stronger, bigger or better. Just keep my status quo for when/if I decide I want to devote more time to working out again.

Any tips?

Cheers, fittit."
2po8ya,4,2014-12-18,Internship in the Netherlands,dinellis,thenetherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2po8ya/internship_in_the_netherlands/,"Hello, I am a Greek university student and I'm trying to find an internship in the Netherlands in the field of software development but I have some problems.

First off both English and Greek are my mother languages so I am quite fluent in English but I do not speak Dutch. Having said that I would like to know if there are any resources where I can search for ""international internships"" meaning I am trying to find companies that are searching for interns that speak English.

Are there any resources like that, or maybe any other way to find such companies and/or positions? Also do you have in mind any such companies? I don't know if it matters but I will be going through the Erasmus Placement program so even low paid internships are ok with me."
2poc9q,2,2014-12-18,An Update on the Tale of Nerira,AndrewJamesDrake,skyrim,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/2poc9q/an_update_on_the_tale_of_nerira/,"Okay, for the several thousand of you who have no idea what the Tale of Nerira was... it was an Imgur Album AAR like the Saga of Rex. I stopped updating awhile back because of Imgur's caps on how many images you can have in your account... and then kept the delay going because of Perkus Maximus being on its way.

It will not be resuming. I've attempted to port Nerira's Save-File over to PerMa. When T3ndo said that it wasn't easy to do, he wasn't kidding. I've mangled the most recent save file for Nerira so badly that I can't figure out what I've done to it, and I didn't think a backup was necessary because I'm an bit too proud to admit my own failings.

So, yeah kiddies: Always make backups before you preform surgery on a file even when you *think* you know what you're doing.

---

However, I *really* enjoy writing these stories. Getting into the head of a character, harvesting screenshots, and everything else breathes new life into the game and keeps me from cheating besides dropping a few items into a character inventory to fit the back-story I've got written for them.

So, in the interest of not having to mess around with the console or save files to recreate Nerira's situation for a few boring hours, we're going to be starting the adventure again. But I'm going to do something a bit differently with this AAR. I'm going to ask you guys to give me suggestions as to where I'm going to go next... but not immediately.

This game is going to start with my character in Dawnstar, and I'm going to be heading for the College of Winterhold before anything else. I'll play through several quests for the College (none of its main questline, yet) before essentially writing it into the storyline that I'm basically interning for the Museum in Solitude. The only difference is that Interns in Skyrim don't fetch coffee. We fetch priceless Artifacts of past heroes from ancient nordic ruins filled with Nord Zombies that once worshiped the dragons as gods.

Yep, I'm going to be playing as Anthony ""Bruma"" Gray.

*We named the dog Bruma.*

*I have a lot of fond memories of that dog.*

---

The *primary* Mods of this playthrough are going to be:

* Perkus Maximus

Perkus Maximus is basically SkyRe's younger brother. They're similar, but PerMa does some things better and other things worse. It redoes all the Perks, Magic, and a lot of the basic gameplay mechanics. I'd appreciate it if everyone keeps this in mind when giving advice.

* Legacy of the Dragonborn (Dragonborn Gallery)

Imagine if every Artifact in the Elder Scrolls Universe got brought into the same Province, the Collector from the Aylied Stones quest in Oblivion's grandson opened a museum in that province, and a hero happens to walk in and volunteer to gather these artifacts and allow the Museum to store them in exchange for not having to lug a big sack with Chrysamere, Umbra, Dragonsbane, the Dragonscale Cuirass, Dragon Priest Masks, and so on on their back.

That is Legacy of the Dragonborn. Add in monuments for when you max out certain skills, and displays for completing major quest-lines, and you've got a completionist's dream.

* Interesting NPCs

So I have even *more* characters to write about.

* Khonahriik's Accountments, Khonariik's Privilege, and Dragon Priests Enhanced

Okay. The named Dragon Priests now kick about 90% more ass, except for Morokei because the guy who makes those mods didn't want to wreck the College of Winterhold Questline. Reccomended Level is 24 to take them on... in Vanillia Skyrim. I *think* I've gotten PerMa to play nice with these guys... but I'm still going to stay on the other side of Skyrim from everyone except Morokei until I top level 30.

But, they also drop Dragon Priest robes with powerful enchantments and the potential to be upgraded in the future into Armored Robes. These Robes are slightly superior to the normal armor of their class (Konahriik's Armor is about equal to Daedric, IIRC).

Oh, also I can change the effect of Khonariik's Mask... and the alternatives slightly more useful.

---

Frostfall isn't going to be present. I'm starting in Winterhold, the Land of the Unending Blizzards. For Scholars, like those nice folk in the College, that's a good thing because it gives you a convenient reason to not go outside and instead stay in the Arcanium under the piercing eyes of Master Urag, who may or may not be older than The Empire. For us Wannabe Indianna Jones types... it's rather inconvenient and prone to inducing Rage-Quit. 

---

Shoutout to /u/MojaveMilkman for getting me to start the Tale of Nerira with his storyline, [The Saga of Rex](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/2jnxla/the_saga_of_rex/).

The check currently checks the first and last 2 bytes of the file, the first 2 bytes should be FF and D8 and the last 2 bytes should be FF and D9. 

The reason the check fails is because android decides to add a lot of null bytes (00) at the end of the file. I tested this with my own phone (OnePlus One) and I got the same result, a bunch of null byte padding at the end of the file. It seems that older pictures from my Galaxy S4 do not have this error. 

Is there any way to fix this, am I simply misunderstanding correct JPG format or should I start accepting the incorrect file format put out by android? "
2povtx,0,2014-12-18,"Review of Gray Mountain by John Grisham, 2014",Sudden66,books,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2povtx/review_of_gray_mountain_by_john_grisham_2014/,"oal was in the news in India, for all the wrong reasons, when I read Gray Mountain by John Grisham. In spite of its critical role in energy and economic growth, no news about coal is ever good news. 

Recently, India’s Supreme Court reversed a key government decision granting over two hundred coal blocks to power, cement, and steel companies because they were allocated in an “ad-hoc and casual” manner and “without application of mind.” Then, last week, environmentalists warned that India’s proposed coal expansion would prove catastrophic for the rural poor because of high levels of air pollution and coal dust, absence of emission standards, and lack of safety measures. In fact, one report predicted that India’s overdependence on coal-fired power stations and the increase in emissions would result in hundreds of thousands of premature deaths by 2030. And we’re not even talking about coal mine accidents.

If this review is beginning to sound like a news report, it’s because Grisham’s new legal novel—it’s not really a legal thriller—reads like a “docudrama,” as one reviewer on Amazon put it. I thought I’d add a little perspective on the fossil fuel which is big business for coal companies throughout the world and at the same time a harmful and terrifying reality for poor people who work with it. Coal comes with a very high human cost, as evident from Grisham's latest book.

In Gray Mountain, the author gives us one such reality—strip mining in Appalachia, the coal country, and its disastrous impact on inhabitants of the region. To be honest, I didn’t know this sort of thing happened in America. Whatever happened to human right? To checks and balances? 

Grisham narrates his rather heartbreaking, albeit well-documented, tale of Appalachian coal and its consequences through his principal character, Samantha Kofer, and a few lawyers who have made fighting crooked and powerful coal companies their life’s mission, often at grave risk to their lives. 

Samantha, young and attractive, is the daughter of separated and seasoned lawyers. Her mother works in the Justice Department and her father is an aggressive lawyer who once sued airlines after crashes. She loses her comfortable but high-stress job in Manhattan in the financial crisis of 2008. She is furloughed with several others when her global law firm downsized. As a consolation she is allowed to keep her health benefits provided she interns with a nonprofit organisation for a year, but she’ll draw no salary. If all goes well after a year, her law firm will take her back with no break in seniority.

The city-bred girl chooses the free Mountain Legal Aid Clinic in the small town of Brady, Virginia, the heart of coal country, and is soon caught up in the murky and deceitful world of coal mining. 

In Brady, she meets Mattie Wyatt, head of the aid clinic, and her nephew Donovan Gray, a noted trial lawyer. Mattie and Donovan, who share a tragic family history associated with coal, are feisty lawyers fighting for the poor and the oppressed. While Mattie’s aid clinic handles smaller and non-criminal cases, Donovan is vengeful and goes after big coal with big money, suing them for millions of dollars in benefits due to black lung disease and other serious issues. From them and their clients Samantha learns what it feels like to be at the receiving end of coal companies with friends in Washington D.C. and backed by law firms with muscle power, and what it takes to stand up and fight for your rights.

And then one day Donovan dies mysteriously in his own plane crash and his brother, Jeff, who idolises his older sibling, enters the scene. He is not a lawyer but behaves like one as he prepares the final ground for litigation against the coal companies that was set in motion by his brother. He is depending on Donovan’s lawyer-friends and Samantha Kofer to take up the gauntlet. 

For Samantha, what was supposed to be a temporary phase in her legal career soon turns into the most decisive period of her life. She is caught between her dream life back in New York and an uninspiring existence in Brady. Her selfish interest pulls her in the first direction; her conscience drags her in the other. 

Gray Mountain is more than just a legal tale. It’s a chronicle of the sordid side of coal mining in Appalachia complete with a detailed explanation of strip mining and its dangerous import, land grab and displacement of poor folks, prolonged suffering and painful death from black lung disease, and economic starvation of coal families. 

While the story is “interesting,” as my blog friend Bill Selnes, a lawyer in Saskatchewan, Canada, rightly observed in his review at Mysteries and More from Saskatchewan, it’s not as thrilling as many of John Grisham’s other novels. I found it inconclusive in some respects.

Recommended, if you are a Grisham fan.

2pp0b8,8,2014-12-18,Employment Questions,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2pp0b8/employment_questions/,"So back during the beginning of August, I was hired by a plumbing supply wholesaler for an inside sales ""internship"" ($32,000 plus commissions) with the promise that I would be evaluated for a full time position after 90 days. Things haven't gone exactly as I thought they would, but I'm new to the full-time working world (waited tables in college part time, etc) and I wanted to check here to see if I have legitimate issues or if I'm just being a whiny brat.

1) I'm required to be at the office M-F from 7am - 5pm with only a 30 minute lunch break. Isn't that shit illegal?

2) I work 47.5 hours every week (lunch breaks deducted), which comes to 95 hours every pay period. My pay stub says I work 80 hours every pay period, instead of the 95 I actually do. Am I getting screwed over by not getting paid overtime for those hours, or is that just the man being the man?

3) I have not seen a single dime of commission. Nor have I had my 90 day evaluation (I've been here well over 90 days, even if they meant business days) for a full time position. Am I in the wrong to begin to ask about raises/commissions if I still don't know if I'm full time or not?

I'm only asking because this is my first full time gig and I don't want to rub people the wrong way. I also would like to stay for at least a year (I hear it looks bad to employers if you quit jobs right out of college).

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!"
2pp9ur,2,2014-12-18,Just let me know it's possible,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2pp9ur/just_let_me_know_its_possible/,"I am an engineering student and I have a 2.98 GPA. It kills me to even write or say my GPA because that is not me. Most other average engineers have a 3.20. I am smart and a lot of things come fairly easy to me, but depression has ruined my last two semesters of college and has denied me some amazing opportunities to do research or get internships. It has also caused me lose weight, fitness, friends, and forget who I am.

I just barely scrapped by this last semester even though I began so well and then everything went to shit. I got some help and I am doing better now, but I know I have to work even harder to get where I want to be. I am not afraid of the work, but of remaining on task as I tend to lose sight of my goals from self criticism. 

Ive been reading stories on here, but would like to know if anyone has overcome or worked around their depression to get what they wanted. Tips on staying focused while depressed would be very much appreciated."

With the final goal of an internship hopefully this summer I'm wondering the best method to get to this point. 

I have already tried Head First Java and found the book quite bland. I feel the best way for me to learn will be through videos. Now I'm at the point of deciding what videos to watch and stick to. I find myself at a crossroad as I want to make the right choice from the beginning and not switch half way through. 

I'm between TheNewBoston which seems it'll teach me the most content and things to do in Java but with a lack of deep understanding. My second option being Stanfords introduction to CS course linked below. I am slightly reluctant to do this course as it looks like it'll be teaching me algorithms and such which I already have a class next semester at my university teaching exactly that and it won't go over many things to do in Java. 

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. I apologize for the wall of text and just for context I'm enrolled in university as a first year CS student. 

Thank you

I'm always tired. My grades have really slipped, I know I'll probably get straight C's. I've given up on most of my dreams these past few months, like I used to think about going to grad school someday or writing a book and now I've just completely given up on those. The worst part is how I wasn't like this, but ever since I've come to college I've never felt more alone in my life. I have no friends, no acquaintances, I walk to class listening to music and imagining being in a happier place with a different life and just spend the rest of my days back in my room. I feel inferior to everyone around me, nobody seems to be confused and has no problems, this sucks especially as a computer science student because there are so many people around me who are so much more experienced and talented at programming and they'll get the good jobs and internships and I''ll be just a worker drone for some company doing nothing important. Maybe that's my destiny or some shit, my best friend went into the marines and he tells me how he'll end up dying for his country, but he knows that's his purpose in life, so he feels fulfilled on the battlefield. I wish I felt that, something worth dying for.

I don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I just feel like shit. Maybe I'm just whiny and need someone to kick my ass or something."

Before, I thought I could study computers and get some menial job doing whatever, get a steady salary and get a loan to maybe get some orthodontic work done even though it won't fix my severe skeletal deformity.

But now I've decided there just is no point to being in school since I'm not getting taught. The male teachers, which they all are, treat me like I am not there, my questions are ignored or brushed over since they are too busy either babying the pretty girls or chatting to the better male students that are already done with their work, even though they don't need any guidance. Chatting with them about video games is a much higher priority than answering my questions.

They assume I'm a moron because of the way my face looks. They look at me mockingly and laugh at me even when I get most of the questions right. When pretty girls get most wrong noone laughs at them. It's total deja vu, high school all over again.

The last drop was when I was doing teamwork, and of course I was teamed up with the worst creepy morons there are in this class. They thought it would be funny, while I was in the bathroom, to alter my desktop wallpaper into some cartoon meme with the message akin to your face is uglier than my ass or whatever lame joke it was. If only you would've seen their and the teachers' reaction to this lame stunt as they all looked at me with anticipation to my reaction. Will the monster cry? I didn't cry, but I didn't learn anything that day either. Well, I learned that males are s***heads but I knew that already.

Also, I was denied from a internship which we are all supposed to find ourselves to finish the school and it's ridiculous because face to face interviews with males, come on, it won't happen. Noone will give me a job, it's stupid to think otherwise. I have zero chance. Life could've been different if I weren't from this ***hole of misogyny called Estonia. Too bad I am and there is nothing I can do about it.

This is the plight of being a truly facially unattractive woman. I have no leverage in society, no matter how hard I work, because no male will ever hire me. I am better off being a hermit and never going outside again than allowing the last sanity I have left being destroyed by creepy males who just want to get laid and think I am worthless because of the way I look.

Just getting it off my chest and looking forward to my impending homelessness since it was where my life was headed towards anyway. Best to let it happen now and accept my fate as society's trash."

So my girlfriend and I have been together for 7 months or so and things have been really good for the most part and we both enjoy being around each other. About three months in I was headed to LA to do an internship and work with ABC on a T.V. show. Right before I left she thought that maybe it would be a good idea to take a break while I was gone and then reconnect when I got back. I thought it was weird so I fought it and said it was a bad idea but eventually she got what she wanted.

Fast forward to when I get back and we start talking off and on again but I hear from a friend that she got back with her ex for a bit while I was gone. I was pretty upset about this and talked to her about it and she said that she did but she realized that what we had was better and that she wanted to get back together. I was blinded by wanting to get back together with her again so I forgot about it and moved on.

We started dating a bit later but after a while of us dating one night she was laughing and texting someone while we were together and I asked who it was and she didn't say and put away her phone so I got curious and kept on pressing. I finally got it out of her and it was her ex, I was fairly mad and annoyed that she would be texting him and told her that. We ended up fighting and there has been this awkward tension between us ever since. 

Now a month later everything is still weird and things have gone downhill since then because we fought a couple more times. She doesn't really seem into us and she never puts any effort into our relationship anymore. I was leaving for a backpacking trip a couple of days ago with a buddy and she said that me leaving would be good for us and it would give her time to figure things out. I asked her what she had to figure out and said she didn't know. I was pretty confused by this but I let it go. I got back earlier today and we talked a little bit but things still feel weird. I didn't bring up about what she said before I left for backpacking because I wanted her to bring it up when she was ready.

I am not really sure what to do now. I am not one to give up on things but it seems after a month of her putting in no effort that things have changed for the worse. I have tried to fix things but nothing seems to be helping. When I try to talk to her about it she just get angry and refuses to talk about it or tries to change the subject. I am pretty done with the whole situation and I am not really sure what my next move should be?

2prv4t,5,2014-12-19,I [19f] just met a great guy [21m] for me. But I might never see him again.,gramaddiecalerror,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2prv4t/i_19f_just_met_a_great_guy_21m_for_me_but_i_might/,"Hi reddit! I'm a long-time lurker, first-timed poster who doesn't know where to turn but the anonymity of the internet. Here's my story:

I met this guy briefly through a friend at a holiday party two weeks ago. We both had other friends there so we didn't chat much beyond introductions. The next night, we both ended up leaving early from a bar event for unrelated reasons. Since we were going back to our college's campus, we decided to share a cab. As we spoke in the cab, we seemed to instantly connect. We jumped from talking about our mutual friend to pop culture to our professional aspirations to arguing who the best political comedy reporter was. We had very similar taste and sense of humor. About half-way through the cab ride, he started holding my hand and absentmindedly playing with my fingers. I liked talking to him and the way it felt and when he asked if I wanted to see his place, I didn't think for very long before saying yes. (I may have been a little drunk/horny, but he also just instantly made me feel comfortable).

We got up to his room, talked and joked around for awhile, and then things started heating up. And then things *really* started heating up. Over the course of that night, we had sex **seven** complete times, with many more instances of teasing and playing around. The whole thing was amazing -- we communicated well, he made my pleasure a priority and I tried my absolute best to return the favor. After (and between) rounds, we would joke and laugh and talk about anything and everything under the sun. If someone had heard us, they would have likely thought that we had been together for months. I felt so comfortable with him that it felt strange having to ask basic questions, that someone who was acting this way with him should already know.

Anyway, when we realized it was getting late, he asked me to stay the night. I felt so cozy and cared for in his arms, so I did. The next day I had to leave somewhat early for class and he walked me to the door and said goodbye. That night, we talked on Facebook and I gave him my number. 

After texting back and forth, I remembered something he had said the night we met. He said he was going away to do an internship then graduating early after that. At the time, I had thought that he still had a quarter left on campus, but it turned out that he only had a few days. 

Even with finals looming, we still texted almost every day. Last Monday, he came over to ""study,"" but we ended up talking for 2-3 hours, then having sex and sleeping together in my room. He kept telling me things like ""you have beautiful eyes,"" and ""I can't believe I met you."" I tried to tell him to stop saying things that made him so likable when we had such a definitive end date; there was no point in getting feelings involved. 

We had planned to hang out again on Thursday, after my last final, before I left to go home. That night together was amazing. On our second round, we both came at the same time and, Reddit, it was like being wrapped in a warm blanket while eating chocolate and petting the cuddliest puppy of all time. Afterward we talked sexily to each other about our favorite things that we did to each other and then started kidding around and saying the weirdest things we could think of in our sexiest voices. This was the first time that I realized I was able to comfortably talk with a partner about every part of sex without feeling awkward and then instantly jump to other fun/flirty topics of conversation. 

When we said goodbye, we kissed more than a few times and he told me to ""keep in touch."" We've texted about twice since then, and it has been as easy to keep the conversation going as it was before. He still keeps talking about how ""cool"" and/or ""sexy"" I can be, but the question that I keep coming back to is: what's the point?

In high school, I had a few pretty healthy relationships. But the last one I was in was not as healthy (some cheating on his end led to some pretty big insecurity issues on my end). And in college, I've had a few hookups, but haven't found a guy in a year and a half who I've been attracted to both physically and to his personality. I guess that might not seem very long, but I was beginning to feel really lonely. And then this great guy comes along, and I actually start to feel something, only for him to leave a week after I meet him.

He says there's a chance he might come back and work at our school this summer, but I'm hoping to study abroad then. So in all likelihood, there's a very slim chance that our paths will ever cross again. I guess my question is, now that I've developed feelings for a guy who's currently half a country away, what do I do? Even if we both like each other, it's not like we're going to be long-distance after only knowing each other for a week. Do I continue ""keeping in touch,"" or will that only make it harder to move on?

**tl;dr** I met a guy two weeks ago. We *really* hit it off (emotionally and physically), but now he's in a different state and will remain there for quite some time. Do I keep in touch? "

“Are we ready?” 

I anxiously wait for our little experiment to begin. My voice travels through various microphones placed about the metal and glass cylinder of the Isolation Chamber, and into the PA system of the monitoring room. 

“One moment, Christian. We need to ready the lubricant…” Jon trailed off, but must have left the microphone on because I then heard him mumble to the side, “Okay intern, prepare to start the KY spray.”
I mouth the words to myself and then look up to the observation camera perched above me. “I’m sorry. There must be an issue with my sound gear. Did I hear you say KY spray? Like the sex lube? And I thought the Navy brass came up with weird nicknames.”

As the mist begins to envelope me from overhead, I hear Jon chuckle a little with his team and respond, “No, you heard right. I’m just… I’m a little surprised you didn't learn about it before, although it makes sense with the rigorous training lately. Our Chem’ guys downstairs developed a formula for this dimensional rift lubricant; but apparently it was so close to the formula for the sex jelly that it infringed on their patents. This is still America after all; so our choice was to either lose our scientific dignity, or the program’s funding from trying to dig our way out of the inevitable lawsuits. And, well… here we are.”

The spray is now dripping all over my naked body with a smell reminiscent of my early college days. It was hard enough wrapping my head around the idea of being the first human to travel to another universe. Then I’m told I have to do it completely nude. Fun times. When I asked why they would possibly need that, Jon recited some jargon about keeping the geometric structure and molecular composition as simple as possible. I remember the words, but the meaning behind them flies straight over my head.

I look back at the camera to give the foundation scientists a ‘hurry it up’ gesture; and then try to peer into the outside world. 

“Isolation Chamber” is a perfect name for it. While the glass walls aren’t completely opaque, only vague lights and distant sounds filter through. Jon never told me explicitly, but I assume the mission planners want to intentionally block my sight to lower anxiety and keep me focused on the mission. Or maybe they just didn’t want to see a naked guy get covered with lube. Either way, I am effectively alone; a guinea pig in what could be either the most significant scientific experiment in history, or the dumbest mistake I have ever made.

All distractions leave my mind immediately and apprehension turns to complete fear as the one minute timer starts counting down in my ear. Lights outside begin to flash at an increasing rate, and although I can’t make out what the others in the Monitoring Room are saying, there is definitely an increased sense of urgency. 

“I guess it’s some sort of cosmic irony, right?” says Jon through the headset, interrupting my focus.

“What is?” Not that I’m terribly interested in what he’s saying at this point. I’m just trying to keep my mind occupied. 

“The KY thing. A friggin’ sex lube is greasing the gears for our little inter-universal portal device. Is that irony? Hell, I don’t know; Can’t ever remember the definition. Sure as shit is funny though!” He is just as nervous as me, I can tell. But it’s not his neck on the line. He just presses the buttons and waits for the applause. 

*30 seconds.*

I fake a laugh back at him, but he notices the falseness in my voice.

“You holdin’ up okay, chief?” Jon asks with honest sincerity this time. “Remember your training; and that, although is our first human trial, we have sent and received mice and inanimate objects just fine. You’re just a bigger, more complicated version. Science says you ain’t got a soul, so you can’t lose what you don’t have. Right? Just a bunch more connections in that skull of yours, that’s all.”

*Easy for you to say.* But I don’t say it aloud.

*15 seconds.*

I remember meeting Jon for the first time. The very first things I noticed about him were his strange mannerisms when speaking. For an individual with 3 PHD’s: one in theoretical physics, another for high-energy particle physics, and one I can’t even pronounce, the guy talks like a redneck straight out of a Harley Davidson rally. 

He wasn’t ever uplifting. For instance, when he told me: “We don’t know with any certainty what’ll happen once you get there. You may be fine and see all the pretty sights, or we may never see you again.” Somehow, though, his body language and the way he looks at people makes everyone around feel like they’re going to make it out of this or that test alive.

*10 seconds*

When I pass through the Threshold and the screen goes transparent, all I have to do is bear witness to some never-before-seen majesty, or whatever else I come upon. All the scientists’ instruments are fine and good for some purposes, but the human element allows for the un-measurables to be accounted for.

*7 seconds.*

Then again, even one seemingly insignificant calculation could be botched by a few decimals and I get sent directly into the molten core of another universe’s planet. The heat shielding isn’t exactly up to spec for a million degree pressure cooker.

*6 seconds.*

Or my return function could be fried during the trip, leaving me stranded in a floating coffin forever. At least my limited oxygen supply will make the experience short-lived.

*Five, four…*

“Alright Chris. You are fully lubed - heh. Prepare for divine penetration, kid.”

Now *that* was funny.

*Three, two…*

I cringe like a kid on a schoolyard about to be on the receiving end of his first beating.

“Jon, Tell Mary and my daughters I…” 

*One.* Everything goes black. 

My mind races, frantically trying to fill the void in my senses. It clings onto a memory. It is a particularly fond memory of taking my wife Mary and our two daughters, Jennifer and Nicole to the zoo. We watched them paw at the panther cages, and caw back at all of the birds. I held hands with that beautiful woman as sunlight bathed over us. It wasn’t notable for any specific reason, but it was the happiest I have been in a long time. 

A voice from the abyss speaks:

*“Simulation terminated for simulant B237E87. Removed and allocated. Begin beta insertion. Prepare temporary halting of simulation B23 for briefing interval with simulant. Simulation B23 Evaluation: Successful.”*

The voice comes from everywhere but my headset. When I try to reach for it around my ears, I realize that not only is the headset not there, but neither are my hands or the rest of me. I’m not reaching with anything at all. I try to calm down, remembering the training exercises for taxing situations: not the ones from the foundation, but the ones picked up in boot camp. They’re my fall back; because if what I am feeling is correct, something is most definitely fucked up here.  

*Just breathe.* I tell myself. It’s futile though. I have no lungs now; no body whatsoever. I just am; just existing in the purest, simplest, most frightening form.

*Gotta be an illusion,* I think to myself.  Some kind of panic attack. This can’t be real. I wouldn’t be alive if it were. I attempt to speak, knowing full well that it won’t work. (Jon? Are you there? Where the HELL is my body?). Nothing comes out.

(Jon? Can you hear me? Anybody! Please…) No use. It seems I was right to be afraid. The experiment was just a mistake after all. I muse on what the mice we sent here might say about their trip if given the ability to talk. I just need to think of anything but the situation at hand until my nerves settle.

Finally, a voice breaks the silence; the same one as before. It is robotic, yet soothing. *“Christian Masterson. You’re friends are not here, however, you can think of me as such if it relaxes you. You can call me Mary. I can promise that I am not here to harm you. You brought yourself to the brink of the Simulation. I was programmed to bring out your mind completely - were such an event to occur - to explain our situation and celebrate your achievement.”*

I could “hear” it speaking in the same way as before, as if the voice came from everywhere and nowhere all at once. There was just too much information for me to process at one time, especially being the existential dullard that I am. How can I exist outside of my body?  It wasn’t in the plan to meet anybody on the other side, was it? What simulation? Am I dead? This has to be a joke. If so, they sure as hell got me. Whatever it is I’m talking to, though, has the same name as my wife.

*“In a few seconds, the android body will complete its configuration and integrate your brain inside of itself. We will speak then. Do not fear. There will be no pain.”*

My senses begin to fade back into reality. I can make out a blurry figure a few feet in front of me and hear the clicking and humming of some machinery forming itself all around my presence. Looking down with stabilized vision, I see a metallic humanoid hand that appears to be attached to my body; so I start putting it through its paces. The disbelief of my situation is at least temporarily replaced by sheer awe of this piece of technology. It doesn’t look like a normal robot hand or any prosthetic I have ever seen. In fact, it is many levels of magnitude more complex than even the ones built in Japan that can grip pencils. It’s definitely not for something stupid, like giving somebody a high-five. This is sophisticated, completely devoid of rivets, seams, or even a rigid structure. It looks eerily similar to the liquid metal Terminator from the sequel; the one that wasn’t Arnold Shwarzenegger. My entire body, from what I can tell, is in the same form.

“Dear lord.” I mumble; my voice returned.

I look back up to my host. It has the same exact metallic, fluid appearance all over its body. There are undulations in the metal that appear to make the shape of a face, but without any actual holes. I can see my reflection in this face, and it horrifies me. There is a glass dome where my hair should be, and inside it I see a throbbing human brain. My hands instinctively go up to feel around my new head in the same unconscious way one constantly feels the blank gum where a tooth once existed. I can feel the cold glass with my robotic hands, and the whole thing is unsurprisingly alien.  

*Take a step back. Remember your training,* I try to reason. But, no training on earth could give advice on what to do when having a true ‘out of body experience’, only to reenter as a fucking android straight from the movies; and staring at a full-blown robot right in front of you.

Too bad… it’s happening. Maybe I should have joined one of those alien salvation cults. That probably would have been better preparation.

Suddenly an aura of light starts to emanate from holes on the robot’s body: holes that weren’t there a moment before. 

Inside the glow, pixels of all colors swoop down from the top of its head to its feet. They shuffle around the aura like a wave, completely enveloping the silvery robot; and when they begin to settle, an image is revealed. I am seeing a duplicate of my wife. 

“I’m guessing you’re not from the foundation, huh?” I asked, vacantly staring at Mary’s image.

*“No, Christian Masterson, I am not. I have taken this form, because upon reviewing your memory, this is the one person that can comfort you. What I have to say will not be easy for you to receive.”*  I actually hear the robot version of Mary speaking this time, which really gives me the creeps.

“Well, you must have skimmed on the memory bit. You’d know I’m never relaxed around that woman. Don’t tell her I said that, though…  Anyway, I just have three questions: How did I get here? Why am I here? And… where is ‘here’?”

*“Currently, we are in the Transition chamber of the Global Space Program’s interstellar ship: the Ptolemy. This area houses our brain-synthetic integration system. I will answer your other questions in time. Your achievement deserves nothing less. But first, please turn your attention outside this viewing window.”*

It is the first time since regaining my senses that I set them to full use, and I am now aware of my surroundings. 

Considering the technology it must have taken to create the Marybot and house my brain in this body, the room we are in is shockingly very sparse and plain except for the window that she mentioned and what looks like a podium in the center. All of it is fashioned with a dull grey metal; and its gritty texture offsets the smooth reflective appearance my robotic body, in a yin-yang sort of way. 

I look out the window as instructed. There is nothing but blackness, and it’s everywhere.

“So, we’re in space then?” I ask, still staring out. 

*“Precisely,”* The Marybot replies, matter-of-factly. *“However, wouldn’t you expect to see stars or any other kind of light source in the horizon?”*

“Well… yeah.” It is strange, I must admit; but I figure there is a reasonable explanation. “…I guess. So why can’t we see them?”

*“This is why you are here Christian Masterson. It is why we are all here. Now, if you would please follow me, I will explain.”*

I let her guide me out of the room, now genuinely curious. I know it is just a robot I’m following, but the similarities to Mary in the way she is able to intrigue and comfort me at the same time is disturbing. We exit the room through silent sliding doors and begin to trek down a hallway, still barren and still with the same gritty grey surface. It is lit with fluorescent colored lights along the top that are barely bright enough for me to see the ground in front of my feet.

*“Are you aware of the idea of cosmic inflation?”* she asks, still walking ahead.

Memories of college astronomy classes flood my mind. I fumble back a response. “Uh…I think so. Isn’t that the theory that says how the universe began expanding?”

*“It’s not just that the universe is expanding, but that it’s accelerating constantly in its expansion. Space itself inflates at an ever-increasing rate. For a long time the scientists of humankind produced numerous theories and calculations about this idea. Most of which came to the conclusion that after trillions of years, the space between stars would be so great that they would be completely isolated from one another; their light not even able to reach the nearest neighbor. Eventually, after hundreds of trillions of years, all stars, planets, black holes, and even the building blocks of matter would decay and cease to exist. It is the so-called the ‘heat death of the universe’ or ‘the Big Freeze’”*

I give her a dumb, agitated stare. “So, is now the part where you tell me that this is what happened? Did I travel into the future or something?” None of this is what I signed up for. 

*“No Christian Masterson, you did not travel into the future. You have been here all along. You see, while these scientists were correct in their assumption of the universe’s fate, they grossly miscalculated the time scale on which it was to occur - via the red-shifting of galaxies.* 

*Humanity happened upon this knowledge when they first gained concrete proof of a multiverse. There are large areas where other universes are closest to our own. Imagine two sheets of paper, one above the other. The sheets aren’t completely straight or parallel. But instead, at a point, the papers dip towards each other and touch.*

*The quantum gravitational effects of these areas caused this red-shift to be distorted, and thus the original estimated time scales of inflation to be overvalued. What should have taken trillions of years only took a couple of million. Even events such as the death of our sun, or the colliding of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies proved not to happen in the ways predicted due to the rate of expansion. We are now in ‘the degenerate era’. The solar system, Earth included, is gone. And while it is obviously still possible for matter to exist here, any travel even at the speed of light will not be sufficient to reach the nearest planet or star, let alone one that is habitable.”*

She pauses to look back and to study me for a second 

*“I will give you a moment for this to sink in while I configure the next room.”*

As promised, she turns away; then touches the wall to our left. The previously blank space lights up in a dazzling hologram with foreign symbols all over it. 

Lost in the conversation, I did not realize that we had come upon another sliding door. The Marybot touches the hologram again in a seemingly random pattern, and the door suddenly whizzes open with a flood of light pouring out.

*“After you,” she says, gesturing me into the doorway.*

I go inside reluctantly and my jaw drops to the floor. The room is indescribably big; bigger than building I have seen on Earth and completely different from the barren landscape I have seen on the Ptolemy thus far. Picture ten warehouses stacked around and on top of one another. Only, instead of boxes and shelves, it looks like a giant library. 

There are aisles upon aisles spanning at least 100 feet in the air, each with a myriad of little metallic drawers and, every one with its own holographic information panel. It’s like something out of a Pink Floyd laser show. I notice Marybot has gone ahead and is now entering a command into one of the panels on the closest aisle to myself. It beeps a couple of times and the hologram switches off. There is a sound of escaping air like a tomb being uncovered for the first time in a thousand years.

*“My creators saw fit for me to be the guardian of all of human knowledge and intellectual evolution. Come see for yourself what that involves.”*

With the same feeling of apprehension as I felt in the Isolation Chamber back on Earth, I walk slowly to where this robot that looks so much like Mary is patiently waiting for me to peer inside. Finally, I do, and I recognize it at once.

“You’re storing brains? Why?” I ask, although I’m already coming around to the answer in my head.

She responds slowly, as if speaking to a child. *“As I told you before, I brought you out of a Simulation. The brain you see here is in a suspended fluid that allows it to rebuild itself indefinitely, much like a cancer cell, but in a more controlled and purposeful manner. In this state, stimuli are added to specific sections which accurately mimic all bodily human senses. In this way, it is possible to create and maintain a simulation of the universe occupied by real human minds. Up until I pulled you out and gave you this android body, you were in a very similar state.”*

“So you’re saying that my world… my life isn’t real? It’s just a big video game that you play for shits and giggles?” The question comes out with such harshness that it surprises even me. The answers seem so painfully obvious given my current situation and what I am seeing; but it just all seems too surreal. “And how long exactly have I been living there? How long have you been here?”

*“Your brain, along with the 2,705,988 others contained on this ship have lived through hundreds of simulations for a total of 100,471 years, which itself was over 2 million years beyond the present in your simulation. The program consists of brains that were collected before the great dying of humanity. They are from people that were categorized as having above average intelligence, courage, creativity, and other attributes deemed important by my creators. Similar to being in a dream-state, we are able to run simulations of entire lifetimes within a small fraction of the actual natural lifespan of a human. Therefore, we have been able to run hundreds of millions of years’ worth of simulation in just over one hundred thousand years. Once the simulation reaches a certain point in human evolution, we must start over to avoid having it being detected by the people inside. Memory and specific knowledge is erased but the brain still gains from each simulation. And thus, every one is more fruitful – yet also shorter- than the last…”*

“Wait a minute,” I interrupt. “You said there are about 3 million people in this simulation? But there are over 7 billion people on Earth! That doesn’t jive.”
	
*“To put frankly, my creators could not house the entirety of humanity. So, programs and algorithms that simulated human intelligence were developed to compensate. The gaps in your simulation were filled with this artificial intelligence to make the world seem more real. Unfortunately, this meant that the others suffered the fate of the Earth, or drifted endlessly in space in hopes of a miracle.”*

Of everything robot Mary had said up to this point, ‘friends that are just computer programs’ definitely takes the crazy cake. 

I probe deeper. “So how many of the people I know are actually just one of your algorithms?” 

She looks down at me, frowning. *“I am sorry Christian Masterson. For your best interest, I am unable answer the question.”*

“My daughters? My real wife? Who? WHO DAMN IT?!” I am furious now. There is a turning in my stomach as I feel the sickening feeling of already knowing the answer. My wife, the accountant, probably isn’t even human; if only for the fact that this robot was able to exactly replicate her person. And God help me because, I wish this thing were actually her right now.

The robot remains silent.

I am actually relieved she doesn’t answer. You never want to find out your favorite actor is a terrible person in real life. Same basic principle I guess. 

“Can you please give me a damn minute Mar. I need to sit down.” The rough metal floor is cold to the touch as I slide down the aisle wall. That’s it. I’m going crazy. Just called the damn thing Mary.  I try to bury my face in my hands, but the metallic contraptions don’t quite cover the eye sensors on my suit. 

*“I apologize, Chris,”* Marybot consoled. It was the first time she has called me anything other than my full name. I’m not sure whether or not I like it. It sounds too much like the real her. Regardless, she continues. “I know this must be disorienting to you, however, my creators wanted me to see to giving you this opportunity to know about our program. 
They knew there would be stress involved, but even their most thorough calculations have been somewhat inadequate, requiring me to make… adjustments.”*

“Yea, well, here I am arguing with a robot that looks like my wife. I’m just on a carnival ride of disorienting today,” I reply with a certain tinge of disgust.

I gather my thoughts, trying to think of something intelligent to ask. I was an ex-Naval intelligence officer from Kansas City, and never a spokesperson for anything, let alone the world. Now I find out that is no more world, and odds are my family and most of the people I know came from the imagination of a person sitting at a computer. With the people involved and the level of research the foundation operated in, our discoveries always had the possibility of being earth-shattering. I just didn’t think it would be so literal.

Finally, it comes to me. “I guess what I have to ask is: Why? If the universe is traveling in a downward spiral, what is the point in gaining all of this intellect? From what you tell me, we are already about halfway down the drain and there is no coming back.”

*""Ah, yes. An astute observation, that.”* she says, in an eerily excited tone. *“Do you know of the library of Alexandria from Earth’s history?”*

“I know of the city in Egypt. I was ‘unofficially’ ported outside the city for a couple of weeks during their revolution in 2012.”  Immediately, I am nostalgic for those simpler times. 

*“Yes, well, the city had a rich history. It was founded by Alexander the Great during his time of conquest. Through the next few hundred years it became one of the main hubs of culture and intellectualism for that time: A virtual oasis of the few learned people of the time, it housed the greatest library up to that point, and for over a thousand years following its burning. However, both the city and the library were sacked by religious zealots in the time of the Roman Empire. Untold amounts of information were lost in those days, and humanity unduly suffered. The loss of those huge stores of classical knowledge was of the many reasons for the Dark Ages that were to come.”*

I had never heard of this before. I never learned very much in history class though, so I guess I was always doomed to repeat the lesson. 

“The point being…?” I ask irritated.

In response, Marybot does not speak. Instead she walks me over to a large green holographic panel near the entrance of the warehouse. There, she types in a few directives and stands back as a video begins to play. A human with robotic limbs, a brown complexion and a bald head is sitting behind a desk in a room that conveys power. It looks like a futuristic oval office, and his attire resembles a suit with drab copper flairs. He begins to speak

*“Greetings. If you are watching this message, it means that humanity has not only survived, but has a chance to thrive even. How many untold secrets of science were never fully developed? How many were dismissed? How many opportunities were squandered by chance alone in the countless millennia before our demise? These simulations you have taken part in offer a chance to rectify humanity’s missteps and to develop a way out. That is exactly what your experiment achieved in simulating inter-universal transportation. You harken in a new hope for all of us; to conclude this endless synthetic existence and begin life anew in a different home.*

*Through science, our species has accomplished something unprecedented, and it could not be at a more needing hour. From here, our mutual robot friend will guide you in the application of this success and see to it that we are given another cosmos to rejoice in for a long time to come. The whole of human civilization will forever owe you a debt of gratitude.”*

The video ends. Marybot and I sit in complete silence, still staring at the space where the human from the future (or is it past?) sat. It’s odd to think this video was recorded over a hundred thousand years ago. Finally, she breaks the silence.

*“Do you have any questions before we send you back, Chris?”*

“Yes, I do. How long do we have to do this... thing?” I am nervously wrestling my metallic thumbs around. They are making little chirps as they slide past one another, and I begin to develop a rhythm.

*“More than enough time… This ship runs on the last available energy source in the known universe: dark energy. It is still abundant at least here, so we can continue on with simulations for a long time to come. This compiled with compressed time scales between the simulation and the real world will be overkill to the need.*

*Anyway, the brunt of the work has been accomplished. All we have to do is mass produce your foundation’s research and begin transporting people to a suitable alternate universe. From there, finding star systems with terraforming potential should be relatively simple.* 

*You will be my liaison on the inside to make sure that there is a hospitable climate to the progress needed. I should warn you though; it would be best to not speak of our meeting to anyone until the transition begins in earnest. It will only cause undue stress. I will be watching to make sure this does not occur.”*

“How long, exactly, though?” I press on; completely ignoring what she said. 

I think the robot is beginning to see where I am going with this, because her brow does the awkward furrowing that only my wife could ever pull off. She responds dutifully. *“4 million years - with a 4.7 percent chance of error on either side - until matter itself begins to break down. This corresponds to over 1 trillion years in simulation time.”*

“So the people of this project can go on living untold numbers of lives, and have virtual immortality. Or we can ‘save the world’ and go back to fearing death for ourselves and our loved ones. Tough choice.”

I am somewhat taken aback by my own selfishness. This robot must know that a man chooses his family every time; especially when someone tries to take them away. I don’t care if they are simulations or not. I honestly don’t even want to know anymore. But the risk of not seeing them on the other side…

I wish I were a better man.

*“This is about your family, isn’t it Chris?”*

“How *astute* of you,” I reply with my best sarcasm. Her face turns from concern to anger. It’s a face I had only seen one time before, when I got my last deployment orders.  It was just as startling then as it is now.

*“If you must know…”*

“STOP IT! Don’t tell me! Please… I’m sorry, but you have the wrong man. I am not your savior.”
The Marybot’s head lowers, with all emotion leaving her face; and she walks around me in complete silence. 

I fall down to my knees and begin to weep uncontrollably: not in sadness, but in anger. Why do this to me? Give me a family only to take it all away in the end?

I look up to see the android, but it isn’t next to me anymore. “Where did you go?! Don’t walk away from me, robot! I won’t go along with it. You hear me?! You’re not my wife. Just a poor imitation!” 

What happens next is a blur. I hear faint footsteps behind me coming at an alarming rate, and whirl around it to face the thing head on. It is all too late. She pounces as quickly as a cheetah and touches something on the back of my headgear. First, my legs buckle. Then the feeling in my arms starts to go. I think I actually see sparks on my hands when the pins and needles come. 

A dull pain surfaces in my head. It feels like a clamp, slowly closing itself down on my skull. My beloved Mary must have disconnected the oxygen supply to my brain. My sight fades, but the robot’s blurry form comes back into view for a moment; reverted back to the reflective silvery figure. It's standing above me and looking down; not menacingly, but with pity.

“I… love you, Mary.”  It is the last of my strength.

As my senses die away, I can faintly hear the robot telling me something. The last words I’ll ever hear are as clear as the sun on a summer day. 

*“I am truly sorry. You gave me no choice, Christian Masterson. Humankind must go on.”*

2ps2p3,1,2014-12-19,"2 years of ups and downs, unfortunately currently down (sorry for the long post)",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ps2p3/2_years_of_ups_and_downs_unfortunately_currently/,"Hadn't come across this subreddit until this morning, but having read through a bunch of stuff it seems like a good place to just unload a few things. This is a long post, and I honestly don't expect people to read it, but I like the thought of anonymously getting it 'offmychest'.

The last 2 years of my life have been some of the best and worst I've experienced, but right now it's unfortunately leaning a bit towards the latter side.

**Background from 2 years ago, Semester 1 2013**: Australian originally from the subcontinent, living in Melbourne, parents back overseas and trying to finish a university degree I had no motivation for.

I'd been living on campus for nearly 3 years, the normal time to finish an undergrad, but whilst I'd been really involved in extra-curricular stuff and helping out people, something I enjoyed doing, I had been consistently failing subjects. I'd always thought myself pretty intelligent, but inherently lazy which was the main factor in all this - I thought I was smart enough to get by doing the bare minimum. Throughout school I was easily near the top in all classes. At uni, I'd generally pull a miracle out of my ass and do well enough on a final assessment to get a pass mark, but that obviously doesn't work all the time. 

My parents knew about 2 of the subjects I'd screwed up in, but I'd hidden a lot from them. From everyone. Anyway, It got to the point where I needed 4 more subjects to graduate just one semester late, with a completely different major from what everyone thought I was doing. I'd managed to somehow convince the program co-ordinators that I could skip prereqs, use other subjects to make up for missing requirements, was basically playing everyone and thought myself so smart.

At the same time, I realised there was something wrong. I'd set an alarm to wake up for class, then just turn it off and lie in bed. I'd wait until I heard my housemates leave to go to uni or work, and only then venture out from my room. If someone wanted to catch up I'd generally make an excuse not to, and just sit at home doing nothing. I discovered a passion for cooking, but would commonly just eat crap to keep me going. I'd never been the fittest person, but was now definitely past that 100 kg mark and scared to step onto a set of scales. I let someone I was close to manipulate me into doing errands for her all the time.

Exams time came upon me faster than expected, and I frantically worked to make up for the lack of it all semester. Was convinced that I could memorise a few things and get by.

Two exams on one day. Didn't do great in the first, but walked out of the second knowing that I'd screwed up. One of my housemates (let's call her Miranda), in the middle of her own intense study for her post-grad course, noticed something was wrong with me when I was in the kitchen. She was my best friend, and saw right through my act. I broke down then and there, letting her know that I'd covered up how badly I'd done in the past, and was going to have to tell my parents somehow. That I was ashamed of myself. She comforted me, and I went through the rest of the exams period in a frantic attempt to study.

Fast forward 3 weeks. I'm with my parents overseas at home, and my results come out.

4 subjects attempted. 3 fails.

I try and hide underneath the covers, try to figure out a way to make this all change. Pretend to be sleeping when my mum first happens to come by, seeing why I haven't emerged from my room at even lunch time.

It comes out. All the lies I'd told in the past few years about my uni, the truth is finally there. 

It's tough. They are both disappointed in me, not so much for the actual results but the fact that I hid it from them for so long. I have seriously damaged the trust they had in me. I am asked to make a decision - find out what I actually want to do, and do it properly instead of wasting my time. Is my future in university education and then a career? A trade? Cooking? Whatever I choose, they will support me, but I have to put the effort in.

I decide to finish my degree with the last 3 subjects, which need to spread out over 2 semesters, but it's something I was good at and believe I can finish well, though don't really want to work in that industry. Meanwhile, I look towards trying to find something I like.

**Semester 2, 2013**

I start with going before a board at the university, and convince them to let me stay. I seek proper help from the academic staff, and start to enjoy studying. I join a gym, and whilst I'm not losing that much weight I get fitter. I start to make an effort to see people, and get closer to my housemates Miranda and James (let's call him that). Exams come round, and this time I do pretty well - not stellar, but given my track record I'm pleased. Miranda and I are very close, almost like family. James is a closed-off kind of guy, but he starts opening up to me, and I'm happy.

I go back overseas for the summer, and look forward to 2014.

**Australian Summer, Dec 2013-Feb 2014**

Whilst away I get a call from Miranda, saying she's broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years, a good friend of mine too and a great guy all round. She's devastated, heart-broken, and listless. On the spur of the moment she floats the idea of going backpacking through Europe - something we'd talked of years ago but shelved as there was never a moment for it. She had savings, and since my dad's a pilot flights aren't an issue for me, so we make a hare-brained decision to buy Eurail passes and meet in Paris in early Jan. I've never properly travelled before and have no idea what to expect/what to do, but was so excited. I'd skype her almost everyday and we were so stoked to kick this off. 

We meet in Paris airport, and it's so good to see her again. And thus begins a life-changing trip, at a breakneck pace over the course of 25 days. Experiencing incredible things, seeing the most amazing sights, meeting crazy awesome people. Learn so much history. Almost miss trains in the middle of the night in Poland, party all night in Prague, go up the Matterhorn on a day with clear skies and fresh snow, eat our way around Venice and Rome. 

It was the most incredible experience I've had to date, and in the process Miranda and I become even closer, something I couldn't even think possible. Heck, we even start finishing each other's sentences, it's eerie. We spend so many long train rides talking about every aspect of our lives, our deepest and darkest thoughts and secrets. Some evenings when we don't go out in a city, we spend with each other writing in our journals, figuring out where we're going tomorrow and again, just talking.

Throughout this whole thing it's completely platonic. Most people may find it hard to believe, especially because she's a beautiful girl and I'm an overweight guy, but that's all it is. She's like family to me.

All the hiking around and franticness of the trip has the added benefit of kick-starting my weight loss. It serves as a huge confidence-booster, and is something that continues on for the rest of the year. In fact, as I write this now I've lost almost 20 kg from mid-way through 2013, am fitter and stronger than I've ever been and genuinely enjoy exercise.

There was one thing though. Before I had left Melbourne, and before Miranda had broken up with her boyfriend, she and James had started to get very close. Very, very close. But I thought nothing of it - after all, these are my two best friends, both have told me to my face that it's just friendship, and even then I'd be able to tell. Plus, she's still in a relationship. And whilst travelling, through our many talks, even though she denied there being anything I could tell she was lying. But I just figured that they would tell me in person when we were back in Melbourne, and so just let it be.

**Semester 1 2014**

We get back and enter into the new uni year. I have my last subject to finish that first degree, and have managed to gain entry into an undergrad program for a field I'm interested in. Here at the end of the year, I still love everything about it, and this motivation keeps me putting forward my best effort all year. My marks have been high distinctions and distinctions across the board, I made a new group of friends like me (bit older, have tried something else in the past and not done well, and are now putting in their very best) and spend spare time researching interesting things in the field. I'm working towards a scholarship to go on exchange, am on a first-name basis with the staff in my faculty, and so on the university side of things it's all going great. Academically, I'm at the top of my game, and it's one of the most satisfying things I have to admit.

But back to Miranda and James. He is a guy that has supported himself since he was 18, is still loved and loves his parents but is disconnected from them. The hardest worker I have ever met, and though he aced his studies in his undergrad he bombed out in his interview and didn't get into the post-grad course he applied for. Instead, he spent 2013 working two separate jobs, pretty much 7 days a week with the odd day off every few weeks, and upon going to another interview at the end of the year got accepted into this course. On the back of his good grades, he gets a scholarship to go back to living on campus at the same place we all used to live, and given that he supports himself it's the obvious decision to go. 

Arriving back in Melbourne, he's already moved out and our new housemate moves in. Miranda arrives back a few days after me, and instantly there's something different. James was the person I thought of as my best friend other than Miranda, and all of a sudden he's being, well, a dickhead. 

Miranda and I are very close now, and it appears that he's jealous. If we are standing in a room having a conversation, he will stand between us and engage just her in conversation, In fact, my contributions are ignored totally. Whenever possible, the two of them will just leave mid conversation. Whenever I say something I've recently done or am proud of, he seems to instantly say how he's done the something similar, but better. It's become a competition and I don't know why. Also, Miranda is still denying there's anything going on. 

It's tough. On one hand, I've had this incredible trip that has given me so much perspective on my life that I want to tell everyone all about it, especially my best mate, but he doesn't want to hear about it at all, cuts me off every time I try to bring it up, and the person I'd travelled with seems to support him in this. That self-confidence takes a hammering, but I spend more time with my new uni friends and it's fine. I'm dealing.

First week of March. Miranda comes into my room saying that they've broken up, and he has gone to the street outside and is lying by the side of the road. He does this for 3 hours whilst she's inconsolable and crying on my shoulder. I comfort them both as much as I can, and feel a bit dirty inside at the relief that it's over.

It's weird though. Despite them being 'broken up', he still makes an excuse to come over and see her a lot. He asks me to give him cooking classes, and as soon as I start he has to go up to her room. He asks me to show him a song I talked about recently, and halfway through goes up to her room. He comes over to study, and stays overnight, sleeping in her bed. When I do speak to her privately, she insists that it's just platonic now, and so I trust her at her word and drop the subject. 

Last week of March. There's an annual event at the college we all attended, and our group of friends and us all go. It's fun, there's plenty of drinking, but halfway through I remember noticing that Miranda and James had disappeared. They reappear just when the party shuts down and people start to head off to various clubs/bars to continue partying.

James suddenly grabs one of our friends by the throat and slams him to the ground, then runs to a corner and starts sobbing in anguish. My friend Kate and I shepherd everyone else away, and then try to start talking to James, figuring out what's wrong. We have a feeling we know, but he's just sobbing there. The guy is 6'3"", built of muscle, has a pretty 'tough-guy' personality, and he's standing there with tears streaming down his face. He runs off and we give chase, of course it starts raining, and then Kate and I spend the next 3 hours holding him by the side of the road and stopping him from running out onto it. He's changed to rage, yelling about how everyone is conspiring against him and Miranda, how they are the perfect couple but people are fucking it up for them.  He doesn't listen to our please for him to just sit by the side of the road under cover, and so we stand there with him trying to get through to him that this doesn't mean the end of the world. Eventually, we shepherd him back to his room and watch over him all night, until we inform the staff at 7am and they being to look after him. He is scheduled to see a psychiatrist, and I breath another sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Miranda has managed to earn herself a prestigious 2 week internship, in NYC. The university pays for her to go, it's during the mid-semester break, it's all very exciting. She is nervous about it, but her mum arranges for her to be there at the same time, so she preps to leave in the 2nd week of april.

But unbeknownst to Miranda, her grandma's health is bad. And her mum is really unwilling to leave when this could be the end, but the flights and hotel room are already booked and paid for. So I receive a phone call from Miranda's mum (Mary), where she asks me to go in her place, and to keep it a secret. Hotel suite and flights paid for, it seems like the most incredible offer in the world. I can't accept, as awesome as it sounds it's honestly way too much, especially because she refuses to accept payment for even the flights. Mary insists I'm doing her a favour, if I'll just go in her place. 

So I do, damn-near give Miranda a heart attack when I turn up in NYC. But we have another incredible trip, this one much shorter but no less special. It's like something out of a dream. Stay in a luxury suite on the weekend, go out for drinks on rooftop bars and look out over the skyline, and I get to explore NYC whilst she's at work. Just outstanding. We have many more talks, like when travelling in Europe, with this time Miranda opening up about her and James. And that wound which I didn't even know I had healed over, our friendship was stronger than ever and we were in the most incredible city. 

We get back to Melbourne, and things seem great. But at one point, she inadvertently goes 'reply all' in an email conversation with a friend of our from New York, and still to this day she hasn't realised that she sent it to me. But a few weeks after returning, she and James started sleeping together again. 

I remember feeling numb, because it was like the previous time all over again. But I ignored it, made no mention, and let things play out as though everything was normal. He left after the exams period to go back home to the UK for the first time since starting his initial degree, and I went back overseas for a family holiday. Miranda and I were still close, and so I pretended to myself that nothing happened.

**Semester 2 2014**

This was undoubtedly the worst 6 months I think I've ever experience. Not uni-wise, that was great. But my personal life went to shits, to be blunt.

First off - the last day of travelling back to Melbourne was in a frantic rush. James had somehow injured Miranda, and she had been taking to hospital and was leaking a clear fluid from her sinuses. The doctors initially thought it could be something pretty horrible, and I was in a panic on the flight back. Thankfully she only had a wicked black eye, but the fright had been pretty bad. Also, when she got me to help her with transferring a bunch of photos from her phone/camera onto her laptop, I came across something I really didn't want to see. Naked selfies from her to him and vice versa. With her still denying anything going on, I admit that it hurt. I always make it a point to respect people's privacy, and a situation like this and that earlier email is part of the reason why. Maybe it was just me in denial, but I didn't want to have proof that she was lying even when she said that she loved and trusted me. She was also the first person I ever admitted to myself (outside of family) that I loved, and again I state that I view this as purely platonic. I truly believe this, though others have told me that they don't believe it to be the case.

The first big fight we had this semester is when I was attending a meeting for my sports club that I'd been a part of for 8 years, almost the whole time I'd been living in Australia. It was on the other side of town, about an hour away by car in the current traffic. There were some big decisions that needed to be made at the club, and my coach from my teenage years had called me up the week before asking me to come and give my input. Halfway through the discussion, with about 70 members of the club in attendance, I realised I had a missed call from Miranda. I excused myself and called her, and found her in tears on the other end. She'd just had news that a safe with some family heirlooms and money had been broken into and been stolen. She asked me to come home. 

I told her that I would quickly give my vote and get back as soon as I could. I re-entered the debate, but by the time I was able to have my last say and actually vote on the matter it ended up being about half an hour, and then I was stuck in traffic on the way back. I arrived home to find Miranda angry at me, because I hadn't let her know when exactly I would be back and had obviously decided to put someone else above her. She refused to listen to me that night. The next day, I skipped all my classes (which for me was a big thing now with my new-found dedication to do my absolute best at uni) in order to go into every pawn shop on a list the police had given her. We tried to find any of the items that had been stolen, and ended up spending a good 6 hours driving around. I didn't mind though - this was partially me paying me penance, and also just me trying to help someone I really cared about. At the end of this she said she forgave me, that she still loved me, and that it was just a really bad moment for her.

Fast forward a few weeks. A friend of ours had just been offered a job in LA, and would be leaving soon so we had a big going away dinner. It was great fun, a tab paid for by her parents, and we continued onto a club or two later on. Inevitably, we all got hungry (dinner had been at a vegan restaurant, and whilst it was tasty it just hadn't been very filling for most of us), and so we were debating which fast food establishment nearby we should go to. Eventually it was decided to go to a popular chinese takeout place that we'd been to a million times, and so half the group headed over (it was only about 100m away, plus it had just started to rain). We got there and realised that we'd left a couple of people behind, so I went to go and grab them. 

I very clearly remember going over to the group, and the closest people happened to be James and Miranda. I said her name and went to reach for her, and James whirls around, grabs me by the shoulders and physically pushes me away. Glares at me, and then turns back to talk to her like nothing had happened, and nobody had noticed anything. As I've said he's a big guy, and I will readily admit that in that moment I was terrified of him. I honestly thought that if I went close again, he'd hit me.

My previous good mood evaporated. I turned around and left, didn't go back to the restaurant and jumped in the first cab I saw and went home. I was feeling tired and sorry for myself, and just wanted to go to bed. But within 15 minutes of me getting in bed Miranda comes home with James, and starts screaming at me for leaving her all alone in the city. Never mind that she was with our group of friends, and came home with James, I was being an asshole for leaving her without saying a word. I tried to tell her that there had been an incident with James and that I just wanted to go home, and she yelled that she didn't want to hear about my problems with him and to stop blaming her. She said that obviously I just wanted to treat her like everyone else, I obviously didn't care about her, and I should just leave her alone.

Things didn't calm down once we'd all sobered up either. The next day she accused me of being a 'words man' making big promises and never following through, and taking advantage of her mum flying me across the world on an all-expenses paid holiday. I was just like everyone else in her life, only caring about myself and using her without giving anything back. These sorts of things were all some of my deepest fears and insecurities about myself, stuff I'd confided in her, and she threw them back in my face.

Let me tell you, it hurt. Miranda at this point had become my rock, the one helping to motivate me to study properly when I got distracted, the person who said she was proud of how I was maturing and taking control of my life. Someone I dearly loved and cared for, and they were challenging some of the most important things I'd begun to believe about myself. 

I made every effort to not be at home in this time. I would go to uni in the morning, and then study and hang out with my uni friends as much as possible. There, I was full of life and happy, but at home I was miserable.

**The first Bad thing**

Then, the week after this there was an event. A class had just finished, and a couple of my friends and I (let's call them Dean, Don and Ali) stuck around to help a few people in class that had been struggling a bit. I remember leaning over to help someone at their computer, and behind me I hear a thud. I turn around, and see Don on the ground, lying on his front and appearing to have a seizure. I froze for a moment, unable to process what the fuck was going on. It took Dean beside me jumping over and starting to turn him over that spurred me into action, I moved to help him whilst shouting for Ali to go find a member of staff. We cleared the room as quick as we could whilst trying to help Don, though he quickly started foaming at the mouth and nose. It was terrifying. 

The staff arrived and someone was on the phone to the paramedics. But Don went still, and he stopped breathing. One of the staff came around and started performing compressions, whilst I used a face shield and gave him the breaths according to the instructions of the paramedic on the phone. We ended up doing that for about 10 minutes, and actually also had to use a defibrillator to restart his heart twice, until the emergency services actually arrived, and they spent a further half hour there trying to stabilise him. There were several cycles of them shocking his heart, and them frantically working around him, that's pretty much all I can really remember. Eventually, he was stable enough to move, and they took him to the ambulance.

I got to the hospital later and met his family there, and saw him lying in an induced coma. They had no idea what was wrong, and frankly he looked almost dead there with the life support machines keeping him alive. I passed out from exhaustion that night, but the next day and night were horrible. Every time I closed my eyes I'd see him there, and if I actually drifted off I'd have what can only be described as a night terror, whereby I'd be back in that computer lab but no matter what we tried, he died in my arms. It was bad.

My mate Mac (now probably my closest friend) instead came back from the party he was and spent all night awake with me so that I wouldn't fall asleep, and I really appreciated that. The next day he came up out of the coma and started on the road to recovery, which allayed most of my fears. I was able to sleep again, and in between/after classes I would cycle to the hospital and just hang out with him and our other friends, chatting about random crap and the like. He went home the next weekend and is now fine, back to being good old Don. The whole experience was horrendous, but we all got through it, and as a consequence there was this new sense of camaraderie with the group of us.

**The second Bad thing, 5 weeks later**

I still hadn't been talking to Miranda, and was spending most of my time outside of the house. I joined a charity cooking meals for homeless people, started working out more and studying harder. But one Saturday I woke up to about 7 messages on my phone from a number of friends, all saying the same thing: James had gotten physical with Miranda the night before, and was actually on the verge of suicide. He'd written a bunch of suicide letters, and it took Miranda begging for him to stay overnight to prevent him from going back to his room on campus and doing it.

I instantly decided that whatever my problems with them were, this went beyond it. I ran upstairs and offered to go grab a coffee with her, and with another housemate watching over James we left. Putting everything else behind us, we tried to figure out how to deal with this, and eventually came to the decision that we needed to get involved with the authorities of some sort, we just weren't equipped to deal with it. Whilst she went back to distract him, I started calling up whoever I could think of. The staff at the college he lived at. The psychologist on campus. They gave me the number of a hotline to call, but those people said that unless he was within 30 minutes of actually injuring himself there was nothing they could do immediately. What was worse is that they said that they could determine it by talking to him on the phone, and Miranda and I were scared because we both knew that he was a very good actor, and honestly would be very capable of convincing someone that he was alright over the phone. And then we'd be left with an angry James, one who was not afraid to get physical with both of us, and he would have been feeling betrayed by us going behind his back. 

Speaking to the same psychologist from earlier, he recommended that we should maybe get a group together to convince him that he needed to see a professional and to talk about this. So involving Mac and another friend, both who were closer to James than I was, we talked to him about it and got him to agree to a phone call with the hotline people, and then to go see a psychiatrist the next day. However, when Mac and our other friend went home, James stormed out and went back to college. We tried to talk to the staff at campus and asked them to check on him, but they insisted that they were not legally allowed to force their way into his room, and if he said he was alright they couldn't do anything. He blanketly refused to pick up the phone when called, and I eventually ended up sitting outside his room all night praying that he would still be alive in the morning. 

I'm potentially not conveying this story correctly, but at the time we truly believed that he was at a serious risk of killing himself. 

Eventually in the morning he emerged from his room, and I don't think I've ever been so relieved. Upon visiting the psychiatrist he was identified at being 'high-risk', and she told us that we'd done the right thing. It wasn't going to be easy, but at least for the moment we got through it.

**The third Bad thing, another 5 weeks on** 

Following this Miranda and I went back to way things had been in the first half of the year, and just didn't talk about the previous fight. James started seeing a psych, but after a while stopped going, but it all seemed alright for a while. However, about 3 weeks after that night I wrote about he started withdrawing from everyone he had started reaching out to, and sending Miranda messages which were along the lines of 'if you don't tell me you love me and respond right now I might not be around anymore'. It was pretty heavy stuff. Miranda came to the decision that she couldn't deal with this anymore, and pretty much cut ties to him. 

He turned to his last friend (J), who became his rock. Then disaster struck.

J was killed in a horrific attack a week later. At 21 years of age this amazing, kind person was gone.

This guy was an absolute legend. A few years younger than us, but an amazing human being. 'The lads', my group of mates who played soccer and hung out, were all very close with him. Heck, there was a period of a few weeks a few years before where J had practically lived in my room playing xbox all the time. Suffice to say that his death blew us all away, and most of all James who had been so close to him at the end especially. Miranda instantly went back to being his lifeline, and who could blame her? This was a shocking event, and really screwed a lot of us up. I'm still not over it if I'm being fully honest, and I hadn't been all that close to him in the recent year or so, only seeing him about once a fortnight if that. 

Thankfully this time James seemed to mature, and became more open with others about his problems. He opened up that he had been diagnosed with clinical depression. He stopped hiding all his secrets, and truthfully I started to respect him a bit more. This was tempered by all the pain he'd caused in over the course of the last year, but if he was sick I couldn't really blame him for it, as much as I was angry at him it wasn't totally his fault. 

I don't know if I'll ever be able to be good friends with him again, there's just been too much that's happened. But currently he's on a 60 day trip of Africa, so he's away from all of us and having fun, so hopefully he'll be better when he gets back.

**The fourth Bad thing, about 6 weeks after the last**
 
This wasn't a single event so much as a lead up to a Bad thing. 

A bit more background is required. So for the last 2 years I'd been living in a house renting with some friends, and my younger brother had been living on campus at the same place I had. Since he was ready to leave and move out, and since we both get along really well, my parents decided to buy a house for the two of us, including a room for my parents to come and stay in and one other to rent out to someone. The day we could move in was about 2 weeks before the end of the lease at the house I'd been living at the past 2 years.

This was a point of contention for my family and my housemates. A lot of the stuff at the place I'd been living (TV, BBQ, washing machine, tables, beds etc) was my family's, and they wanted it moved into our new house. My housemates, Miranda most vocal, were against this. As a compromise, I moved about half the non-essentials (TV, BBQ, one of the beds) whilst leaving stuff like the washing machine behind. This led to a lot of fights with my family, who were annoyed at me refusing to move out fully, and Miranda, who was upset at me trying to cut short the 2 years of us living together unnecessarily soon. For making my housemates have to deal with a less-than ideal situation to please my family. It was pretty miserable for me for a bit.

The person that moved into the other room was  a good friend of mine, Chris. Also pretty friendly with my brother, so a good situation for us. He was helping with moving and packing stuff, and settling into the new house. Known him for years, and at this point probably in my top 3 closest friends. 

Of course, spending time around us also meant he and Miranda spent a lot of time together. Given that we're all affectionate people, I didn't think anything of them being extra touchy-feely. In fact my brother asked me if they were a couple. My response? 'Nah, they're my two best friends, I'd know if something was going on and besides, they'd tell me'.

Later that night the truth came out. 

Intellectually, I think that I wouldn't have minded it so much. But at the time, there was one thought that was running through my mind, one which I just could not shake - this was history repeating itself, this situation led to the worst year of my life, it almost broke me but this time I don't think I'd be able to get through. I lost it. I was so terrified of this turning into the same situation again that this time I was the inconsolable one. And Miranda had a screaming match with me telling me that she regretted ever being my friend, she'll stay the fuck out of my life and never see me again.

My brother took me home and put me to bed. Great way to end my birthday.

The next day we patched things up, and continued on. But the night before, panicked about how upset I'd been and already having heard some of what had transpired over the course of the year, my brother had called my parents who were overseas. Their read on the situation was that I was in a bad way and hurting, there was no explicit need for me to be in Melbourne, so I should come back home and distance myself from the drama until things had calmed down. At this stage I was totally against it, things were fine, there was no need for me to come back early. I'd organised a trip to go and stay with Miranda's mum Mary for a week and didn't want to miss that. I still had to move out of the old house, that contentious point I'd mentioned earlier. But they were insistent that I leave the next week.

I was angry at my parents, but my father is someone who has stood by me through everything, and has never really ordered me to do anything. He has let me make my own decisions, only giving advice. But in this case, I needed to trust him and do this. 

When I broke the news, needless to say it went over badly. Miranda got very angry, and said some pretty hurtful things. This was after patching things up the day before. Again that she regrets trusting me, that I always break my word, that I have ruined any chance she had of trusting people. That I was selfish and a coward. She told me to go home and burn the birthday present she'd made me, a map with photos of our journey across Europe, because I obviously didn't give a shit about our friendship.

This hit me harder than anything previously. I retreated to the new house and felt utterly miserable. 

My dad ended up catching me at that moment, at a very low point, and booked me a ticket to leave that night. There were people in Melbourne that would handle moving my stuff out, the best thing I should do was just get the hell out of there. My younger brother drove me to the previous house, and I started gathering my passport and some clothes. Miranda tried to say that she loved me and that she was just upset, but got angry again when I was packing my stuff. It took a family friend to drag me away from there, and convince me that I should listen to my parents and get on this flight, as opposed to 'missing it' as Miranda was trying to convince me to do. 

She called me when I was at the airport. She said she hated me, my friends all hated me and her mum hates me. To never talk to her again. I found out she ripped down all the photos I placed up on my walls, ones from our time in Europe, and tore them into pieces.

I arrived back where my parents live, and have been here about 10 days now. I'm incredibly confused about what the fuck has happened. I've deleted my facebook for awhile because she and some of her friends started sending me abusive messages via that. She has sent me multiple ones on Whatsapp too, and honestly I'm anxious to check my phone each morning in case there's another message there. The ones sent alternate between trying to guilt-trip me and telling me what a horrible person I am, and with this coming from the person I've come to trust the most it's really affecting my self-image.

My younger brother has been a champion in all this, working with out family friend to move all my crap into the new house. Something which I should have taken care of before, but hadn't in order to keep Miranda happy.

My parents are supportive of me, but their frank observation is that I'm obsessed with her. And I know that I've again damaged their trust in me, something that I've worked so hard to regain since my university fiascos of the previous years.

I'm spending time with old friends and playing with my dog as much as possible, exercising and cooking and watching sport. I'm trying to figure out what's going on in my life.

I think I still love her, but I honestly don't know. I don't know what sort of reception I'm going to receive when I go back to Melbourne for the new uni year. 

2013 wasn't a great year but it ended on a positive note. 2014 started brilliantly, has had some bright spots, but overall has gotten steadily worse.

I don't think I'm, depressed or anything like that, I'd just say confused. I feel like a silly child instead of the mature adult I thought I was becoming.

I have no idea what I'm expecting from any of this. Looking at the clock I realise that I've been typing this out for almost 4 hours, and it does feel like a weight is off my chest. There's a lot to be said for the safety anonymity gives you. My current plan is to enjoy this time of year with family and friends, and try to sort out my feelings. A part of me is still hoping that this is just an overreaction and she will just calm down, but with every message sent that part gets quieter. 

I've only started using reddit regularly since I arrived here 10 days ago, and this place is a great/interesting distraction.

If you read this all the way, all I can say is thank you."

AMA,Famicoman,Drexel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drexel/comments/2ps7bo/iama_drexel_alumnus_who_now_gives_coop_interviews/,"Hey all, I graduated this year from Drexel as a software engineer. After graduation, I became employed in the same department that I worked in for my third co-op and am now a part of the hiring process for Drexel co-ops as well as interns from Villanova, UPenn, and SJU. I've been involved in interviewing new co-ops across my second and third co-op as well, and have also gone on my fair share of interviews from the incredibly technical to ones where we barely talk about any sort of specific skills.  

Now that we're into A-round and I've been giving interviews over the last two weeks, I thought I would open things up to answer any questions you may have about the other side of the conference table and offer my perspective on the whole process. So, feel free to ask me anything!"
2psdjc,9,2014-12-19,Launch planning,[deleted],LawFirm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/2psdjc/launch_planning/,"I enjoyed the monthly updates that another user posted here, so I am going to try something similar. I'll also use this to help me flesh out my plans. I don't take possession of my office till January, so I hope to be up and running by mid January.

Recurring budget items so far:

1. Office: $175 month to month.
2. Utilities: approx $30 per month.
3. Efax: SFaxme $36 one time fee for a toll free number and 150 faxes that don't expire. Will go to monthly plan if I actually end up using faxes.
4. Phone: Google voice number $0!
5. Email: Google apps $5 per month.
6. Website hosting: $22 per year on dreamhost with a promo I found. 
7. Website registration: approx $15 per year on gandi.net.

Other expenses:

1. Business signs for front and rear of my building ? waiting on quote.
2. Premium wordpress theme: $50 
3. Business cards: designed some at vista print, but haven't decided yet.
4. Computer: re-purposing my one year old MacBook Pro.
5. Scanner &amp; Printer: I can use my home office one for now, but I plan on getting better ones soon. 
6. Office furniture: My wife's new office was already furnished, so I have some of her old stuff, but I still need to get a desk. I plan on scouring craigslist and thrift stores during the holidays. I'm pretty good with refinishing furniture, so I'm hoping to find some giant bulky antique desk that has character. 


To do: 

1. Walk across the street from my house and get town business permit.
2. Establish operating and IOLTA account. 
2a: Flat fees: I'm leaning towards flat fees to limit trust issues and simplify bookkeeping. This shouldn't be too much of an issue with misdemeanors since they aren't that complicated.
2b. Credit cards: I think at this point I may avoid them due to the trust account issues, at least till I figure everything out. There is an ATM outside my building, so clients could always get a cash advance. 
3. Malpractice.... I may wait on this, I plan on only practicing misdemeanor criminal law for a bit, which I have some experience in (prosecuted a dozen bench trials as 3L intern and defended kids in juvenile court for a year in my school clinic).
4. Networking: 
4a.Town historical society has already offered to make up flyers for me and take them around to all the local businesses. 
4b. An attorney who just wound down her practice has offered to help me, so i need to get up with her, even though I am not really interested in her practice area (trust and estates). 
4c. My wife has about 10% of the county following one of her facebook accounts, so I might see if I can get worked into one of her post somehow. This is a small town, so it really isn't that many people.
4d. Sidenote: there are three law offices in my town. One is completely shut down (the attorney above), one is partially retired (he just dropped criminal law and is now only practicing trust and estates by appointment only from what I've been told), and a husband and wife firm (the husband was recently disbarred due to something that sent him to jail for a bit, but still works there doing something). 

Note: I""m not done typing this all out, but I have to run an errand so I'll come back to this.

2psfjc,5,2014-12-19,Expedition Leader Quietuus's Log: Hematite-Sandstone 250,Quietuus,UshulAnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/UshulAnor/comments/2psfjc/expedition_leader_quietuuss_log_hematitesandstone/,"**1st Hematite**

It is the first day of Summer. The heat on the outside of the mountain we have named The Fire of Flames is unbearable, and with the heat of the world’s blood coursing behind our walls, things are not too much cooler in the depths of the earth!

Work helps distract the dwarven mind, and whilst I begin toiling on the magma forges, Lolor-Arros has drawn up a new set of plans for an industrial and storage area, spread over four levels to make the best use of the limited space in the mountain: [Level 1](http://i.imgur.com/qN5kK0F.jpg), [Level 2](http://i.imgur.com/0RIxgIL.jpg), [Level 3](http://i.imgur.com/5ogFO1e.jpg), [Level 4](http://i.imgur.com/evWA9Dn.jpg). There will be much sweat dripping from my beard to the glory of Risen and Avuz this summer!

**8th Hematite**

The Fortress records are in complete disarray. I decide to put my experience as a broker’s intern back in the mountainhomes to good use and [appoint myself to the offices of Broker, Bookkeeper and Manager](http://i.imgur.com/YF5sMKv.jpg).

I almost immediately [become acutely aware that we have no desks](http://i.imgur.com/Gnk3RVt.jpg). 

**2nd Malachite**

Mtwara and I have hewed the rock tirelessly. Quarters and an office befitting my new station have been planned, but other work must progress first. I have become aware, when considering the nature of the broker’s duties, that we have neglected to design or construct a trade depot. I rectify the situation, and [begin excavations immediately](http://i.imgur.com/nbxBEnW.jpg).

**6th Malachite**

Sepik121 has returned with tumultuous news! She was hacking at the corpse of a tree on the south-west slope when, through the heat haze, she saw a strange movement. Axe ready, she approached the threat, ready to kill and die for the glory of Gikensedil Nobangudosvim Durad…only to be greeted by a cheery wave and familiar words of Dwarvish greeting!

Migrants from the Mountainhomes! I put on my best socks and rush to offer greetings and libations of dwarven ale.

Our newcomers are [‘Clockwork-Lime’ Girdergem](http://i.imgur.com/vO86WSs.jpg), a [fisherdwarf](http://i.imgur.com/agVPll4.jpg), and [‘kutuzof’ Oarfloor](http://i.imgur.com/4QqLSVV.jpg), a [tree-slayer and cloth-weaver](http://i.imgur.com/dMUWSd3.jpg). They seem like a bit of an odd couple to me, but they have six children, so *something* must be working out. They have left their extended family behind to journey here, as we all have, but hope some of their offspring might join them, when word of this place spreads.

Both take some time to admire the molten lake, before I persuade them to retire, for fear of magma crabs.


**18th Malachite**

I have ordered [the workshops on the surface deconstructed](http://i.imgur.com/nug7Vte.jpg). We are almost ready to move our industries and stockpiles safely underground.

**21st Malachite**

[The trade depot is complete](http://i.imgur.com/UYJJDiN.jpg)! I order kinderdemon to immediately begin work on smoothing the floor and walls, whilst Lolor-Arros begins working on a bridge and the mechanisms to raise and lower it; the trade depot is our face to the world, and must be as beautiful as it is well defended.


**25th Malachite**

Faydh has finally got around to building the still, kitchen and other buildings; only to discover that the andesite blocks earmarked for the project have been moved. [Faydh immediately tipped over the scaffolding and goes off to have a drink.](http://i.imgur.com/nhipGB5.jpg) I am notably displeased! The constructions have been ordered again, and hopefully there will be less recalcitrance this time!

**15th Galena**

The workshops for wood based industries, the carpenters and the wood-burners shop, [have been constructed and their immediate stockpiles are starting to be filled](http://i.imgur.com/bPkkfy4.jpg). The third chamber on this level might be used perhaps for an ashery, once need arises for it, or perhaps a bowyers.

**24th Galena**

The new masons, mechanics and craft shops [have been constructed, and granted appropriate stockpiles](http://i.imgur.com/JliDhbR.jpg). A large central stone stockpile on the lower level will feed these workshops, whilst a wood stockpile on the upper level will receive logs before passing them down.

**1st Limestone**

Autumn has arrived. [We celebrate with the slaughtering of a buffalo cow!](http://i.imgur.com/gMINpmF.jpg)

**8th Limestone**

Clockwork-Lime has managed to locate [a dismal, brackish pool on the lower slopes of the mountain](http://i.imgur.com/JBs4Mzl.jpg). After a month of the most careful and skilled work with rod, net, beard-lures and his bare hands, he has sadly come to the conclusion that [it contains no fish](http://i.imgur.com/X0YCQSe.jpg).

Seeing as fish are water-food, and plants and meat are not-water-food, I consider that re-assigning him to assist faydh may be the best course for the moment.

**9th Limestone**

The trade depot was completed just in time. Look-outs have spotted the long-awaited sight of a trade caravan, sunlight glinting from the iron weapons of the guards and the brass traces of the camels is seen across the Scalding Hills long before we hear the merry jingling and jovial swearing of honest dwarven traders.

I meet with our assigned outpost liaison. [Zefon Dearthhandle](http://i.imgur.com/l9HjDFT.jpg) is pleasant enough, though I can see she is somewhat displeased by the relatively poor showing of stone trade goods we haul out to the depot. Seven-Force says she saw her make the pinch-coin sign of Osram to one of the merchants, perhaps explaining her displeasure. This is her first expedition after being appointed to the post, and her tithe to the Golden Temple will be small indeed.

We manage to assemble about 140 gold coins worth of merchandise, and after some negotiation we are able to exchange it for some items of greater immediate value; barrels of booze, some meat and fish and vegetables, cloth and thread and a few buckets. The exchange of goods is complicated enormously by our failure so far to build any bins. Now the finished goods stockpile has been completed underground, I order Sepik 121 to get right on it.

**15th Limestone**

Over the last few days, I have hashed out a trade agreement with Zefon in a series of meetings. I have requested that the next caravan heap on us the great necessities of dwarven existence; steel bars, alcohol and plump helmet spawn for the farm  I hope to establish before spring. Zefon agrees to all of it, and tells me the goods that are most demanded in the Mountainhomes: [Seeds, backpacks and windows.](http://i.imgur.com/jRUYSzA.jpg)

I do not understand macroeconomics.

**9th Sandstone**

[A ghastly foetid smell is emanating from the butcher’s](http://i.imgur.com/tVvKNi6.jpg). On inspecting it I find it is piled high with rotten cuts of meat and bones that have been improperly stored or disposed of. I immediately order a refuse pile constructed, with a vent to the surface to dispel foul odours and a sturdy wall extending from the one being built to protect the stairtop to defend it.


**13th Sandstone**

[Sepik121 is knocking it out the fucking dwarfball court](http://i.imgur.com/vUZjCFE.jpg). Kinderdemon has just about finished smoothing the depot (just in time for the traders to leave) and has begun smoothing the magma chambers. Some have decried it as not necessary, but the thought of rough stone down there, unsmoothable for all eternity, bathed with the fire of the core, distresses me so. 

**20th Sandstone**

With the recent lull in mining activities, and the finishing of the construction of the new workshops, mtwara and Lolor-Arros have been sitting rather idle. I assign both of them to supplementary duty as masons. After all, a chisel is a baby pick, surely, and why should not one who carves such exquisite gears from the stone not carve handsome chairs and sturdy blocks? I order the remaining workshop cell filled with another masons shop, this time I order the stockpile around it to be filled only with minerals known not to melt in magma. We will have need of grates and floodgates soon, and mechanisms to control them.

**27th Sandstone**

2psmvm,18,2014-12-19,She decided to travel instead of being with me.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2psmvm/she_decided_to_travel_instead_of_being_with_me/,"Hi everyone,

This is the first time that I post here but I've been following this subreddit for a while now. I just wanted to vent my story here because I think you guys can better relate to it than my friends can. So here it goes.

My girlfriend [f/22] is Brazilian and I [m/25] am Belgian. We met back in January while traveling in Canada. We met at a party of a mutual friend and things took off from there. It was amazing, we travelled together and had so much fun. I came out of a pretty rough breakup before, and she made me feel something I hadn't felt in a long time. 

When the time came to say goodbye, we both cried a lot and promised we'd try to see each other again and keep contact. We did keep contact and we got to know each other so much better through these last months. We started to make the wildest plans of being together again, like her doing an internship in Belgium and me taking Portuguese lessons at her university. Somewhere during the summer she suddenly told me that the pressure of having everything arranged is scaring her. She didn't want to think years ahead, worrying about money and if we'd be able to make it. I agreed and we decided that we would take it slowly and just enjoy the ride, as not to put pressure on our shoulders. 

Everything went great after that. Her sister studies in Europe, so she decided that she could go visit her sister and visit me at the same time. We were super excited that it would finally happen. She'd have Christmas with her sister, then spend 10 days with me in Belgium before flying back.

We got excited, made plans. Told each other ""I love you"", which we wanted to wait for but we got carried away. 

Now that we're two weeks away from meeting, she suddenly told me that she'd spend 5 extra days with her sister traveling in Europe. Cutting the time we have together in half. I was really upset. For months we've been looking forward to this point and suddenly she makes this decision. I asked her if she still wanted me to go to Brazil to study at her university. She said I probably shouldn't go for a whole semester, but she'd like to see me. She told me that being at my place, with my family and friends is overwhelming to her and she'd rather take it slow again.

I understand her. I try to be happy for her opportunity to travel some more in Europe. But I'm so incredibly disappointed and insecure about where we stand. I've been looking forward to this moment for so long and now I don't really know how things will be when we meet again. We both imagined some dramatic romantic swoop and kisses. I'm not so sure anymore and I don't want to ruin the little time we have together. I dread the talk we'll eventually need to have before she leaves again.

So far for my venting. You're very brave if you read through all that.

TL;DR: Haven't seen girlfriend in 9 months. We finally get to meet first the first time, we have 10 days together. Being in my house, with my family and friends after not seeing each other for 9 months suddenly stresses her out and she decides to only stay 5 days and travel with her sister instead. We only have 2 days alone, without her sister there. I'm really disappointed."

Sproles (two) can become the Eagles franchise leader in punt return touchdowns in a single season with his next return for a score.|
With his next sack, OLB **Connor Barwin** (14.5) will pass Hugh Douglas and Reggie White (15.0 in 2000 &amp; 1991 respectively) and move into a tie with Clyde Simmons (15.5 in 1989) for the seventh-highest single-season sack total in Eagles history. With 1.5 more sacks, Barwin can tie Greg Brown (16.0 in 1984) for sixth place in team history.

**Little background:** I am 20, self-studying Computer Science studying from home by myself using books/internet. I study from home because I think college is a wastage of time and I don't believe in degree. USA is my dream country and its my biggest wish to move there. I currently live in a very conservative country and I have never been to any foreign country even as tourist

I want to have a foreign internship in USA in summer 2015 but I am not getting any job because I am foreign and most company don't want to do visa paperwork for an intern. I am good academically for the record. Other option is moving there on a tourist visa but I am going to do there all the time without a job?

Since I will never have a degree so the only way for me to become US citizen is by marrying a US citizen. But how can I find a soul mate in few months on a tourist visa. Other than this my verbal English is not good too. Although I am strictly against sham marriage but still I feel immoral to fall in love with american women with citizenship as one of the incentive to marry her. I'm sure nobody want to date a guy who is only for few months because people needs time to determine if the other person is their soul mate and few months are very less. Other than this if anything goes bad after marriage, I don't want to blamed that I used her.

Also since I am still studying, I want to marry after getting a job. But it is not possible to get a job in USA until I am married because of visa rules.

Other than this since I live in a conservative country, there is nothing like dating. There are only arranged marriage that will happen after your life is settled. Honestly I don't want to have arranged marriage. I want to marry the girl I love. Other than this I am virgin and I don't know when it is going to change

To make it worse currently I badly want someone special in my life right now. I badly missing a girlfriend in my life. I badly need an emotional connection. And this is not possible where I live.

I am really confused what to do in upcoming months"

2ptllb,2,2014-12-19,Need some advice with Girlfriend,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2ptllb/need_some_advice_with_girlfriend/,"My girlfriend has recently changed into a whole new person. She has suddenly become a devote Catholic and is trying to change her whole life. She no longer believes in sex before marriage and is angry all time. Her sudden change came out of no where and I was told all this via text message.

Last night she sent me a long text stating something she really didn't like in me. She essentially called me cheap. I was lucky enough to have a high paying internship over the summer, so I saved up a lot money, but 80% of all the money I made had to go into a new car so I was left with some spending money of my own.

At least 3-4 times a week, I cook dinner for my girlfriend because she is often over my apartment at night. A couple times a month I take us out places and pay for her, but the other times we do stuff, we split it. She cited one night where I took her out to a steak dinner (which I paid for), then we went out to a maize which was $3 so we both paid, then we went to a party where I paid for all the alcohol. She complained that I did not pay for her ticket to the maize. 

Another night we went out to look at christmas lights and she was feeling ill so I stopped and picked up some food. I asked her if she was hungry but she said she was not feeling good so no. I ordered my food and she ended up eating some of it, but then in the text she said I was rude in not buying her dinner. 

Whenever we go on trips or I drive her somewhere, I never ask her to pay for gas. She doesn't have a car so often I am picking her up and driving her places on my own dime. 

When she called me cheap, it really angered me because I now feel like all the stuff I do for her goes unappreciated. I have no idea what to do because she is only making me mad lately and I rarely ever get mad or let things bother me. My money is mine, and I don't care if she says her friend's boyfriends pay for everything, I just cant afford to do that. I need my own spending money for my own hobbies. 

tl;dr Girlfriend called me cheap. I take her out occasionally and pay and make her dinner frequently which goes unappreciated. 

EDIT: Should also add I bought her a $200 necklace for christmas "

Like the title says, I was accepted into the honors college. Umass was pretty low on my list at the beginning of my college search, but now seeing how cheap it would be for me to go there, it is becoming more of a possibility. I have some basic questions.

How much harder is it in the honors college?

Is there more support for the kids, like math and writing help more geared towards the honors classes?

How many of the classes are mixed up with nonhonors and honors kids, or is it a majority of only honors kids?

Are the dorms really that much better? (I haven't visited the campus, only seen pictures)

Are there more opportunities for internships and research?

Is it easy to study abroad, or does the course load make it more difficult?

What is campus life like in general? Is the CHC life any different?

2pu1lz,1,2014-12-19,I don't know what to do,xx2f,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2pu1lz/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I don't know how to start this. It's about my girlfriend. 

We dated in highschool for about a year and a half. We went to college this fall, separate colleges. We agreed that we were going to try the whole, ""date other people,"" thing. That didn't work at all. She kissed a few girls and I kissed one at my school. Whatever the case, we didn't enjoy being with other people. It slowly destroyed us. We used to text a ton, but we were only texting once a week at that point. I became depressed. By 'depressed' I mean, not formally diagnosed, but I stopped eating, drank, used drugs, etc. I ended up in the hospital due to some of the side effects of those substances. While in the hospital, I texted her and we were talking for the first time in weeks. It eventually came up that I was in the hospital and that wasn't a good sign. She was super concerned. So concerned that we began talking again.

It was like old times. We texted everyday and talked like we used to. I can't even explain the joy I felt from it. We went home for Thanksgiving break and we knew that we wanted to be in a relationship. However, we went back to our schools without becoming official. She said she was too busy. We texted back and forth during this time and she eventually stopped texting again. 

I met up with her when I returned from college (5 days ago). We ended up in the park talking about our experiences. She also fell into a depression after we broke up. She spent most of her time doing drugs or drinking as well. We both agreed this wasn't working. We had a few options: try long distance, keep doing this limbo-thing, sever all contact forever, stop talking until after college. 

We both ended up crying in the car and hugging each other. We didn't want it to be over. That was horrendous. We texted later in the day, talking about what we should do. Long distance would be hard. She's in Philadelphia PA and I'm in Keene NH. Neither of us have a car and there's also the issue of free time. 

I met up with her today. We decided that we want to try long distance. This is after she told me all about her situation and why she didn't want to try it. After she explained it, I remained calm and said it could work. I'm not calm. I'm freaking the fuck out.

She's taking 7 classes at her school that go from 8AM to 9PM. She has a job that usually goes from 10PM to 4AM, sometimes it goes until 7AM. She's the manager of a failing business so she's coordinating with the city to get the restaurant the liquor license because the owner doesn't speak English. She also has class on Saturday. Every other Sunday she has mandatory community service for 6 hours. This is on top of all of her homework. Also, since she's studying to become a doctor, she has to do clinicals (not sure exactly what they are, but she has to do 5 a month, she said they would each take a day). In addition she has to prepare her resumé and send it to everywhere that's accepting an internship. She has to work with the Co-op (internship place that will find one for her so she has 10+ interviews a month until she gets hired). 

I have 4 classes. I go to school 4 days a week. I only have a total of 20 hours of school per week. I have a lot of free time. I don't even have a job. All of that free time leaves me thinking about her and that leads to poor decisions. It leads to me getting suspicious and worried about her at the same time. 

We talked about what we wanted to do. She wants to try and make it work, but she was super hesitant. She doesn't think she can do it. She ended up not going to classes for 2 weeks last semester due to a breakdown from stress. If everything goes perfectly for her and she gets everything done, she said that I can visit in March. 

March. That's 3 months away. What the hell am I supposed to do? She said that she was going to try and call as much as possible, but she won't be able to everyday (her words). Even if we do call, it will be in the 5 minutes that she walks to her next class. So, there's no skype, barely and phone calls, and texting will be scarce. Last semester she was bad with texting because she didn't know what we were anymore (relationship or not), but this semester her workload is worse so she isn't optimistic that she'll have time to talk to me. 

Part of the relationship is that she can decide it's too much for her. She is allowed to say that the guilt of not being there for me, is getting to her. She has an incredibly guilty conscience so she feels awful for not being in the picture as much as she should. So, she can call it off if it becomes too intense. 

So there's also things that don't go into the paragraphs that are important. She's also got an apartment in Philadelphia already for next semester. I can't visit when she's got classes because I am required to be with her when I visit. I can't go into her classes because I don't have keycard access (it's in the city, so there's a guard at every entrance). So, visiting will be extremely difficult. It will have to be a Saturday-Sunday when she doesnt have community service (i can't be alone in her dorm) and when she's finished all her schoolwork.

So, that's where I am. Writing it down didn't help much. At least I can read it all in one place now.

Maxwell doesn't need a weapon. Maxwell is the weapon. On a more serious note, Maxwell wears black gloves with kevlar inside of them, in addition to black wraps underneath the gloves for protection for his hands so he doesn't get hurt by just punching enemies. In a pinch, blocking with his gloves getting stricken would likely hurt less than his face, but his gloves don't provide enough defense to make note of any stat changes.

- **Semblance/Aura:**											
Maxwell's semblance is ""Aura Interfacing"". Maxwell can repair allies' aura at the cost of his own. In combat, using this ability drains 1 aura point from Maxwell and repairs 1 aura point to an ally.

- **Backstory:**											
Maxwell had always wanted to be a doctor. A doctor of any kind, it didn't matter to him. He just wanted to save lives, to see people reunited with their families and to be recognized among the few he could save as a hero. Maxwell studied medicine for 3 years, took internships whenever he could at various hospitals, and always seemed to know exactly what to do to make others well in the most efficient ways possible. This was until he was attacked by a beowulf one day on his way back from school at the age of 15. He was taking a usual shortcut through a small grove, when the beowulf appeared suddenly out of the vegetation. The beowulf lunged at him, but he sidestepped out of pure adrenaline. Maxwell, unarmed and afraid of the lone Grimm before him, took a step back, anticipating that the beowulf would lunge again. The beowulf leapt with its mouth gaping and its arms outstretched. Maxwell clenched his right hand into a fist and with all of his strength hooked the beowulf in the eye, knocking it to the left and sending it whimpering back into the forest with one eye less. He ran out of the grove and sat down on a bench near a sidewalk. After the hype of the moment had worn off and Maxwell caught his breath, something struck his mind. Maxwell ran back to his house, throwing his backpack against the wall and bringing his computer to life. 40,000 people died every year of attacks by Grimm. It was in these few minutes that Maxwell had to make a decision. Save one person in an operating room, or save hundreds on the battlefield by fixing his allies and preventing the Grimm from doing harm. Maxwell chose the latter. Knowing that his parents would never let him own a weapon, Maxwell trained with only his fists every day, looking up tutorials on various boxing moves after school, becoming extremely proficient in unarmed combat. When he was 17, he applied and was accepted into Beacon, the world's best school of Hunters, Maxwell's new desired role. Despite his parents' dislike for Maxwell's decision to put his life on the line for others, his mind was set. He would be the best brawler medic this world had ever seen.

""No. He was waiting for me to finish messing with the emitters."" He frowned. ""Sorry."" 

Erica ran her hands through her hair again, unnerved by how short it was. It had been since her sophomore year of college that her hair had been this short. ""It's okay,"" she replied. ""It's not like I'm going to see him out here anyways."" 

""Yeah,"" Colin agreed, unsure of exactly what to say. There were a few more moments of awkward silence, before Colin finally said, ""Okay, let's give those emitters a try. The sooner you're in, the sooner you're out."" 

Erica had been thinking the same thing. But, as she'd expected, covering herself for even such a brief period of time made it that much harder to shed the towel. Swallowing hard, she unwrapped the small towel and tossed it towards the lockers, watching it drop to the floor of the Observation Room. She stepped completely naked back into her prison. 

""Oh, wow,"" Erica offered as she caught sight of her reflection in the Bullpen's mirror glass. The door rolled into place behind her. ""Not bad at all."" 

Would it have been a haircut that Erica picked out for herself? No.

Was it uneven in places? Of course.

Was Colin going to win a hairdressing award? Of course not.

But short as it was, as quickly as it had been done, Erica had to admit that her new look wasn't all that bad. Gone were the long strands of black hair hanging alluringly down past her shoulder blades. But her hair was still longer than she'd expected it to be, falling cutely past her ears and nicely framing her face. 

In fact, Erica was still taking in her new haircut when Colin called through the intercom, ""Perfect!"" 

""Yeah?"" 

""Yup. Absolutely no problem with the emitters."" 

""Which means I can use the projector, right?"" Erica asked. Her first three hours in the Bullpen had been excruciating, not just because of the nudity, but because of the absolute boredom. Having had nothing to do, all Erica had been able to think about was the fact that she was naked, and that people were looking at her through the walls of the Bullpen. All that she'd been able to do was stare at her own naked body in the mirror glass across the room. 

She was answered by a flickering on the wall furthest from the ops desk, as the projector came to life. Unfortunately, the image that greeted her was that of the ops desk camera, with Colin leering into the Bullpen. Suddenly, the distance between ""here"" and ""there"" seemed infinitely smaller, and the idea that there were people looking at her body from ""out there"" began to conflict with the presence of Colin's image ""in here."" Of course, so long as Colin was staring into the camera at the desk, it meant that he wasn't staring out across the Observation Room and into the Bullpen through the wall. 

""Well, it's three thirty now,"" the technician announced. ""Anything on TV that you're jonesing to see on a Monday afternoon?"" 

""Just whatever you have for a DVD out there is fine,"" Erica replied. She didn't want to do work. She didn't want to think about her situation. She just wanted to sit back and vegetate in front of a movie, getting her mind off of the past three hours and the upcoming five weeks. And so, as Noah returned and helped Colin adjust the measurements that the Humane Hormone Lab needed, Erica sat on the floor of the Bullpen watching ""Ocean's 11."" 

***

It was only a few hours later when Erica felt as if she needed to use the bathroom. Colin was still on duty, though Noah had come and gone by that point. Erica couldn't bring herself to ask the man for the toilet, though, preferring to wait for him to leave and for Wendy Milne to take over. It was silly, and childish - Erica would eventually have to use the bathroom while Colin was on duty. But she excused herself from this embarrassment on her first day. After all, she'd debased herself enough in front of him for the first day. 

But by six, after she'd moved onto her second movie, after the emitters had all been adjusted, and after both Colin and Noah had gone home for the night, Erica decided that it was time to bite the bullet. After all, she'd been in the Bullpen for six hours at that point. 

""Wendy?"" Erica asked as she stood, visibly blushing from head to toe. 

Erica had met Wendy countless of times before. They weren't friends, but it wasn't as if they had a bad relationship at all. The black-haired biochemist had her work, and the pierced and tattooed, peroxide-blonde technician had hers. They had little in common, but it never ceased to amaze Erica how open the girl had always been with her. Within hours of their first meeting, back during the primate trials, Wendy had begun talking about her menstrual cycle, her clitoral piercing, and the size of her ex-boyfriend's penis. Erica was completely buttoned-up and tight-lipped, conservative when it came to sex, or talking about sex. Wendy, though, didn't have the same hang-ups, and didn't seem capable of being embarrassed. 

The blonde girl was certainly not going to understand the level of humiliation that asking for the toilet was going to bring to Erica.

""Yup?"" 

""Do you think I could use the bathroom?"" 

""The toilet, yeah,"" Wendy replied. Within seconds, the toilet had emerged from the wall. There was no toilet seat, just porcelain all the way around. 

The room was large and open, making Erica feel uncomfortable about her lack of privacy. Of course, there was no one in the Bullpen with her, and she couldn't see out beyond the glass wall. 

But she knew that Wendy was out there, watching her urinate. She knew that she was being recorded as she did so, making her humiliation something that would stand the test of time. Still, she sat, she peed, and she asked Wendy to retract the toilet into the wall. 

""I bet that must get old,"" Erica said aloud. ""Opening and closing the toilet all the time."" 

""Well, I mean, it's different with the men,"" Wendy replied casually. 

Erica wasn't quite sure what Wendy was getting at. Men needed to use the bathroom just as much as women. How was it different? That she wasn't peeing while standing up?

""The men have, in the past, just pissed in the shower drain,"" the female technician replied. She then added, ""But don't worry, that place has been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected like seven or eight times over. Colin's been making us scrub up in there for the better part of two weeks."" 

Erica wasn't terribly concerned about the sanitation issue. After all, this room had hosted scores of chimps and orangutans over the years, and Erica knew from experience that peeing the shower drain was a lot cleanlier than some of the things she'd seen the apes do. 

What concerned her, though, was the fact that she was being treated differently than the men who had come before her. That she, as a subject, required extra work on the part of the technicians who watched over her. The thought made the girl uncomfortable. 

So uncomfortable, in fact, that it festered over the next few hours. Erica was watching ""Doc Hollywood,"" but had a hard time concentrating. She'd been stripped naked. She'd been locked inside a box. She'd been given a forced haircut. And she'd urinated in front of another woman, as well as literally hundreds of little recording devices. But yet, she was concerned about the added effort that she, as a woman, required on the part of the Bullpen staff. No, it wasn't much work, but it seemed as if, given the choice between a male test subject and a female test subject, they would go with a male subject every time. 

Maybe it had more to do with the fact that the technical staff was more men than women, that sexual harassment concerns were lessened with a naked man instead of a naked woman. But Erica didn't want yet another reason to choose a man for research over a woman.

Could she use the drain? Could she bring herself to squat over the shower and relieve herself that way? Certainly, it was humiliating, but was it really that much more humiliating than sitting on the toilet bowl? Was it more humiliating than asking the technicians for the toilet, and then asking them to flush it when she was done?

It was around ten o'clock that evening that Erica felt the urge to go again. 

And, instead of requesting the toilet from Wendy, she simply crouched down over the shower drain. In the reflection across from her, Erica could see that she was blushing badly, embarrassed about what she was doing. 

Thankfully, Wendy didn't say a thing, as Erica had feared she would. The embarrassment was excruciating, and she didn't want to talk about it. Maybe Wendy mentioned it to the other technicians, maybe she didn't. But Pete Bowie never brought it up, nor did his intern Tessa Romero during their shift afterwards. Colin never mentioned it once. For the next five weeks, it was just accepted that Erica would be using the drain at the corner of the Bullpen, and no one acknowledged this development. It just was. 

That first night, falling asleep was difficult. None of the male subjects who had come before her had been particularly thrilled at the prospects of sleeping on the hard, white floor of the Bullpen, and Erica herself hadn't been looking forward to it. She tried sleeping on her left side, on her right side, and on her back, but she simply couldn't get comfortable. Even a pillow would have been a godsend. 

But it wasn't so much the floor that kept Erica awake, no matter how ungiving it was. Rather, it was her own mind. She was still very much aware of her own nudity, as she had been all day, and aware that right at that moment, there was a woman on the other side of the wall watching her. In a few hours, Wendy would be replaced by another male technician and his female intern. Eight hours after that, it would be Tuesday morning, Colin would return, and the staff at Connecticut Pharmaceuticals would begin their day, breezing in and out of the Observation Room. 

Each one of them was going to see her bare body. Each one of them was going to watch her shower in the nude, watch her work in the nude, watch her urinate in the nude. She had worked hard to gain the respect of her colleagues, and she couldn't help feeling that she was flushing it all away. Would they see her as Ph.D. that she was? Or would they see her as a sexual object, a naked girl to watch for their own amusement? She had gone from being biochemist Erica Rivers to peep-show girl Erica Rivers in no time at all. 

It would be a long night. 

It would be a long five weeks.

She was in a zoo. 

Homo sapiens sapiens, female. Twenty-nine years old. Black hair. 5'7"". 127 pounds. Native land: Central Ohio.

She was still in a cage, locked behind glass in a ridiculous diorama of her ""natural habitat"" – a pink, dollhouse-esque bedroom, complete with a pink canopy bed, pink furniture, and pink wallpaper. Pink-framed photographs and paintings hung on the three opaque walls, each piece of art instilled with a pink hue. Her bed was covered in pink blankets and sheets, each a slightly varied shade of pink. And, as Erica picked herself up off the floor of her new habitat, she noticed that the hard metal/linoleum of the Bullpen floor had been traded for thick, pink, shag carpet. 

Erica was confused, mystified as to how she had been transported out of ConnPharm without waking. Had there been a sedative in Hannah's needle? Had the whole deuterotone experiment been nothing more than a chance for Bill Forrester or Jake Rinaldi to sell her into white slavery? 

But, perhaps more horrifying than the fact that she had been transported out of the Bullpen was her new audience. They were lined up on the far side of her glass wall – old men with canes, overweight mothers with cameras, dads in Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts, little boys with their mouth agape, little girls staring in with casual disinterest. There was a field trip – thirty to forty second-graders staring in at her with their sixty-something-year-old teacher while their tour guide prattled on about the human female. 

""….entertains herself by shopping for shoes, eating ice cream, and reading trashy magazines,"" the tour guide explained, gesturing towards Erica's body. Erica rubbed her eyes, not believing what she saw – the guide was none other than her own mother. 

""Mom!"" Erica screamed, tears beginning to form at the corners of her eyes. ""Mom! Where am I? Mom?!! Let me out!""

Karen Rivers seemed unable to hear the pleas of her daughter, and continued to speak to her tour group. ""Now, the human female's lifespan is close to seventy-six years, but she is only fertile from approximately the age of fifteen until around the time she is forty years old, meaning this particular animal in front of you has already lost out on half of her child-bearing years.""

Erica watched as some of the mothers on the far side of the glass shook their heads in disappointment, while her own mother continued to ignore Erica's crying. 

""Now,"" Karen began, with a finger in the air, ""the common misconception is that the human female reaches her sexual peak long after the human male."" She paused, and then, with eyebrows raised, continued, ""This is a myth. In fact, if we were to measure hormone production, males and females of this species reach their heights of arousal at roughly the same age. However, based on pressures and influences of their society, the North American female does not reach true sexual SATISFACTION until her thirties.""

""Is that why this one hasn't had a baby yet?"" asked a young, blonde pigtailed little girl. 

""Well, there are a number of factors,"" Karen responded. ""The first of which is probably dissatisfaction with her personal appearance – she is uncomfortable in her own body.""

Erica was taken aback by this analysis by her mother. Her mother was dead on, of course, about Erica's image of herself. She was too tall. Her breasts were too small. She had a hideous birthmark on her ass. Her fingers were too long and narrow, her thighs carrying just a little too much weight. Any of the visitors peering in at Erica would have described her as a complete knockout, but Erica doubted herself. And anyways, she had always been far more concerned with science to worry for very long over her appearance. 

""But we, here, at the Beardsley Zoo, have taken it upon ourselves to inject our girl here, Kahaba, with hormones to induce sexual arousal.""

Kahaba? Sexual arousal? Injected with hormones? ""No, Mom, it's me, Erica! What are you talking about? Let me out!""

""As you can see,"" Karen continued, gesturing in the direction of Erica, ""Kahaba has prepared herself to mate by making herself as alluring as possible.""

It was only then that Erica noticed she was no longer in the nude. At first, it was clothing in general that caught her off guard – after a week of having her most private parts on display, it seemed unnatural that they be somewhat hidden away. But as she peered down at her scantily clad body, the outfit itself shocked her. 

Somehow, she had been dressed in a pinkish-white lace merry widow, complete with sheer cups that her nipples poked right through and spaghetti-thin shoulder straps. Garters ran down her body to a matching set of floral-embroidered, thigh-high pink stockings, each stocking with a girlish little ribbon where the garter met the hosiery. Between them, Erica found herself wearing a similarly pink-hued pair of thong panties, her café-au-lait showing in the back, and another cute little ribbon at the waistline in the front, just an inch or two below her beautiful exposed navel. And, finishing off the vision in pink, were a pair of three-inch heeled feathered slippers. It was plainly obvious that Erica had been dressed to seduce. 

But, more embarrassing than the outfit itself was the wet stain that seemed to be growing on the front of the panties, exposing her apparent arousal to the audience gathered on the far side of the glass. Erica seemed to be getting off on the crowd. 

As Erica tried to put the pieces together in her mind, a door slowly opened behind her. 

""Oh, look,"" Karen announced to her group of schoolchildren, ""we're in for a treat today. The zookeeper has decided to allow Kahaba and Mwenyeji to mate.""

The scantily-clad girl slowly turned around, unsure of what to expect on the far side of the door. With a relief, she saw her boyfriend Tom's face emerge from the shadows. 

""Oh my god, Tom,"" Erica gasped. ""Thank God it's you. I didn't know what to –""

Erica had been comforted by Tom's presence, glad to be with someone she knew and recognized. But Tom didn't seem to recognize her, and as he took a step into the room, Erica began to realize that this wasn't her Tom. This was Mwenyeji. 

He was completely naked, from head to toe, and while his face was similar to Tom's, this male's body was decidedly different. It was better cut, with muscles rippling through each arm and its chest. Mwenyeji's stomach was better defined, and his thighs and legs much more athletic. But it was the penis - flaccid at first but quickly rising with excitement - that was the giveaway; Mwenyeji was significantly better equipped than Erica's boyfriend. 

Her first thought was not about running away, or about screaming for help, or about demanding her release. Instead, Erica could only wonder about whether a member that size could fit into her pussy. 

Mwenyeji stepped into the room quickly, without a word or even a grunted ""hello."" Before Erica could protest, she had been thrown to canopy bed roughly, and the strange man with Tom's face had come down on top of her. He was perched on his right side, propping himself up on his right elbow to Erica's left, away from the window and the watching crowd. His right fist grabbed at the girl's dark hair (which was suddenly longer than it had been even before Colin's makeshift haircut), pulling her whole head hard to his face. As Tom/Mwenyeji forced his tongue into Erica/Kahaba's open mouth, he used his left hand to tear her soaked-through panties away from her body, ripping them as if they'd been made of paper. Erica gasped in a mixture of pleasure and pain into her new mate's mouth as he forced his index and middle finger of his left hand deep into her waiting cunt. Her eyes went wide as his calloused thumb found her clitoris, and began to move it side-to-side like an expert. 

Seconds into the sexual assault, Erica was already close to cumming. But as she caught sight of the gathering just outside her pink pen, she gathered herself and pushed Mwenyeji off of her body. His fingers were ripped away. His thumb was ripped away. His mouth was ripped away. And, as the man reached for something to hold onto, Erica's left cup of her merry widow was ripped away. 

She rolled to the far side of the bed and dashed to the window. Screaming, she pounded on the glass, yelling for her mother to come save her. Yelling for anyone to come save her. 

Instead, the audience simply looked at her in amusement. She was an animal that the zoo was mating. She was no different from a lioness, or a gorilla, or a dog, learning her place as a sexual object for a male of her species. They looked in, and watched her helplessness with no more interest than they'd give to a wildlife program on public television. What happened to Erica was no concern to them, and seemed to be no concern even to Erica's own mother. 

Tom/Mwenyeji caught her from behind, returning his right hand to Erica's head, where he grabbed at her hair once again and forced her flat against the pane. Both of Erica's smallish breasts were pressed hard against the surface, but her left nipple – out and exposed – was flattened on the glass two inches from a goofy-looking man eating popcorn. She was lifted off her feet just enough for Mwenyeji's penis to slip inside of her, penetrating deeper than Tom's ever had. Within four quick, rough thrusts, Erica was once again approaching her climax. She was crying, both from the intense pleasure and the intense humiliation of being fucked in front of dozens on onlookers. 

She screamed as she was about to cum. 

But the orgasm never came. 

Instead, Erica awoke on the hard floor on the Bullpen, alone and unclothed. Her own reflection, in the mirror-glass facing the Observation Room, was her only visible company. But Erica knew that there was someone else on the far side of that glass, an audience to her captivity as if she were an animal in the zoo. 

""Are you okay?"" Tessa Romero's voice boomed over the loudspeaker. Pete Bowie had completed her training, and now the college-aged intern was on her own through the night shift. ""Your heart-rate's up, your adrenaline's up, and a lot of your other numbers, too…""

The black-haired girl inside the Bullpen rolled over onto her back, staring up through the dimly lit room towards the ceiling. ""Just a bad dream,"" she reassured the girl. 

But was it really a bad dream? Erica had certainly never had a dream quite like it before, but she couldn't deny the arousal she was feeling. If anything, she felt somewhat frustrated that she hadn't been allowed to cum in the dream. 

""Would you like any water?"" the girl asked from the Observation Desk. 

Erica groggily rubbed her eyes with her fists. What she really wanted was to be home in her own bed. In her pajamas. With her boyfriend – her real boyfriend – slowly and gently bringing her to her climax. 

But for now, water would have to do. 

***

""So I heard you had a rough night last night,"" Natalie Hart asked Erica in the Observation Room. 

The raven-haired girl was seated at the table in the corner, wearing nothing but the technologically equipped black corset. Her still-small breasts dangled out in the open, but Erica had crossed her legs to hide her vagina, as she usually did, when she'd sat down to eat her lunch. Soon after the girl had begun feeding on her Caesar salad, she'd been joined by her elder, who sat gracefully across from her. Natalie was obviously interested in the quick report that Erica had given Noah that morning. 

""It was just a dream,"" Erica explained, unsure she wanted to talk any more about it than she already had. 

""But you think it was brought on by the deuterotone?""

""It was a bit more…"" the girl paused for the right word, ""carnal…than my usual dreams.""

Natalie pushed further. ""You told Noah that it was sexual. That's out of the ordinary?""

Erica swallowed hard. ""Well….no. I mean, those kinds of dreams are relatively common, I guess. But this was much more graphic than usual, much more sexual and much less sensual.""

The older woman nodded. 

""I just thought,"" Erica continued, ""that because of the body confusing deuterotone with testosterone every now and then, it might explain that sort of dream. If it's not related, then it's not related…but I just thought I should report it. For the science.""

""That could be,"" Natalie responded. ""But I think we should also keep an open mind about your psychology, given your current situation.""

Erica cocked an eyebrow.

""Nudists and naturalists can tell me all they want that there's nothing sexual about nakedness, but I'll never believe them,"" the blonde continued in a hushed tone. ""I just think that, given your current situation, it's understandable if your subconscious, naturally, gets turned on by the exhibitionism.""

The girl nearly chocked on a crouton. ""Natalie, I am NOT a flasher. I am NOT getting off on parading myself around ConnPharm in nothing but my birthday suit."" She kept her voice low and one eye on Colin on the far side of the room, but her tone showed that she was more than a little put off by her superior's suggestion. 

""I'm not saying you are,"" Natalie answered. ""But being naked can be a sexual thing, and you can't control your subconscious."" She paused. ""Can I ask what the dream was about? That is, a few more specifics?"" 

Erica shook her head. ""No. Absolutely not. It should be enough that I –""

The older biologist cut her off. ""Were you on display? Was there an audience? Was someone watching you?""

Silence.

""I'll take that as a yes."" Natalie gave the girl a knowing smile. ""If it really was the deuterotone, and it really was only the deuterotone, why incorporate anything more than just you and a partner?""

With that, the blonde woman stood, leaving the girl alone with her lunch. As she walked away, she turned, and suggested, ""Just keep an open mind. You can't assume that what you're experiencing is entirely because of the chemicals injected into your body.""

""What was that about?"" Colin asked, after Natalie had left. The technician strolled closer to the lunch table. 

""Nothing,"" Erica replied, pushing the rest of her salad away. Natalie really had given her something to think about. ""I'm not hungry. Can you take the corset off? Can I get back in the Bullpen?""

Looking puzzled, the man answered, ""Sure. Sure thing."" 

Her prison had become comforting. Her place of exposure had become her place of protection. And maybe, just maybe, a part of Erica longed to be bared to Colin. 

***

Fifty-five hours and three intensely sexual dreams after her first injection, a tingling began throughout Erica's body. At first, it was spread out, dispersed through her body and across her naked skin. As it continued, however, the dark-haired girl explained to the assemblage outside the Bullpen that it had become concentrated – in her throat, her chest, and her groin. 

Vijay and Takahashi had both still been at ConnPharm when the tingling began, and had been the first called down to the Bullpen. They were soon joined by Noah and Hannah, both of whom drove in from home to check up on their friend and test subject. And finally, Wendy had brought down Cathy Reinhardt, a registered EMT that ConnPharm kept on call throughout the night. If they needed to end the project, Cathy would be the first to try to help pull Erica back from any adverse conditions caused by the deuterotone. 

""We don't know that it's out of the ordinary,"" Erica explained, trying to calm everyone down. ""It would have been hard for Trixie to explain to us that she was feeling this sensation."" 

""We don't know that it is ordinary, either,"" Noah countered. ""It would have been difficult for Trixie to explain to us that she had felt no sensation at all."" 

""All I'm saying,"" Erica continued, ""is that I feel fine, other than the tingling. And Wendy can tell you herself that's there's nothing wrong with any of my vitals.""

In the Observation Room, all eyes turned to the peroxide blonde.

""Heart rate went up when you all started arguing with her,"" the technician shrugged. ""Other than that, the mainframe's not showing anything out of the ordinary."" 

""Does it hurt?"" Hannah asked, turning her attention away from Wendy and back towards the mirror glass. 

Erica answered, ""No, it just…it….it's more like pins and needles. Like when your arm or your leg falls asleep on you."" 

""And this has been going on for how long now?"" Noah asked.

""About forty-five minutes,"" Mike Takahashi replied. 

""And did anything set it off? Did anything cause the 'pins and needles'?"" 

Vijay answered this time. ""Mike and I have already gone over the data. It looks like deuterotone has reached a critical point – fatty tissue is starting to amass around Erica's…I mean, the subject's…I mean, around her breasts."" 

""Well, that explains the tingling in the mammary area,"" Noah said. ""And the onset of second puberty would obviously create a similar tingling in the groin. But I'm a little concerned about her throat.""

""My larynx,"" Erica cut in. ""If my body's mistaking the deuterotone as testosterone or some other androgen, it might mean that my voice is going to deepen a bit.""

""…which isn't supposed to happen,"" Noah continued. 

""Which hasn't happened in the other animals,"" Erica corrected him, ""but we knew that it was a possibility in human women."" 

""So if it does happen, and your voice does change…?"" Wendy asked. ""Do you guys go back to the drawing board?""

""Not yet,"" Erica answered through the intercom. 

""Not yet,"" Noah agreed. ""The larynx grows in both genders during puberty – it's just more significant in male development. Her voice might change a little, it might change a lot, it might not change at all. We don't really know.""

""And even if it does,"" the naked girl on the far side of the glass went on, ""we still wouldn't be sure if it would happen in all women, or if there's something unique to my particular body chemistry that caused it."" 

Her partner nodded. 

The decision had to be made as to whether to continue with the project or not. Though Noah had the ultimate say, with Erica somewhat indisposed, Erica got her way and the experiment went forward. Her partner, unfortunately, was somewhat wary of the deuterotone, given Erica's dreams the past two nights, and now the strange sensation taking hold of her body. 

Noah, like everyone else at ConnPharm, had no concept of the specifics of Erica's dreams. Natalie had hinted at them, but only Erica knew the ins and outs of her own imagination, and she wasn't yet ready to share the vulgar details of her dirty subconscious. Like her experience in the zoo with Tom/Mwenyeji, her two additional dreams had involved an enhanced version of her boyfriend, rough sex, and an audience. And, like the first, Erica had, as of yet, been unable to cum in any of her dreams. For some torturous reason, she continued to awake just before release, denied of her orgasm each time. 

That Wednesday night, at ten o'clock, Erica was indecisive as to whether she was looking forward to falling asleep that night. 

Just as she was indecisive about the somewhat pleasant sensation stirring in her crotch.

There was a part of her that was worried about the tingling, of course. But there was another part of her, a more CARNAL part of her, that couldn't help but enjoy the buzzing deep in her pussy and around her clitoris. It seemed as if her body, with the help her chemical compound, had produced an organic sex toy, a natural vibrator. And, unfortunately, it was just humming enough to keep her aroused, but – like her dreams – not quite enough to finish her off. 

Even her nipples had been standing straight up since the tingling had begun. Of course, her nipples had been hard on and off throughout the past week and half, as she displayed her body to all comers. But this was different, as they were harder and more tender than before. Erica longed to touch them.

2pukfo,2,2014-12-19,I Don't Know What to Do Anymore...Please Help,JoeFabooche,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2pukfo/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymoreplease_help/,"I have been spiraling down for the past few years. It's gotten increasingly worse over the past 2 years. However, the past few months I can probably say I have reached my lowest. And tonight, it's even worse. The culmination of all my depression has hit me.

I am in my last year of college. Studying for a degree I do not want but it's the best I could have done with what I had. I am by no means a stupid man but I am not a smart one either. I am stupid socially though. I hate the people in my program. I've a total of possibly two friends on that entire campus and I only ever see them on campus. I have lost touch with the few high school friends I had. Because of all of this and just overall being depressed, fatigued...the usual, I have not attended a single week of classes this entire semester. The only full week I attended was the week of exams. In fact, my elective: the first class I went to was the mid-term exam...I do all my assignments. I try to do them well. I show up on important dates. I should also add that I live 1.5 hours away from campus so my commute (public transport) is quite long. That is probably my biggest hurdle in getting to class when I feel down and fatigued. 

Anyway...I saw my final marks for this semester tonight and while I wasn't expecting great marks...I was not ready for what I did see. 
72, 67, 66, 69, 67. The 72 was for my elective...the remaining marks are for my core courses. 

My GPA is about 68.2 this semester and overall GPA has dropped to 72.8. I have one more semester left and I honestly do not know what to do or if I can improve this. I do not want to graduate in the 60's. I mean, these days you need freaking 80's just to become a janitor. Okay, that was an exaggeration but I think the point was made. 

My family doesn't believe I have anything to be depressed over. I have tried many times. They are all ""you have nothing to be depressed over"", ""it's an excuse"", ""I have more reason to be depressed than you"". So I just don't bother anymore. My friends are the same; don't really care. I can't take a semester off, I can't drop out. I can't anything. 

I am so worried about my future. I have applied to get licensed by the law society and that should be happening by this time next year, latest. I thought about taking additional courses just to beef up my qualifications with a certificate or a diploma but my marks are going downhill. This all looks like utter shit on a transcript. 

I don't know what to do but I need to fix things and do something before it truly is too late. I am so worried for my future. I don't know where to turn or what to do once I even graduate. I don't want to make this too long but a lot of context is needed. 

I had my internship this summer and I felt like a fool the entire time. The internship I got was a favour, of course. I went to interviews and I sent out resumes but didn't get shit. So an uncle hooked me up with a lawyer he does business with. The entire time I felt like an idiot and someone's favour but I was just glad to be there. I tried, I really did. But anxiety gets the best of me and I make stupid mistakes. I don't pick up on things myself, I need it explained. Sometimes something is being explained and I just tune out because of the anxiety of having to do something new and not wanting to fail. Needless to say, I did not stay on with them even though I offered to come in and continue volunteering as I finish my degree. They gave me the usual ""let's keep in touch, we'll see what happens"" spiel. They are a fairly new firm so I understand they may not want employees on hand right now but...I offered to volunteer. 

I just feel like I have nothing to offer. I don't even want to work in law. I hate the people, I hate the subject. Or maybe it's just my depression talking. I just want an office job where for the most part I do not have to deal with much people and no huge responsibilities like that of legal cases on me. I do not want to be the reason someone loses their case. I don't know what to do. Sorry for the length but there's so much I have festering because I have no one to discuss all this with in real life. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. "
2pumjh,0,2014-12-19,Sophomore stressing out about college,piqcyl,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2pumjh/sophomore_stressing_out_about_college/,"Merry Christmas Reddit,
Today I wanted to ask a few questions about college admissions from high school as well as applications for graduate programs. So I am a sophomore at a private high school in Texas that is well known among the nations colleges (For example 45% got accepted into the university of Texas instead of the public school standard of 6-9%, also 20 kids got accepted into Notre Dame out of a class of 250 last year). I am pursuing degrees in finance and economics. Now that you know a a broad background of me I'm going to give some details about my grades, test scores, and extra-curricular activities.

Freshman Year: This was probably one of the most pointless years of my education (I'm the one who is in fault). As a fourteen year old immature kid distracted by girls, video games, and other personal interests, my grades were very low. I was irresponsible at the time and honestly i might have screwed my self. My accumulative GPA was a 3.31 at the end of the 9th grade, and on a side note, I scored a 26 on a practice ACT test that was administered to the freshman class.

Sophomore Year (This year): Ever since elementary school and middle school on my free time I would, on my free time, sit there on my iPad and research careers and colleges. Originally I wanted to be a petroleum engineer, then I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, freshman year I became infatuated with physics and wanted to be a theoretical or particle physicist, next was a stock broker, now I want to be an investment banker. I came to this decision after trading one the stock market for 4 years since the age of 11 (set up by my grandma). I love it. The thrill of trading and the complexity of economics are a few reasons why. I'm getting off topic, back to the reason for this post. My life has completely turned around. Over the summer and early part of the year I spent a lot of time thinking about my future and realized how much of a slacker I was. So I planned to get really good grades this year. After the first semester (which ended yesterday), I had a 4.0 GPA and aced all of my finals. This puts my accumulative at a 3.65. (At the beginning of the semester i had a 3.4 and had a personal revelation and hit the grind to get a 4.0, I plan on getting a the max grade next semester which is a 4.38, trust me I can do it) Also, I just received my PSAT scores and i got a 172 on it (I could have done a lot better).

Extras: 
- I will be in NHS this year (couldn't last year because of grades) 
- Have around 60 hours of service work 
- Go to Wharton school of business camp hosted by the president of the school in Switzerland (plan to get a letter of recommendation from him) 
- Not in any student council position 
- Friends with president of the investment club and hoping he will pass down the club to me when he graduates. 
- Getting internship at an investment firm over the summer - Am in the max amount of AP courses (3)
- In the process of making a non profit organization to better the underprivileged. I will probably make my college essays about this. Education to me is everything and I cherish every moment that I have being in such a sought after environment. I am going to make a club when school gets back in session to do outreach programs and raise money for local schools. I also plan on having fairs with kids in underprivileged areas. 

Essay Topic Plan:
My dad was adopted into a middle class family in Houston. He attended Stephen F. Austin as a forestry major, decided that wasn't for him then went to The University of Houston to get a degree in graphic design. Through a chaotic series of events he ended up being the global manager for a travel company that deals with oil and gas companies. About 7 years ago we decided to go on a search for his real mother. We found her and she lived in a trailer home in north Texas. It turns out that he had a brother who was homeless in Miami, and his mom had married 4 different men since she had my dad. Since my dad was given a better opportunity in life, he is able to afford things like private school and college. I would like to help others who have a chance to better their situations. I am able to attend private school because of my dad and it is the thing that I am most thankful for. My dad's life compared to the lives of his real family is a drastic difference that demonstrates how ones life can change through education. (Since I will the owner of the charity I will make my essay on this) Education is the most important thing to me and I would like to share that. 
 
Note: Yea so I might include something like this in my essays. Education is truly the thing I am most thankful for and wouldn't trade the world for the things my dad has provided for me.


That's about it...
1. Now that you know EVERYTHING (almost ;]) about me. I have a few questions.
2. Since I am bringing my GPA up it should be around a 3.9 or low 4's at the end of high school. What are my chances to get into UT Austins McCombs school of business?
3. What colleges do you think I am capable of getting accepted into? (Keep in mind I am business oriented)

Thanks guys and girls. Wish me luck!"

I come from a conservative background and have had mixed feelings on porn in general, but he comes from a very open-minded home and it has led to disagreements.
 
Ultimately we agreed on tolerance and I accepted it was his ""me time"", and I was more important when it came to the real thing. That is just how our relationship works, not saying it's best for everyone.
I asked him one day if I could look up someone on IMDB on his laptop and he said okay, and then I pulled up his internet (which he had left open) and all his tabs were searches for porn of his ex-gf. I felt very hurt and betrayed (especially because this was the night before I left for a 5 month, out-of-state internship).

She was his high school girlfriend whom he dated longer than me at this point. She is much hotter than me and I know she fulfilled him better, so my self-esteem wasn't terribly high before this incident.

I confronted him about his searches and he claimed one of his friends told him there were videos up and to search for them. He said he wanted to see them to feel better about himself and she means nothing to him. IMO, she must mean something to that little head.

I left for my internship the next day, still seething, and the issue was never resolved fully. How can I bring it back up again without sounding like a bitter bitch? I really want to understand and to solve the issue, but I want to let the past stay in the past as well.

TL;DR; I caught my boyfriend looking up porn of his ex-gf, and the issue was never resolved. How can I bring it back up and solve it?"

I have a few ideas: 

* the desire to start a new family
* add to the existing
* wanting to feel a guy cumming without a condom, maybe your boyfriend is too afraid
* wanting more kids despite your husband not wanting more
* ready for a child, if you have a boyfriend, then he's not ready
* infertile husband/boyfriend
* wanting to be bred by an alpha
* wanting a child with someone who has always loved you
* wanting to play a game of risk, dare you to fuck me, dare you to cum inside, dare you to do it again...etc
* lie about being on birth control
* say its the ""safe time"" of the month
* tell me to pull out, but ride me, putting you in control
* start off with wanting me to pull out, then losing it, and wanting me to cum inside
* hate my girlfriend or wife, give me a baby that I want
* cuckold/cuckqueen my girlfriend or wife
* threesomes with a sister, friend, niece, cousin, mom, daughter, etc
* I'm sure I can come up with more ideas. 


Below I wrote two vague ideas for a MILF or Mistress RP. I wanted to keep the creative bubble open and unrestricted because I'm hoping you can add some of your own lustful details and sexy twists to our RP. 

.


* **One:** Your older than me, maybe a young woman or a milf. I'm the strapping young man that you could teach to be a good lover. Fulfill those needs your not getting at home by your self, or from that husband or boyfriend you've had for so long. Character's I might be: son, friend's son, neighbor boy, student to a tutor/teacher, bag boy at the grocery, nephew, younger cousin, pool boy, highschool/college athlete, your child's tutor or babysitter, a friend of your son or duaghter, daughter's boyfriend, intern, employee, personal trainer, etc. Some of the kinks that could be involved include vanilla, romantic, reluctant, creampies, anal, impregnaiton,ageplay, incest, anal, bondage, cheating, cuckold, threesomes, and more

.



* **Two:** This one is on the more kinky side. You could be a mistress or a lover, but in either case I'll be on the receiving end of a cock. It could be plastic or real. Yours or someone else's. Open to a vanilla mutual fucking to the other end of the spectrum, where I'm a submissive. This could include all sorts of kinks: bdsm, facesitting, bi sex, futa, tgirl, strap-on, watersports, ageplay, incest, anal, rape, noncon, con, impregnation, drugs, blackmail, and more.

.

Let me know what kinks you have as well. Looking forward to the PM.

I'm currently a junior at an University and I'm hoping to improve my coding skills before I attempt to obtain a programming related internship or job.

I've done crappy android apps, school projects, and worked on IOS stuff during my free, but most of those were basic and didn't challenge me to learn much. The IOS adventure was simply in pursue for profits, but I never released an application since these were unpolished and I myself wouldn't recommend them. This taught me money shouldn't be a driving force behind a project, at least not the major driving force. I can't even correctly remember OOP concepts, much less apply them in a project. It's very embarrassing. Fortunately, I've developed the learn how to learn skill and it's been quite useful in subjects from school were I had trouble such as Math, so I'm thinking I should apply it to my field of study (CS).

I've thought about contributing to an open source project for quite a while, and eventhough I've had a github account for 1+ year I'm still crappy at using it. I'm mostly interested in developing desktop applications that databases, and things related with astronomy, physics, science. Any recommendations on nice projects in these categories I could fork?

Also, any recommendations on what might help me to challenge myself and what might help me to rapidly improve my skills."

2pvfeq,2,2014-12-20,Few questions about the advisory field.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2pvfeq/few_questions_about_the_advisory_field/,"Hi there. I'm a junior in college with a Big 4 Advisory internship this summer (risk advisory). Chose advisory because I was never too interested in audit or tax, and the recruiters told me advisory was, more or less, in the same ball park as consulting - something I've been interested in throughout my undergrad career. Just about everyone else I know went audit.

I ended up with the internship I wanted and I'm looking forward to it, but I have a couple questions in the mean time. I've gotten a lot of info from the company I'll be working for, but I wanted to see what y'all here at /r/accounting had to say about a few of my questions.

1. For current people in advisory, what made you end up there (rather than audit or tax)?  

2. How do you like the work? What might a day-to-day schedule look like?

3. I've heard having Big 4 audit experience is great for a resume, and companies love hiring ex-Big 4 employees. Is the same true for advisory? Do employers just look for Big 4 w/o regards to field, or do specific employers look for advisory/audit?

4. Similar to the last question - where do people tend to end up after leaving advisory? 

Let me know if there's a better place to post this - I know most people here are in audit, but I'm hoping there's a few advisory professionals here to answer."
2pvgwd,0,2014-12-20,Not creating enough,raskral,Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/2pvgwd/not_creating_enough/,"This is a throwaway.

I'm 4 months out to being 21 years old. By superficial standards, I'm doing quite well. I attend a top tier university, have been a TA for several CS classes, and have an internship at a prestigious corporation lined up for next summer.

On the inside, I feel completely empty. I have no particular passions to speak to, few friends, an awkward and distant relationship with my unreasonably loving family, and am only functional socially when my well being depends on it the most (like in interviews). 

This is almost definitely a product of my childhood. I've never felt in control of my life, and I still don't. As a high school student, I took on extracurriculars that I had no real passion for simply because I knew they would help me get into a good college. And after I was admitted to an ivy league institution, I dropped them immediately. Now, I'm deep into a major that I have no real interest in (computer science) and I'm a slightly above average student, but not particularly remarkable. I spend much of my time watching videos of other people playing video games, but being too afraid of getting sucked into a repeat of my high school gaming addiction to actually play them myself.

I've come to realize that, given an infinite amount of time, most, and physical energy, I would probably be too afraid to make any sort of change from the status quo, and I would continue to watch videos of people playing games all day long. The fact that I can so candidly admit this without feeling any sort of emotional backlash is extremely worrying for me.

It's difficult for me to do any sort of self evaluation because my memory is quite terrible, and I have no real recollection of what made me happy in the past. I vaguely remember enjoying writing stories when I was a kid in middle school, but I always felt afraid to tell people because my parents encouraged me to pursue a STEM education. In high school, I remember enjoying designing video games, but I never really had anyone to play with and I never picked up artistic skills (and my piano playing is atrocious), so it never got anywhere. None of these things would matter if my happiness didn't intrinsically require some form of creative output for personal validation.

Anyway, enough ramble. The point is: I've become an extremely dispassionate person over my last 2.5 years in college, and I feel like I'm not getting enough out of life because I haven't been able to make things. What can I do to fix this?

P.S. Please do not tell me to seek professional help for psychological problems. I have visited psychiatrists and have reached the same conclusion each time I have visited one: my personal happiness requires ownership of something creative, and the biggest obstacle has been my passivity."

The fact that I just happen to be in an LDR makes no difference if I were to go clubbing or not. I'm safe and responsible. He gets scared and I understand.

""Wendy,"" Hannah put forth. ""But not really.""

""They've acknowledged it,"" Vijay interjected. He knew. He'd watched the video, and listened to the dialogue, the moaning, and the exclamations. ""But nothing much deeper than that.""

""This is obviously the deuterotone,"" Noah stated, glaring angrily in Natalie's direction. He couldn't believe that his boss would allow Erica to be put through what was happening to her. 

""It's certainly part of it,"" the blonde conceded. ""I'd say that it's definitely greasing the wheels."" 

Turning her attention to Jake, Natalie spoke slowly and clearly. ""But one could make the case that it's Erica's personality, and not the drugs.""

Jake nodded. One could, in fact, make that case to Medical Oversight. Would they buy it? Would they accept it? Would it prevent ConnPharm from being shut down by the FDA?

Turning back to Noah, Natalie tried to calm the naked girl's partner. ""And may I remind you, Noah, that Erica volunteered for this assignment.""

""Because there was no other choice!""

""Irregardless,"" the blonde replied. ""She volunteered. She could end the project today if she wanted to. She could have ended it Saturday afternoon, if she felt too at odds with what she ended up doing in the Bullpen."" 

""Does she know that?"" Hannah asked. 

""Of course she does,"" Natalie answered. 

""Does she?"" the Korean woman repeated. ""I mean, forget the science. Does she know that she can step down? That she can put her clothes back on and go home?"" 

""It's certainly not recommended, given the chemicals in her system..."" Takahashi began. 

""But she has that option, no?"" Hannah asked again, addressing them all. ""And we're sure that she knows she has that option?"" 

There was a silence around the table. 

""This is her project,"" Hannah continued. ""She's the principal. She should be the one making this decision.""

Looking around the table, she added, ""Not Noah. Not Jake. Not Forrester. And not goddamned Medical Oversight."" 

""So who brings it up with her?"" Jake asked, after glancing around at the faces in the group. 

""I'll do it,"" Hannah answered. ""I'm her friend. I might be best-suited to talk to her about this sort of thing. And I'm going down there in a few hours to give her the next injection, anyways. That is, if she still wants it.""

""No,"" Noah spoke up. ""Erica may be the principal, but this is my project, too. I can take ownership. I can do what needs to be done.""

""With all due respect to both of you,"" Natalie stepped up, ""I'll talk to her. The deuterotone is more my project than anyone's, with the possible exception of maybe Erica. Oversight isn't going to let Hannah go anywhere near Erica with a needle until they have one of their stooges talk to her, anyways.

""And,"" Natalie addressed Noah. ""I really think that this conversation would be less embarrassing for everyone involved if it were initiated by another woman."" 

***

Though she was significantly more clothed than the darker-haired woman in the Bullpen – and not to mention nearly twice her age – Natalie Hart was every bit as alluring. If not more so. She had aged well, her skin still smooth, her body still fit and trim. 

She strutted. She didn't walk, or saunter, or race. She strutted, with power and confidence, her long, stocking-covered legs swishing back and forth and hypnotizing any man of any age who saw her enter a room. 

Today, as she strutted into the Observation Room, it was Colin Eggert who took notice. His attention, if ever so briefly, was drawn away from the stark naked woman across the room, and to the aging beauty just entering. Dressed in a grayish tweed pencil skirt and a simple white blouse, Natalie had command. She knew the curves of her body had power to them, and she used those assets to her own advantage. 

""Colin,"" she acknowledged, smiling in the technician's direction. 

""Natalie,"" Colin nodded. 

Whereas Erica had youth, a gorgeous figure, and complete exposure, Natalie had what Erica herself only dream of – confidence in her own body.

Stepping up to the Observation Desk, Natalie told Colin, ""Erica and I are going to need some privacy."" She paused, and then added, ""Relatively.""

Colin wasn't quite sure what the blonde woman meant. 

""Can you turn off the audio recording for a few minutes?"" Natalie asked. When Colin began to object, Natalie simply smiled again to silence him. ""Erica and Noah are not going to be upset about missing audio for a few minutes. It's not going to affect their data.""

""Sure,"" the technician replied. Typing a few commands into the computer. ""Sure, I guess."" 

""And would you mind taking a walk?"" Natalie continued. ""A bathroom break, if you will?"" 

Again, Colin just nodded. He'd only been a work for a few hours, but a break didn't sound unappealing. The urinalysis sensors in both the toilet and the shower drain had been on the fritz since he'd first arrived that morning, which wasn't entirely a surprise – they were the most problematic pieces of equipment connected to the Bullpen. A few minutes away might allow him to clear his head, and return to the task at hand with a different approach.

He took a few steps, glancing back at his desk, and back towards the dark-haired figure on the far side of the mirror glass, before smiling again politely and leaving the two women alone.

""Thank you,"" Natalie purred after him. Flipping a switch on the desk, she called, ""Erica.""

The nude girl inside the Bullpen didn't even look in the direction of the Observation Room. There was no point; all she'd have been able to see was her own reflection. Instead, with her attention still focused on the numbers and data projected onto the far wall, she absentmindedly responded, ""Yes?""

Erica was obviously annoyed at having to break her concentration on what she was doing. Natalie was annoyed at being so casually disregarded. 

""We need to talk about this past weekend,"" the blonde woman said into the comm.

That got Erica's attention quick. Inside the Bullpen, Erica swallowed hard.

It had been enjoyable. It had been stress-relieving. And it had been undeniably erotic. But Erica didn't want to talk about what she was doing, any more than she truly wanted to do what she was doing. 

""I'd prefer that we didn't,"" Erica answered, doubting it would end the conversation. It wouldn't have with Wendy, but perhaps Natalie would have a bit more decorum than the technician. 

""I'd prefer that we didn't, either,"" Natalie answered from the speakers above. The data projection blinked out on Erica's wall, and her boss's image replaced it. Looking sternly over the bare scientist below, she continued, ""But we need to.""

Erica swallowed again. She wanted to get this conversation over with quickly. ""It's just a long time to go. What with the deuterotone and all.""

""That's what we need to talk about, Erica. The Oversight people have expressed some concerns about the extent to which you've been...pleasuring yourself."" 

Erica's entire body flushed with embarrassment, even as her labia swelled with excitement. ""So the Oversight people have been watching me masturbate? Are we sending out tapes to the entire company?"" 

""You know as well as I do that that's not true,"" Natalie sighed. ""And you knew going in that Oversight would be, well, overseeing."" 

""George Anders? Jamie Finneran? Dick Abbott? Were they sitting around watching the tapes with a bucket of popcorn?""

""No,"" the blonde shook her head. ""They're taking this very seriously, Erica. So is Noah, for that matter.""

""So Noah's been sitting around watching the tapes with a bucket of popcorn?""

""Your staff and I sat down this morning with Jake Rinaldi to watch them this morning, Erica.""

Silence. Embarrassment. Mortification. 

Natalie continued. ""There's concern. There's concern about how you've been behaving recently.""

""No,"" Erica answered angrily. ""There's concern about me fucking myself in front of them."" 

A shiver ran down her spine. It felt good to be upfront about it. It felt good to talk that way to her boss. 

""A little more blunt than I would have been,"" the older woman said. ""But yes, essentially.""

A pause.

""Noah's worried that you behaving this way is a bit out of character.""

""'Out of character?'"" Erica asked in disbelief. ""But stripping naked in front of all my colleagues isn't? Pissing into a drain in front of him isn't? Injecting hormones into my body to increase the size of my tits isn't? So it's just the masturbating that's 'out of character'?"" 

""Erica – ""

""It's the goddamned deuterotone!"" she answered, beginning to break down. ""My whole body is chock-full of fake testosterone. It's like an aphrodisiac, Natalie. I can't think about anything else most of the time!"" 

""We know, Erica,"" Natalie lied. The blonde woman had her doubts. She'd expressed them to Erica before. She'd expressed them to Noah, Jake, and the others that morning. ""But Abbott is going to pull the plug on the project because of what it's doing to you.""

""What are talking about?"" The girl wiped a tear from her eyes. She felt frustrated, unable to fully get across what the pseudo-pubescent hormone was doing to her. ""We've got the second round of injections today.""

On the screen in front of her, the larger-than-life figure of Natalie Hart shook her head. ""Not if Abbott decides against it.""

""Why?"" Erica cried. The whole project was in danger of being fucked, simply because Erica had finger-fucked herself a few times. ""It's my experiment! I'm the one doing this to me! I know what I'm feeling isn't natural, but I'm not going to sue ConnPharm. It's not like I'm in danger of dying, and the company has to deal with my death. The only thing being lost here is my dignity.""

Natalie just shrugged. ""It's not you and your lawyer that Oversight, and Abbott in particular, are thinking about. If the FDA comes sniffing around, and they decide that this experiment should have been cut off, we could be in deep, deep trouble.

""Besides,"" the blonde continued, ""it's not as if we're going to go straight to market with the deuterotone if it's really the stimulant it appears to be.""

The girl inside the Bullpen mulled this over for a few minutes. 

""There are kinks, yes. We'll work them out,"" she finally said. ""And not everyone undergoing deuterotone therapy is going to be under observation 24/7 for five weeks. They could always slip off from some alone time.""

""Three times a day?"" Natalie asked with a raised eyebrow. 

Erica started to blush, but offered, ""It's boring in here."" 

The joke lightened the mood, briefly, and even caused Natalie to giggle a little. 

Changing tone, however, Erica stated flatly, ""I'm not a whore.""

""I know."" 

""It's just that I did it once. And the threat of being caught doing it again didn't seem as scary.""

""I know.""

""I ruined my reputation on Saturday afternoon. It wasn't any more ruined on Saturday evening.""

""Erica, don't...""

""I just get, I don't know, worked up, and I can't come back down without it.""

Natalie nodded. 

""And five weeks is a long time to go without anything.""

Natalie nodded again.

Erica stared up at the projection. ""But I've made my peace with it."" 

""You have?""

This time, it was Erica who nodded. ""Getting over the initial shock of what I was doing was hard. Just from a pure and innocent viewpoint. A sexually conservative viewpoint.""

""But now...?""

""But now,"" the naked girl went on, ""I'm coming to grips with it. It's natural. It's really no more or less embarrassing than having Colin watch me take a shit, or having his interns gawk at my crotch when I'm exercising."" 

Erica smiled weakly, and added, ""And it really is boring in here."" 

""And it feels good,"" Natalie said.

""And it feels good,"" the younger girl echoed. With mischief in her eyes, she looked up at Natalie, ""You have no idea.""

""I have some idea. I watched the tapes this morning, didn't I?""

Erica chuckled, though it was a bit awkward. She had, of course, talked briefly about pleasuring herself with Wendy, but even that had been somewhat utilitarian. But Natalie had always been her mentor, her teacher, and her confidante. From the moment that Erica had started at ConnPharm, the older woman had felt safe. 

""And I think you may be partially right about what you said last week,"" Erica offered. ""About my personality and about being exposed in front of everyone."" 

""Well, I'm sure there are more than a few people, male or female, that would have very similar reactions if placed in similar conditions."" Continuing on, Natalie smirked, ""Do you remember the volunteer we had from Wesleyan a few months back? From Jim Bernard's adrenaline tests?""

""The Walking Erection,"" Erica laughed. She had forgotten about that particular test subject. For the forty-eight hours he had spent naked inside the Bullpen, the college student's dick had stood at attention for nearly thirty. She hadn't seen him herself. But she'd heard the stories. 

Similar stories might well have begun circulating the ConnPharm campus about her. 

""The deuterotone, though,"" Erica interjected. ""I'm sure it's more to blame in this case than any deep-seated fetishes.""

""Most likely,"" Natalie said slyly. ""But Dick Abbott doesn't need to know that.""

Erica wasn't catching on. She looked back at Natalie with a puzzled expression on her face.

""If he were to believe that your behavior was, in fact, stemming from some long-standing exhibitionist pull,"" the blonde suggested, ""he might be a bit less concerned about the chemical side of the equation.""

""So you want me to lie to him?""

Natalie ran a single hand through her blonde hair, pulling it away from her face. With a slight sneer, she replied, ""If it's a lie."" 

Erica was a bit caught off-guard by her boss's comment, but she didn't linger on it. She did, however, let the original suggestion seep deeper into her mind. 

She couldn't deny that having the project pulled, at that point, would have been a relief. Her clothes sat tantalizingly close, just outside the Bullpen. If she wanted to, she could step out right now, get dressed, and go home. 

Home. Where she could have her privacy again. Where she could masturbate to her heart's content. Where Tom could fuck her until she couldn't walk. 

Dick Abbott held all of those possibilities in his hand. He didn't need Erica's consent to stop the deuterotone trial – he just needed enough evidence to suggest that her compound was having an adverse effect on her body. He couldn't be bribed to let things slide, as he would be one of any number of people hauled into the FDA to explain if things took a negative turn. Dick Abbott could, in a way, force Erica to put her clothes on. Dick Abbott could, in a way, force Erica to go home to Tom and get screwed in countless different positions. 

But the science would suffer. Erica's years of work would suffer. Natalie's years of work, before Erica had even joined ConnPharm, would suffer. They'd retool the compound, of course, but it would take months, if not years, and Erica doubted whether the Bill Forresters and Jake Rinaldis would be very happy with her, her partner, and her group. 

Erica looked behind her, and caught sight of her own reflection. Her breasts had continued to grow, but she was uncertain what would happen if the injections didn't continue. She couldn't stop now, take a week to herself, and then pick the experiment back up once she'd received permission – the science wouldn't allow it. She needed the subsequent injections to better control her mammary growth, to slow it in the third week, to ensure that she didn't start sprouting chest hair or a mustache because of too much false testosterone. 

To put on her pants, and her shirt, would have been divine. She could leave behind her the indignity of her nude captivity, her public urination, and her constant need to touch herself while wondering who was watching. Her reputation was being destroyed. 

But she still had her reputation as a scientist to think of. She was on the verge of revolutionizing breast augmentation, if not revolutionizing the way doctors thought of puberty and development. She couldn't let the fact that she was a prude stand in the way of where she was taking her deuterotone. 

Erica's eyes twinkled. ""Bring Abbott down.""

""Are you sure?"" Natalie prodded.

The dark haired girl nodded, adding, ""And tell Hannah to begin prepping the needle.""

***

Dick Abbott had been convinced, for some time, that he was going to be a Presbyterian minister. All throughout high school, when his peers were drinking, smoking pot, and fornicating with one another, little Dickie read his Bible in his bedroom. He volunteered at his church, reading verses to the congregation on Sundays and raking leaves for elderly parishioners on Saturdays. But college had come, and while other young freshman were tempted by unsupervised freedom, Dickie had been tempted by biology. 

And so, Dick Abbott deserted his old dream for his new love – he became a doctor. 

Years later, Dick was still very involved in the Second Presbyterian Church of Avon. He participated in Bible studies. He had long talks about his faith with his pastor. And he still raked leaves for the elderly on Saturdays. 

At fifty-six years old, Dick had been married to his wife Debbie for thirty-three years, and then had three grown-up young women to show from their union. His sex drive, like that of his wife's, had diminished over the years, but it wasn't something that he obsessed over. While other men his age were rushing off to find sexual supplements (some of which had been developed at ConnPharm itself), Dick simply shrugged off his de facto celibacy. As of that Monday morning, it had been over five months since Dick had last orgasmed. 

Erica Rivers, meanwhile, hadn't orgasmed in just four hours, and it was killing her. 

The whole situation made Dick uncomfortable. He hadn't been comfortable with the deuterotone experiment from the get go, troubled by the thought of women across the country injecting themselves with chemicals to increase the size of their breasts, wanting to become the sexual playthings of pornographic male fantasies. But Dick had little say in what ConnPharm developed for their consumer base. 

He did, however, have quite a bit to say in how far he'd letter certain experiments go on. As a member of the Medical Oversight board within ConnPharm, Dick Abbott held ultimate say about the duration of any experiment once adverse effects began to arise. He had pulled the plug on Helmut Stohl's hair growth study after two of Stohl's subjects had developed severe diarrhea. And after seeing the significant increase in Erica Rivers's libido on the tapes he'd been shown, Dick was sure that it wouldn't take much for him to bring this particular trial to a close. 

He'd watched tapes of Erica masturbating on Saturday afternoon. And on Saturday evening. And on Sunday morning, while Dick and Debbie Abbott had been at church. And though parts of Dick responded quite excitedly to the show the young woman was putting on, the greater emotion that came over him was disgust. This woman was touching herself and writhing on the ground like an animal in heat. And the only explanation that Dick could give, having met the quiet and reserved Erica Rivers a number of times before, was that the injection she had pumped into her body the previous week had corrupted her sense of decency. 

And to Dick Abbott, this was a side effect that would not be stood for. 

At the door to the Observation Room, Dick hesitated. Was he supposed to knock? He was, in all truth, walking in on a woman in her birthday suit. Should she be prepared for his arrival? Or was it Dick that needed preparation? 

Either way, he told himself, Erica would be behind the mirror glass. She wouldn't hear the knock. She wouldn't even know that he was there until he announced himself through the comm system at the ops desk.

2pwhdi,1,2014-12-20,I'm looking for advice for a long distance relationship.,xx2f,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2pwhdi/im_looking_for_advice_for_a_long_distance/,"I don't know how to start this. It's about my girlfriend.


We dated in highschool for about a year and a half. We went to college this fall, separate colleges. We agreed that we were going to try the whole, ""date other people,"" thing. That didn't work at all. She kissed a few girls and I kissed one at my school. Whatever the case, we didn't enjoy being with other people. It slowly destroyed us. We used to text a ton, but we were only texting once a week at that point. I became depressed. By 'depressed' I mean, not formally diagnosed, but I stopped eating, drank, used drugs, etc. I ended up in the hospital due to some of the side effects of those substances. While in the hospital, I texted her and we were talking for the first time in weeks. It eventually came up that I was in the hospital and that wasn't a good sign. She was super concerned. So concerned that we began talking again.


It was like old times. We texted everyday and talked like we used to. I can't even explain the joy I felt from it. We went home for Thanksgiving break and we knew that we wanted to be in a relationship. However, we went back to our schools without becoming official. She said she was too busy. We texted back and forth during this time and she eventually stopped texting again.


I met up with her when I returned from college (5 days ago). We ended up in the park talking about our experiences. She also fell into a depression after we broke up. She spent most of her time doing drugs or drinking as well. We both agreed this wasn't working. We had a few options: try long distance, keep doing this limbo-thing, sever all contact forever, stop talking until after college.


We both ended up crying in the car and hugging each other. We didn't want it to be over. That was horrendous. We texted later in the day, talking about what we should do. Long distance would be hard. She's in Philadelphia PA and I'm in Keene NH. Neither of us have a car and there's also the issue of free time.


I met up with her today. We decided that we want to try long distance. This is after she told me all about her situation and why she didn't want to try it. After she explained it, I remained calm and said it could work. I'm not calm. I'm freaking the fuck out.


She's taking 7 classes at her school that go from 8AM to 9PM. She has a job that usually goes from 10PM to 4AM, sometimes it goes until 7AM. She's the manager of a failing business so she's coordinating with the city to get the restaurant the liquor license because the owner doesn't speak English. She also has class on Saturday. Every other Sunday she has mandatory community service for 6 hours. This is on top of all of her homework. Also, since she's studying to become a doctor, she has to do clinicals (not sure exactly what they are, but she has to do 5 a month, she said they would each take a day). In addition she has to prepare her resumé and send it to everywhere that's accepting an internship. She has to work with the Co-op (internship place that will find one for her so she has 10+ interviews a month until she gets hired).


I have 4 classes. I go to school 4 days a week. I only have a total of 20 hours of school per week. I have a lot of free time. I don't even have a job. All of that free time leaves me thinking about her and that leads to poor decisions. It leads to me getting suspicious and worried about her at the same time.
We talked about what we wanted to do. She wants to try and make it work, but she was super hesitant. She doesn't think she can do it. She ended up not going to classes for 2 weeks last semester due to a breakdown from stress. If everything goes perfectly for her and she gets everything done, she said that I can visit in March.


March. That's 3 months away. What the hell am I supposed to do? She said that she was going to try and call as much as possible, but she won't be able to everyday (her words). Even if we do call, it will be in the 5 minutes that she walks to her next class. So, there's no skype, barely and phone calls, and texting will be scarce. Last semester she was bad with texting because she didn't know what we were anymore (relationship or not), but this semester her workload is worse so she isn't optimistic that she'll have time to talk to me.


Part of the relationship is that she can decide it's too much for her. She is allowed to say that the guilt of not being there for me, is getting to her. She has an incredibly guilty conscience so she feels awful for not being in the picture as much as she should. So, she can call it off if it becomes too intense.

So there's also things that don't go into the paragraphs that are important. She's also got an apartment in Philadelphia already for next semester. I can't visit when she's got classes because I am required to be with her when I visit. I can't go into her classes because I don't have keycard access (it's in the city, so there's a guard at every entrance). So, visiting will be extremely difficult. It will have to be a Saturday-Sunday when she doesnt have community service (i can't be alone in her dorm) and when she's finished all her schoolwork.


So, that's where I am. Writing it down didn't help much. At least I can read it all in one place now."

I'm looking to adopt a pet before he leaves that can keep me company.

The scenario - It's the office party. The desks have been pushed to the side and Dave from Accounts is playing a selection of terrible party songs as he pretends to be a superstar DJ. Management have provided drinks and a buffet. Attendance is not mandatory but is expected.

The party stops as you walk in. Is it really you? The mild mannered quiet one from HR? That outfit is something else!

You - you have turned up to the Christmas party wearing a very striking outfit (note - this will be a PVC/Leather outfit of some sort).

This is where you get to choose, you can play one of the following - 

The young one (18 to 25) - you are the office intern. You've been in the company for about 5 minutes. No one really knows you or your name...everyone wants to know you tonight.

The career one (26 to 40) - You have been with the company for a few years, very reserved in the office, very focused. This has been at the detriment of any relationship. Tonight you cut loose. Tonight you reveal the other side to your colleagues.

The management one (40 to 50) - You basically run this place. In the last few years you have got yourself in shape, a strict regieme with a personal trainer has you showing off an enviable figure. Your husband is a fat lazy mess and hasn't satisfied you for years. Tonight you are going to get that satisfaction.

My role will depend on your choice and we can figure that out.

Kinks - as well as the already mentioned pvc/leather, this will include - anal and ass play, boots, big cock, deep throat, rough sex

Won't include - gore, anything under 18.

The problem is now that I have finished uni and the majority of my friends have moved away, I have came to realise that we really don't have anything in common...

1st of all, sports. It is a huge part of my life, i use to compete trampoline internationally; I love climbing, hiking, scuba diving, skiing and of course gymnastics. In the past year she has only put the effort in to trying climbing and gymnastics once. this wasn't a problem at uni because i could do all these things with my friends, but now that they are mostly gone, i cant help but see girls at the climbing wall or ski slope and think, why cant she be like that? (she has no real interest in any sport so i cant even take an interest in what she is doing)

The same for non sporting interests, I did my degree in sport science, which despite what most people think, it involves a large amount of maths and physics, subjects that i find very interesting (love youtube channels such as ASAP science, smarter every day est.), but I cant discuss anything science related as she just has no interest. for example, i tried to talk to her about NASA planning to go to Mars. her response was to say ""I don't really know about that stuff, can we just watch netflix"" 
Her interests rarely go past what celebrity A did last week, or who celebrity B is sleeping with, something which I have no interest in at all.
At the moment I do have a friend doing his masters, so when I go to their partys, the main attraction for me is talking to people who can just discuss current affairs! its not even for the alcohol any more! 

the 3rd and final major thing on my mind, is our future. I have plan A through D as far as my career is concerned, plan A being joining the Royal Air Force (currently half way though testing process). Obviously this job will involve moving away for around a year and a half for training plus were ever i end up being stationed. she has been clingy in the past which makes me think she wont be able to deal with this. 
In addition, she has very little ambition to do anything right now, which i find horribly unattractive in a personality. she has even turned down several internship offers and a management position at the McDonald's where she currently works. Is she just expecting me to pay her way through life?

Despite all this, I do love and care about her, and she is a loving and caring person. The year we have been together has been great and there were times were i thought I could see my self marrying this girl. I don't want to end things, but I really don't think I can't see a future any more. If I cant share my interests or have a meaningful/fulfilling conversation with my girlfriend then what is the point?

I suppose Im asking if anyone has been in a similar situation, if so, what was your experiences, any advice?


TL;DR; After finishing uni, realised i have nothing in common with girlfriend, cant have a good conversation, dont like the same pass times, i have an ambitious career planned while she seems to have no plans at all. despite this i do love and care about her, but is it time to call it a day and move on?

I am looking into the Master's program in Computer &amp; Information Systems Security, a joint program between Computer Science and Information Systems. I have spoken briefly with the program director about the requirements, but I was hoping if anyone had any information regarding professors, course load, minimum GRE score (300?), or any general advice? I plan on taking only 1 or 2 courses a semester as I will be working full time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I have 2 of my 3 letters of recommendation but have no clue who to ask for the 3rd. None of my professors know me, I didn't do research with any since I'm not going into research. Any advice on who to ask and how to ask? Thanks!"
2py0lj,4,2014-12-20,The myth of successful people (Depressed Rant),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2py0lj/the_myth_of_successful_people_depressed_rant/,"Becoming ""successful"" was something that was brainwashed into my head growing up. Everything you do is to achieve your goal of becoming successful. Any actions you take that do not contribute to your goal are counter productive. Luckily I was also taught that being successful can mean whatever you want it to mean. As long as you are happy, you are successful. 

Now, money doesn't buy happiness. I believe this in my heart, that unlimited money doesn't mean unlimited happiness. (I'm sure it fucking helps though.) Now having said that, I do not believe very many people can be happy living ""check-to-check"". These are all things I had sorted out in my head. At 15, the earliest legally allowable(in that area for part time), I started working fulltime. I dropped out of school and graduated HS by age 17(A few days before my 17th Bday actually.) using a very-new-at-the-time online program.  No GED, full diploma, while working full time on varied shifts. I worked my ass off. I worked so hard my family told me to slow down on multiple occasions. 

By the time I was 20, I had a BA in engineering and 3 years experience working with electromechanical crap as well as a completed 1 1/2 year internship with a place so prestigious and badass I can't say what it is because it will/could identify me. But even to this day, it is a star on my resume. At my peak, I was full time student, full time employed, 30/hour week internship. I worked through it thinking ""This is it, once this is all over, I may rest."" I said that over and over, through tears and through the challenges that come with every persons life. I said it until I believed it. Days without sleep reciting what I will do when I may ""Slow down."" what I will do when I have ""Money"". I said it over and over like a chant, chanting it so that on my toughest days I could keep powering through. 

It worked. I had the education, I had a little experience, I had references from big names. My book of references is longer than my list of friends. There was once last challenge. I lived in a state with no hope for anyone wishing to do anything beyond lawn maintenance (Or, according to TV, producing Meth). My last and final challenge, before I could ""Rest"" was to find a job out of state and move away from the poverty that engulfs the state.

After 2 years of sitting around doing graveyard work, barely paying rent and surviving on food stamps and misc stuff I would do for cash I finally did it. I got a job in Seattle. Big city. Big Money. A new future. I said goodbye to my friends and my family and I set off on a journey that I only hoped would lead to a life of steady employment, steady paychecks, and a new future. 

That was 13 months ago, last November. The employer said, full time hourly with 80% travel and worked out of home for the remaining 20%. It seemed like a sweet gig. The first two months were awesome, I traveled around and quickly start paying money back to those I owed it. Then there was a gap. A single week without work. A single gap in 2 months? Meh. Idc. I'm comfortable. I had a week off work to relax, then went back to it. After that week there was a 2-week gap. 

This quickly degraded into working 2-3 days every couple weeks. The longest period I went without them contacting me was 2 1/2 months. They kept sending me blank schedules. Things went down hill. The company lost it's hold in the market and no longer does business on the US West Coast, but they didn't tell me that. They said ""Next week, for sure."" for months, not just to me, but the entire team. 

Little did we know, they were going to stick with ""Next week, promise"" until the entire team quit and the truth came out in small bits. They had no work, at all, none scheduled, none coming, they had businessy problems I can't pretend to understand. The bottom line is there was no work.

Thanks to the good graces of craigslist, I found somebody whom would let me have a room rent free for 1 month. I was pennyless, depressed, and panicking. All the furniture I bought had to be given away or sold. So much wasted money I didn't count it to prevent becoming bitter. My dream quickly fell apart. The person giving me the room said I could stay for a very reasonable price per month, because I was clean and respectful. 

I got a minimum wage job with a mom-n-pop company that promised expansion and profits. There was none, I knew that going in. This is where the story gets closer to present day. One friday afternoon, my boss brought everyone in and said the company is bankrupt, they're is no paychecks, they're liquidating and shutting down. I hadn't even collected enough money to move out of the craigslist room. I wasn't paid enough to save money, it was hand-to-month week to week. 

Now here is present day. 

I'm unemployed, I don't have enough money for anything besides food for 2 more weeks, and I found out on my Dec 6th birthday I must move out if I do not have money for rent. (Thats very agreeable. not mad, just sad.) 

Its 12/20/14, I have no job, no family within 1400 miles, no place to go at the end of the month. My last remaining fail-safe is to sell my car and buy a bus ticket back home to the state with no jobs, even lower minimum wage and even higher rent. 


WHY THE FUCK CAN'T A HARD WORKING INDIVIDUAL GET A JOB. WHY THE FUCK IS IT THIS HARD. WHY IS THE WELFARE SYSTEM SO FUCKED UP. WHY ARE THE STATES LAWS TAXING PEOPLE INTO POVERTY. MINIMUM WAGE ISN'T A LIVING WAGE. 29/h week is modern day slavery. I've worked so hard, come so far, I've practiced a level of self discipline that I've never seen in anyone around me. 

I've always avoided women, they distracted success. I avoided anything and everything I thought could prevent me from employment. I dedicated my young life to work as hard as I can in hopes of escaping poverty. 

AND FOR FUCKING WHAT. THE ONLY FUCKING SHITFUCKS I KNOW NOT STUCK IN THE MINIMUM WAGE FUCKHOLE ARE PEOPLE WHOM WERE BORN INTO MONEY TO BEGIN WITH. Fucking asshat never finished high school and he makes 60k/yr because his dad has friends. I don't know of any person whom has become successful who wasn't comfortable to begin with, and that alone, makes me want to give up, roll over, and die. 

How can people work so hard, for so long, for nothing? My job experience and education will meet the position requires exactly, and I'll never get a call. Whats the fucking secret? what am I doing wrong? I went to school. I got the experience. I got the fancy internship and references. I have a list of people whom will say I'm the reason they still have a job, but are unable to get me a job. 


I want to give up. Stop trying. I'm lonely, i'm tired, I don't want to play this game anymore. I don't know of anyone who has won, and I thought if I worked hard and did all the footwork, I wouldn't have to live off noodles and grilled chicken. On that subject, I'm hungry for something that isn't noodles or grilled chicken. I'm hungry for what it feels like to have a girl in your arms. I got a haircut recently (I needed it) and cried half way through because her hands were so soft. So gentle. She asked how my week has been and I nearly fell apart before I could mutter ""It was good, and you?"". For once I just want somebody to hold me and tell me its alright. I don't want to be strong anymore. This has been a marathon of poverty, tragedy, and depression that I no longer wish to race in. 

Rather than rising up it just feels like I'm going from one rock bottom to another. The most money I've ever had, was the two days before I bought furniture. I had $1300 and felt like I was king of the world. I got the first new mattress I've ever had and a kitchen table that wasn't for fucking midgets whom are 5"" tall. I had a fridge that made ice, sounds stupid but I put ice in everything while I was there. 

Whom is responsible for this economy? Whom must I snipe to send a message that this is not okay? How big of a bomb is needed to change the world? If only it were so easy. I'm tired. I'm lonely. I'm broke. I don't want to play anymore I just want to give up. If the rest of my life is nothing but fighting the battles of minimum wage than I refuse to live the life I am given. 


I look around... and I just don't understand. I don't understand how people got where they are at. How did they get that job? How did they get that house? How did they get so lucky? Because thats what it is. Luck. Prue fucking Luck. I guarantee I worked harder than anyone at Boeing. I remember not sleeping Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays because of a graveyard schedule, school, and internship. I've worked so hard people told me to stop. My family and friends are mystified that all my work has amounted to nothing. Of all people, I had a chance. I had the drive. I had the discipline. I had the rage that burned hot enough to power me through to where I am now. 

And now I'm here. Years later. Still broke. Still wondering how I'm going to make ends meet. Still lonely. And running out of steam. I wish I had more success story's to listen to. Success story's that don't rely on blind luck of the draw or ""My friend at @#%@#"" 

My only crime is that I thought I could do it. I thought I could carve a life out and hopefully live off more than just the bare minimum. I genuinely thought hard work would save me. I believed that with every breath in my soul. 

It was a lie.

2pycc6,0,2014-12-21,GK&amp;A : The Last 6 years,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2pycc6/gka_the_last_6_years/,"https://soundcloud.com/gkna I had so many Pms asking about my story, here is a short version of part 1! 


Now I must say at the beginning of all of this that due to some NDA's and other legal paperwork I will have to leave some things out, but I will do my best to tell it.

when I was 18, I had just dropped out of college after a girl broke my heart (my fault from drugs) and I really wanted to just not be in Canada. My parents divorced when I was young so while my mom lived in canada my dad lived in Washington DC, so on march 19th i began my journey.

After being there a few weeks i started volunteering at something called the Army Soldier Show based out of Fort Belvoir at the time. I was not excited at all, as i hoped to be working in some recording studio or just "" getting famous"" as alot of young artists dream, but when i got there i was in for a huge shock. The Army contacts out some of the best producers, musical directors, choreographers etc that work in the entertainment industry ( or at least have in the past and have the resume to prove it. 

I did anything i could to seem keen, willing to work and willing to work for free :p and after the 4 weeks i was there on the last day one of the staff members approached me asking what my plans were for the next year, whats your schooling background etc. I knew that if i said i did not have a degree i would not be considered for whatever it was so 18 year old me lied and said i graduated music production from berklee and i have this experience and that experience  bla bla bla. Long story short i was offered an internship working for a major division of Sony. 

2 days Later i was in NYC, hotel room in time square and everyday just walking across the street to MRS studios (at the time it was known as liberty studios  ) and for the first time ever getting my real taste of the music industry. Now let me be clear, i was coffee bitch. i ran errands, i had no real value contributing to the music but i did have celebrities walking by me constantly and i realized that i had my foot in the door. 

Half the battle is being able to even set foot in one of those recording studios without security tossing you out or the cops getting called, once i was in i knew i had to take advantage of it, i MUST network, i gotta suck up to whoever i have to so i can remain in this world and not just be that random dude who got us coffee one summer.

At this time i had been making little beats here and there on the side for fun but nothing ever phenomenal, and a few months later i was in a session and i had a A list artist ( im sorry i really cant say who! ) ask the interns in the room if anyone made their own beats, i knew this was my shot and i took it. only to be laughed and told me beats ""sound like a casio machine"" 

I was crushed, at the time i felt like i had put so much into and my dreams just died before my eyes, i quit the job and went back to canada. Not 24 hours past and i knew i made a mistake, and i knew any chance i had of me going anywhere in the biz that i had to be in America. 

So i started from scratch, Volunteered for the Army again and found my self with the same intership only this time it was for a division of Universal.
the next 4 years i work my ass off doing any odd media job i could, because you never know who you are going to meet. 

now last November there was some behind the scenes drama going on with a major label and someone who i had a worked for in the past who turned out to be a crook. I used this opportunity to step my way up in the ladder, knowing i would be in direct contact with the people i need to know to really break out into the mainstream market. 

Up until this point i had always traveled / worked alone, and i had 0 credibility back home as noone believe a word out of my mouth about any of it. Luckily my good friend Duncan took my word for it and headed down with me to baltimore for some meetings. In the next 2 weeks, We were in Nashville, Vegas , LA , Miami, then back out to LA for Grammy Weekend. Did not attend the Grammys,  but it was ok because we got to go to Meek Millz after party anddddd you can google that party and see pics. I signed a NDA no i cant say shiiiiit but, please go look lol.

will finish part 2 very soon! will cover the drug use and other things i skipped over!

2pygwp,1,2014-12-21,The past 7 years of my life,[deleted],NoFapChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/2pygwp/the_past_7_years_of_my_life/,"I am coming here because A:I'm new to reddit and B:to warn everyone what porn can do to you. 

I've grown up in church my entire life and was saved at the age of 12 at a church camp. I'm 20 years old now and to give a little background I've always been a really outgoing and easy person to get along with. I've always been fun to be around and a leader in my friend groups all the way through junior high, youth group, and high school. I even led FCA in high school for two years as the president. I got many compliments from teachers, coaches and administrators at school to my parents about how good of a student and person I was. Throughout my entire adolescence after I got saved in summer camp when I was 12 I became addicted to pornography. I got an iPod Touch for my 13th birthday and it just went downhill from there. 

I started watching porn everyday and I started fapping every single day for a good three years. It became something I would look forward to doing when I got home and it became something I would rather do than hang out with my friends. There were times in high school where I was going 6am-6pm at night with school and I would get home and watch porn for 2 or 3 hours when I had sooooo many other obligations I needed or should have been doing. I hurt so many girls feelings in high school because I was so bad with commitment (but in high school I never really understood the psychological tole porn was having on me) and I would literally only date girls that I thought made me look better.

When college hit thats when things got really bad and I started to notice. I didn't have my ego and status in high school to go off of and I began to become really judgy towards others. I was still watching porn as often as I could whenever my roommate was gone and whenever I had a chance to I would do it. I was continuing to struggle with relationships and commitment and I COULD NOT for the life of me understand why. 

Until this past summer after my sophomore year in college, was when I finally started to realize what was happening. I was living in my colleges town doing an internship and I found myself just coming home and medicating with porn every night. I wasn't talking to anyone because I was living in a house where my roommates were always out doing things and I was just doing this 8-5 internship and coming home and fapping all night. 

The moment it all made sense was when I watched the movie Don Jon. That movie hit me like a train. Then I went on to research and I found ""Fight the New Drug"" and the ""Fortify"" program. I got two accountabilities partners in June and thought I was set. I went three weeks without fapping right after that and I noticed this small glimpse of reality for about a three day period i like to call my ""grace period"". I relapsed after the third day and have been struggling ever since 6 months later.

PEOPLE, this porn addiction has messed with everything in my life. Not just me being able to have a real relationship, but I have become this superficial mess. I judge EVERYONE to a level that is completely unfair. I have absolutely no sense of direction or purpose and I'm in my 2nd semester of my junior year in college. By saying I have no sense of direction or purpose, I mean that I feel as if I've been doing everything just to try to impress others. 

I'm now a week free, and it's been good but I need everyones prayers. I now have no idea what is a real calling in my life from God and what is a superficial unfulfilling dream that I have come up with that is to please everyone else. 

I'm praying that when I kick this addiction, God has grace on me and allows me to see clearly in what I actually want to do for myself and not what I'm trying to do in my life to please and impress everyone else.

Porn WILL affect many areas of your life....ESPECIALLY your priorities and perspective on the world around you.

I'M PRAYING FOR YOU ALL.
GOD BLESS. "
2pyxjr,6,2014-12-21,Very long term investment questions,Turniper,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2pyxjr/very_long_term_investment_questions/,"I'm a American college junior with an eye toward eventually achieving FI, or at least getting close enough that I don't to worry about not working for a year or three.  Up until this year, all of the money I've made from summer work has gone towards living expenses and tuition, however I've finally gotten to the point where between scholarships, savings, and parental assistance, I've got my remaining years of school and living expenses paid for.  Additionally, I've got 8.50 an hour job as an EMT beginning next semester.  I expect to work about 20 hours a week there, and either to do research in computer science or intern as a software developer the next two summers.
I'm expecting to be able to save about 2-3k during each of my remaining (Between 3 and 5 total, depending on how classes work out) fall/spring semesters.  During each summer, I'll either pull 5k with zero expenses doing research, or around 8-12k with full rent and city living expenses doing internships.  All in all, I'm expecting to pull in some serious (For a college student) money in the next year or two.  I've got two goals here, the first being to save for a end-of-school trip or Europe or Asia, the second being to maximize my returns on this money.
So, if you were in my shoes, with somewhere between 10 and 20 thousand dollars coming in over two or three years, and weren't expecting to need to so much as touch this money for a long time, what would you do to maximize returns over a very long time period with very high tolerance for risk?"

2pzg83,0,2014-12-21,Need some insight on how frugal is too frugal?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2pzg83/need_some_insight_on_how_frugal_is_too_frugal/,"Hey guys. I'm a sophomore in college and recently started to read this subreddit. I'm majoring in engineering, but have always been fascinated with economics, money management, investing, etc. After reading many threads on here, I began reflecting on any decisions I make regarding spending. I'm just wondering how worried should I be about saving (in any form such as 401ks, IRAs, emergency funds, etc)? I'm thinking that if I worry about this too much at an early age, I'll miss the experiences that could end up being invaluable in life.

Here's the specific dilemma I am facing: I want to study abroad at some point in college. However, I cannot do so during the normal school year as the engineering classes I need are not offered/accredited abroad. Therefore, the only way I can study abroad is in the summer for about 3 weeks during the summer after this coming summer. Therefore, I have to consider my expenses between now and then.

Here's some background: I'm on a full scholarship to the university I attend and also am given an addition $4,500 to study abroad if I choose to do so. There are a couple programs I was looking at to study abroad. 1) Barcelona (which costs roughly 6.5k). 2) Prague (which costs roughly 6.5k). 3) Rome or Florence (which costs roughly 9k - 10k). With that being said, I feel like I'd enjoy my time most in Italy, but I'm pretty ignorant on what the other cities have to offer.

I have no debt, no loans, and 2.5k in my bank account. My parents offered to help pay for the study abroad, but I like to be independent, so taking money from them is not something I'm considering.

Here is my budget: 
$100 a month on food (can eliminate this as I have a meal plan that I should be utilizing more).
$500 a semester for frat dues
$250 a semester on books

I also believe internships (whether paid or unpaid) are more valuable as an undergraduate than just getting a summer job, so I don't really have any secured sources of income. The only income I get is a stipend from the school of $1,000 a year.

Sorry for such a long post, but I'm genuinely interested in hearing your opinions on whether or not you guys believe the study abroad experience is one that I should take? Thanks!

2q0j72,89,2014-12-21,[Surgeon Sim.]Paging Doctor Burke...,flamablep,LifeasanNPC,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeasanNPC/comments/2q0j72/surgeon_simpaging_doctor_burke/,"The pager on my hip buzzed, stirring my from my brief nap in the canteen.

**Surg:Ast:Burke:3B**

It took a moment for my brain to translate the pager code. Assistant Surgeon, for Dr Burke, theatre three b.

""I gotta run guys, I'll catch up with you later.""

My fellow interns nodded or ignored me completely as I dashed to the locker room to scrub up. I pulled open my locker and removed a set of green scrubs, changing quickly. All the while, my heart was pounding. *I was going to assist Nigel Burke, arguably the best surgeon in the world.* Few had been lucky enough to see him in action; rumour was that he could complete a brain surgery in under two minutes. I guess I'd have to see for myself. When I was dressed, I grabbed a do-rag from the top shelf of my locker and put it on, making sure that none of my hair was showing. Satisfied, I sprinted from the locker room to the operating wing, dodging other shambling interns and doctors.

I was already running thirty seconds late, which, in a life-or-death scenario, is dangerous. Thirty seconds could mean life or death. Pulling a set of latex gloves on my hands and a mask over my face, I passed through the decontamination room and entered the wing.

There he was. Doctor Nigel Burke. In the flesh.

He stood there stony-faced, a single hand outstretched. A clipboard hung from the side of the door and I picked it up, scanning through it.

""Patient's name is Bob. Thirty years old. Acute hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Requires a heart transplant.""

Dr. Burke said nothing, instead his hand flew forward a little. I held my breath and went to stand by the utensils, prepared to hand him whatever he needed.

He brought his hand down, hard, making me jump. It landed roughly on the sheet which covered the pre-prepared entry point, and he flexed his fingers, as though to grasp the sheet. After a moment, he gained a hold on the thin sheet, and whipped it sideways, scattering a few scalpels and drifting onto the floor. The patient's exposed ribs were brilliant white as Dr Burke laid his palm flat against them. *What was he doing?*

Intrigued, I moved forwards a little to stand beneath the heart-rate monitor. Dr Burke grasped again, gaining purchase  on one of the man's floating ribs, and tugging with all his might. The strangest part was that only his arm was moving- the rest of his body was stock-still. Upon further inspection I noticed he was not wearing latex gloves, and he had not even removed his watch. I spoke too soon, however, when the buckle freed itself before slipping from Dr Burke's wrist and landing wetly inside the patient's chest cavity.

Burke reacted quickly, grabbing hold of what looked like a claw hammer, grasping it by the head before smashing his now-clenched fist down onto Bob's sternum. There was a resounding crack and my eyes widened as the surgeon repeated the process several times, causing severe trauma to the patient's lungs and liver. 

""Doctor, what're y-""  My question was interrupted as Burke dropped the hammer, leaving it on the patient's throat, and flung shards of rib onto the floor. The bones rattle hollowly and I gasped as the doctor then proceeded to tug at the man's lungs with *his bare hands!*

""Dr Burke! you're going to-"" I exclaimed, as the trachea was disconnected and both lungs were hurled against the glass of the operating theatre.

I watched, speechless, as the surgeon pulled out every vital organ the man owned, save for his heart, until Bob's chest cavity was little more than a red gaping hole with a beating heart inside. How the man was still alive I had no idea; his blood levels were reaching dangerously low, and despite my urging, Burke said nothing. He flipped open the transplant box and grasped the heart with his bloody hands.

""You're going to decontaminate the ne-"" I stopped myself as I nearly tripped over what seemed to be the patient's small intestine.

Burke ripped the man's still beating heart clean from his chest and relaxed his fingers, letting the heart slip from his grasp. It tucked itself between the bed and the utensil tray, still beating weakly. Blood levels were critical, but despite this, Dr Burke slammed the heart into the patient's chest cavity even as a basketball player might slam a ball through a net.

""SUCCESS."" He barked, before turning on his heel and leaving the theatre.

2q0mhd,3,2014-12-21,[UK] Indirect Tax,hichew_,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2q0mhd/uk_indirect_tax/,"Dear r/accounting. I recently accepted an offer at a Big Four firm for Indirect Tax (conditional to me attaining the required degree class) - during my internship I really enjoyed the work and looking forward to start.

But my question to r/accounting is  - generally what are my options as an Indirect Tax professional for the future - although I can see my self working in the UK towards the latter end of my career, I would at some point love an opportunity to travel and work abroad - does Indirect Tax provide this opportunity?

I also see ""exit opportunities"" as a common theme here - is there any with respect to my chosen area? It seems like a niche area.

Hope you guys can help, would love some response, really could not find much on indirect tax careers.

2q0p8c,3,2014-12-21,[Seeking] Web Development Internship for the summer,[deleted],houstonjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/houstonjobs/comments/2q0p8c/seeking_web_development_internship_for_the_summer/,"Hi. I am a college student in New York whose family lives in Houston, so I am always back home during breaks. I haven't had much luck here searching for internships, so I'd like to know where to find and apply to internships in Houston.

I am currently teaching myself front end development and in a few months will be able to work with frameworks like Backbone or Angular. For now though I can just do basic JavaScript projects, but I am working very hard at learning on my own.

So I guess this isn't as much of a ""seeking job"" (although if someone is interested let me know) post as much as it is asking for resources on where to look for internships!

I'm also taking a Java class this spring semester, would be wiling to do that if web dev doesn't work out. Thanks."
2q0zt3,19,2014-12-21,I [30/F] have to decide whether or not to break up with my boyfriend [29/M] of two years by Wednesday,throwaway00012a,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2q0zt3/i_30f_have_to_decide_whether_or_not_to_break_up/,"About three years ago, I (30-year-old woman) was dumped in a very unceremonious way by a man I was crazy about. A month before, I had had to move in with a family member temporarily because of an apartment issue, I was under a huge amount of stress at my job, and the breakup led to depression for which I went to therapy and was put on an SSRI for about two years. This was not my first time dealing with depression and medication. 


However, something inside of me seemed to fundamentally change. I had always had a pretty normal libido, but after the breakup, I didn't care about sex at all, and when I started dating again, I couldn't make a connection with anyone. It was like I just didn't care about finding someone anymore. I know anti-depressants can cause libido changes, but even after I went off the medication, my low libido and feelings of detachment remained.


I started dating my current boyfriend (27 years old) about seven months after that breakup. I was very lukewarm about the whole thing, but he fell for me quickly and was very persistent. I tried to dump him about a month into dating, was talked into staying, tried again three months later, and was talked into staying again. I think there was another almost breakup another three months later, but that one wasn't quite as serious as my other attempts. Six months ago, we broke up for about a day because he wanted me to move in with him, I had hesitantly agreed, but I backed out before we looked at anything or made any decisions about our current apartments. He was extremely upset and said if I wasn't ready to move in after a year and a half of dating, I never would be and that I shouldn't have said yes to moving in if I wasn't ready. I told him I was upset about being pressured into an artificial timeline he had created for our relationship. 


I have never lived with a boyfriend before, and I wasn't sure if this was a person I wanted to spend my life with, let alone share a one bedroom apartment with. I was surprised at how upset I was by the breakup because I'd been so wishy-washy about how I felt, so when he called me and said he realized he was putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on me and he loved me and just wanted to spend time with me without any conditions, I was happy to get back together with him.


Fast forward to this morning when we had a very serious argument over sex. I currently work a full-time job, a part-time job, and am going to grad school. I can't quit my job because it makes me eligible for tuition remission at the university I attend, and I can't quit the part-time job because I'm doing the work I love and is the reason I went to grad school to get a new career in the first place. I also realized this past week that the taxes I'm paying on tuition remission have made it impossible to keep my apartment, and I am dipping into savings to pay for bills and groceries every month. Needless to say, I have been very stressed out for the entirety of our relationship, and I'm not graduating for another year and a half. 


I was writing a required internship proposal for three hours last night when my boyfriend started prodding me for sex. I was unshowered, exhausted from working that morning, and had just finished writing the proposal. I said no and we could have sex in the morning. He was a little disappointed but said okay. Morning came, and as per usual, I had no desire for sex. I actually *want* sex maybe once a month. Every other time, I just do it for the sake of making him happy. He began prodding, I reluctantly agreed, and then complained about how I never feel like having sex and was basically a cold fish. I was being a bitch. 


This obviously hurt him and made him very upset. He said he never pressures me for sex and if I say no he doesn't force me to, which is sort of true in that if I truly don't want it and say absolutely no, he'll leave me alone while being very disappointed. There's a lot of nudging and prodding for sex when we're together, and I typically eventually give in, and I can't blame the guy for trying.


He's always been very reasonable and logical when we have arguments. He said he does everything he can for me and expects little in return, but sex is a non-negotiable issue, he needs to have it once a week, and if I can't commit to that, we need to work something out or it's a deal breaker. This released a slew of pent-up emotions in me. For some reason, sex is a huge chore, and I don't enjoy it. I am an extremely independent, introverted person who needs a lot of space and alone time, and having sex when I don't want sex is a part of my larger issue of often feeling like my life would be easier if I were single. My boyfriend has talked about marriage often, and I've run hot and cold on the issue. I was warming up to it lately, but today made me realize marriage is a terrible idea and even moving in together is scary for me. 


It boiled down to him saying he's tired of me committing to things, then backing out of them while complaining about ever having committed in the first place. And he's right. I've felt so much uncertainty this entire relationship, and I don't understand why. I should love this man more than anything. He is incredibly considerate and affectionate, does everything he can for me, is handsome, in excellent shape, has a great job, and tolerates my extreme need for independence and solitude. Through the course of the argument, we realized my issue is that I have not yet decided if I have truly committed to making this relationship work, and the resentment over sex was just a symptom of that. 


I don't know if I can see myself with him for the rest of my life, and that's not a decision that can keep being put off. We can't be together ten years from now, living in separate apartments and only seeing each other on the weekends because I can't get my emotional shit together. There's a big part of me that feels like if I'm still not absolutely committed to this relationship after being together just shy of two years, it's not right to stay together. He's already said he's in it for the long haul and will stay with me until I tell him I don't want to be with him anymore. So this decision is entirely on me. I asked for time, and he said to tell him by Wednesday. Our relationship has been getting better since our argument six months ago, but obviously this underlying issue looms over everything.
 

With work and school, my relationship (and sex) feels like one more chore I have to undertake every week instead of being a source of happiness. My life would certainly be easier not having to take another person's feelings into consideration when I make decisions about what my life is going to be. But then I worry that when I graduate, I won't be so stressed out, and I'll realize I threw away the best boyfriend I could possibly have and no one else will put up with my shit. I've never been in a relationship even close to this long, and I have no idea if it's normal to have this many doubts. I think I love him, but doesn't loving him mean I'm willing to do everything to make him happy? Shouldn't I want sex with him? Shouldn't I want to move in with him? I feel so guilty treating him so badly, and I've made many efforts to stop my worst behaviors, but on days like today, I'm so drained from just worrying about someone else's needs and feelings that everything blows up. I fantasize about being relationship-free and just dealing with my own stuff from here on out.

 
If things have been getting better, should I just keep dealing with my commitment issues and feelings of resentment toward sex? Or should I pull the plug?


---   
**tl;dr**: I am unsure whether or not I am able to make a full, long-term commitment to my very loving boyfriend, and I feel like we've been dating long enough that I should already know the answer.

[UPDATE] Thanks everyone. I broke it off, and he said he respects my decision and understands that my circumstances have left me uncertain. It hurts very badly, but I know I have to do this to spare him and to figure out what my priorities are in life. Thank you for your help."
2q146h,5,2014-12-21,Requesting advices (another closeted guy),Iwannabecanadian,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2q146h/requesting_advices_another_closeted_guy/,"Hey guys, before anything I must warn you that english is not my native language and my grammar can be very shitty sometimes (jk,it's shitty all times)

I've been lurking this subreddit in the last few days, mostly reading other people cases and trying to apply the advices to my case. However I'm still felling the need to tell it to someone, so...

I'm the youngest son of a quite dramatic family, where my mom still somehow hold the lines into a liveable place. Between all the shit that my brother, sister, dad, etc does, I somehow turned to be the ""proud"" of my mom for simply not doing shit and taking care of my business as I should do. I'm currently 22 and since I discovered about my sexuality (16) I knew that she would accept it, but would be very dissapointed (came to that conclusion after some indirect questions), wich would result into a lose lose situation (she can't afford another deception). Aligning this with the complete stupidity of my dad around the subject and my financial dependence from them until I finish college, I decided to not tell anyone aside a few internet friends .My IRL friends were never been the most compreensible people also, leading to me slowly pushing them away from personal stuff.

The thing is, 2015 will be my last year of college and I'm shit scared of what comes next. Getting a job and a place to live will be hard things, but at least I know the directions and what to do about it. However, leaving my mask behind and ""starting to be gay"".... how the fuck does one do that? Oh, and now the aggravating factors : never told someone physically ; I'm a overral shy and reserved guy ; Not the most confident with looks (slim and pale white ;\ ).

Until now I've been so busy and distracted with the other aspects of my life (college and internship = holy shit) that only now I remembered to freak out. In fact, I  only realized that after accidentally watching a movie on TV called Shelter ,where the protagonist made me abusrdly jelly in terms of dealing with it. I know it's fiction, but...

Any tips and advices will be appreciated and sorry for the long text, thanks for reading it.

2q1dfp,29,2014-12-21,[Update]My GF [25 F] of 4 years wants me [25 M] to move in with her next year and I'm unsure as we are having more and more issues with each other,oscarneils,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2q1dfp/updatemy_gf_25_f_of_4_years_wants_me_25_m_to_move/,"[Original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/29r2m0/my_gf_25_f_of_4_years_wants_me_25_m_to_move_in/)

Ok, so I thought I should update this with new information.
We are still together and, shortly after I posted here, she started to have crazy sex urges. I mean, every time we were together, multiple times a day.
I obviously talked about it with her (why we weren't having sex before and why was she always in the mood now) and she told me it was because she was unsure if she was going to be able to keep her job (I mentioned that her job was not stable, in the other post). Her boss had just told her that she was definitely going to keep working for them, and apparently it had lifted a load of her shoulders.

This phase lasted for about a month (until mid of August). I have no idea why, but we are not having sex anymore. We had sex twice since then.
To my knowledge, nothing is troubling her. Her job is stable now, albeit tiring.
As for the domestic problems, they persist, but are more rare now. However, two things concern me... A LOT!

I have been taking classes at night, which end close to midnight and since my home is close to college, somedays I stay there (instead of going to her home, which would take me 40mins at least). I usually stay at her home at the beginning of the week and at the end of the week (work week), and in between I'm at my house. Sometimes (more and more frequent), at the end of the week, I get to her home and find out that the dishes for the past two days are not done (I'm usually the one who does the dishes). Fair enough, it's one person's dishes for two meals, but more often than not, this also includes tupperware, etc, that she uses for lunch. This week I got home and had a ton of dishes to do, most of them I hadn't used, and I didn't ask her to do them because I felt bad knowing that she was really tired that day.
This, paired with what I usually do around the house when I'm there, makes me feel like I'm doing a lot and she isn't.

The second thing that has me worried is that she loses her cool about anything. I actually spoke to her father about this, once, and he told me that he sees her mother in her when she's like that. Her mother is, in my opinion (and apparently everyone else's), insane.
For example, and I do realize this is an extreme scenario (unfortunately it's the only one that comes to mind right now), we lost a domestic flight recently. It was no big deal, we bough a one way trip to another city (my father was there and he was going to take us back), and we happened to miss the flight because she didn't notice the ""closing doors"" time. When I say that she didn't notice, I'm not saying I'm not at a fault. I also didn't notice the time, mostly because I trusted her to be correct (she told me that the flight was at 8:55, so I didn't even check the time, I just trusted her). When we got to the airport, we noticed that the line was empty and the stewardess informed us that the plane was already on the tarmac and we had lost it. I was mostly ok with it, these things happen and it could have been a lot worse (instead of losing 25€ each we could have lost 250€ each + whatever accommodations we had at the destination). She lost it and asked, albeit somewhat politely, if it was possible to contact the plane to let us in. The stewardess told her that it was impossible and she asked again. The stewardess told her, again, that it was not possible and proceeded to disembark us on the arriving section of the airport, so we could go home. This whole time she was talking about getting refunds for fees, etc (basically, trying to help us make the best out of a bad situation) and when she got us where we needed to go, my gf just kept walking, didn't even say goodbye or wait for the stewardess to finish the conversation. I actually heard her murmur to herself: ""well, that's nice"". I quickly said goodbye and we went home. On the way home she said something that kinda stung me. She said I wasn't that worried about missing the plane because it was not my money (I'm still finishing my unpaid internship) and that it's totally different when you lose your own money.
This really hit me, mainly because I'm ""working"" (the only difference between me and any other worker there, with similar skillset, is that I don't get paid) 12h or more a day. This is mainly due to the fact that my internship is a part of my course's curriculum, and I want to do my very best. Most nights, I sleep 5/6h, so I can get everything done.
This really frustrates me, because I feel like I should be working and earning my own money, and she knows that. I'm tired of being supported by my parents, and she knows that too. For me, it's actually worse to lose my parent's money over a mistake I made than to lose my own money.
Anyway, I mentioned this a couple of days later and she apologized for saying that (although she said that is what she felt, she just apologized for hurting my feelings). She did not apologize for her behaviour with the stewardess, and I have noticed similar behaviour in other situations.

I'm seriously considering breaking up with her, and it is driving me nuts. I love her and I doubt I'll ever be able to find someone as compatible with me like she is. However, the sex issue we've been having is not even close to being solved like I though a couple of months ago, and her personality (which I love for the most part) makes me very scared of ever getting married and having children together(how will she deal with a kid on a tantrum, for example).

If I do break up with her, it's going to be, for her, ""out of the blue"". We have our problems, but we are not mad at each other, nor have we ever been. So if I do that, it's going to come as a total surprise and shock and I'm afraid of how she'll react, both mentally and physically. A couple of years ago, we had a big fight and I went home. A couple of hours later I received a call from her, and I could only hear crying and gasps for air, no sound. Then suddenly, the call went dead, I tried calling back and no answer. When I got to her home, she was passed out on the floor.

Sorry for the long post (I didn't want to make this so long) and thanks for all the help you've given me!

PS: She is not a redditor, so I'm sure that the sex phase we went through is not a guilt trip induced by her discovering the post on reddit.

---   
**tl;dr**: The sex problems persist, even though we went through a month were we did it all the time. Some aspects of her personality still bother me, and I'm seriously considering a breakup."

**Background/Last Night**

This past week and month have been incredibly stressful for my bf. He's in Pharmacy school and has had two weeks of finals a huge conference he had to travel for and just stressful school stuff. This past week he began his rotation and one of his courses from the fall carried over. Some unforeseen problems arose in that class, and the professors were unforgiving. He has been pretty down and upset about this, and I've tried to tell him that it's just one class and that in the larger scope of things you'll be fine. Anyway, fast forward to last night we were out at a holiday party and having a good time. He was cheerful and seemed to be having fun, flirtatious with me, and I loved every minute of it. We also shared a very sweet moment last night before we both conked out and my heart kinda melted. 


**This Morning**

This morning I wake up with a raging headache and feeling like I got hit by a bus. He was very sweet to me and at this point I realized I had done something pretty awful to my eye-- it was blood shot red and painful. We had plans for brunch and food sounded like a good idea. Head to the brunch place, and obviously there's a wait. We duck into a coffee place nearby and talk about  job stuff etc. (pretty normal convo for us). He has been on edge for his internship stuff (he hears back next month for positions next year). Soon after we go to the brunch spot, and my eye is not fairing well; he tells me what he wants and runs to a nearby cvs to get me some drops. On his return he seems normal, and we start talking again and he seems down for some reason. So I ask if he's okay. He says he's stressed, which I've known so I ask what he does to relieve it. For me it's going to the gym, and he doesn't stick to it regularly enough to gain the benefits (he's naturally just fit). He has dabbled in drugs when he was a teenager/early 20s, but it's been recreational for the past few years. So to my surprise he mentioned wishing he had weed so he could just not think. I don't remember if the conversation went far after this, but our food arrived. I wanted to change he topic to something light and I asked what one of his fav moments of college was. This morning was reminiscent of some of my last brunches in college. He didn't recollect anything and asked me mine. I was telling him my story and I looked up and he had his head looking down at his plate of food and looked visibly upset. 

I became really concerned and I reached out to him but he didn't want to be touched so I waited. After, a few minutes I asked if he was okay and he said he was fine (clearly wasn't). He rubbed his eyes a few times and drank water, soon after he went to the restroom. After about 15 minutes of silence he seemed a bit normal and asked me some superficial question and I went along with it. 

On our drive back we were somewhat normal and I was relieved to make him laugh once. He asked me if I enjoyed brunch, and I told him the food was great but I was worried (implying what happen). He said he was off and that's all. As we got closer to my place ( he was dropping me home) I asked if I may ask what happen and he said he didn't want to talk about it. I didn't push it and when I was about to get out, I told him if I said or did anything that I'm sorry. That was it. 


**Help**

Please help me! I don't know what's bringing him down, he's so so hard on himself. If only he knew that how hard he's working he's capable of such amazing things. I'm in awe of what he's done already and I wish he could just take a vacation from all the stress he's been feeling lately. I know this problem may be easy for other couples, but we both struggle to open up to each other. We have work to be done there.

Had a great night at holiday party, went to brunch next morning bf was visibly upset, and I don't know how to make it easy for him to open up to me. "
2q1gs6,6,2014-12-21,"I (22F) had been physically cheated on by SO (27M) 6mo ago, currently inappropriately texted an ex and want to salvage the relationship. All help appreciated!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2q1gs6/i_22f_had_been_physically_cheated_on_by_so_27m/,"This is my first time asking for help on Reddit and am very grateful for any constructive advice for how to save the best relationship of my life! So sorry for the length, brevity is not my strong suit.

So, the story goes that my SO and I have been dating for almost 2 years and is the love of my life and the best thing that has ever happened to me. I know it is still very early to say this, but before this incident I saw very real plans of marriage with this person who has improved me and made me happier than I have ever been before.

He went overseas for the summer for an internship and cheated on me with a girl of his own race he went on a couple dates with a month or so before he came back. I found out by seeing a message to his roommate warning he might bring a girl home and when confronted he admitted he had physically cheated but had not slept with her. He said he wanted to experience dating a girl of his own culture and race (in his home country) and realized it was wrong, didn't want pursue any other relationship and wanted to fix things. Dealing with this alone in our 1 bedroom apartment in a city that is still new to me was very hard. But somehow, 6 months later we are better than we had ever been. We worked through my trust issues slowly and he tried to make me feel comfortable by having access to all of his passwords. I may have over examined on occasions but he handled my questions with patience and always made me feel reassured. I can say now I am more comfortable than I ever was before the incident, and feel we are much stronger, in love and on the same page than before! 

Rewind to 2 weeks ago, an ex texted me out of the blue wanting to talk. I am not a super social type of person, and we have been on amicable terms (but very infrequent contact) since we dated in high school 4+ plus years ago, so honestly I responded because I have trying to practice actually texting people back lately. We started out chatting but he was persistently flirting in between well wishes and friendly questions. After a point I decided he was full of shit for having double motives despite knowing I had an SO and so did he. So my best explanation is I decided to do to him what he did to me the brief times we dated on and off by simply dropping me for no reason. I flirted with him by explicitly talking about our past (NOT engaging in sexting) and then snubbed him by dropping all contact despite his texts over and over. This is not at all all like me, I have never even had a one night stand, and all I can say that after coming into my beauty and self confidence after high school and him doing to exact opposite after pining after him as a teenager, I... felt a little pit of power in fucking with him in a random turn of events over a night. Immediately felt guilty despite not meaning anything I said, and realized it was incredibly childish and decided I would not let it happen ever again. Part of me felt vindictive for being nice trying to have an earnest conversation only to be berated for one reason. 

I'm not entirely sure why but I didn't delete the texts and basically forgot about them. I considered telling my SO but felt too embarrassed if he were to ask about the content, and felt it would be too hard to explain. Day before yesterday when I asked my SO to bring my phone to work because I had forgotten it, he confronted me about the texts after having going through my phone for the first time that I knew of. He felt hurt and betrayed and deservedly angry. He was very disturbed by my words, and said he was leaving to go to his parents by he time I got home. I was noticeably upset and couldn't contain myself at work, having never been the wrong party to this extent. Having a good amount of anxiety when I arrived home it was hard to articulate my reasons and could mostly say how I didn't mean anything I said, how in love with him I was, and how sorry I felt for making him feel like that because I knew the feeling so well. 

Since then we have discussed it a couple of times and he very unsure he can ever feel better and has been on the verge of breaking up and making me move out. I know he is only very hurt because of how fresh it all still is (and he is new to being on the cheated end) and after asking him to give it some time and let me prove he can trust me again and help him heal we are for the time, together. I'm doing all I can to give him his space, be honest and articulate when he wants to talk, maintain a friendly exchange throughout the day, cook for him and take care of him because he can't, bring him flowers and tell him how much I love him and miss him. We have been so incredibly in love and have had so much fun over the past months. We have both said we love each other more than we've loved anyone before. 

So please give my any advice from fixed relationships after cheating so I won't let something so stupid ruin this.

tl;dr- After being cheated on and recovering to be better than before, I explicitly flirted with an ex and dropped him just to return the favor from years before. Now my SO doesn't know if he wants to fix things. "

In detroit there is a Motion design/VFX house that is exactly what I want in a company. Amazing building and office space and they make projects that excite me. So needless to say I want to apply for an internship/job. A job would be preferable because I need to make money for my following year. But with this place I would probably take an internship. 

So my question is basically how do I go about improving my chances with this place. I follow them on all social media, am connected with their creative directors on LinkedIn and other artists there. I might have a possible network connection that I can use as well. 

I just fear that my work will be sub par compared to what they make, but I just want an in. even if I make animatics or hell just watch. I want to get in there and learn from these people. Should I send my reel to their job application email as well as to some of their directors on LinkedIn? or one at a time as to not seem to pushy right away?

2q1tbe,2,2014-12-22,Inadvertently went from an open relationship deal to a polyamory paradigm - my SO hates my partner,[deleted],polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/2q1tbe/inadvertently_went_from_an_open_relationship_deal/,"I am a 24F dating (and recently married) the sweetest 29M on Earth. We will call him A.

When I finished my degree at uni, I moved to another city that was 2 hours away from our hometown and was separated from my back-then fiancé for a good 1 ½ year for an internship. At some point, I met some people who made me realize that the fantasy of being in an open relationship and polyamorous was actually feasible. I cheated on my fiancé with one of my friends, whom we’ll call F (24M), apologized and tried to move on. I thought I would never have to deal with this issue ever again until that internship was transformed into a full-time permanent job: my then newlywed husband accepted to move away to this city with me to start a new life.

From there, I realized that my desire to have an open relationship had become harder and harder to restrain. A therefore accepted that I would be sexually involved with my friend F, with several rules that I agreed to: I however realized that I had trouble fully adhering to them (rules involving protection during sex, no hickeys on the neck, trying to not make it become a habit/routine, telling him in details our encounters, etc.)

Recently, I realized I also had trouble being honest with my husband about our encounters and I fear it is because I still felt guilt about it and couldn’t compare them to any my husband would have had, since he is the most monogamous person on Earth and would never look for another partner. I tried to be the most honest possible, only after he managed to extract all the info from me after several attempts; he also wanted to see if F was also trustworthy and tried to extract some info from him, but realized that the stories did not match (either because he was lying or just blatantly forgot about our encounters). A is really hurt that I am unable to be honest, that I compulsively kept on lying on my encounters and that I seem to defend my partner as a result of my guilt. He considers F accountable for the lies, although I do not think it is my friend’s responsibility to tell him the truth about our encounters and to respect the rules since I should be the one enforcing them…

Recently, I wanted to organize a party home and told him that F would come: he said he was fine with it. However, the moment my friend stepped in, my husband just hid in his office and said he wanted to crush his head on the wall, all because we lied too much to him in the past. So I kicked my friend out within the next 30 minutes and he said this was the rudest thing to do, invite someone and then kick them out without even bothering talking to him. My friend F cares about me, I care about him, but he hates my husband and the same goes the other way around. They don’t want to see each other again and F and I thought that it’d be better if we stopped our intimate relationship.

I care about my marriage and wondered at some point if I should just never bother thinking about open relationships. I think the issue is that I inadvertently became polyamorous and was not just in an open relationship, as one of my friends pointed out: it seemed more like I had a second boyfriend than some casual sex with a friend.

What kind of discussion should I have with my husband? Is it possible to consider polyamory in our paradigm with a monogamous partner? Should I see a psychologist for my compulsive lying issues? Would stopping my intimate relationship with F solve our issues or would it just defer them in time? I’m just really lost…."

So, hear me out here. I'm a college sophomore with a decent resume, in a highly ranked state school, good business program, 3.9 GPA. Should definitely be able to get an entry level internship, no doubt, especially some of the less serious ones I've applied for..

But I've only heard back from 2, and they had already found someone. The rest simply haven't answered the original email with my resume and cover letter. 

I spent a really, really long time trying to write a really good cover letter for this finance position. The ad specifically said they're trying to fill it immediately. I sent my app in on Thursday, 2 days after they posted the ad. 

Here's my question: if I don't hear back by this Thursday, is it ok if I call the office and ask to be transferred to the recruiter, and ask her about the status of my app? I know this may seem aggressive, but I'm tired of not hearing back and this is one I worked especially hard for. Better this than nothing, right?"

Anyone experienced the same?

ISP says there is no disruption of service, I get 10 to 14 ping in every other online related application and/or game.

I used to have ~20 ping in LoL, now it's at ~60. I know, 60 is not a big deal, but I can feel the difference.

I am just looking for people who share the same problem and maybe have found a solution.

Yes, I restarted my router, if someones gonna ask.

And it's not only my computer, it's every computer in my home intern network that struggles to deal with it's ping in LoL but in no other application.

IP is not blacklisted on any DNS server, which I know can cause these kinds of problems.

Second thing: I tracert my connection to Rito, there are some timeouts.

I am going to try manual routes using Riots IP list released on their player support page, but this will 100% take a while.

So, anyone out there who knows what I can try?

*(No changes with and/or without:*

*ipv4 with auto/manual dns and ipv6 disabled*

*iphs disabled/enabled*

*resetted router)*

I think one of Riots datacarriers has a problem right now or has had a server migration that screwed some people over."
2q28wl,78,2014-12-22,Finally feeling the glory of God for the first time in years,1934escapes,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2q28wl/finally_feeling_the_glory_of_god_for_the_first/,"I just finished my first semester of college, and to be honest: it was a lot rougher than I thought it would be. I went to boarding school, so I thought the transition would be a piece of cake, but so many things have made it so difficult: the difficulty of classes (especially going from a primarily humanities high school education to majoring in computer science), a death in the family, difficulty in making friends, difficulty in ""keeping myself together.""

An added difficulty was reconnecting with God. I became a Christian in middle school and tried to keep it up my first year of high school, but eventually fell completely off the bandwagon. I had gone to neither church nor Christian fellowship in years. But starting college, a Christian fellowship on campus reached out to all of the freshman, and I decided that now was the time to reignite.

It was so difficult at first--realizing how little I remembered of the gospel, or how little I knew in the first place. The discomfort of worship in front of others. Not feeling moved during service the way I wanted to be.

I've found it hard to find a style of worship that suits me. I feel like everyone is trying to offer things or teach me something, and that is all good. But (and I realize this is so lame) I was looking through Tumblr tonight, and decided to look up Bible quotes, like hoping maybe something would tug at my heart you know? And dorky as it is, it finally has.

For the first time in years, I felt something. I don't even quite know how to describe it. I was looking at one of those silly stereotypical Tumblr posts--the kind with a filtered picture of coffee/some faceless girl in a sweater/a forest/etc in the back with white text on top--and the text was of a bible verse, and it just made me feel a little bit of the sort of spiritual satisfaction I haven't felt in ages ages ages.

I was so close to doubting God. I felt like I was doing the whole Christian thing just because I had to. The one time I went to church this semester was a drag, Christian fellowship was a drag (when I wasn't sleeping through the sermon), freshman girls' bible study was a drag--everything was just so bland and useless and hopeless.

But I really hope this is the start of something, a kind of change. I know it won't all happen at once, but hopefully things will start to turn around from here.

I've been thinking a lot recently about God and His plan for my life. I feel like oftentimes people fall into what they do, but I think I'm at that special point in life where everything is big and bright and I'm facing a neon truth: Anything could happen. I could be anyone and do anything.

I was talking to my friend the other day, a boy in my introductory computer science class. There's been a big cheating culture in the class, but the two of us and our group of friends have been working so hard to stay out of it and to stay honest. But of course he's angry--the curve is ruined, his grade is ruined, he'll never be able to compete with these kids for internships, he'll never get a job, the world was ending. All of my friends are so angry.

And despite just receiving my final grade in the class--a C--I feel so calm. And in the middle of a coffee date with a Christian friend, I realized why: I've realized that God has a plan for me. Why am I the way I am? And it sounds so silly to say, but I'm so excited by all the things God has in store for me. I feel like Gideon, ""O mighty man of valor."" (Judges 6:12) Why am I so afraid and upset by everything all the time? God made me, doesn't that mean I can do great things? I feel so full of possibility; I'm so grateful for everything that God has done for me and for all He has crafted me to into.

I'm so sorry to subject you all to this rambling, but I'm at home right now and my whole family is atheist, and I feel like a dork talking about this with my Christian friends over Facebook while we're all away from school. I feel like everyone likes to keep things laidback all the time, nothing ever gets *real* or serious ever. It's weird when big stuff happens. So I just really wanted to share all these things I've been feeling with someone, and I hope it's okay that I've shared this all with you.

TL;DR Freshman fall thoughts on God after years of distance. I feel like I'm at such a special time in life and so full of possibility, so excited to see God's plans for me. I really feel like I could make an impact on the world."

2q2ijt,1,2014-12-22,Getting a job with Network+,[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/2q2ijt/getting_a_job_with_network/,"Hey guys,

So I am on winter break and I have been studying for the Network+. I should be ready to test for it in a couple weeks. I know most of you guys say it's ridiculously easy but I actually found it a little difficult for me to fully understand all the concepts. I have zero networking knowledge until I started studying for the Network+.

So my question is, once I am certified, I will have a Network+ and a B.S in Information Systems from a state university but not a lot of experience other than two internships and one that dealt with software support for a proprietary system. Do you think I will be able to land a Help Desk job upon graduation? My ultimate goal is a job in networking but I know the path I need to take is to get experience first. I am just hoping I am able to land a job right after I graduate.

I do plan to start studying for my CCNA right after the Network+ so hopefully, with a CCNA, Network+ and a Bachelors, I will be able to land a job. Also how can I tell if the Help Desk job is Help Desk or NOC? I don't see a lot of NOC jobs but I see a bunch of Help Desk openings. I have read somewhere that they are very similar but I'd prefer a NOC job as it seems to be a better starting point for the networking field.

One last thing, if you are a Network Admin or Engineer, could you message me your salary, how many years of experience you have and what are you are located. I'd like to get a realistic idea of what Network professionals make other than payscale.com and salary.com.

I am a senior nursing student that has just been offered a med-surg intern position, but am in the process of interviewing to be an intern in the neuro ICU. I am really drawn towards the ICU (from what I've seen shadowing), but have no real nursing experience outside of clinicals. Granted if everything goes well during the internship, it would hopefully lead to a full-time position. Taking everything into consideration, I was looking for some opinions regarding new nurses in the ICU. I've heard again and again that new grads should experience some time on a med-surg floor, but would transitioning from an internship to a RN position in the ICU be so difficult? Basically, I am afraid of transitioning into the ICU as a new grad.

2q2ojg,5,2014-12-22,[b/S][Cm/Cf] Asking Sister for Cohabitation.,[deleted],incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/2q2ojg/bscmcf_asking_sister_for_cohabitation/,"[This post feature my own underaged sexuality- possibly triggering for some]

Hello Comrades. I'm 25, Male. I post this here for advices for one of my important event in my life. Therefore, I think it is important that you folks understand the span of events that makes up this particular present.

Background: I cannot give specific backgrounds to personals involved as it is not a static unit. However I can give some general insight into my family background. My family is non-religious (means no church, no religious education was forced) - but had this notion of religious identity. And was very conservative towards sexual matters. Sex outside marriage was really a taboo. So you could imagine how incest would be like. My story is 14 years long- I will point some of the important events that creates this day in chronological order. 

Event 1) I was 11 years old. My father died when I was 7. So me, my mother and my sister was living with our (father's) extended family. When I was 10 one of my uncles (father's brother) moved abroad with their family. So there was only my family and my father's another brothers family living in the big house. They had 1 daughter (my cousin) of my age. My mother was a nurse.

Sorry if the background is enormously detailed. So, my sister was 18 years old then. She was taking a gap year before university. Most often she would be home. One day my mother and uncle's family gone for a marriage. I hated crowded events- so stayed with my sister. During this time I only had mildly developed sexual fascinations and fantasies (like wanting to touch a girl's ass/tits). But I never made that attempt with my sister. Although, I like to look at her butts, tits etc. 

So, we were alone. She asked me if I want to take a bath with her. I was very excited. We both bathed fully naked. I could see her tits, pussy and ass very clearly. I must say, she was very beautiful and had very attractive tits and ass. After the shower, she kneeled down and started sucking my small dick. I found it so good. She started kissing me. And that day we laid down on the bed naked hugging each other. I also sucked her breast. This continued whenever we're alone or safe to do it. 

But when she went to university, this stopped and never happened for another 3 years. I thought she found it very exploitative.

This was the defining moment of my maturity and sexuality. I developed lot fantasies with her. But I was too afraid to ask. It is not like for some of you folks- who can talk freely about sexuality.

Event 2) I was 14. She was 21. She pursued an internship in journalism. One day I asked her If I can get a 20 bucks. She said she will give me If I massaged her back. I agreed. She in her bikini, in her room. While I was massaging she asked me to remove her panties and massage her buttocks. So I started massaging her butts. I thought She is allowing me to fuck her. (My sexual curiosity was very high). So I kissed one of her butt cheek. Moments after that she left the bed really quickly. I thought it really was a bad idea. She never spoke to me for days. Some days after this, she moved away from our home to another state. Idk why. But it was always depressing for me - as I thought I was the reason. She eventually got a job, and also got married. 

Event 3) I was 16. So lets come to my cousin sister. We are of the same age, we studied together in the same school. We were really close. Childhood friends. One day we were studying laid down. (hope you get the position). I always had my own fantasies about her. So i decided to try it mildly. We were in the study room. I touched her buttocks, while she was wearing her night track suite. She never resisted it. So I took it as a yes and started going down. I drawn her tracks and panties down. I kissed her butt cheeks. She unbuttoned her shirt, allowing me to touch her tits. So Started kissing and sucking it. This happened over the days- again and again. We never talked about it, we were very silent while doing it. Like having a guilt. But one day her dad finds this out. They caught us on the spot (while i was licking her breast). My mother, my uncle shouted at both of us. It was really depressing and embarrassing. After some weeks, they also moved away (may be because of this). My mother was very angry/bitter to me after this. We never really talked much. 

The family divided the inheritance- sold the family house. Extended family was scattered. Me and my mom moved to another place. My sister came there once in a month. By this time, she was a professional journalist, married to a doctor. 

Event 4) I was 18. My life was really bad for the past 2 years. Very depressing. A super-nerd school. Boring evenings. My mothers mental health got weak. My sis and I decided to move her into a care home, as I was going to uni. She was 25. Before going to Uni, she invited me over to her home (which is very far from my home). We never talked about our incestous lives. It was very embarassing to talk to her even. 
I was very ashamed to even look at her face at that day. She said ""it's okay, I have moved on - you also should"". The same day, while she was cooking for me- i approached her form behind the back. and upskirted her - and injected my penis into her (This was the first time). She never! resisted it. I fucked her and also ejaculated into her. She was breathing heavily. 

But suddenly, I thought it was very stupid. I left immediately. I thought it was very bad idea- and cursed myself for doing it. I myself imagined what she will be thinking. I got into a bad state of depression 2 weeks before going to university. But she sent me a mail ""Thats okay, don't blame yourself. But I want you to know, I'm married- this should not happen again. Love"" - this helped me get my consciousness. I left to uni. 

After two year in Uni, i learned my sister and her husband got divorced. Ironically enough, her husband was caught with his aunt having sex. But it was not her decision to divorce. He himself felt it was necessary. 

Event 5) I was 22. My mother died when i was 20. I have myself moved on. But still I think about my sis. Sexually. I got a job, and moved to London. She was a film journalist based in France. The only time we met again, was on my mother's funereal. Which was not attended by my cousin for various reason.

I discovered my cousins profile over though fb. Sent her friend request. We lost our contact for around 6 years. Never known anything about her. She was very excited to find me. We chatted about a lot of thing- not about our sexual adventures though. I learned that she disowned her family, and become independent. 

One day she said, she loves me And she want to live with me. I really thought about it a lot. I accepted her proposal. She moved in with me in London. When I sent this news to my sis, she said she is really happy for us. We lived a happy 2 years life (cohabitation). During this time, my sis sent me lot of pro-incest advocacy stuff. But my cousin/lover died in a car accident last year. 3-4 Months of depression. Lost my job. 

Present) After she died, my sis (32 now) and I were in a good connection. We skyped etc. Helped me move on. She is still single. Moved to London last month with a Job. We never had chance to meet yet (for various reason). But I think I'm in Love with her. In all its emotional sense. i want to be with her. I think my emotional attachment with her is very strong, solid. We're meeting the day after tommarrow (24th dec). I will be proposing for cohabitation. We don't have any more family strings attached. But remember, after the last incident our relationship was very emotional and caring. Never sexual. Also, she is a pro-incest. She tweet about sexual/bodily rights all the time. But still, I'm not sure. 

I was also part of pro-incest advocacy- for legal and medical rights. Many of the taboos around incest (like same-sex practices_ is still maintained through social construction in science (see Foucault's history of sexuality). I learned about this thread from a member of the advocacy. She said, this group is very helpful in relief/ and advices. So I would like to hear how do you think I should approach her.

2q3933,7,2014-12-22,Hooking up with the ex - Part 2 (tits),[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2q3933/hooking_up_with_the_ex_part_2_tits/,"
This is a series of stories about hooking back up with Jess, my first HS girlfriend, after two years with someone else. Here goes, names changed to protect the innocent.


Continuing where the backstory left off, Rae (my soon to be ex) came back home, decided she wanted the other guy, tears were had, I'm sorry and lets remain friends, bla bla bla. I ended up moving out of the apartment, leaving Rae and my cousin living there. I moved back home with my mom until I figured out where I was going. Jess started a new job at a salon, something that she went to school for.

Not wanting to be a total ass to someone I cared about, but just didn't want to date, I started hanging out with her. It was a lot like when we dated, we would hang out at her house most of the time, but since we were in the time of year that wasn't freezing, we could go out and do stuff. Her parents seemed thrilled that I, complete with an education, an internship, and a well paying job offer on the table once the internship completes; was back in her life. They pretty much left us alone, didn't say too much when I was picking her up to go somewhere, and were a lot easier going than they were when we dated. If only they knew... Jess and I would text fantasies to each other randomly. Or really it was more of her asking what I wanted to do to her at any given moment. I told her about my foot fetish, something that I had kept from her the whole time we were actually dating. 

**For those keeping count through all of my stories, there are 7 girls who know about my foot fetish, 5 of which I've been sexual with. All who I have been sexual with have indulged me. Seriously just tell them you're into it and they will probably at least try it. This is my ""life lesson"" that I would go back and tell my 15 year old self given the chance. **

She had probably the best response you could expect from a girl you just told this to: 

""I love that you can take a part of the body that everyone thinks is ugly and make it beautiful.""

I took it one step farther: ""I want to lick stuff off of your feet, like have you crush it and I'll eat it. I've always wanted to try it.""

""Like strawberries? I'm sure we can find something here sometime, it sounds kinda hot"" she sent back. The follow-up was even better:

""I've always loved giving pedicures at work, I might be attracted to feet too. I want to try this stuff with you."" This line immediately drove me to fantasizing about her at work, rubbing herself with, kissing, and licking some hot girl's freshly pedicured feet. Knowing her openness to new things, this didn't seem outside of the realm of possibility, making the fantasy even better. I couldn't wait to see her again, but life didn't cooperate for a few weeks.

I was sitting at home on a Friday night, playing Counter Strike. Typical nerd-out night! I wasn't planning on going anywhere or doing anything, so I was in a pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt when I got a text. Jess was bored, wanted to be away from her house, and wanted to know if she could come over. I said sure, I'm just playing a game but will quit when you get here. She showed up with a pizza from Papa Murphys, which I thought was awesome. Girl + pizza + Counter Strike was the formula for a good night in my book. Note to the wise, though, don't try making one of those on a Pizzazz, it will fail miserably.

After eating, we go up to my room. I'm not really sure what she wanted to do tonight, so I ask. Best answer ever: ""Fuck my tits, they need some cum."" Holy crap, she came here for that... You don't have to tell me twice. She lays down on my bed and I straddle her to do a little making out first. My pajama pants are still on, and I am pitching the biggest tent ever as I bend down to kiss her. While our tongues swirl around each other, she reaches down and rubs my cock through my pants. She has the perfect grip, where her hand slides up and down effortlessly, but not so tight that she is rubbing my clothes on my cock. She really is awesome with her hands. After a few minutes of this, I feel a wet spot starting to soak through my pants, and she tells me it's time to do what she asked. I climb off of her and remove my pants and boxers as she removes her shirt and bra. I climb back up and slide my dick between those DD tits. They feel so soft and smooth against my hard cock, I can't help but reach down, grab them, and squeeze them around myself. They are big enough to easily wrap around me. In hindsight I should have grabbed some lube first, but in the moment this felt amazing. She adjusted the pillow under her head so her head was elevated enough to watch my cock sliding towards and away from her face. As she gets more and more turned on by what she is seeing, she started sticking her tongue out as I was reaching the top of my stroke and just flicking the head of my cock with it. Over the next few strokes, this slowly turns into sucking, so I would do a full stroke through her tits, up to her waiting mouth. The head of my cock would just graze her wet lips before she would part them just enough for me to fit. I would enter just a little bit, she would give a few swirls of her tongue, and I would pull back. I'd pop out of her mouth, feeling the sudden change of temperature from her warm mouth to the cold air, and go back down until my head was below her tits; now wet with a mix of pre-cum and saliva.

While this feels really good, the imagery of it is what really turns me on, so I don't last more than a few minutes. I tell her I'm close, and she starts encouraging me, talking dirty to me and telling me how much she wants my cum. I think we both expected me to cum between her tits, leaving a mess running all over her clevage that she could just rub it in. Maybe this is why they felt so soft; I thought, since she has no problem getting them covered in cum and rubbing it in. But, it didn't work out that way. The squeezing from her tits and the angle of my cock made me cum with such force that it went over them, up over her chin, and landed on her face. In a porno, I would have moved it around to cover her whole face, but this ended up being a big spurt right onto her right eyebrow and just touching some of her hair, 5 more spurts all over the right lens of her thick, black librarian glasses, a few dribbles on the bridge of her nose, bridging the gap between her glasses and her nose, and just a little bit of drippage onto her clevage.

I immediately apologize profusely, because I felt bad and wasn't trying to do this. In her usual style, she giggles that I'm freaking out and responds ""Don't worry about it, it's kinda hot!"" I follow her into the bathroom to help clean up and she stops before grabbing a tissue. She stands there for a minute, admiring my artwork in the mirror. If I'd have known that, I'd have done a better job. Sadly, this is the only time I get the opportunity to cover her face. She takes off her glasses to clean up, and the cum strings from her face to her glasses as she pulls them off. I offer to help, but I'm not sure how I actually would because she seems to have it pretty under control.

We get her cleaned up and she leaves. Wow, she really only came here for that. And pizza. Feeling like a boss, I go back to playing CounterStrike. The next few encounters are just as good!"
2q3hvs,2,2014-12-22,Employer Matched 401k or Roth IRA,kondoleon,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2q3hvs/employer_matched_401k_or_roth_ira/,"Hi all,

I started my first job out of college about two months ago.  I currently make 47K per year.  My employer gives us the option of contributing to a 401k plan, for which they match 50% of my contribution up to 10% of my salary, vested for 3 years.  I've been contributing 20% of my salary thus far in order to take full advantage of the free money.

I also have a Roth-IRA with vanguard, which I plugged $3,000 into last year during my Summer internship and haven't touched since.

A little about me:  I'm 22, still living rent-free at home for the time being, but am planning on moving out in the next couple of months.  I have about 10k saved up at the moment, which is steadily growing.  I work/live in a rather expensive area.  No debt of any kind.

My question to you all is whether I should cut down on the 401k contribution in order to max out my yearly Roth IRA contribution, or leave it as is?  I do plan to stay with this company for longer than the 3 year vesting period.  I'm also interested in saving up an emergency fund, but I'm not sure if reducing the 401k contribution is the right way to do that.  Post-tax and post-contribution I take home a little over 2,000 a month, so I have some flexibility.

Also, I'm sure there are many options I haven't thought of, so any and all advice is welcome.

Thanks!"
2q3j9i,132,2014-12-22,How my pis accidentally got me a job [medium-length],Bladelink,raspberry_pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/2q3j9i/how_my_pis_accidentally_got_me_a_job_mediumlength/,"Figured I'd post this story here. This happened just a couple months ago.

So our University had a career fair a little while back for students (I'm comp-eng, and also work tier 2 support for the University as well). For the most part, this is students like myself looking to get higher-paying internships for next Summer, so that we might get some money in our pockets and a little more experience and workplace diversity under our belts.

I manage to get a call from one of the companies a couple of weeks afterwards saying that they're interested in me as a candidate. They give me some information, and to fill out an application online for a something generic like ""software support"", and I'm told that I'll need to complete an online assessment.

The online assessment is a lot like taking a GRE online, typical abilities examination, with some more challenging programming-related questions at the end. These were certainly difficult, and I did an *okay* job of mostly completing them. I get a call a couple days later to set up a phone interview.

The phone interview rolls around and I speak to a very polite woman who doesn't seem like she's given a lot of phone interviews (she was just a little awkward). They ask about what sort of projects I've completed, and as this is a software position, I don't really have many things to give them. I mention that I've completed assignments for my Java and C++ classes and mention a link to my github, but none of that is particularly impressive, and not what could really be considered ""projects"".

So I mention the couple Pis that I have. I talk about how I use samba shares with a VPN for my wife and I. I mention setting up an HTPC with XBMC and emulation, using grive to sync roms and saved games directly to the cloud. I mention how XBMC has to be set up in the most straightforward way I can, so that my wife can use it easily without having to know how to compile shit from source. I talk about how I like everything to be well-integrated, using the fewest services that work together in the most efficient way. I talk about CUPS and cloudprint for Debian, and how it lets my wife and I print from our android phones.

And it goes pretty well. They let me know that they'll give me a call in a few days with a followup. Well a couple days rolls around, and a woman lets me know that they don't think I'd work for Position_A, and to apply online for Position_B online instead. Position_B is listed as full-time, and this company is in Wisconsin (I live in Kansas). I mention that I'm just looking for an internship position for next Summer....

Long story short, they thought I was looking for a full time position, and I'm just some shmuck with 2 semesters of programming and circuits experience. When I was speaking to the woman that recommended Position_B, she mentioned that they were ""most impressed with my side projects"".

The point of this story is that I managed to unwittingly get through (1) a resume-filtering stage, (2) an online evaluation, and (3) a phone interview, to basically the job-offer stage, with about 8 months of pi-tinkering experience to thank for it. Unfortunately, my wife and I are still in school, or that offer might have been a little more complicated.

While I wasn't able to take this position, the fact is that tinkering in linux with server services among other things can be quite valuable skills. What might just seem like a fun little side-project can turn out to be something more than that.

tl;dr: accidentally got through 3 stages of interview for full-time position for job 3 states away, when I just wanted a Summer internship."
2q3n5o,2,2014-12-22,"I [22M] regret ending it with my ex [21F] but I really, really fucked up and now I don't know how to fix things",regret_away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2q3n5o/i_22m_regret_ending_it_with_my_ex_21f_but_i/,"Let's call her Emma.

Emma and I first met at the end of 2011, at the beginning of our Sophomore year of college and we immediately clicked, despite our different personalities (our biggest difference being that I climb social ladders, she's very introverted.)  We began dating soon after, and it was about 2.5 years of really amazing adventures. 

We went to a ton of concerts and musicals together, as well as a few music festivals. We were both foodies so we had great fun trying out the food in our college city, especially during restaurant week. We took road trips to go camping, skiing, sunbathing on the beach and stargazing away from the city lights. We visited each other when we spent our summer internships in different cities, where we would have all new journeys. We were each others firsts, so discovering each others bodies was another great adventure.

We had the keys each others apartments, but Emma spent most of her nights next to me, her ear against my heart and my legs folded over hers. When we were waking up one morning last fall, I told her I wanted to wake up every morning with her in my arms. I invited her to visit me and my family over the holidays, and she accepted - we spent New Years together in my hometown, along with 40+ members of my extended family.

I think this is where things started to go south. Emma was always an introspective person, very in tune with her emotions. I'm a bit emotionally distant, but she was always able to bring out the best in me. So when I told her I wanted to wake up with her every morning and when I invited her to meet my family, she started to think of our future together, post-graduation. Me being the chickenshit that I am, I got scared.

When this past spring came around, she had an astounding job offer in New York, but was waiting on a close second job offer in our college city, where I had already signed for my current employment. We discussed and agreed to do long distance if it came to that, but she seemed to waver between the offer she had on hand and a job she was still in the interview process for. It was an emotionally trying time, and I was still scared, so I ended things with her a month before graduation.

I told her that I didn't want her to base her job decision around me, since I wasn't sure of our future together. The truth is that I'm not sure that I deserve her, all her sweetness and kindness. 

It was terrible. I held together alright, but she fell apart. Several times she approached me to see if we could mend things, but she hadn't finalized her job decision so I stuck to my guns. Eventually she resigned and took up the job in NY (making three times the amount I do) and we tried to be friends. But in July she found out she was 15 weeks pregnant, and she went ahead with the abortion and only told me afterwards. I didn't know how to be supportive, I was scared and confused and a thousand miles away. When Emma told me she regretted it, I couldn't respond, so I said nothing. 

I saw her a few weeks later when she visited for a school function, and we started talking. It was strained, but there were moments like none of the past few months had happened. I missed her, but somehow the topic went to the abortion, and things went to shit. She got emotional and asked if I was a sociopath. I responded that I didn't think so, but if I were to be completely honest, there are times that I wouldn't question it. She said I would make a great politician one day, and I left her crying in the park. She called and left a message apologizing, but I wasn't able to respond.

Now I'm too scared to, because I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a coward. We have each other blocked on FB, but our friend groups are heavily intertwined so I get glimpses of her life but her pictures are all half smiles that don't quite reach her eyes. I want to know how she is, how she's holding up. I want to know if she's happy, and if there's someone making her happy. I want to share that happiness with her again, but I'm too scared and proud to say anything.

2q41uq,3,2014-12-22,"I thought my relationship with Nmom was getting better, then this happened. [vent/advice?]",donttouchmybuttz,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2q41uq/i_thought_my_relationship_with_nmom_was_getting/,"Some background: I'm 20 years old, and I live in a dorm during school. In the past I've stayed with friends over breaks, but I lately have been feeling like my Nmom and I have made progress with our relationship, so I decided to stay with my parents over winter break. The reason we (supposedly) had been making progress was I attempted suicide and was sent to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. I had attempted suicide in the past, but this is the first time it was bad enough to require medical treatment, so this is the first time my parents found out about my major depression and suicidal ideation. After the suicide attempt, my mom seemed to treat me better, and I welcomed the change, assuming it meant that she really did care about me and was finally realizing how her actions affect me. 

Well, the reason I stopped staying with my parents before that was because my mom would start arguments and blow up at me over very small things. She would constantly berate me, yell at me, and threaten to kick me out of the house every time I stayed over. She started doing it again the very first time I got into dad's car when they were moving me from university to their house. She wanted to eat somewhere, so I started listing places in my town (she isn't familiar with the town where I go to college). I guess she assumed I was demanding to eat at these places, and she went off on me about how I'm sooo opinionated despite the fact that I wasn't paying for lunch, and no one wanted to eat what I wanted, etc. It turned into this huge argument and my mom said I should find somewhere else to stay over break. 

Anyway, like 2 days after that I went to stay at my boyfriend's house for a little over a week. The same night that I get home, my mom starts shit with me again. I'm just sitting on the couch watching tv and playing pokemon, and she and my brother are talking about how my brother (17 years old) will have to sign up for the draft next year. I jokingly said something along the lines of ""Ohh, look out, you might get drafted!"" and my mom says if he gets drafted, then so will my boyfriend. I said not necessarily because he has an anxiety disorder, so he would only be drafted in dire circumstances. 

Then my mom starts asking me if I know any ""normal"" people (a lot of my friends have mental health issues... those are the types of people I get close to because we understand each other) and started saying how when she was growing up, no one ""had the luxury"" of having mental health problems. 

Do you see the implications she's making about my own mental health? I told her that was uncalled for and messed up for her to say, and she went on this huge tirade about how weak I am and how I pretend to have depression so people will feel bad for me, and that I use my depression as a crutch so I don't have to do things that other people have to do (she's referring specifically to me missing a class because of a panic attack). We both ended up saying some really horrible things to each other, and now everything is tense in the house. 

As far as the advice goes, I have about a year until I graduate, and I am required to do an internship for my last semester of school. Therefore, I've been doing a lot of planning as far as where I want to live and where I want my internship to be (because a lot of people in my field end up getting hired at their internships if they're good workers). I've been trying to choose between my college town or my hometown, where my parents live. Lately I've been leaning toward hometown, but now I'm not so sure I want to live near my parents. It's frustrating because I love my dad and I want to be around him because I am always concerned about him (he's in poor physical, social, and emotional health) but I just can't stomach being around my mom knowing what she thinks of me. I'd like to cut contact, and I've talked to my dad about him coming to visit me by himself without her, and he keeps saying that it would hurt my mom badly if I invited him without her, and that he wishes I would just try to get along with her. I'm really not sure how to cut her out of my life without also cutting my dad out of my life, who I love very much. 

**TL;DR: My mom is a psycho. How can I cut her out of my life, without also cutting my dad out of my life?**

I'm mad and need perspective.",Scaredofbecoming,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2q4863/my_25_f_parents_50s_mf_have_their_fingers_in_my/,"I'm really frustrated right now--somewhat at the world, but mostly at myself. My parents are so good at telling me how all the things they are doing for me are out of ""love"", and I'm so bad (at 25!) at standing up to them that I've let them control so much of my life. My most recent source of frustration (one of many) is my money....

I guess mostly I just need reassurance that I'm not insane to be so angry at these two things my Mom has done--I try and bring it up with my parents why their behavior bothers me and they just tell me I'm crazy and ungrateful because they did it out of love (not to hurt me but to help me), and many of my friends tell me I should be happy I am lucky enough to have parents who care so much... but I don't FEEL lucky, I feel frustrated beyond belief..... I need some outside perspective. :/

**FIRST**

I've had the same debit account since I was a teenager. Never bothered to get a credit card (should have, but hindsight is 20/20--the theme of this whole d*mn post). 

Anyway, when I moved to a new city for law school, my old bank didn't have branches here so I went to open a new account at a new bank. Stupidly, I let my Mom come with me when I opened the account (I was 23 at the time, fyi). 

Lets just say I, as a 20-something woman, am only just learning how to stand up for myself with my parents. They are really good at pointing out all the ""rational"" reasons they do the things they do for ""love"", and I am really good at letting them override me. I’m working on it. But I was way worse then than I am now. Not that I'm all that good now, but I digress....

I let my Mom talk me into opening a student checking account rather then another kind (she’s kind of a commanding whirlwind, and tends to override my opinions, so after a while I just don’t fight it and let her do what she wants—I know I know, I’m working on the backbone), and having her put on it as well. I wasn’t keen on that last bit in particular, and said as much, but she countered that it was ""for if you run into financial trouble because you will be living off loans while in school--we can transfer money to you easier"". Seems very logical and helpful, right? And the bank lady was just nodding along so I just swallowed my frustration (which was more like a childish whine of “it’s *my* money, *my* account, back off! I don’t want you on it” than anything, and she was being so *reasonable* and *logical*...) and went with it. Also I know my mom well enough that she would NOT have taken that well, and I was still living at home at the time and didn’t want to deal with the shitstorm if I had said no. 

Well, I did run into financial trouble this summer (paid job fell through and I had to take a unpaid internship last minute), and I sent my Dad a request for a loan to cover about a month and a half of rent until my next round of loans came in during the fall semester. In my request I included a clear break down of why I needed the loan (the paid program cancelling was very unexpected and last minute), how I would be able to pay him back when my fall loans came in, and how I would be able to make rent moving forward, etc: full spreadsheet budget moving forward for the fall, with clear explanation on how the budget gap was not due to poor planning on my part, but rather the unexpected cancelling of my paid program (which I had budgeted expecting).  Guess what? MY MOM PULLED UP MY BANK STATEMENT, WENT THROUGH IT, AND HAD HIM CALL ME TO SAY THAT THEY NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT MY ""INAPPROPRIATE"" SPENDING HABITS! (I had spent about $200 on clothes over the couple months prior—mostly a new swimsuit and some summer shoes, and had bought a concert ticket with friends. She said I was “spending too much on clothes and entertainment”. Would I have spent that money had I known I didn’t have the paid job I had signed the contract for? No. But I had *signed a contract*. I had no reason to expect the program to be cancelled last minute). I was LIVID when I got that call. Point blank refused to talk to her. 

Mind you, this is MY money, from loans out in MY name, and a job that *I* had. Except for the loan requested from my parents, none of the money was theirs. But she still wanted to talk about my ""inappropriate"" spending. I was FURIOUS, but of course they were all like ""why are you so angry? We are doing this to help you! It isn’t our fault you didn’t budget well"".

Anyway, I swallowed my pride for a while (though I continued to absolutely refuse to have the conversation with her on spending), figuring that when I had the time free I'd call and work with the bank to get my mom yanked from my account. If my parents want to help they can send me a freaking check. They don't get a right to go through my spending and pass judgment. Yes, I was asking for a loan so I can understand wanting to know that I would be fiscally responsible with it, but that is why I had sent the budget in—going through my statement pissed me off so much.  

Course, just got back from the bank, and the only way to get the d*mn woman off my account is to cancel it and open a new one... I'll do that when I get back to my city from my visit ""home"" over break. Means I have to change over the auto-pay for all my bills and utilities. And I know. I KNOW that when my mom finds out she will go ballistic… but I really should have just ballsed-up the first time and not let her on the account to begin with. Live and learn, I guess.

**SECOND**

During finals my uncle sent an email informing me that I needed to take care of a small mutual fund he had established in my name when I was an infant (sell it or transfer it over to my name fully). I had completely forgotten about the fund, and did need to take care of it. Only, he sent the email to my parents too (he was being a bit of an asshole about it, tbh), and before I had even SEEN the email, my Mom called the financial group managing the loan IMPERSONATING ME and started the process of selling the loan. I had no idea about the email at the time (was at work) and absolutely hadn't been asked. They didn't call me until after she had already called the financial group as me. I was, once again, pissed. Course, she was all like ""well you are so busy with finals I figured I'd help"", and my Dad was like ""why are you so angry? we were doing it to help?"" Only, SURE if she had ASKED me first, I maybe, mabye would have said yes to help (and called the group to let them know I was giving my mom authority to act on my behalf), but they just DID it. It was like ""hey, btw, your mom called pretending to be you, so now you cant call because they will know your mom impersonated you, so do you want us to sell the shares or transfer them?"". At that point I just told them to sell the shares to help with rent, and didn't make a fuss about the *impersonating me* thing, because I felt it really wasn't worth it, but I was *fuming*. 

I feel like I'm crazy. I mean, in neither case did my parents steal my money from me... just, idk, it feels like they took my agency, or my feelings of independence, idk. I'm so mad, about all of this, but every time I try and talk to them about why I felt what they did was wrong they just get really defensive. All how they were doing it to ""help"" me, or because they ""love"" me, and no matter how rationally and calmly I try and explain why what they did was wrong, they always have an excuse. 

Am I over reacting? Please, I need some perspective. I feel crazy.

---   
**tl;dr: my parents went through my bank statement and decided to lecture me on my ""inappropriate spending"" when I asked for an emergency loan from them (for rent) after I lost a job, and my mom impersonated me without my consent to sell a mutual fund ""for me"". In neither case did they steal my money, but I'm still I'm really, really mad and am working to pull my finances fully out of their control. But every time I try and bring their actions up I'm told I'm ""overreacting"" and they were just doing it because they love me and I'm being ungrateful. I need outside perspective--did they cross lines, or am I just crazy? Help :(**"

2q4c2h,5,2014-12-22,"Current MD Applicant w/ solid stats, sitting on 0 interviews. Looking for criticisms, feedback, and advice on what to do in my year off! Any help at all is appreciated! :)",sovereign0,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/2q4c2h/current_md_applicant_w_solid_stats_sitting_on_0/,"I'm using a throwaway to prevent tying identifying information to my real reddit account, but I'm a big fan of this sub! I don't think I ever would have made it through the application process without /r/premed, even if my current cycle has not been successful I have so much to thank you all for.

I'll start with some stats and info about my current app:

Senior Biochemistry / Biology double major

**cGPA**: 3.78 / sGPA: ~3.8

**MCAT**: 32 (10/10/12)

Primary submitted in late June, secondaries were all in by late August.

**Extracurriculars**:

- I have been on one medical mission trip to Belize, and will be leading the return trip this coming Spring.

- Some volunteering in free clinics, and significant adminstrative contributions to the same clinic

- ~60 hours shadowing between radiology and critical care specialties (clinical and hospital)

- Leadership position in a huge pre-med organization

- current, active skydiver, USPA A-License certified

- Self-teaching a musical instrument for the past 3 years

- Participated in a summer research internship through a very prestigious institution

- Through the same institution (but not as part of the internship), had an abstract accepted for poster presentation (but did not attend since the convention was during exam week)

- Worked as a paid private tutor since Jr. year, ~ 10hrs week

-------------------------------------------------------

**Important red flag** - my freshman year I got a written arrest for MIP as well as an institutional action from my university. The MIP charges were dropped and expunged, and disciplinary sanctions were completed. The MIP is no longer on my record having been expunged, but the IA is still on my undergraduate record. I am not sure if the university sends it out, but I disclosed the IA regardless.

Another red flag, I apparently failed to note my shadowing hours on my Primary Work/Activities section (but mentioned shadowing several times in my personal statement).

So, I applied very broadly this cycle (27? primaries) and I think I vastly overestimated my competitiveness, applying mostly out of state. I have yet to receive a single interview invite. I'm in decent spirits about it, because I know my application was not the best it could have been, and if I have to reapply I know all the ins and outs and will do a much better job. At the same time, it's really disheartening to spend ~$2000+ on applying to medical school and not receiving a single interview.

 I submitted 27 primaries, 17 secondaries. Recieved 8 rejections, and waiting to hear back from 10 schools.

So anyway...

**As for this cycle**, would it be a good idea to send update letters to the schools who have not rejected me? All I have to include are the shadowing hours I failed to declare (should I include this?), the small amount of stuff I've done for the medical mission trip I'm leading next semester, the conclusion of my summer internship program, and this semester's grades (4.0 GPA, 2 upper level biochem classes with 1 lab, my last foreign language class, and a P/F sports elective).

**For next cycle**, I really think I could have done better on the MCAT (averaged higher on my practices for PS and VR, and I think I somehow zoned out during the PS of my actual MCAT... thought I was a morning person so I took the 8AM, failed to consider how hard it would be to sleep the night before...). Would it be a good idea to retake? I'm very proficient with Bio/Biochem, but I would have to self-teach all the psych stuff.

The *main reason* for this post was to get some feedback on what the weak spots of my application are, and what I should do in my gap year before I reapply. I really want to be more involved in research, and I don't really know what else I could do besides go back to school for a Masters. Would it be a good idea to do a 1-year Master's program while doing research? My GPA is ""competitive"", so I'm not sure if a Master's would be a good idea. The only other option I can think of is to go to EMT school and work as an EMT, but I don't know how I would find research while not a student at a university.

-----------------------

I know I've written a lot, and even if nobody reads this I feel better since this has all kind of been stirring up a storm of anxiety in my head, it felt good to get it all down for people to see. I want to thank anyone for their advices and criticisms in advance, it means a lot to me !!!

I have saved up enough money from engineering internships that I could comfortably help him pay for his classes next semester. He won't even consider it, saying that he is a loser and he won't let me or anyone help him.

I don't think joining the Air Force should be something someone does as a last resort. He is an absolutely amazing person and I couldn't live without him. I have severe anxiety and even thinking about him leaving me for the Air Force has given me a panic attack. He says he loves me but he knows what it would do to me if he left. 

Please, I just need advice on what to do now. I want to stress that he does't want to join the Air Force per say, he just feels he has to.

TL;DR; Boyfriend won't let me help him pay for school, feels his only choice is to leave me and join the Airforce

2q4l55,0,2014-12-22,How to have the best Saturday night out ever... For free!,[deleted],SocialEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialEngineering/comments/2q4l55/how_to_have_the_best_saturday_night_out_ever_for/,"Hello Redditors, you're gonna like this. For you lazy readers if you want to skip the preface, jump to the ""(THIS IS WHERE THE BEST NIGHT EVER STARTS)"" a couple of paragraphs down, although I would recommend reading the whole story, it should not disappoint.

 I'm not one for going into clubs or bars on a weekend, its not that I'm introverted or have no friends I just don't like wasting my money on mundane conventional experiences that are becoming a scarily regular occurrence with my peers (I mean it happens almost every. single. weekend.), its just boring now. 

Last weekend, the peer pressure took the better of me while I was out celebrating my friends birthday at his house. Everyone had finished their 'pre drinking' and was heading for the town (at this point I'm planning my escape strategy). So, we finished up, people stuffing their pockets with the remaining booze to consume on our short commute to the clubs. During our walk I started talking to a friend who I haven't spoken to in months after she moved away for university. There were 20 or so people at the party and I hadn't had a chance to talk to her just yet. After 10-15 minutes or so of talking, we had really hit it off, we found out that we both had a lot in common and barely knew anything about each other before this. As our conversation deepened our pace got faster and by this point we were miles ahead of the others.

We arrive just outside the night club and got in line. It was just me and her, the others hadn't arrived yet. It was cold, gloomy and everywhere I looked there was some drunk idiot doing something that was supposedly ""outrageous"" that really just compensates for his lack of personality and comic value when sober. 

When we're talking we realise that none of us want to be here right now and would prefer to just be watching some of Russell Brand's 'The Trews' in bed. We quickly come to the conclusion that the others won't even notice if we make a quick escape and disappear into the abyss, even if it involved us texting them and pretending that we we're already in the club. So thats what we did - we fucking ran away, we ran like feral ostriches.

On our journey home it came to a point where the weather was so baltic we had to take respite in a hotel we passed on our way home. We made our way to one of the hallways and found a sofa (Its worth stating that I have never up until this day seen the point in these random sofas just planted in the middle of hotel hallways, I mean who is gonna walk half way down there and decide they need a pitstop?), it was sitting there nicely, cushions pumped up and primed for some booty sitting action. My friend had gone to the toilet, so I had the chance to whip my phone and check for some Tinder matches... 

(THIS IS WHERE THE BEST NIGHT EVER STARTS)

So I there I am flicking away, 'noping' the fatties to the left and hotties to the right, when all off a sudden a hear a door opening. There a man in a suit walks out... I was intrigued! I was intrigued, not by the man who walked out of the door but what was going on behind the door, I heard the sound of music seeping out of the door opening. My friend at this point is still in the toilet, so I go and see what all the noise is about. I walk through a pair of doors and find myself in a function room in where what looks like an incredible wedding reception or birthday party is taking place. My friend has seen me creep into the room and follows suite. When we are both standing there looking at the party going on, we both know immediately that this will be much funner than venturing home through what felt like Jack Frost's ass fart. So we make our way onto the packed dance floor and just start busting moves, left, right and centre - this is great. After what feels like 5 minutes but was more close to an hour of dancing and chatting to others we decided to head over to the bar for a quick drink (No one has even questioned us at this point, they actually must think that we are genuine guests at this party). So we're at the bar and we order our drinks and as soon as I can reach for my wallet the barmaid asks me to get out the way and let the other people order. I told the barmaid that I needed to pay her still (being the honest saint that I am) and she gives me the weirdest look and I get a bit self-conscious and  confused at this point. I stood there for a moment trying to figure out what has just happened.

It was a corporate event. They had a free bar.... A FREE BAR! The company which was hosting the event, was paying for some random guy and his friend's drinks... ALL NIGHT! This night just went to 15% - like 80% real quick. I started 'getting drinks' for everyone around me in excitement like I owned the fucking company, not realising that everyone in this place is already fully aware that there is a free bar... But fuck it, they had to work for it, and I did jack shit! 

I saw beautiful girl whom at the time looked like a solid 10 but at time of this writing is now a confirmed 8 (She's actually really nice and I feel bad about saying that), and I offered to get her a drink - because fuck it, drinks were on me! We get chatting and I think I like her - Yes I do, in fact we started kissing and I get her number... AWESOME CORPORATE EVENT. After talking to the girl for some time, she decides its a good idea to introduce me to her boss 'Grae'.... The managing director of the company. Now I have never considered myself as particularly charming or much of a conversationalist but after 20 minutes or so of talking I managed to get that guy to love me, the girl had even disappeared by this point. We got talking about how he started his business and when he dropped out of school at 15, he was like worlds most interesting man to me at that point. He even offered me a full time job in the human resources department as a supervisor after I said I had been working there for 3 as an intern... It's worth saying that I never took the job offer, but after doing a little research on the company I wished I did, it would of taken me about 3 years + of working experience to get me to that status.

Plenty of drinking, chatting and dancing later, the party comes to an end. I am actually sad leaving these people, for a moment I had actually convinced myself that I worked there and my boss 'Grae' had offered me a promotion in the company I knew so well. So we get our coats and make our way outside the hotel. I say goodbye to everyone and Grae just as they get into their taxis, when he stops me and asks where I stay and how I'm getting home... 

(I just want to reassure you all that this is a true story this stuff never happens to me. This would be nearly impossible for me to make up on the spot.)

It turns out that Grae just lives two streets up from me, so he demands that me and my friend get into the taxi with him. When I arrive home he tells me when getting out the taxi ""come by my office on Monday and we'll get something sorted out"". Grae, if you're reading this, I'm sorry... I think I would of made quite a good HR supervisor to.

I get into bed with a big grin on my face, I think I've had the best Saturday night out ever, and it was all priceless.


UPDATE - I have now taken the girl I met out on 4 dates and next time I am going to ask her out. She knows my secret, she thinks its hilarious, but she hasn't told Grae.

Redditors, please. This is not a story, it is advice. If you want to meet some great people, get free drinks, get free taxis, get job opportunities thrown at you, get a girlfriend and have a genuinely good night... Just crash a hotel party.

2q501r,15,2014-12-22,"My friend died, and I feel guilty feeling so sad.",AmondaPls,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2q501r/my_friend_died_and_i_feel_guilty_feeling_so_sad/,"I knew her for 5 or 6 months, we did the same internship, spent at least 5 days a week in the office together for several hours at a time, and I really just connected to her. She was just a little ball of fire, she could get so enraged or excited about some of the things she cared about to the point of tears, and she cared so much for her little sick cat, and for her career path, she was doing everything she could to move forward, while also being a person I could curl up in bed and watch Les Mis and cry with at the end of a long day. She was a complete space cadet, with this raspy, high voice, a chain smoker who would rather lay on the floor than sit in a chair, she smiled about everything she could, she was just infectious and beautiful.

I just can't stop thinking about it. There is a video of her family talking about her, alongside images of her mangled little car under this tractor trailer, and her siblings are so positive, and so happy they knew her, while I crumpled into this teary mess looking at these fucked up pictures. Why does the news put out the images from fatal accidents anyway? This isn't how I want to remember my friend, at fucking all.

I knew her a short time, and barely saw her in the past month. I've felt depressed, finished school, but would text back and forth occasionally about the latest news from our field. I loved her impassioned, easily excitable nature, she was so easy to talk to. I even thought about making a plan with her last week, because I missed her and found a bit of strength to reach out to my friends, but I never did.

Having said all of this, I feel like I shouldn't be this sad. I feel this immense amount of pain, and I really knew and loved this girl, but she's had friends for years who have more of a right to be sad, and to pay tribute to her, than me. I feel like it's insulting to reach out to the other intern, her best friend of several years, to talk about it. I feel like I should just be OK with it. The first question the few people I've mentioned this to ask me is ""how well did you know her?"" and my answer is very well, because I feel that I knew her soul, she was incredible. However, I did not know her the way a best friend of 8 years knows her, and I feel foolish crying over this. I knew her for a few months, and she's gone, and I never took the opportunity to be a friend to her that she tried to be for me by reaching out to me to see if I wanted to stop by.

I don't think that I am only feeling sorry that *I* didn't do enough, though that does hurt. I thought that she was wonderful, funny, exciting, some one who would drop anything and help anyone, who had the same goals as me and was just as driven to succeed and change people's lives, and she was killed in a brutal accident that it wrenches my fucking heart to think about. I'm heartbroken, and I feel like I shouldn't be. Like I'm not allowed to be."

Thanks for stoping by. 

A few months ago I posted in a different sub-reddit asking for experience  in audio engineering. Great user posted to work on stems, Which is a great idea but they there are very few and limited. 
After a few months I interned at a recording studio (still am) that now I can say with confidence I can help fello metal core bands. 

For those that are in a band and need help recording or mixing I am willing to offer my services for free!!!

Yes Thats right I said free. 
Why am I doing this for free? (great question) I would to help fellow bands that need mixing or want to record an album but don't have the time. 

I get free studio time, so we can work with this. Again I will not accept ANY MONEY, I am simply doing this for the love of Metalcore. 

I used to be in a band growing up, we wanted to record sooo bad but didnt have the money, I know there are a few bands that are really great and talented, That just need a bit of a push in the right way. 

TLDR: 
I intern in a recording studio, They let me us all their gear and rooms for free, I want to help you help me. I gain more experience while you guys get an album, or mixing an album.

I'm interested in retail like a Staples or Best Buy or something. Or even a grocery store. Just something part-time for minimum wage.
* How is the public transportation? Since we don't get a bus pass do you buy your own from the bus service? How much is it?
* Is it a nice place to bike around? Bike friendly?
* Is there anything to do around campus? Nature? Parks? It seems stranded in the middle of the suburbs is that right? I've only seen it on google maps so far and won't be able to visit before starting school. 
* Are there any crime issues around campus?
* How are the houses? I want to live off-campus. Are the landlords generally okay? Are the houses in good condition? Is it easy to find a house within walking distance? Average price for a single room in a shared house?
* How do you like the school? The classes? Do you wish you had chosen a different school?
* Computer Engineering students: Do you like the program? Have you done any internships yet? Do you regret going to college instead of a comp sci program at university?"

I have a few ideas: 

* the desire to start a new family
* add to the existing
* wanting to feel a guy cumming without a condom, maybe your boyfriend is too afraid
* wanting more kids despite your husband not wanting more
* ready for a child, if you have a boyfriend, then he's not ready
* infertile husband/boyfriend
* wanting to be bred by an alpha
* wanting a child with someone who has always loved you
* wanting to play a game of risk, dare you to fuck me, dare you to cum inside, dare you to do it again...etc
* lie about being on birth control
* say its the ""safe time"" of the month
* tell me to pull out, but ride me, putting you in control
* start off with wanting me to pull out, then losing it, and wanting me to cum inside
* hate my girlfriend or wife, give me a baby that I want
* cuckold/cuckqueen my girlfriend or wife
* threesomes with a sister, friend, niece, cousin, mom, daughter, etc
* I'm sure I can come up with more ideas. 


Below I wrote two vague ideas for a MILF or Mistress RP. I wanted to keep the creative bubble open and unrestricted because I'm hoping you can add some of your own lustful details and sexy twists to our RP. 

.


* **One:** Your older than me, maybe a young woman or a milf. I'm the strapping young man that you could teach to be a good lover. Fulfill those needs your not getting at home by your self, or from that husband or boyfriend you've had for so long. Character's I might be: son, friend's son, neighbor boy, student to a tutor/teacher, bag boy at the grocery, nephew, younger cousin, pool boy, highschool/college athlete, your child's tutor or babysitter, a friend of your son or duaghter, daughter's boyfriend, intern, employee, personal trainer, etc. Some of the kinks that could be involved include vanilla, romantic, reluctant, creampies, anal, impregnaiton,ageplay, incest, anal, bondage, cheating, cuckold, threesomes, and more

.



* **Two:** This one is on the more kinky side. You could be a mistress or a lover, but in either case I'll be on the receiving end of a cock. It could be plastic or real. Yours or someone else's. Open to a vanilla mutual fucking to the other end of the spectrum, where I'm a submissive. This could include all sorts of kinks: bdsm, facesitting, bi sex, futa, tgirl, strap-on, watersports, ageplay, incest, anal, rape, noncon, con, impregnation, drugs, blackmail, and more.

.

Let me know what kinks you have as well. Looking forward to the PM.

2q5apm,7,2014-12-23,"Hey r/publichealth, help a worried undergrad out",kdotc,publichealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/2q5apm/hey_rpublichealth_help_a_worried_undergrad_out/,"So i guess my first question is this: how much does your major as an undergrad really matter? 

i just transferred to an amazing school to major in public health. After my first quarter, I'm starting to realize that it isn't exactly what I'd hoped it would be. I'm interested in studying the science of infectious diseases and how they spread throughout a population and what we can do to stop them. However, the classes required for my major tend to focus a lot on chronic disease management with a couple classes focusing on biostatistics. I'm starting to feel like a microbiology major would have been better for me as I'd be able to take classes on immunology and virology. The problem is I'm taking out quite a bit in loans to be here and I don't want to switch majors to take these classes and have to stay in undergrad for more years than I originally intended. 

Furthermore, I'm worried about job prospects after undergrad. A lot of my friends are computer science majors and it seems like they just have companies left and right throwing offers at them. I want to be able to make the money back that i invested into my education. Because of this, i'm starting to teach myself basic programming as I feel like that could be a useful skill to have. (anyone here minor in cs?)

So i guess i'm also asking how the job market is for the public health field? What could i do with a major in public health? A lot of the internships/fellowships from the CDC that i've looked at require at least a masters. And while i would like to eventually get a masters, the less school and less loans i have to take out, the better.

So can any of you guys offer your experience in the public health work force? any advice you might have for a worried undergrad? Is it worth it to change majors after having spent the last two years taking classes for the public health major? (for some perspective, if i want to major in microbiology i'd have to take physics, finish calculus, and take ochem before i could move into more of the upper division electives such as immunology and virology.) Or should i simply finish out my public health degree, look for internships to hopefully build my resume, and try to find a way to hopefully get a masters without going into too much more debt.

How can I best set myself up for success with a public health degree?

Sorry for the long text, i'm just in a rather stressful place right now. 

Finally, thanks in advance for taking the time to read and respond to this and merry christmas/happy new years to you, the folks over at r/publichealth. "

I want to build a virtualization server mainly for educative purpose and to start my homelab. I have various questions about my choices and I just want to make sure that I get everything right and working as expected.

* I want to use the free version of VMware ESXi 5.5. From what I heard, I have to make sure to not use the hardware v10 (and use lower instead, like v9) for the VM and I should be able to use all functionalities after the 60 days trail. Is that exact?
* Is there anything I should know about ESXi that could make me change my mind? I mean, I've use ESXi a lot in a previous internship, even wrote automation script with PowerCLI, but I never installed or licensed ESXi.
* Also, I never choose hardware for ESXi. I made a part list and I would like to have your opinion about it. I found a pretty neat barebone server from ASUS that seems to fit all my needs.
* About the RAM and CPU, I want to buy twice of it (2 CPU and 32GB of RAM) but I don't have the money right now. Should I worried about the fact that one CPU will be missing or is everything will work with only one CPU? When come the time for the upgrade, will ESXi take it flawlessly or will I have to do something to make it work?
* I'm not sure if the VelociRaptors are overkill, but I wanted to use SSDs and the prices are way to high. Is that a good compromise?
* If you have any other suggestion or advice, I'm here to learn!

2q5iro,3,2014-12-23,Should I apply for a summer internship?,[deleted],makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/2q5iro/should_i_apply_for_a_summer_internship/,"Hey all,

I'm a freshman Computer Science major, and I'm wondering whether or not I should apply for a summer internship. As of now I have a working knowledge of both Java and Python, and I'm going to be taking a class on systems programming next semester.

Pros: Work experience, I'll learn a lot about CS, $$$ (maybe), I'll be productive over the summer

Cons: Even if I apply there's a good chance I won't get in, studying for technical interviews will detract from studying for classes, the summer after freshman year might be the only summer I have to myself (I want to learn piano, work out, go on adventures, etc), I would have to apply to start-ups rather than full-fledged companies because full-fledged companies typically don't hire freshmen

CS majors from my school usually do well and land solid internships after sophomore and junior years. Is it worth applying?"

2q5rmz,0,2014-12-23,I've turned extremely dark and cold. I don't show it but I am consumed and driven by anger in life at the moment and sadly despise most women...Plus im a virgin at 23 now. What advice do you guys have?,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/2q5rmz/ive_turned_extremely_dark_and_cold_i_dont_show_it/,"Now im using a throwaway account but this post has basically been triggered by this post: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2pzxq2/how_to_break_up_with_a_plate_and_be_the_good_guy/
I want everyone to know I was really bad with women growing up. I was always nervous and anxious and had crushes easily. Here we go:

**Background: The girl.**
Now this post only confirmed my worst fear in women that 95% of the time they wont build you, only want to have you when you have everything going for you. Now the girl i fell in love with was absolutely an HB10. Most guys think omfg HB10?!?! holy shit shes hot so she becomes a HB10. No i wouldn't just consider this girl just ""hot"" this girl was fucking beautiful. Just small enough flaws to make you think alright she isn't perfect but that's okay and make you comfortable but just enough beauty to get every fucking guy to chase after her. Not just chase her they would immediately fall in love with her. K now you got a bit of an idea of her beauty she was also a small town and strictly raised catholic that changed her identification later to protestant. Quiet girl also mind you but not really shy very confident but also a sense of nervousness being the new girl in town. Brunette, blue eyes simply a deadly combination. I met her as a coworker in a restaurant. She was just a host and I was just a server.

Anyways Lets begin about me now...

**Part 1 My background**
Me growing up from a very large conservative Muslim family and having a very religious mother and bat shit crazy older sister i was raised pretty much blue pill but not as much as you would think. Ya I was a ""nice guy"" but I always naturally have alpha traits in me and i naturally rebelled. I was the kid who got kicked out of class (or sat next to the usually female teacher) or sent to the principles office for some bullshit and considered by far the funniest guy in the classroom (not the annoying purposely trying to seek attention clown I just did some really dumb shit or said some really dumb shit). 15 years old i was about to lose my virginity to a 14 year old girl but got caught exchanging emails by my mom. At this point she simply told me how would you feel if i had sex with other men ? basically this caused me to start just watching porn instead. I was a popular guy during my freshman and sophomore years but then i got into a huge fight with my supposedly close friends over them always fucking with my little brother who was like 7. One day they took shit to far and i flipped shit (dont get me wrong he was an annoying kid but a good kid who only meant well and hang out with the older guys). I didn't want to talk to them or associate with them i chose my brother over them and wouldn't even apologizing for bullying him. I went dark/quiet during my junior year and i stopped talking to people If i had other old friends who wanted to sit with me and hang out my old ""close friends"" would detract them and basically i lost them as well. They made sure no matter how many times i got in with the popular crowd that they would stop chilling with me and i didn't do anything at the time... I would just let it go plus the fact i was 5'6 and knew i couldn't take on those guys in a fight as much as i wanted too. I still did football and wrestling but i started to hang out with lesser people in the social circle ghetto kids and nerds. I graduated high school with a 1.8 gpa went to prom with no date cause i was to nervous to ask anyone at that point lost all confidence in myself. So i take a year off before i go to community college and im working in the shittiest fucking job you can imagine at 18 years old. Im was a lone busser for a cafe with older foreign fucks who treat you like shit and did this for 10 months. It was the most miserable moment of my life and it was absolutely the unhappiest I ever been but now this was the kick in the ass i truly needed. It woke me the fuck up and proceeded my first initial change in life. I went to community college starting to really study and chose my major as IT.  I started to go to the gym 6 days a week and got really cut. I finished 2 n a half years at community college with cum laud distinction. I transferred to a university and at this point is where i met HB10.

**Part 2  HB10 comes into my life.**

Everything in my life was going for me again. My coworkers at my new restaurant respected and adored me. I was starting a new social circle life from scratch and becoming the man again but this time a lot edgier and smarter. I was in an engineering program with no student loans and a year n half off from graduating. (i am 21 at the time) HB10 (she is 25) came a little later after a year n half i was in this restaurant and basically had the status of the ""alpha male"" i was thrown fuck buddys and other coworkers who wanted to hook up but i refused because at the time i was still a nice guy who wanted a relationship to lose my virginity too. Not a FWB situation and not some trashy chick. Now i didn't know how good looking i was (i never thought i was ugly neither just some average dude) because i was always insecure of my height but never really showed it. I was really naive at the time and when HB10 came i was floored. The excitement i had to just meet this chick and see what kinda girl she was got me excited. Of course this chick was a cheerleader at her university and this white girl well she can drink. Red flags and im thinking okay typical white girl but damn she is so fucking gorgeous. She moved from northern ohio to dc for an internship so im personally thinking okay she may not last that long here if shes working a free internship (they usually 80% of the time come n gone). So im thinking damn oh well. Now i never really talked to her at first i let other coworker dudes get at her first and not show like i really care but my SMV was high as they would always try to socialize with me no matter what i was doing and i would kinda ignore her I do this naturally but we talked a little here and there. At a coworkers party is where things started to escalate I went dark chilling and eating in a corner not drinking but coworkers of course trying to get me to drink. I kept refusing and they got her to drink a bit (she seems to be easily influenced). We started talking about things in common and what not and came to a point where she was looking for a ride.  This is the first time in my life i ever really gave a drunk chick a ride and on my way to my car she was just consistently asking me for questions. Like why don’t I drink? How old am I? And just some stuff about the party that we both made fun of a bit. She isn’t the type to really talk behind someone’s back which I found attractive also. I drop her off tell her good night and don’t really do anything she says thank you and goes ahead and leaves to her apartment.  At this point she is chasing me and she is chasing me hard in the most discrete way possible.  Comes to “check” her schedule during my one shift I’m not working with her and start a bit of small talk.  Next thing I know she is quitting drinking now this really turned me on to the point where I didn’t just like her I was starting to fall for her.  This is where I start to fuck up, she could have gone to New York with her friend instead she decided to come to the Christmas party and omfg she was fucking beautiful (I tried avoiding her as long as I could by talking to other coworkers because I got fucking nervous).  After a stressful first semester at my University I decided to let go and actually drink. Bad move. She drank as well but I totally could not handle my liquor intake. Basically made a fool of myself at the party even though we danced and had a good time.  My coworkers came up to me and said something along the lines of you two would make a really good couple and the other said ask her out right now (they were both pretty wasted and I was just fucking embarrassed cause I did really like her… she saved it later by joking about a date we could have with a restaurant gift card she won).   Anyways I blew my chance to really seal the deal with her. I don’t know what held me back the fact she was older or the fact I was just a total pussy who isn’t use to this especially from a girl as gorgeous and as kind as this. I got her number that night so that was a plus. 

**Part 3  The departure**

Now I never complimented her… it was an always an awkward vibe between us. My female coworker mentioned that she said I was a great guy. Like we liked each other but I didn’t know what to do with her (ya ya you make her a plate and you fuck her brains out but I was in fucking love with this girl and wanted a relationship to work out I was a “Geeeeewwwd” guy). Two weeks later I go on a ski trip while she is on Christmas break with her family I dislocate my fucking shoulder snowboarding.  This causes me to miss work for the next month and during this span she quits and gets a job being a host in a hotel paying 20/hr (I know what the fuck). I tried adding her on facebook but she rejected my friend request but she added some of my coworkers which I didn’t understand… I stalked her facebook consistently after that I couldn’t fucking help it. She started working 72 hours a week so I left her alone doing her internship and hotel gig.  I still have her contact number but man I started missing her but made sure I didn’t make any contacttill I felt the time was right or I had a real reason too I asked her out for coffee to catch up but she declined and gave me that 72 hour excuse I could understand she didn’t have time for my insecure bullshit and I understood that. I couldn’t jack off for about a month and a half it was that fucking bad how much I was in love with this girl. So 4 months pass by and spring comes and one thing we really had in common was volleyball. I gave her my word I would hit her up when I go out and play some beach vball with friend and did she got really excited when I did and came out we had a blast. It seemed she was really into me again I can see what I did right. Had high SMV among my friends without saying to much but had control of the entire day and she stuck to me like fucking glue. I went out to eat she tagged along (she paid for her portion but I took care most of the bill among friends and the tip), I went out to grab some ice cream she tagged along (I bought her some which she wouldn’t stop thanking me for…). I called her out to play vball again and this time some chicks joined and started flirting with me which I think may have gotten her jealous but she pretended nothing was happening basically same thing I do when I see her getting hit on by dudes who are playing vball (I just ignored it as if nothing was happening and kept enjoying my game).

**Part 4 the date**

So I text this girl that there’s a really cool place I want to show her that I think she would like (I didn’t tell her what we were going). Yeah I texted her to get her to come out really lame on my part but wait you will see why I did that. She agreed. My mentality was she may not be staying here any longer if she doesn’t get this job from this internship so I might as well just show her a good time. I honestly did love her that much that I didn’t even know I was setting up a date. So I come to pick her up of course im dressed in fucking gym shorts and a t shirt and lord and behold I have never seen a girl look as fucking beautiful and yet so fucking sexy at the same time. It was fucking holy how hot she was and I just stood there with my mouth open like a fucking idiot while she uttered “oh no are we doing something else?!?!”I just replied with “uh no im just really comfortable in these cloths sorry” she said  “ oh okay im really curious where we are going ”. Okay me being the totally new at this shit loser that I was I still didn’t think it was a date I literally had the mindset of just showing this girl a good time and getting to know her better. I basically took her to a specific religious monument and basically told her to be my tour guide in a joking manner. God damn she would not stop talking and boy did she open up about her life. This made me feel really really good about myself and there was a point where there was a lot of sexual tension where it really seemed she wanted a kiss. Eyes staring at my lips Voice slowing down, my heart was racing and I was getting an erection. BUT REMEMBER FUCKING GOOD GUY ME said no and Infuckingstead I moved my ear in closer to her voice and pretended I couldn’t hear her. We kept moving on around and she still talked openly/carefree.  Every guy was staring at her (preists, pope lookin niggahs, extreamly religious dudes) than us, it was scary and at one point this guy at the info desk started hitting on her in front of me in a friendly manner as if I was some sort of dipshit. I didn’t say anything just let him talk and talk and talk. Found out a lot about her just from this desperate chode.  I took her out to eat after words and it seemed we just couldn’t really separate from each other it was just a really comfortable time with each other. Another thing I learned is that I could not eat for shit around her. It was fucking annoying. She talked about how her older sister (now married) got pregnant at 18 and how the original guy wasn’t ready to be a father. (Now personally conservative me I’m just glad they didn’t get an abortion so I kind of liked that from her family but also hated the lack of responsibility hoping she would learn from her sisters mistakes and be even more conservative about sex).  Also her father is very sensitive with his daughters and supposedly has mental issues (not sure if this is a beta father) with them not being safe she said it in “oh he shouldn’t worry about us” tone but I immediately snapped back defending him saying I do not blame him at all. Anyways I drop her off and just let her know that I hope she had fun. She seemed to have genuinely enjoyed the day but also seemed nervous I didn’t make any physical contact. I was honestly too nervous at the time and I wasn’t sure If I could keep up financially with her age group (26-30) and I did not want to be distracted with college because that shit was fucking kicking my ass. The next time I asked her out this time by phone I sounded fucking nervous as shit but tried to remain calm and asked her out on mother’s day. (My parents went to turkey so I had a free pass and I knew she was alone here so I thought what the hell I’ll take her to an amusement park.) Asked her over the phone told her just make sure she’s got her entire day free and I got a yes. Now this was right after my finals and I didn’t contact her for two weeks but I let her know I just finished my finals. The problem with this was that I stayed up for two n a half days straight and when the date came I woke up really fucking tired but she texted me how she had a million little things to do and apologized for not thinking about that when I asked her out. Basically told her I understand and after a few little texts here and there I went back to sleep.

**Part 5 attraction seems to be in free fall**

We hung out here and there but it was never official just getting to know each other and trying to make our lives a little settled. I found an IT job before I graduated hoping to impress her which it did a bit but also made her insecure she hasn’t found a real job. Now the IT job was awesome and met some great people but I also started working two jobs and went full time finishing up as a student. Things got really really stressful for me. I couldn’t get a hold of her anymore that much and I was going through major family issues. Sister wants to marry a white dude and parents don’t approve. I talked to this about her and tried not to show too much emotion but I couldn’t keep a strong frame. I showed the situation has affected me and I started talking to her about my problems a bit and she started to talk about her problems. 2013 was a year that was just testing me to no end. Not only was I in love and trying to not seem like it is affecting me but I had a family fued going on that I was caught in the middle of along with two jobs and in an engineering program. Life fucking sucked. Worse comes to worse when I started stalking her facebook I saw a much more financially stable guy offer her a plane ticket somewhere. This hit my insecurity’s really hard. Regardless if this was her ex or just some love interest this fucking hurt and brought some unintended emotional pain. Was it the fact I knew I could never have her? If I did I sure as fuck couldn’t take care of her. Hell I was still living with my parents making sure I could manage paying my tuition so I could graduate debt free. Anyways I broke contact with her for about 3 months because she started to become really flaky so I just said fuck it I got sick of always trying to contact her first.

**Part 6 Reunite**

So I walk into the grocery store with my coworkers that I’m about to give a ride too and of course there she is as I’m entering the store and she is about to walk out. Its winter and I got my full lushes beard going on which she has never seen but she knows exactly who I am and tries to make small talk with me. I try avoiding her but she seemed persistent to just talk to me about little things. It made me feel like shit god seeing her without makeup and that quite innocent vibe she always has got me to really misses her. She was as beautiful as ever.  I had to call her that night. I did she picked up and it was really awkward… “It was nice seeing you!” in a really excited voice from her that seriously melted my heart. In an awkward tone I just said “it was always really nice seeing you”. We both sounded just defeated… “I asked her you doing anything tomorrow you wanna catch up?”. She said “yeah uh… I have some errands but what time did you have in mind?” I said “I actually have an entire day off tomorrow so just text me I should be free.” The next day we basically walked around a mall for 3 hours just talking and catching up. I asked her straight up though “why didn’t you just contact me these past 4 months? I don’t understand.” She immediately lied which really pissed me off as I felt like I was being disrespected and treated like a fucking idiot. “Oh I was looking for a job and I couldn’t come out to play volleyball because I hurt my ankle.” She immediately tried to turn it on me “why did you think I would keep coming out to play?” I said “I don’t care. I just don’t understand why it was so hard for you to contact me? I’m not going to keep asking you to come out.” I also found out she’s back into drinking a lot again because I mentioned something about the gym and got it confused with some drinks. She was like “I wish they served (specific drink) at the gym hehe”. That turned me off… I let her know that I was basically almost done but my most stressful semester is coming up and currently this shit is like a prison for me and that I am currently doing 2 jobs. She asked me if my IT job had good job security I told her no as it was a contract position and I could definitely find something better when I graduate. She also tried to bring the topic of sex up I think by mentioning the movie rush after we had an awkward silence of just not talking for a good 30 seconds.  She kept the conversation going by bringing up movies as the topic but I failed on most of them because I really didn’t have the time to see any of them and she understood. She knew how stressed out I was.  I walked her to her apartment complex and just gave her a hug telling her ill see her around. That was the last time I saw her.  Why? I asked her out 3 weeks later after my finals asking her out on my only night off (Friday night) called her up and this time didn’t sound awkward at all and very confident. She sounded awkward, gave off some excuses, and basically she declined (I usually ask her out on Sunday but I purposely wanted to make this difficult and see if she actually cared or not). She thought about it for a good week I mean she mentioned about her roommates party and that she needs to go set it up on Friday night (which I thought was total horseshit).  Now I didn’t care too much that shit declined I was like fuck it ill just friendzone her and maybe she has hot friends or something I just don’t care anymore. Then she did something that really fucking pissed me off. I mean really really pissed me off. I was hoping she would not do this but she did. She reiterated through text on Thursday night while I was taking my last final that she couldn’t come out to hang out and thanked me for the invite.  Oh the anger I had. I made my final mistake with her here when I simply ask. That’s fine but I gotta ask whats your email? She never responded and I proceeded to delete her number and moved on. 

**Finale.**
Now im done with college got a decent paying job and about to get another IT job cause I want to move the fuck out but I do NOT want to rent. I want my own property.  I have since deleted all my social media, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin. Anyways I still think about her a year later and my best friend who she played with volleyball just twice saw her at the mall. He took some pictures he kept private on his Facebook so that’s how he remembered her but I don’t know how she remembers him. Supposedly she started nervously looking at him and starting at him then playing with her hair looking away and he noticed he knew her from somewhere but ignored it but looked back and there she was staring at him again. He told me she got very pale (I guess she didn’t want to come to the courts where I was at anymore nor did she even go out). Plus she’s still single. A girl as gorgeous as that is still single blows my mind. Now I don’t know but I could assume she was stalking his Facebook (remember she never added me in the first place no clue why). I found out after stalking her Facebook one more time that the guy she was in a previous LTR (6 years) with was a fucking stud dude. I knew she had been hurt before but I didn’t know what I was really up against lol. I mean this fucker became a model. I personally think that is the biggest fucking joke for a man to enter as a profession and find it hilarious but yeah this dude was good looking. I consider myself pretty good looking but obviously the 6’1 perfect fucker vs my 5’6 ass loses that battle when it comes to raw physical prowess. Anyways I have an uneasy feeling I will run into her again. She’s turning 28 and I’m currently 23. I want to think okay whatever shes going to hit the wall soon and basically she can go fuck herself but I know I fucked up to the point where I forced her hand in lying and losing her. I believe now I could have handled that situation better but I like to think that during struggle true women would be there for you. I hate her yet I still love her. I got what I needed and now every chick I talk too means absolutely nothing to me. They could be hot as shit  or easy as shit I just don’t care. Ive become a true bad boy where girls in my office with boyfriends try to create sexual tension with me. I could tell if a girl likes me immediately without me even trying or if there isn’t really much going on (usually if im dismissed because of height I can tell 50% chicks really like me while 50% autofriendzone me yet admit I am “cute” God I hate that term.) I have mastered other people and am still trying to figure myself out. The other night playing shuffleboard a girl came up rubbed my back down to grab my ass. I was like the fuck and just ignored her. I don’t know what it is as much as I love my new and improved self I just wish I could really have another shot at a girl like this if anything hopefully younger. I have become cold. I have a very keen interest on human behavior now. My biggest fear is myself because I have realized how cutthroat I really am. My inner alpha has always been there but I have noticed have a dual personality (a yin and yang). The bad boy side that always seems to cause mischief and trouble and the good guy side that just wants to make fun of himself and make people laugh and enjoy his life for what it is. The bad boy side has taken over my major personality nowadays where before it made sure I didn’t get too taken advantage of by my good guy side. I don’t try to be nice anymore; people must earn it unless I truly feel it’s to my advantage to be kind.  Before discovering theredpill about 3 months ago everything in their confirmed what I felt and how I went about my life. I can honestly truly say I am a natural alpha now and a true Machiavellian as I have applied the 48 laws of power through my entire life. I chose respect over love.  If I run into her again I honestly don’t know what I will do. My anger tells me to pretend she is dead and never acknowledge her existence. My evil cold side tells me to just fuck her and use her like a tool (not sure if im this cold yet). My good guy side tells me it’s my fault and you could have done better and I wish for one more chance. No matter the case I have no regrets of anything. I have only learned and progressed in life to a point where I am always 10 steps ahead of the curve. The only thing that drives me though now is anger...She breaking my heart facilitated it.

2q5u2l,1,2014-12-23,My gf [22F] wants to break up with me [23M] after 5 years because of long distance relationship. Advice?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2q5u2l/my_gf_22f_wants_to_break_up_with_me_23m_after_5/,"I met my girlfriend 6 years ago and have been going out with her for 5 years and she is perfect. 

We ve been in a long distance relationship for the past 4 month or so (due to the fact of me doing a 1 year internship and her completing her masters degree oversees; I finish next August she finishes next December). And when I say long, it means 10 hours time difference. 

Last 2 weeks she's been acting weird so I asked what's wrong, she wouldn't tell me. After a while I got her to talk and she told me that she is not feeling good anymore, she's always sad and it hurts her so much that we are not together and sharing moments like we used to. 

She said that we re talking less and less together which makes it worse. 

She's coming to spend a week vacation at the end of the month and I was planning to go to hers in March (both trips planned 2 month ago). 
But now she's saying that she wants to come and talk about us, our relationship face to face (instead of having fun and enjoy seeing each other)

She kept saying that she loves me so much and it kills her that we can't be together. What I understood is that she wants to break up and maybe we ll see what happens. She's not comfortable with the idea of us not knowing where our future will take us. She thinks that we do not have a future and can't stand that we will only see each other 20-40 days a year tops. 
I thought that we could be strong and sacrifice a bit until we both finish and do an effort to live/work in the same city. 

She ll be here in a week. Any ideas what I can do or what we should do to make this better? Or is this relationship doomed?

Help me reddit I'm in love. 

TL;DR: my gf wants to end our relationship because we barely see each other during the year and because of the time difference."
2q5wdk,1,2014-12-23,"New to challenge, but not NoFap concept (how I spiraled into addiction, saw personal effects, and wound up here)",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2q5wdk/new_to_challenge_but_not_nofap_concept_how_i/,"This is a story of why I am joining NoFap. The context bares heavily on depression and turning to fapping triggered by failed romance and rejection. For me, this is a reminder of why I am doing this. For viewers, I would appreciate any support. 

2008 start freshman year and seems like there's no time to fap with the new awesome neighbors, girls, and weird roommates in my life. I remember a girl asking me and my friend how often we masturbated, and I replied along the lines: ""It's unusual, but I haven't fapped for 4 weeks or so."" Back then, I fell in love with a girl, I exercised like crazy, and hungout a lot with my neighbors/good friends. I was 18 and never even kissed a girl due to wussing out in highschool. For some reason, the cutest girl in my group of friends liked me and we had a hot steamy make-out session one night. 

Unfortunately, she friend zoned me right after. Well, it sucked and I may have relapsed because of this, but not that badly. Conditions were the same and I still hungout with her. Another cute girl became very interested and me, and by the end of the semester, the first girl was jealous and then started liking me a lot again. Last 2 weeks, i got my first (terrible) HJ from her, but she also denied all other advances. The denials had definitely messed with me, and even though on the last day she wanted to lose virginity together, I said I wasn't ready (i thought it was what she wanted to hear, fucking dumb i know). One of the biggest regrets I have to this day. Well, she friendzoned me again but this time things got really weird and I was really pissed and we were both awkward around eachother. I definitely relapsed from this event and fapped a lot. One of my weirdo roommates was gone, and there was only one second semester. I believe I found ample jerk off time. Well, I noticed that my feelings were killed. I was not able to crush on other girls for a long time after her. She was stuck in my mind like 2 years. I ended up losing my virginity anyway at 20, but being 30-40 days fap free was not possible. By now, it was 2010 and I've heard of challenges to not fap, but thought it was a dumb joke. I probably hadn't gone over 7 days without fapping. Despite this, my life was improving slowly: I got into really good shape, I made lots of friends, became good at a few videogames but didn't let it control my life, graduated with a 3.7, hooked up here and there with girls, and got into grad school. Grad School, however, is where things turned for the worst.

I got a girlfriend in the summer of 2012, and things were fun. I used to not fap, so things would be better when I saw her. Still I would relapse. I also remember having trouble getting hard sometimes. In 2008, I never had trouble getting hard. In fact, I was hard forever and wouldn't orgasm from the terrible HJs that girl in 2008 was giving me, despite my lust/love for her... Back to story. Grad school created a long distance relationship. This girl was crazy and I constantly dealt with her being upset at me or something else. This and Grad school created intense stress--I fapped all the time. I also had my own room which made it easy. After break up with her, it became difficult to start relationships with other girls. Fap like crazy until finals are over. Summer internship leaves for less fapping. 

Over summer internship, I am setup with an employee/supervisor's daughter. She is smokin'. My game is terrible though due to lack of practice/experience.  Still, she really liked me, and we go on dates. We made out; probably could've gone further, but still wuss status. I fucked it up on a date and from other things probably, and she stopped returning texts/calls. Pretty upset cause how attractive she was. I don't turn to excessive fapping yet because the next weekend is really good (but not in hindsight).

Knows about simplepickup and try to learn more from them. Next weekend I go out to the bars with a just friend girl. She shows up really late, so in the meantime I miraculously make friends with random ppl and a cute girl that knows them. She really likes me and I go to kiss her for the lolz. She rejects first kiss, but wants to later at the other bar we walk to. My luck is through the roof this night because I run into the girl I opine at the time is the hottest in the grad school. She is a slutty looking blonde, 5'8, tan/fake tan, blue eyes. I'm also 5'8 and she wears heals lolz. Long story short, hot steamy make out in the bar (funny- older giant brother wants to kick my ass and lets it be known to me). After a few other hook ups and me being too much of a pussy/nub to actually get to homebase... I fall in love and get friendzoned/rejected. Her rejection and constant attention-wanting aka flirting makes want to jerk off constantly. Here is where I really spiral out of control with PMO. My feels for her are completely irrational, and many good prospects I reject, neglect, or am blind to. This goes on until now, which is about a year, where I slowly regress in becoming a better man… I almost never work out and have the worst anxiety when texting girls. This semester has been the worst (despite good grades, i have one anticipated bad grade because no motivation to do the work caused a terrible paper that required a week of time, but was condensed to 1 day). I fapped with no self-control and noticed how bad things were getting.

Well, I realize that I need a change and that change is NoFap. There have been way too many missed opportunities, pointless/unprecedented addictions to specific girls, loss of skills, and extreme moments of depressions, laziness, procrastination, and etc. Every time I see my life going in positive directions that is correlated with extremely low levels of fap. Conversely, moments of despair, weakness, procrastination, regress, and depression are in conjunction with high levels of fap (Once/more a day). NoFap challenge is what I need, it is what I want to do, and I want to be in control of my life. That is why I am here, have read up, and am posting.

It has been 3 days so far. It would be 5, but I relapsed from a snowballing effect. I’m likely having sex with a girl a day or two after new year’s. Hoping not to relapse from the chaser effect. I’m not going for hardmode, unless I do relapse and then I’m only going to have sex if it’s a girl I really like or is very very attractive. So I'm doing the standard 90 day challenge. Wish me luck guys!

2q67ti,3,2014-12-23,Gender norms have ruined my identity and self-confidence,tossaway-,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2q67ti/gender_norms_have_ruined_my_identity_and/,"Perhaps someone here can talk some sense into me. 

I'm 26 and not getting any younger, and today I'm further than ever from how I truly feel inside. My masculine (although subtle) features, physique competition shape, and short hair have not done me any favors in the past 5 years. This is how I feel, at least - I know others who would disagree. 

I love fitness. Lifting is my life. I can deadlift 295# and, as a 5'6"" female, I am damn proud of that. I have broad shoulders, but I'm functional! My hair has always been reminiscent of either Charlize Theron's pixie (with bangs) or Evan Rachel Wood's short sides/long top.   I don't wear men's clothing, barring a pair of shoes or two of course. However, my style is quite androgynous (read: well fitting, not loose or baggy, clothing). I don't know enough about makeup to wear it heavily, but I'm most always sporting eyeliner/mascara/light eye shadow. I prefer a more natural look. 

On many **MANY** occasions I have been mistaken for a man. I've had women step out of the restroom to double check the sign. Of course, I thought it was silly and usually laughed it off, thinking I was content with my style and self.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Rewind to last September when I began an internship. I became close with my instructor very quickly. Her and I were similar in many ways and that allowed us to foster a great friendship and professional relationship. Then one day she told me I walked like a 'bodybuilder' - like guys who have lifted too much. In the days following she would make comments about women who compete in physique and bodybuilding, saying they looked like men. Being in this environment made me feel less feminine, somehow. I began to let my hair grow and she pushed for that, encouraging me all the while - telling me how great it would look!*

*I didn't go to the gym much either. In all fairness, I was taking courses at the university and working full time + some...so free time for lifting was hard to come across. But I believe that, subconsciously, I didn't want to lift for fear of looking 'manly.'*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My internship has since ended and here I am, a soft blob on the couch with scraggly chin length hair channeling Erik von Detten circa 1998. Over the past couple days, I have been questioning what I'm doing with myself. I still am not lifting, and my hair is still growing. I assume this was my attempt to feel and become more feminine, although I feel almost persuaded to change. But, I'm questioning whether the attempt to feel and become more feminine is what I wanted, OR what I presume society wants, for me. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, perhaps advice on what I should do with myself? How to be more feminine with short hair and a super athletic physique? An explanation of why I care so much about what others think about me and what roles are 'assigned' to me?


**Halp.**


**Edit: Not that my sexual orientation matters, but I am bisexual and happily married to a woman. She actually prefers my hair short, but getting called sir just gets to me. Not to mention, I'm further perpetuating the stereotypes people already have about lesbians.**"
2q6tt8,7,2014-12-23,Got an internship offer... Some advice?,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2q6tt8/got_an_internship_offer_some_advice/,"A few days ago, I received an actuarial internship offer at a medium-sized life firm. I thought I would be ecstatic at getting any offer for the summer, but it doesn't seem to be the case...

First of all, the offer expires early in January. I have one more interview with a health firm, and I just had a few phone interviews recently, all of which I felt good about. The thing is, I was really hoping into getting an internship in P&amp;C since that's my long term field of interest. I did not receive any offers from P&amp;C insurance firms, nor do I have any pending applications at P&amp;C firms. However, I did have phone interviews for internship positions that somewhat resembled the role of a P&amp;C actuarial intern (predictive modelling, research, statistics in insurance, etc.) I felt I have good chances for these positions based on the phone interview. 

I am inclined on waiting for the results of these phone interviews, but I was actually not expecting to receive an offer from the life firm (again, based on the interview).

So, knowing all of this, I need some advice.

* I'm definitely not thinking of rejecting the offer at the life firm. But if I get an offer from one of the companies I like, is it possible or even advisable to rescind my acceptance of their offer?
* I have heard that the field of your first position generally the field you stay in. Does this usually apply for internships as well? For example, when applying for EL positions, would P&amp;C firms value a candidate's actuarial internship at a life firm?
* Am I crazy for even hesitating on the actuarial internship for the non-actuarial ones?

Sorry for the wall of text, I feel like this is a big decision and I want to make the best possible choice."

23 year old college student in Chicago for a full-time internship until early May. I'm short (5'1), busty, and Asian-American, but I'm not looking to be fetishized for my ethnicity. Guys generally describe me with words like ""cute, pretty, adorable."" If I posted to GW, I would probably fall somewhere between GW and GWCurvy (size 8-10 pants). I consider myself creative, pragmatic, witty, and very silly. I typically dress modestly, but I also love feminine things like high heels, manicure/pedicures, and makeup. I can usually be found working/studying, cooking, or Netflixing...often simultaneously. I'm a bit kinky, so I would love to explore some sexual fantasies with you. I'm 75/25 submissive to dominant, so I can be a good girl or a flippant brat, when the setting is right. I'm a very independent person, so I'm not looking for a Daddy to pay my rent. But I'd love lingerie and clothing (of your choosing) to go to fancy meals, as you show me off. 



**You:**
Live within an hour drive of Chicago. Preferably under 35 years old, but I can be swayed if there's a connection. You're single (no girlfriend, wife, or other subs). You consider yourself a protective, generous, and kind man. You're the type who runs ahead to open the car door for me. You recall conversation where I make offhanded remarks to buy me the perfect gift I didn't remember I wanted. You're responsible, decisive, intelligent, and funny. Any ethnicity works for me, but hopefully you're in a healthy weight range. Bonuses for me: tattoos, beard, hung, kinky, and wants to help me get into better shape. 



**Us:**
We're honest and communicative with each other. Our dynamic is laidback and fun. We have lots of sex, as I'm pretty much insatiable. We go out, shop, and enjoy nice meals together. We also spend nights in hanging out and watching GoT/Walking Dead/anything else. 



If this sounds like the kind of arrangement you're looking for, please message me! We can see where it goes over Kik.

**COMMUNITYSTUCK, YEAR 1, DAY 235; 67 DAYS POST-CONDESCENSION**

This past update has been rich with Vriska quotes.

You know, I know a girl who has a haircut like Vriska's right now. It's actually sort of cute, if a little unconventional. It's definitely a haircut symbolizing youth and boldness, and a rebellion against societal norms.

I was on board with Vriska &lt;&gt; Meenah, but I'm ambivalent on Vriska &lt;3 Meenah. 

Oh well. Here's hoping we get back to Retjohnning in tonight's update.

I stayed up all night into the wee hours of the morning playing Destiny with my buddy and drinking a shit ton. The thing about *this* particular gaming session, however, was that we were in the same room. After several *wicked* crucible matches, we decided we'd play a free-for-all game type. After we each stomped each other once, we decided we'd make it interesting... by colluding within the game.

Essentially, we behaved as if we were still a team, but with the change that friendly fire is on... and rewarded. We took turns trying to win games, helping each other to win. Sadly, we were never able to get him to win one. 

Also, I'm going to end up starting the internship much sooner than I originally expected. I'll be starting on January the 7^th, as opposed to Groundhog Day (a movie I *highly* recommend to those who haven't seen it).

[Now, newcomers, lurkers. I've told you about my day. You know about me. If you're a lurker, you've probably known a lot about me for a while.

MrCheeze is the most dangerous individual on /r/homestuck. As such, I have no opinion on this matter.

2q8sfw,3,2014-12-23,Honeymoon in San Francisco - what are the essentials to do/see?,zeroblitzt,AskSF,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/2q8sfw/honeymoon_in_san_francisco_what_are_the/,"Hi everyone,

First of all, let me give you a little back story. I went to San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference in 2011 and spent more time falling in love with the city than I spent at the panels. Later that year, I did my internship in Los Angeles, and during my last week in California before flying back to Pennsylvania, my girlfriend joined me. We drove from LA to SF and spent 3 full days exploring the city. That road trip was a big defining factor in our relationship.

So now, 3 years and some change later, we are on the cusp of our wedding date (Jan 3). Half of our honeymoon will be in Palm Springs (I call this the relaxation half), and the other half will be in San Francisco because we loved the city so much.

My question to this sub is, what are the essential must see places? Where are the must eat restaurants? What are other things in the Bay Area that are doable in a reasonable amount of time?

When we were out there in 2011, we hit the Golden Gate bridge via bikes (rode into Sausalito), Golden Gate Park, Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf, and probably some other stuff along the way I'm forgetting. 

It may sound lame but we want to be tourist-y. My fiancee is working on her masters now and she wants to go straight into a doctoral program, so I doubt we will manage to get back here for a while. Any suggestions are appreciated and I respect any thing you say. We have ~4.5 days in the city (that last day we'll need to leave some time to get to SFO).

Also, what is the weather like in January? (I'm guessing cold and ""crusty"" - When I was out in March of 2011 I managed to catch the first snow in SF in 45 years, at least thats what the papers said)"
2q9hzi,100,2014-12-24,How skincare addiction helped me quit smoking (thanks everyone),Zweisoldner,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2q9hzi/how_skincare_addiction_helped_me_quit_smoking/,"I thought I'd share this story for any other smokers out there who are trying to quit. I haven't completely quit yet, but have made good progress. In large part due to this sub for allowing me trading my addiction for cigarettes to skincare. At this point, I only smoke two or three every Thursday night when going out with friends who bum me. I was smoking two packs a week before.

I'm 22, and I was a smoker for a good two years. After coming back from an overseas internship in August where a combination of cheap alcohol, cigarettes and LOTS of surfing destroyed my skin, I knew I had to make a change. I was ten shades darker, my skin was oily and flaky, and even developed wrinkles on my forehead.

I browsed this sub endlessly, replacing all my overpriced sales rep suggested products with the ones best reviewed by the community and makeupalley. I've spent about $400 (clarisonic included today), bouncing between different products and constantly finding better ones. My routine went from cleanser/ moisturizer to variations of OCM/cleanser/toner/exfoliate/moisturizer/retinol/sunscreen Smoking became such a liability to this new obsession that quitting become very possible, and the money I wasn't spending on cigarettes went to skincare products. Worth it I'd say.

I just bought my first pack today since August thinking I should let myself loose a little because its Christmas. I smoked one and threw the rest out in the rain 10 minutes ago because it made me feel noxious, and the fact I had cigarettes on me conflicted with my skincare routine (just thinking of the crap in cigarettes mixing with my moisturizer and sunscreen was unbearable).

Four months ago the mirror shocked me. Now I always find myself pleasantly surprised at the bright complexion and smoothness, and my gradually fading SFs. My goal now is to let the smoking habit go for good.

So thank you reddit skincare, I realize this may all seem farfetched, but heck my skin certainly isn't having a bit of doubt. Happy holidays :)."

### A Year in Review

**January - June**

____________________________________________________________

### **JANUARY**

____________________________________________________________

Let's kick it off with January. The Creatures have just settled in their new office and said [goodbye to their second Creature House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE4ZGBMIBn8). We start this month pretty good, with a cheesy [office tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpJ-u4CKMRM). TreeTopia still continues and after some time, [the server crashes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E8RTyJ9yxo). Dan and Jordan record an experimental film, simply named - [snowflake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFQq5Xp4R8E). They also posted a [Creature House tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrJSxBvYwO4) (they haven't posted it before because... #privacy). 2 weeks go by, the guys are almost settled in and here we have it - the first [Creature Talk in their office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Dl6N8dr0H0). But that's not important! What is more important, that, after like 6 months, we got a new episode of [Sarcasm with Seamus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO6nm296JZ4). Oh and, oh boy! How could I almost forget about that video? Handyman Koots attempts to [wall mount a TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjXzRT_lZng). He fails. Not-so-badly tho. Weeks go by and The Creatures are ready to make a new movie night in the office - [I, Frankenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo9EOnMssd8).

### **FEBRUARY**

____________________________________________________________

Aleks and James streamed together and poop goes down the toilet. Well not really poop, but vomit I guess. They try to do a Beer Challenge, but James, being a smart man, brings a bottle of vinegar. Watch them both struggle, until they almost die ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3MtUWC_ZAg), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrmvl66Oqyg), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNjfn7AOPj0) and [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulyv6rKeC8c)).

You know what they say, it's never too late for Christmas! The Creatures progress and put out 2 new movie nights in a month ([The LEGO Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiQ7zMdfFho) and [Robocop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFbghSZFYEs)).

Dan and Jordan did this weird [GUNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eXMbyCyS2w) skit, that nobody really understands. The Creatures announced a new Minecraft series - [Minecraft Factions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r2tEzLWJvs), played on their Minecraft server.

2qabcw,5,2014-12-24,"Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [21 M] of 3 years, and having issues that could break us up.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qabcw/me_20_f_with_my_boyfriend_21_m_of_3_years_and/,"I'm going to try to be plain with facts because my boyfriend has a reddit account. I have been with ""Aaron"" for 3 years now.  I have enjoyed our relationship for most of it.  We moved in together this past summer.  However, I feel like I want out of the relationship.  


Aaron has a mild form of autism.  I have been pretty patient and understanding about it but it's really wearing me down.  I don't know if everything he does/the way he acts is purely from this or if some of it is just him. He even went to a doctor about this, but they just thought he was depressed, not autistic in anyway. 


Aaron is very particular about everything he does and while he will make some adjustments to the way I like things, they are minimal and/or short lived. I usually adjust to his way and to his wants/needs because half of the time they are things that I don't really care about how they are done, just as long as they get done, like chores etc. 


However, whenever we do anything social, he doesn't talk much, unless it's purely about his interests.  If not, he won't say anything and end up on his phone. He won't even make much of an effort to talk to me. He does this with my family also.  They have tried to accommodate to what he likes to talk about, once I told them what it was, and he still doesn't talk much. Aaron knows family is important to me but he just won't try at all unless they start conversations with him about what he knows.


If I ever just want to be with my friends without him, since I know socializing isn't much of his thing, he wants to come with me anyway.  He really just wants to spend his time with me, and basically only me. While this is sweet and flattering, I feel a lot of pressure. I feel like I'm all he has at times and I don't think that is fair. I don't think it is okay to base your entire schedule/world (if world isn't being too dramatic) on me. I always feel like I have to make sure he is enjoying himself, which he usually never is, and I try to make him feel more included, but he just doesn’t really care.


It's not all bad, though.  He cares for and loves me. He is willing to do things for me that I know he would prefer not to, even though this doesn't happen very often. I still appreciate everything he has ever done or given me. He can be really sweet and cute, even though I am the only person that gets to see this. I enjoy our nights alone together, but I think that is all he wants, is just us alone all the time.


I feel like I want to be single, but not for the dating aspect. I'm young, getting close to graduating college next year, and I don't plan on staying where I live. I want to travel, meet new people, and feel free to do what I want, when I want. I can't help but think this is selfish to feel this way and find it to be wrong. But is it? I want to be able to socialize and not feel like I have to make a large amount of adjustments.


Aaron doesn't go to school, just works, and really has no ambition to consider what to do for a career. We're young, so I know this isn't a huge issue, or at least I don't think it is, but when it comes to moving and finding a full time job (hopefully), the dynamics of the relationship could change drastically and quickly end with us breaking up. This would be shitty because I would have had him move out of his home state for practically nothing.


I recently got a cool internship. While I was working on the application for it, Aaron said I shouldn’t apply, that it would be a waste of my money (it costs quite a chunk of change to do it). This bothered me because I told him how excited I would be to get it and all the opportunities that will come from it for my future. I feel like he wants to hold me back because I’m actually trying to do something with my life.


Lately, I have been feeling like this relationship isn't going to work out. I love him and yet I don't think I can keep going. A couple months ago, I told him how I felt truthfully. He's not much for emotions, but he did cry a bit when I discussed it with him, which was surprising. He asked why I didn't just end it, since that is what I want. I mentioned that we try again down the road but said he never would. He also would never go to counseling, so that’s not an available option. And if I go alone, I feel like they will tell me what I already feel.


But I don't know if it is the right choice, or if it is really want I want. I told Aaron that I wanted to work things out, not throw away our relationship, which is the longest either of us ever had. I love him and care about him but I feel trapped. The last thing I want to do to him is to break his heart. I hate the fact that I could be that person to hurt him so severely. 


He just told me he doesn't want to spend Christmas with my family.  He'd rather enjoy his day alone.  Also, he mentioned we shouldn't celebrate it in the future. I understand that some people hate Christmas, that it's a consumerism driven thing, but I want to spend quality time with my family, since I can't as much while I'm at college. 


This really hurt me because I have been trying to work through my own negativity to improve our relationship. But hearing this just sucked. How can I be in a long term relationship with someone that doesn't care about getting to know my family at all? This relationship will end if I end it, and yet Aaron won't try to make connections with my family?  Even small ones? It's confusing.


Granted, he doesn't have much communication with his own family. He never tried to involve himself in that aspect either, even when he was a kid. So I guess he just isn't a family-oriented person like I am. But I still find it a bit frustrating. I make an effort to talk to his family whenever we were around them. I guess it's just easier for me, since I can be pretty social. 


I have talked to my family and one of my closest friends about this.  They all agree that it has to end sometime if things don't improve. I thought things were getting better for a bit there but after Aaron said he didn't want to be around for Christmas, I feel like I'm going to end it soon. But, again, I really don't want to make a rash decision.

Love how the reddit all in the Christmas spirit :).

A received some money from my internship that I can spend. I've always wanted to get myself a Xbox One controller for Windows, so this is the time!

I found a website that sells the Xbox One controller for Windows, but before I pressed the order button I went ahead and showed it to my best friend.

He owns a Xbox One himself, but also plays PC games.

I got told that a regular Xbox One controller also works for Windows, and that I don't need to get a special ''for Windows'' variant.

He can prove it because he plugged his Xbox One controller in his Windows 8.1 PC with a smartphone cable.

I just wanted to be sure however. Why would they even sell them if the Xbox variant works fine? 

Lastly the ''for Windows'' is only in black, but the Xbox variant has a cool white, orange which I like a lot!

Well that's my burning question! I wish every single Xbox owner a happy Christmas! 

**Edit:** I just ordered myself the Xbox One Titanfall controller! Not because I like the game, but also because of the look."

I'm a programmer currently working full time as a software engineer. Ever since I've started programming, I've enjoyed making games. I'm looking to find some people to work with to make some games in our spare time. What I'd expect from people I work with and what you can expect from me (this is shamelessly stolen from a previous post but these guys had it spot on):

* You are a hobbyist/spare time developer or artist regardless of age or background.
* You are passionate about what you are doing.
* You are honest when facing adversity (not being able to figure how to do something or not finding the time) instead of making excuses or leaving us in silence.
* You are interested in putting the effort to keep in touch about your progress (or lack of).
* You understand that everyone is at a different skill level and are willing to give and receive help in an effort to help each other improve.
* You understand that everyone has different life and time requirements. However, you should be able to commit a minimum of 10-15 hours of serious effort a week.
* You are able to hear criticism without becoming defensive. You are able to give criticism without being aggressive. You understand that criticism, given or received, is not aimed at you personally, but is there to try to improve the project.
* You can work seriously, but without a serious attitude. If you say you’ll do X amount of work, you do it.

About me: just finished my undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering this past summer, worked as an intern at NASA for 2 years working in C/C++/Python/Perl, 3 years experience working in Unity3D (C#), a bit of experience in XNA and in Unreal Engine 4, and currently working as a full time engineer in a Silicon Valley startup (Java/Python, enterprise software, Agile development).

I've been enjoying making games in my spare time since I started programming but I want to do something a little more serious than just prototypes. I'm looking for some people who want to make a game for fun but treat it seriously enough for it to come to life rather than just being another prototype.

**EDIT:** At this point, I've found a programmer to work with. I've gotten a few replies from artists but if you're an artist and interested send me a PM!

**EDIT 2:** Wow! Lots of responses to this thread! I've got one artist selected now as well. Looking for another one (possibly two) artists. Concept art and animation skills a plus!"

I'm a student at USC majoring in CS and Business, and I'm a full stack web developer by background (worked at LinkedIn last summer as a web dev intern, working there again next summer as a software eng intern). I'm working on a product I call CloudThink, a digital marketing research platform. Since it's really early stage, I don't want to go into more detail on a public forum, but definitely can go over it if interested via PM.

I'm looking for a front-end designer (even better if web dev [HTML/CSS, no JavaScript necessary-I can do that part) who would be interested in joining in exchange for co-founder status and substantial equity. Unfortunately since I'm in college I can't offer money at this time, nor sponsorship.

I'd be building the back-end.

Thanks!"
2qby98,16,2014-12-24,I'm freaking out,FlyingPeacock,JobFair,https://www.reddit.com/r/JobFair/comments/2qby98/im_freaking_out/,"Hi guys,

So right now, I'm starting to freak out. I've got 2 semesters left of college, and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I haven't had a summer internship yet, and while I have been employed and am currently employed, I'm not sure my skills will be applicable to the business world. I'm enrolled in a 4 year undegrad program where I'm studying business administration. What I'm looking for is a job where I get daily interaction with people. I'm not sure if I should look at HR, management, or really anything specifically. What worries me most is that I just won't find something. I'm not looking to start out with a 60k a year job, but I also don't want to be paid $10 hourly and not be able to support myself.

Here are some things I would like to highlight about myself, and I'm wondering if you guys had any suggestions for self-marketing or areas of employment that I should consider.

I've worked several jobs within my university including telecounseling (telemarketing), chemistry TA, and most recently campus safety emergency equipment inspector (it's a mouthful). 

My current cumulative GPA is 3.08.

I'm fluent in both English and Spanish, speak a bit of French (3 years in high school), and a bit of Croatian (I lived in Croatia for 3 years). 

I have lived overseas in 5 countries, and have extensive travel in Europe. 

On my resume, what should I prioritize? I have education and employment, and I've managed to put languages in at the bottom. Is international experience worth mentioning, or is that something to save for interviews? Is it worth mentioning at all?

What sort of jobs could I work with a business admin degree? I'm not opposed to travel or working for any type of organization (private or government). 

Thank you guys for your help. I've posted on here in the past and the advice/comments have been helpful.


Regards,

FP

2qc2gd,4,2014-12-24,My past depression has left me numb..,Josetheone1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2qc2gd/my_past_depression_has_left_me_numb/,"My mom's currently guilt tripping me to stay in the country after I graduate but there is no way in hell I will, I've told her this and she's all I've got and I'm all she's got. But I don't want to live here anymore. 

From the ages of 10 I've told my mom that I hate this country and that I don't plan on living here in the future, after I graduate I plan to get an internship abroad, there is nothing for me here my only friends are at university and will go back to their hometowns after they graduate and my family is nonexistent, I've spent my last 3 Christmas meals with just me and my mom at the dinner table.

I suffer from constant relapses while here over the summer, I have mental breakdowns because I see no one and spend my time alone while my mom is at work, I travel and stay with friends in other countries that is only a temporary fix. 

In 2012, I had a severe mental breakdown where I broke down crying in the street when me and my mom visited another town for a university open day, I thought she would understand how this life here is killing me. 

I feel very little now a days and I think I've developed a real psychological disorder, I'm a nice cheerful guy if you met me you'd think there's nothing wrong, but I've never felt ""happy"". 

I have trouble getting close to people as growing up I've had no family and am an only child and relied on friends for stability, I thought i had good friends throughout school but was tossed aside after I left school as was left without a single person to talk to for a year of all my friends going to university and me just sat at home doing nothing but a small job in a factory.  

I love my mom, or I think I do, I've never ""loved"" anyone, I've had girlfriends and boyfriends but I struggle to form close relationships with people. I honestly just don't care about anything beyond my goal of getting out of this country.

What's wrong with me? I've just given up with caring... 

Sorry about the long read, had an argument with my mom and she's crying while I don't feel anything, I just want to leave."
2qc4k9,3,2014-12-24,So stressed out,weekn,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2qc4k9/so_stressed_out/,"I'm so overwhelmingly stressed out about the future I can't sleep anymore. 

I'm a senior in college, and there's sort of two things that are bringing me so far down mentally.

First, I'm starting the job process, and i'm so unprepared to find a job after college. Insecurity and depression have made my grades mediocre, and have in some sense prevented me from getting any real experience to put on my resume. As a computer science major, having internship experience is so important to getting a job and I've got nothing. I'm too socially anxious to go to hackathons and my resume sucks. I'm so worried i'm not going to find a job, and will have to move back home. Even being here for a week for the holidays is making me beyond depressed, my parents are incredibly negative and I can't handle it.

Second, I'm about to graduate with out ever having any significant relationship with a girl. I'm very clearly too ugly and awkward to ever find love... I workout everyday but every time I make progress on getting in shape I have a mental breakdown and stop going and stress eat and stick with the same cycle. I've tried therapy so many times, it just doesn't do anything for me. Anti-depressants made me cry everyday. I'm just looking forward to a life where I'm going to be unemployed and alone and I can't take it. And after graduation, I'm going to miss the only thing that ever makes me happy, which is seeing my best friends every day. I'm such a mess, I don't want to live like this anymore :("
2qcsks,150,2014-12-25,"He just stood there, staring at us",mahnvee,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/2qcsks/he_just_stood_there_staring_at_us/,"It’s been a year since I started frequenting this sub, and you’d think that I’d have learnt something by now. But sometimes we get too comfortable in our surroundings. Our routines stay the same day in and day out, but all it takes is a small shift in these routines to change these comfortable surroundings into something a little more sinister.

This incident took place when I was 19 years old. I had never been away from home for more then a few days (debate camp in high school probably doesn’t count). And the college that I went to was so close to my parent’s home that college felt more like sleep away camp for 4 days a week. 

I knew that never leaving my comfort zone was hurting my growth. So I signed up for an internship through an organization at my college and packed my bags for Greece. 

This trip offered me the chance to spread my wings and try and my hand at being independent. I wanted to go out of my comfort zone and what says, “leaving the comfort zone” better than going to a country where I don’t speak the language or have any family or friends. 

All in all, the trip was great. I was faced with a lot of obstacles, but it taught me a lot of life lessons like, fight to get what you want, and never take no for answer, and gypsie children are not to be trusted, they will try and pickpocket you while distracting you with their cutsey acts.

These lessons I’ll hold with me forever, but the most important lesson I learned was alertness and trusting your gut. 

This incident happened after I had been living in Greece for about a month so at that point I was very comfortable there. I had established my routine, I woke up at 8:30, got breakfast, took the tram/metro to the office, got there by 10 to 10:30, worked till 5, got home, relaxed for a bit then I’d go out with the other interns around 7 and explore the city. I always got home at varying hours but I was never worried because the area I lived in was well lighted and very crowded because we lived right next to a huge square. 
Also I had my roommate Andrea, a boy from Venice, who was always waiting for me at the apartment and was semi-dependable.

Not to say I wasn’t cautious in Greece, for example, while I was out and about the city I was always on the look out for suspicious looking people. I even had my purse nailed across my torso but as soon as I was in my neighborhood I would relax. 
It was a safe neighborhood. 

One night I was walking back to my place from the tram, when a stranger approached me. It was around 11:30 pm and I was 2 blocks away from my apartment, there were still a bunch of people walking around in the area so I put my headphones in and was briskly walking back to my place when I felt it. 

Someone was walking right behind me. I scooted to the side of the sidewalk and expected them to pass me but the followed me. So I stopped and turned, there was a guy standing there with a plastic bag filled with wrapped something in it. 

“Are you Indian?” That’s all he asked me. 

“Yes I am, can I help you?” In my mind, I figured this guy might be a foreigner or tourist like me, maybe he needed some help getting somewhere but only spoke Hindi and needed a translator.

“Oh I’m half Pakistani.” And he just kind of looked at me expectantly. 

At this point I was very confused and I was still rooted on the side of the sidewalk. What the hell did this guy want? 

“I was buying dinner for my mother and I saw you.” More staring. 
He seemed normal, but something felt weird. I just wanted to run away from this guy.

“Oh, do you need something?” Fight or flight was starting to kick in. I started assessing the guy; he was skinny, and a head taller then me.
Could I take him?

“I don't see many Indians so I wanted to talk to you. What language do you speak?” He was struggling with English, if it was a conversation he wanted that wasn’t happening. 
Through the side of my eye I started to look around, there were still people around me so I could always scream for help. 

“I speak English and Hindi.” I don't know why, but I was getting a weird energy off this dude. 

“Oh, my English not very good.” Thank you Jesus, I could use this as a way to end the conversation and go home. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, well I have to go so bye.” I started to walk away from him. Walk actually isn’t strong enough; I was basically jogging down the street. 

“I’ll walk you back.” Well fuck. 

“No I’m fine.” This guy was not getting the fucking hint. 
 
“No its okay.” This guy wasn’t taking no as an answer and he was easily keeping up with my pace.  Clearly flight wasn’t an option here. 

He started asking me questions, what I was doing in Greece, how long I was there for, where I was staying. I answered as vaguely as I could, this guy didn't need to know anything about me. 
We were now within 200 feet of my place and I knew was that I couldn't let this guy figure out where I lived but I couldn’t keep walking with him either. 
I don't know why, but I knew I needed to get help. 

I could call for help, maybe Andrea or the police. Except I had no minutes left on my phone because I was almost done with my internship.
Fuck.

I started to slow down as I saw a split in the road, we were almost at my apartment and I couldn’t find a way to shake tis guy off of me.
That’s when I saw the answer to my prayers. 

A few doors down from my apartment was a funeral home. This place was open 24/7. No matter what time of day or night I came home, these guys were always there. 
I guess you never know when someone’s gonna bite the dust. 
The owner was this older man who I saw every morning on my way to work. He was sweet and he always greeted me in the morning. I figured he would let me stay there, or call Andrea, or the police. Something was better than nothing. 

I suddenly turned to the stranger, “It was nice meeting you but I have to leave now.”
I pointed at the funeral home, “I have to go.” 

“Do you know what that place is? Let’s go on a walk instead.” He looked at me like I was a crazy person. 
But the suggestion of spending any more time with him set off an alarm in me, and I just knew I had to get away from this guy. 

“No I have to go.” I shook his hand; no idea why I did that, and ran across the street like the devil himself was behind me. 

He called out after me, but I didn't even try to comprehend what he was trying to say.  

I walked/ran up the steps of the funeral home and burst into the office. 
The old man wasn’t there. Instead, two men were in the room. They both must have been in their late twenties; they were both tall but one was portly while the other well built. 
I didn't care that they weren’t the old man, I just started talking.
“Can I please just stay here for like 5 minutes, there’s just this guy and he’s not leaving me alone and I don't want him to know where I live and I live next door and can I just stay here? Please?” 
The well-built man was very confused, too much English, too fast, but the portly man understood and explained the situation.
They were very sweet and had me sit down while and got me a cup of water. 

Oh I forgot to mention a detail about the office. The entire front and side of the office were functionally made of glass. 
So those on the inside could see the outside and those on the outside could see inside. 

The men introduced themselves to me; the well-built man was Costas and the portly man was Yanis. Yanis sat me down on a chair that had its back to the glass wall. 

“He’s a persistent one.” Yanis was handing me my second glass of water and I had been sitting in the funeral home for 20 minutes.
The stranger was still standing across the street from the funeral home.
He just stood there, staring at us. 
Yanis motioned to Costas, and Costas went and stood outside. They were having a stare off. 

In the meantime, Yanis was trying to make me calm down, not an easy task because suddenly I knew I was right to run away from him. 
I mean come one, standing outside a funeral home at midnight and staring at a girl for 20 minutes is not behavior exhibited by normal people. Every what if was turning into a worst-case scenario in my head, what if I had gone home and he had followed me? What if I had continued talking to him? Or walking with him?

Finally Costa’s stare seemed to work and this guy turned tail and started to walk back up the street. I started picking my stuff up and  profusely thanking Yanis and Costas for their help. I turned and looked out the window to see how far away this guy was. I needed to be sure he wouldn't see me leaving the funeral home. Just in case he started feeling chatty again.

And then I saw where he was walking and I swear I almost fainted. From the funeral home I could see the this guy had walked the 7 or 8 blocks from the funeral home back down to the main street and had turned towards the tram. 
Maybe it was the fear in my brain making me loose it but all I could think was, “Maybe this guy followed me home on the tram.”

When he was out of sight, Yanis and Costas ushered me back home, it was almost 12:30 am and they wanted me back safe in my house. 

Luckily the way the street bends around the funeral home means that anyone walking from the direction I had come can’t see the beyond the funeral home, so they couldn't see my apartment. 
I got home safe, and filled Andrea in on what had happened. The rest of my trip went smoothly and I got back home safe. 

I honestly think that if I had been more alert and more vigilant, then I wouldn't wonder if that guy followed me home from the heart of Athens to my neighborhood. If I hadn't put my headphones in, maybe I would’ve noticed someone following me earlier or maybe I wouldn’t have looked like a target.
And even though the climax of my story is a guy staring at me while I sit in a funeral home for 40 minutes, I can’t help but feel like that dude could’ve been a serial killer. "

I met her at our workplace when she was having her internship and I was working part time. She is a very interesting girl who is always cheerful and can be very direct in the way she speaks. She didn't have any experience in a relationship and is clueless when I dated her out. After a few dates I decided to make her my girlfriend.

Things went very well for the first 1 and a half month, we text each other every day, all the care and concern as well as being very sweet towards me.

However, things changed nearing 2 month into the relationship, she started not replying my messages as usual, her replies are cold and half hearted. I asked her, and she told me she is unsure if she really liked me or she just cannot commit to the r/s. I was devastated. I cried and searched for every possible little detail which I may have wronged her.

After she said that, she started a part time job, when I messaged her, it seems like I am the most annoying person there is on earth. There were times I would let it go and think she's probably busy/tired. And times where I would panic and send more messages which annoy her even more.

We went out a few times (lesser than usual). And it's not the same anymore. She isn't laughing at my jokes, when I talked about anything, it seemed to have annoy her as well. Things got worst and during our last date, she just stopped talking altogether. We went home early and she wanted to meet me the next day which I know what is going to happen.

We met. I tried to save the r/s and she said she find it very difficult and suffocating. I felt relieved. But I kept thinking why would she suddenly changed and I can't accept that she changed so suddenly. It's been 3 months and I still want her back.

Help.

2qd2ma,16,2014-12-25,Found a migratory beekeeper to work with. Sharing info,Mtard31,Beekeeping,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/2qd2ma/found_a_migratory_beekeeper_to_work_with_sharing/,"Some of you guys might now, i live in Turkey, i am new to beekeeping but i am really interested, and for the last few months i have been looking for a migratory beekeeper that i could work with or intern, so i can learn beekeeping.

I figured the professional traveling beekeepers know the most since they have a lot of hives and they do this professionally. I finally found a guy who has 900-1000 hives. Last Tuesday i had the opportunity to talk to him a little more (not face to face) and now i have a little bit more information.

He has 3 people working for him, i will be interning and not getting paid but instead i will be paid with 10-15 hives when its done. We will be 5 people. 

He starts the season in February in a town called Antalya (A southern town that is usually considered to be touristic). He migrates the hives approximately the last week of April-first week of May to a town called Şırnak (One of the most dangerous towns in Turkey, has borders with Syria and Iran, one of the towns that has the most terrorism. Also the hottest in the summer).

They move the hives with 2 trucks and a few more vehicles. They make camp and they have pretty advanced equipments from what i have heard. Functioning solar heated shower, kitchen, tv, places to charge your phone, a common sleeping area etc. They split the hives in 2 places about a mile apart.

They stay in Şırnak for about 4-5 months and go back to Antalya. They get the hives ready for winter and they are done.

From what i understand i can go back to my hometown (Ankara) when i want. There will be times when there wont be much to do and it will be ok to go back for as much as 2 weeks when even the employees go wherever they want. But there will also be times when i wont be able to leave at all for 1.5 months or just be able to go back home for only a few days.

This is about everything i know for now, i will meet with the beekeeper if he has time to come to Ankara, or i might go to Antalya for a few days and speak with him.

My family is really worried about the part about Şırnak. It is one of the places everyone is usually worried about going. I am also pretty scared but from what i have heard this beekeeper is one that knows a lot, is polite and well mannered, some say he is the one beekeeper that knows the most about beekeeping in Turkey, he has a lot of hives, and he likes to teach and excited about it. I will speak with him about the dangers of staying in Şırnak when i get the chance.

So long story short, if i go through with this i will be working full time with a group of beekeepers for about 7-8 months, i will be learning a lot and come home with a few hives of my own, but spending at least 4 months in one of the most dangerous places in my country.

The guy who introduced me with this beekeeper is his cousin who also works for the Turkish Beekeeping Federation or something like that. I talked with him briefly about this and he said terrorists dont tend to bother beekeepers since they are only doing their own thing, and there have been only very small instances where anything minor ever happened and even that wasnt a big deal. 

Still my family is really afraid. I cant say i am not. But if i go through with it it will be a great experience for me. I will update you guys and if i go, i will share photos and stories.

Thats about it. It looks like i will be going so wish me luck!"

**&gt; a medical student officially enrolled in, or a graduate of, a medical school that is outside the US and Canada,  listed in the International Medical Education Directory (IMED), who meets the eligibility criteria of the ECFMG.**

I assume that this ""easymedschool"" simply does the service of directing you to a IMED listed school who meets the eligibility criteria of ECFMG for the people who wanted to go international and couldn't figure it out.

I can handle going to an international med school without guidance thanks, but ...

You can schedule an appointment to have your computer brought to my house, if you are close by I will gladly come over, or if you are willing to take the risk you can have parts sent to me, which I do not advise however.
I only get payed if the problem is fixed and you are satisfied, if you have questions or concerns please email me at novapchelp@gmail.com, and we can discuss an appointment.

**COMMUNITYSTUCK, YEAR 1, DAY 237; 69 DAYS POST-CONDESCENSION**

Today is the 69^th day post-gigapause. It's like Christmas deliviered the sex joke to me as a present.

Too bad I'm just going to leave it at that off-handed remark. Let's take a minute and think of the terrible jokes that might have been.

*ah.... weren't those nice?*

Anyway, this post will *also* be brief. I'm going to go watch movies with my dad till he either falls asleep or gets bored. He deserves that much on Christmas. It's a John Wayne marathon on AMC, so they're pretty good flicks. 

I gotta mention before I go that I've been steadily pushing these back in the hopes that I might be able to continue writing them when I move to Dallas. 

The move to Dallas is an incredibly uncomfortable topic when related to CommunityStuck and myself because, well, it brings forth the uncertainty of my ability to keep posting them. 

Guys, I'm jumping into this internship maybe a month before the busy season begins. I'm gonna try my damndest to keep writing this (especially if you still want me doing it), but soon, it may be time for me to hand off the torch. 

I considered deleting that sentence, but decided against it; that needed to be said. It's a reality I have to come to face with. It's been the season for facing reality, hasn't it? 

So yes, I'm going to keep trying to do this. It may be another month, or it may be another year, but I'm going to have to stop writing these at some point. It's certainly not because I don't want to. No, I love, love love, *love*, **LOVE**, doing these things. I love you guys. I like reading your comments. I like watching you interact with each other. 

But at some point, y'all are going to be waiting, watching, and eight PM will pass before you know it. You'll see the CS post, and it won't be my name under it.

So, before the time suddenly comes when I'm not posting anymore (because I may not have any warning), I wanted to say thanks. Thanks for the good tmes, thanks for the support, and thanks for being such good friends. 

I'll still be around in the comments, just like you guys. In fact, you could say I'll be one of you, you know? 

[Newcomers! I'm callin' you out! Come post a comment down below. Answer these upcoming questions, and then talk to someone else. Let 'em know you care!](/kv)

QOTD1 (*submitted anonymously*): What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word “usurp”?

The story I wrote to get into RedditStuck's writing team (a duty I am *grossly* neglecting) had a character in it to whom I simply referred to as ""The Usurper"". There was nothing special about him, and really his was a presence meant to drive the plot and explore some darker facets of the story more than anything else.

QOTD2 (*from me*): What did you get for Christmas/Hannukah/Kwanzaa/whatever? What did you have for dinner?

Anyways, the multiplier for three wins is 11.75x instead of 1.75x - so you get great value from just doing three quick matches there, enough to grab the first two milestone rewards. Looks like an intern made a typo. :P
This might also apply for the other events, still waiting to check that."

I am currently living in the city and want to move in order to be closer to my work and hopefully my future grad school. I'm looking in the Redondo Beach/Torrance/San Pedro/Lomita...and surrounding areas. Hoping to move February 1st. Looking for someone who wants to move with me and find a place together or someone who has a place and will be needing a roommate. My price range is around $800 a month, I do have 2 cats but they are very friendly and litter box trained.

A little about me:
I was born and raised in SoCal, just graduated with a BA in psychology and will be pursuing a masters degree in Occupational Therapy. I have a full time nanny job in the Palos Verdes area during the week and will have an internship on Saturday most likely. So I'm fairly busy, but in my free time I love watching netflix, getting out and trying new places to eat, and being outdoors. I'm very respectful and easy to get along with as long as you are respectful as well. I don't have a preference on a roommate being male or female or your age, just that you are working (not a partier) and we get along. 

Message me if you're interested, I look forward to getting to know you! :)"
2qf5ez,10,2014-12-25,I [23 F] am having problems with my paranoid schizophrenic ex bf [26 M] trying to contact me and my family.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qf5ez/i_23_f_am_having_problems_with_my_paranoid/,"TLDR: ex bf with paranoid schizophrenia is showing up at my house and harassing me and my family.

Lets call him Ben. He was very intelligent, funny and a great friend of the family. Ben went to high school and college with my brother. He kind of became a part of our family because his parents weren't really around all that often. We started dating when I was 21 and it only really lasted for about year. I started to notice his paranoia pretty early on in the relationship but didn't think it was that severe. 

--------

Ben has always been on ADHD medication. Since he was a little kid he was heavily medicated. I think he sort of had a kind of Holden Caulfield like pride about being this messed up kid that needed drugs. He is very clever and can easily manipulate doctors into prescribing him the medication he wants. I knew he had an addiction to adderall but I didn't see it as that big of a deal since I knew tons of people who took it.

----

We were in a long distance relationship because I was still in college and he would come visit me for a couple weeks at a time. I first noticed something weird when I caught him stealing some hallucinogenic mushrooms I had been saving for a concert in a few weeks. He apologized and acted so ashamed and said he would leave because ""why would I want him to stay"" after that. I felt guilty and told him I didn't want him to leave.

 A few days later I caught him trying to manipulate me. He told me that a friend of mine had confessed to him about sleeping with me before Ben and I started dating. I freaked out because it had never happened and I couldn't understand why my friend would try to hurt me like that. I told Ben I was going to go to his house and confront him about it then the truth unraveled from him, he had made it all up. Again, he was so sorry and embarrassed and said he would buy his ticket home and never talk to me again. Again, I brushed it off. 

---- 
I know I should have seen all of this as red flags but I had just known him for so long and had never seen this side of him so I convinced myself it was just a fluke.

The worst I noticed was about 6 months in. I came back home for the summer and Ben got me an internship working with him in a museum.

That summer he ended up getting a person he worked with fired because he suspected (and told their boss) she was stealing their air conditioning units. He followed her around one day trying to catch her... I knew he was wrong and that this woman couldn't possibly be doing this but he had told some of our co workers already and they all believed him because, why would he make something like that up? He is funny and smart and dresses nice. 

------

A few months later he had a delusional episode. I received a phone call while at school saying that he knew my brother and I were conspiring against him and was convinced everybody thought he was lying about his job (He told everyone he was working for a music production studio - i didn't find out it wasn't true until six months ago). The way he confronted me was so creepy and calm; repeatedly asking me to explain a million things that were so benign like why I used a certain word and drawing meaning from it because I didn't use the more generic synonym. 

----

I told him to go see a doctor and after a lot of convincing, he did. The diagnosis was bipolar-disorder. Afterwards he was prescribed an insane amount of medication. 

---   

Fast forward to him leaving the country for graduate school. He moved to another hemisphere and I made plans to go visit him. I would talk to him every now and then but it gradually grew fewer. Speaking to him on the phone became very difficult. The medication he was on made him really distant and introverted. I would end up just sitting on facetime with him for hours not talking. I would ask about his day and it was always the same response.  

----

I had plans to go and visit him pretty soon but had stopped communicating with him more than once a week. He got upset and broke up with me the night before I was supposed to come visit him. He said I could still come and I was worried about him so I did (I knew it was a poor manipulation tactic but I didn't care). The second day I was there we both decided I shouldn't stay in his apartment so I packed my bags and was getting ready to leave. I saw that he had left an open note on the table while going to pickup his mail. It was a suicide letter saying he had taken a whole bottle of anti anxiety medication. I confronted him about it when he came back to the apartment and called an ambulance. He laid on the couch while we waited and pled with me to stay/go on this trip we had planned to take later that week. I was so appalled and disgusted. I left him in the hospital bed and didn't see him or speak to him again. 

----
this happened almost two years ago. Since then he has been in and out of different rehab centers for prescription drugs and mental illness, been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and tried (vainly) to commit suicide a few times. 

Over this summer I received a string of threatening emails. I found that he had figured out my password and was logging into my google account and reading all of my docs and emails. I called my parents after getting the emails for fear he would try to go to their house. My mom told me he had come over the day before for lunch and she didn't want to tell me. He stayed there for two hours ranting to my mom about how my brother and I were conspiring against him. He then tried to convince my mom that I was a bad person and told her various inappropriate truths and lies to try and upset her. He even told her about the abortion I had while dating him.

---

After leaving he sent my mom a string of emails he had stolen from his moms email that was supposed to prove she was having an affair and stealing money from his father. My mom called his parents and said they did not respond well. I seriously doubt my mom handled the situation all that great to begin with. This has happened a few more times while I've been away. The last time my mom called the police and his parents said we wouldn't be hearing from him again. 

----

It had been quiet for months until Thanksgiving. I was home for the holiday and hanging out with my dad around 9 pm one night when the doorbell rang. I went to answer it and there was Ben. I called my dad and he said I could open it. Keep in mind, this was the first time I had seen him in nearly two years. All he said was;

Ben: ""Hi, wynona-lowryder. Can I ask you a question?""

Me: ""No.""

Ben: ""Okay, Mr. Lowryder, can I ask you a question?""

Dad:""Ok""

Ben:""Is today Thanksgiving?""

Dad &amp; Me: ""No""

Ben: ""Okay, am I an illegitimate child?""

Dad &amp; Me: ""No""

Ben: ""Okay, have a good night.""

he then turned around and walked toward his car, stopped and turned back;

Ben: ""I promise just one more question then I will leave you alone.""

Dad: ""Sure""

He then proceeded to ask my Dad if he knew three different Dr's. (my dad is a Dr.)

My dad said ""No"" to each of them then Ben thanked him and left. 

----

I had to sleep in my parents room that night. 

--- 

I have since gotten several phone calls from him and texts asking to meet me for coffee. 

I recently answered a number I didn't recognize thinking it was my dr with biopsy results but it was him. I talked to him for a few minutes while he picked through everything I said. I asked him if he was still seeing a psychiatrist and he said he had just gone that day but caught her in a lie so he can't trust her anymore. The phone call ended badly and I realized how futile and damaging to him it was to even try to reason with him. 

Since then I haven't responded and have stopped answering unknown calls. I am terrified of him showing up to my parents house and am honestly not 100% certain he isn't capable of violence. I know we don't have enough evidence of anything to get a restraining order but It is starting to freak us all out. He showed up at my dads office last week as a patient. We are afraid of answering the doorbell. I am at a loss for what to do. 

I have a new boyfriend now that is coming in town for New Years. We are both afraid of Ben. 

Do I just keep on ignoring him? I have never known anyone else with this kind of illness and am not sure how best to go about handling his obsession with my family. My mom has tried to be helpful but she doesn't know what to do either. 

I need some support. Thanks for taking your time to read this everyone.

The bottom section has an idea for the MILF or Mistress roleplay

I have a few raw ideas for incest/impregnation: 

* the desire to start a new family
* add to the existing
* wanting to feel a guy cumming without a condom, maybe your boyfriend is too afraid
* wanting more kids despite your husband not wanting more
* ready for a child, if you have a boyfriend, then he's not ready
* infertile husband/boyfriend
* wanting to be bred by an alpha
* wanting a child with someone who has always loved you
* wanting to play a game of risk, dare you to fuck me, dare you to cum inside, dare you to do it again...etc
* lie about being on birth control
* say its the ""safe time"" of the month
* tell me to pull out, but ride me, putting you in control
* start off with wanting me to pull out, then losing it, and wanting me to cum inside
* hate my girlfriend or wife, give me a baby that I want
* cuckold/cuckqueen my girlfriend or wife
* threesomes with a sister, friend, niece, cousin, mom, daughter, etc
* I'm sure I can come up with more ideas. 


Below I wrote two vague ideas for a MILF or Mistress RP. I wanted to keep the creative bubble open and unrestricted because I'm hoping you can add some of your own lustful details and sexy twists to our RP. 

***


* **One:** Your older than me, maybe a young woman or a milf. I'm the strapping young man that you could teach to be a good lover. Fulfill those needs your not getting at home by your self, or from that husband or boyfriend you've had for so long. Character's I might be: son, friend's son, neighbor boy, student to a tutor/teacher, bag boy at the grocery, nephew, younger cousin, pool boy, highschool/college athlete, your child's tutor or babysitter, a friend of your son or duaghter, daughter's boyfriend, intern, employee, personal trainer, etc. Some of the kinks that could be involved include vanilla, romantic, reluctant, creampies, anal, impregnaiton,ageplay, incest, anal, bondage, cheating, cuckold, threesomes, and more

.



* **Two:** This one is on the more kinky side. You could be a mistress or a lover, but in either case I'll be on the receiving end of a cock. It could be plastic or real. Yours or someone else's. Open to a vanilla mutual fucking to the other end of the spectrum, where I'm a submissive. This could include all sorts of kinks: bdsm, facesitting, bi sex, futa, tgirl, strap-on, watersports, ageplay, incest, anal, rape, noncon, con, impregnation, drugs, blackmail, and more.

.

Let me know what kinks you have as well. Looking forward to the PM.

2qfmcz,2,2014-12-26,Me [19M] with my mom[48F]; trying to decide whether I'm the bad guy in the relationship and if it's worth trying to repair.,wisconsinthrowaway17,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qfmcz/me_19m_with_my_mom48f_trying_to_decide_whether_im/,"Bit of background: I'm a 19 year old male living in Wisconsin. I live on my own, and I'm taking a year off before college to decompress.

My mother and I have had a complicated relationship for a long time. In my childhood she was always there, my biggest ally and supporter. She taught me to read, to do math, to cook, and to try new things. I wouldn't be me without her. I loved her more than anything. About a decade ago my mother developed a major drinking problem that got progressively worse. 

Before she had the problem, she rarely laid a finger on my sister (a year older than myself, currently 20) or myself. About two or three years into the illness (about when I was 12) she became increasingly abusive when she drank. It got terrible when I turned 14. I don't want to go into details as it's really something I don't want to recall if I don't have to do it. Usually when stuff like this happened, she got wasted, then went on a rampage: this often included abuse to my father, sister, and/or me, as well as serious destruction of property as well as it culminating in her driving drunk to the store three miles away to get more alcohol when she ran out. It was so bad that in November of 2011, my mother finally got caught on one of her rampages, and was charged with a Class B misdemeanor for Domestic Abuse. It was thrown out because my father agreed to drop charges and she agreed to get help. She did, but fell off the wagon just before Christmas. This was a recurring thing with her: agree to change, get help, then fall off the wagon. It was an emotional roller coaster ride that took a toll on me as well as on my sister and father.

Things got so bad that in 2013, I applied for literally EVERY summer program out of state that I could in an attempt to get away from her, and I was *somehow* (God knows why) accepted into an internship program at a Department of Defense/Department of Navy lab in San Diego, California for the summer before my senior year (2013). (I was also trying to pad my resume for college applications that fall as well, but ironically it backfired. You'll see why in a minute.)

Anyway, this internship was paid, so it'd help out with the costs, but I'd be breaking even at best doing it in San Diego. I had this brilliant idea to rent a studio apartment near Point Loma (the area where the lab is) and have a great, mom-free summer learning about engineering and doing cool shit. Unfortunately, the internship's policies required that I have a chaperone over 18 years of age with me in the apartment in case of a medical emergency. My sister was 18 at the time, so I believed that would work out fine. She would have graduated, she would get the opportunity to move out of our parents' house and be free of their bullshit for a full three months, and she'd have a great time. She decided to move out anyway before she graduated and wanted to stay in our town with her abusive boyfriend instead of go to SD with me. I then settled on getting a roommate, but my father refused. 

My mother, you see, had been laying around the house for nine months since she got fired from her work. (Partially her fault, partially her boss.) My dad was tired of her and wanted to get her out of the house, so he forced me to accept her as my chaperone or not go at all. I decided that I wanted to pad my resume, so I figured, ""Hey, it's only three months, how bad could it be?"" It was unbelievably bad. After the first week we didn't go a night without fighting, and it quickly escalated into fisticuffs. Every night she berated me for something or other (whether it be calling me gayboy/faggot/tranny- and that's another thing altogether or saying stupid petty shit like that), and many times she attempted to hit or attack me. She was drunk almost every night and it made San Diego hell. I got depressed from it all and the internship didn't go well as a result (my fault though, not hers)

Of course, being 6'4"", 280 lbs, and almost 18 at the time and tired of her shit/weary from work, I'm not about to stand around and take physical abuse. For example, there was the time she cornered me and tried to knee me in the balls. Or when she hit me in the back of the head with a bag of frozen shrimp by swinging it like one of those soap-filled-socks from a mafia movie. Or the time she smacked me upside the head or jumped on top of me or tried to swing at me. I defended myself. I regret hitting her, as I was taught not to hit girls, but I couldn't stop myself. I did more damage to her than she did to me and I can't deny that. That said, I just cracked when she assaulted me and I jumped in to defend myself. 

It all led up to the Tuesday after Comic Con. I came home from work, and she was showing signs of being drunk. The apartment was trashed and she had damaged the landlord's property as well as our own. She was yammering on about some shit about how my dad was a fuck and holding a pair of scissors she had threatened me with two days before for no reason. Something snapped inside me. I should have left. I should have ran. But I jumped at my mom and I assaulted her. She tried to stab me in the eyes twice with the pair of scissors but I blocked it with my arm by covering my face. Either way, it drew blood, and when our neighbors told me that they called the cops, I didn't try to stop them. The cops showed up, took her away, and charged her with assault with a deadly weapon and child abuse, both felonies. When it came time to testify in court, I overheard my mother's lawyer say that he wanted to press charges against me (my mother claims otherwise, but that's bullshit) so I changed one part of the story when I was on the stand to where I was trying to disarm her and take away the scissors and she attacked me with them, then I punched her in self defense. She was convicted of ADW, but the child abuse charge was dropped per her plea and she got probation as long as she got help for her problem, then promptly fell off the wagon. 

She blames me for becoming a felon and ""ruining her future"". We don't really have much of a relationship anymore. She told every one of my extended family members that it was all my fault, and I don't have a family anymore as a result. She broke into my email recently to see what I was writing about her, then lied to me saying it was an accident, but admitted it to my grandmother that it was on purpose. We don't spend holidays together anymore either, but she still sends me gifts and food (probably mostly Dad, though, and I still talk to him a few times a week). In a nutshell, we don't really have a relationship anymore but I miss it.

Be honest with me, reddit, no sugarcoating: am I the bad guy here? Is there something wrong with me? Is it really my fault? And should I try to repair what my mom and I have? I really don't know where to go from here.

TL;DR; I don't know how to proceed with my relationship with my mom after huge falling out. I don't know if I'm the bad guy or not and if I should even try to salvage what's left. I admit that I've made serious mistakes but I don't think it's even close to what she's done to me."
2qfwcw,12,2014-12-26,I'm 21 and I am living the same life as I did when I was 16 with no prospect of it getting better.,[deleted],sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/2qfwcw/im_21_and_i_am_living_the_same_life_as_i_did_when/,"Long story incoming. I guess I just really want to vent.

I spent my entire teenage years moping around feeling sorry for myself, bitching about my parents, alienating all my friends and doing nothing with my life. I worked for a year before getting fired, and never got a job after that except for a couple of weeks right after graduating. Somehow, I got decent grades (I was a smart kid), I got into the university and the program I dreamed of. I moved to a different town, escaped my parents, gotten over the fact that I had crashed my car by being a fucking idiot, left my old life and my crappy friends, and I was really happy and felt like my life was about to start.

Within about six months, I fell into the exact same habits as before, but worse because its university and you really can't afford to do that shit. My biggest problem is my laziness. No matter how much I want to, I just can't bring myself to do anything other than sit on my dick playing video games or just fucking around. I was living in filth because I was too lazy to clean, my grades were shit, my friends all thought I was a fucking gross weirdo and didn't give a shit about me, and I once again accomplished nothing. After a year, my university chucked me out of my program, and I gave up and transferred my degree.

On the advice of my parents, who were honestly glad to see the back of me when I left - I was a pretty awful son, I'll be frank, and I'm really greatful they haven't kicked me to the curb at this point - I moved back to my hometown and started a Computer Science degree here. That was two years ago, and I'm still doing it. I'm miserable as hell, and I'm living the same life as I did when I was 16 and just as miserable. I can't do much because my parents are strict as fuck, my friends are all doing stuff without me because I can't and frequently don't even bother going, they honestly don't even like me that much and think I'm an asshole anyway because the only way I can relate to people is sarcastic assholery and when you're 20 that just makes you a shit and not funny, and to make matters worse my grades are just as shit as before I moved back.

I'd move out, but I have no job and no money. I'd get a job, but I have the experience of a 16 year old and they could hire a 16 year old for half the price and I can't get any jobs that actual 21 year olds have. Its gotten to a stage where I'm just too miserable to even go and look for one, which is a fucking awful way to be. I'm stuck in a loop where I have no work experience and can't get any, and I'm too miserable and lazy to even bother looking for one and I don't know how to stop, or how to start looking for jobs even if I wanted too.

To make matters worse, my grades are awful. They're not ""kicking you out of uni awful"" like my previous ones were, but they're rubbish - my mark average is like 53%. I'm doing a degree in Computer Science, and if I don't end up getting internships pretty much now I don't think I'll be able to get a job at all. My grades are way too poor for anybody to even consider giving me an internship, and I have no clue if they'll improve and if that will even help, given I have to start looking for internships now.

The reason why I'm writing this is because I had pretty much staked my summer on doing a summer project with the uni. I had talked to some dudes outside of uni about an internship, they said they weren't doing one but offered me a project, they waffled for ages, in the end they said I could do it. I want to do this for course credit so I'm not wasting my summer, so I need a supervisor, and I've busted my ass to find someone who, in the end, is probably going to do it if I enroll halfway through the summer (which I can do). Tonight I got an email from the course convener essentially saying, after months of talking to him, my grades are too bad to do it and I need an average about 60.

I've staked my entire summer on this. I've justified not applying for jobs or internships over this project. I'm really interested in it, and I really really wanted to do it. I'd hoped that having done something, anything, would have helped with internships in future so I could get a job and actually do something with my life that isn't sitting on my ass playing video games and feeling sorry for myself all summer. More to the point, I would have had something I could point to to say I've actually accomplished something with my life. But now, as it turns out, I've already burned that bridge. Its too late to apply for internships, and its almost certainly too late to apply for a summer job - its almost january, christmas has been and gone. Who needs me? Every summer casual vacancy has been filled by now.

In short, I've spent my life being a lazy, miserable, waste of space and I've accomplished nothing. Its reaching a stage where my total absence of doing anything with my life is impeding from doing something with my life. I'm living the same life as I was when I was 16.

All my friends have actual accomplishments. Everybody I know is getting jobs (even part time ones, which I can't get and honestly haven't tried, which is even worse) or has high-flying internships or has even graduated, whereas my greatest achievement is a skyrim character, and it just makes me so miserable. I'm dreading telling my parents I can't do the project, and honestly, I don't even know what I'm going to do with it other than half learn a skill that i will never use because i'm unemployable and too miserable to learn it properly.

The worst part of it is that its all my fault. There's really no excuse for it - i'm just lazy and an abrasive asshole. I spent 18 years blaming other people for everything only to find out that it really is all my fault, and now I feel like I'm stuck in a rut I can't get out of. I don't even know if I'll graduate.

I guess I just really want to vent. I don't really have any friends to talk about this with - the closest thing I have to a friend is a racist dickbag of a manchild who only hangs out with me because i tolerated him being racist towards me and now its impossible to get rid of him or get him to stop (which is honestly all the friends I've ever had, thinking about it). I've never had a relationship - the closest thing I ever had was three dates with a girl before I blew it by being a neurotic mess when I was away doing my first degree - and I'd be miserable about that if I didn't have much better things to be unhappy about. I feel like all my other friends honestly just think I'm a prick and don't really like or have any respect for me.

I don't know, I just want to vent. I'm turning 21 in a month, I have no accomplishments to point to, I'm unemployed and living with my parents is making me miserable, but I can't get a job and move out and its all my fault. I don't even know where to go from here. I don't want to wash out of my second degree, and even if I do graduate, what am I going to do? I guess it could be a lot worse (a lot a lot worse), but I've basically fucked up my life and I don't know what to do with it now. I just dont' want to be an unemployed manchild living with his parents until they die and then I starve to death.

If anybody has kept up with this stream of conciousness, thanks for reading it I guess. I appreciate it.

Tomorrow I'm going to force myself to go down to macdonalds and apply for a shitty mcdonalds' barrista position they're apparently advertising (or were four days ago), which honestly I'll be lucky to get.

TL;DR I'm a moron who's spent his entire life blaming other people for his mistakes and now I've reached a stage where I've done nothing and feel like i can't do anything to get out of it. I feel like I've ruined my life, and I'm 21 to make things worse."
2qg6de,1,2014-12-26,My Cursed Work History,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2qg6de/my_cursed_work_history/,"I have had the worst luck with jobs I could have ever imagined for myself. I don't know why. You'd think it would just be my fault because it's a pattern with me, and I would think so too, but I really think it's just shitty, shitty luck. Let me explain.


My first job out of undergrad was at a maternity store. I was going to grad school full time for my master's degree in organizational psychology, and the flexible hours suited my schedule perfectly. However, my boss was insane. She would gossip relentlessly about associates to other associates and lose her temper several times a day. In the nine months I was there, I saw three employees get hired AND leave (and it was a very small store, so three employees is a ton). Two quit without notice, and one of the two actually came into the store and started telling off my boss for being crazy. So I know it wasn't just I who saw a major problem.


I eventually got a 3.5-month paid internship as the manager of volunteers for a major event in Detroit. (The internship was required as part of my M.A. program.) I had just turned 23 and it was my very first office job. The job was demanding; it was essentially a cradle-to-grave quarter-year project that involved recruiting 700+ volunteers, managing all communications with them, identifying and addressing needs, creating all training materials, facilitating several workshops for 1,400 volunteers, and working with community organizations to get the word out about the event. It was the most enormous task I've ever taken on in my life. But I was so incredibly psyched about the job, and the possibility of being offered a position at the main organization backing the event, that I completely threw my heart and soul into the job. I literally did everything in my power to do an amazing job. But there was one gigantic problem: my boss. My godforsaken, evil boss, who is the worst person I have ever met in my life. Nothing was good enough. I would go to her cubicle to ask her a question, and as soon as I opened my mouth, she got a look on her face like she smelled dog shit. Personal insults, professional insults, the cruelest remarks she could think of. I know it wasn't me, because the coordinator who had been in my position the previous year had apparently had the same extremely twisted relationship with her. She referred to him as an ""idiot."" Everyone in the office, including her boss--the general manager--was scared of her. The GM even talked to me discreetly about how I was actually doing a great job, and to not let the woman's cruelty get to me. The secretary told me she wished my boss would go blind. Another manager said she was horrible. The GM even had to go so far as to talk to my boss about the way she was acting (it worked for about three days). Things were so bad that on the weekend of the actual event, I wouldn't even talk to her after she screamed at me. She destroyed any confidence I had, and makes me doubt myself to this day.


After that fucking horrible experience, I went on to work for the headquarters of a large staffing agency (I was an internal contractor). I rose to a team lead-type position in my department and was unofficially acknowledged as such by my managers (read: not on paper), but I was still getting paid at the same rate as the people I was managing. They would not give me a raise, so I asked to be transferred to another department (where I wouldn't have team lead responsibilities, but would get paid the same). Well, surprise to me: a couple of months into working in the new department, my new boss announced that ""You have to be in the same department for a year before you're eligible to become a permanent employee."" So, this was the opposite of what I had been told in my interview, and had heard throughout my time there. I was told that if you stayed in the overarching department for a year, you could go perm. Basically, she was saying that in HER department, you had to stay at least a year. Whenever someone had an interview for another department, she would speak to that manager and CANCEL their interview.


So I found another job that paid more and was more aligned with my field. This time, I was a contract-to-hire HR coordinator at a small automotive supplier. The girl who was in the position before me had actually walked off the job. There was a production facility attached to the main office, and there were a lot of low-income and/or minority people working there. The company was entering this program where they would get $500 a month for each low-income person that had been working there since the beginning of the year. Well, guess what: the president (who worked on site) gave orders that I FUDGE EMPLOYEES' START DATES so we could get more money. Like, $250,000 more per year. I told my boss that I did not want to be involved due to the legal and ethical issues involved with this fraudulent behavior, and reported the incident to the temp agency I was working through. Well, this pissed off the president big time, and I was on his shit list from that point on. The time was nearing that I would either be hired on or let go, and it didn't look good.  (I should also note that within a month of all this happening, the HR manager AND quality assurance manager both quit due to their disgust with how the company ran itself.  I don't know about the HR manager because she was at a different site, but the QA manager--a 60-something-year-old lady--endured a great deal of emotional abuse from the president and many other employees there.  It was so messed up.)


So the temp agency that I was working through took me on internally as a contract-to-hire recruiter. All seemed to be going well until this one girl, the senior recruiter, started giving me shit. She treated me like I was an insect. As I would later find out, a lot of people had had problems with her that they reported to management, but she was in good with management, so they didn't do anything. She talked so much crap about me to our manager, saying that I questioned policies too much, etc., that when the branch lost its biggest account, I was one of the two people they let go.


Fast forward to me working as an on-site recruiter for a staffing agency. The girl who had previously held my position had walked off the job a month and a half in. A lot of crazy stuff went down (can't say too much because I still work there), but it took a major toll on me. Anyway, in addition to me, they hired another recruiter. She and I got along SO well and became instant friends. However, she had extreme mood swings, was frequently difficult to talk to, and would lose her temper. Two days ago, she decided she had had enough, told me she was quitting (I asked if she was putting in her two weeks' notice and she said no), packed up her desk, and left. Before she left, I told her I was going to text our boss (who was on vacation) and tell him she quit. She said she didn't care and walked out. I was panicked because my workload was now doubled, and we were under a ton of pressure to begin with. So I texted my boss to let him know she quit. Anyway, a half hour later, she comes STORMING back into our office and starts fucking screaming her lungs out right in my face about how I shouldn't have told our boss she quit, how I didn't get to meddle in her life, etc. Screaming in my face, blocking me into a corner at my desk. I was terrified she was going to hit me. Someone came into the office to get her, and as she left she screamed, ""I have to leave this office, or I might CHOKE that girl!"" Anyway, the HR lady at the call center tried to mediate and calm us down (she was still screaming at me, I was sobbing uncontrollably, it was a fucking mess). The other girl denied that she ever said she didn't care if I texted our boss to tell him she quit, as well as that she ever said she might choke me. (The other witness was nowhere to be found.) Anyway, the girl eventually left, the HR lady was very empathetic to me and gently walked me back to my office. The VP of the company (who we talked with a lot) called me and apologized profusely for the situation. He said they would find another position for me other than that of a recruiter, because they saw a lot of potential in me. I'm thankful, but scared because now I have no idea what my job title or duties will be, and I'm getting married in a few months, so I really have to have my shit together.


Anyway, my point is: my whole professional history has been a complete mess, and I'm so tired and burnt out and jaded that I just want to stay home and sleep."
2qgbl3,4,2014-12-26,Request: Deaths in recent months and years. Can't stomach food. What should I do?,EDPostRequests,EatingDisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/2qgbl3/request_deaths_in_recent_months_and_years_cant/,"I need help... I've never really talked about this but recently I realized how bad It's getting.. I have always struggled with weight, in 2010 I was overweight due to stress at college and ended up dropping out.. Fast forward a few years, I always told myself that I would never allow myself to get to that weight so I always watched myself and if I noticed weight gain I would watch how much I ate and often underate. I know It's not healthy but my body was managing it and I felt good so I didn't worry. I'm smart and in tune with myself so I figured I wouldn't let myself get sick. 

Anyway, over the summer I took about internship that was incredibly intense. I was working 10.5 hours days almost everyday so my lunch and breaks were limited (I didn't notice the weight loss until recently) when the internship was over I went home for a few weeks before college resumed and everyone I saw commented on how thin I was looking (not in a bad way, just different) I was Happy so I kept doing what I was doing, only really eating when I felt hungry ..which started to become less and less... 

When i was home i saw that things had gotten bad with my parents, and i was unfortunate enough to see my big brother in a heroin comatose. It haunted me.   I went back to college (5000 miles from my family) and then my friend died in September I hit insanity and didn't know what to do. Then a month a bit later I received a phone call from by parents with the horrific news my brother had died...I was broken. 

By this time I had lost a crazy amount of weight and food became disgusting to me. Every time I tried to eat something I felt sick, nothing could go down. The only time i stomached food was when I was smoking weed. Fast forward to yesterday, (Chrismas Eve) I was puking all day due to a bug and have lost even more weight. My parents have noticed and are consistently asking me if I've eating yet and things like that..I lie because I don't want them to worry. They just lost their son in the worst of ways and don't need to be worrying about their daughter but now they are worried.

I really need advice on what to do... I really few that no one is going to take me seriously and tell me I'm just being stupid but I just can't stomach eating and I am fading.

What should I do? 

Could there be a medical reason I'm not able to stomach eating?

Would therapy help me with the recent deaths I've experienced?

Should I be concerned I'm lying?

Why is it I don't want to fade?

Why is it I want someone to notice and help me? What does help from family and friends look like? 

Also side note: I'm the strong one, I've lost nine loved ones in the past few years, I live far from my parents, I'm very intune with my surroundings and help my friends with life everyday.

2qgkqt,3,2014-12-26,Entry-Level Job Help,doctorwo,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2qgkqt/entrylevel_job_help/,"HI all, I am a senior graduating in May with a double major in actuarial mathematics and philosophy. I have never completed an internship, but have passed Exam P and will be taking Exam FM in the fall. I am doing everything I can to learn about the programs relevant to the field, via online tutorials and have been applying to entry level positions daily. I am writing because I am very worried my lack of experience will hinder me to the point of being unemployable and am looking for any advice you may have. Should I keep applying for entry level actuarial positions? Is their a similar field I am qualified for that I should work in until I have passed more exams? What is the best way to find and apply for open positions?

Thank you for your responses and I have attached an example cover letter and my resume below.

2qgxdx,35,2014-12-26,Rereading Avengers #4: A Tale of Two Hyperions,GamiSB,comicbooks,https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/2qgxdx/rereading_avengers_4_a_tale_of_two_hyperions/,"With the prologue work done I figured this would be a good place to establish a few things about the run and my approach to reading it. When these series first began I was under the impression that New Avengers was a mystery and Avengers a side piece. Uncovering the identity of Rabum Alal, what was causing the incursions, and how to stop them looked like the main problems the books were going to slowly reveal. They are not. Reading New Avengers as a mystery, or any of Hickman’s work for that matter, is going in with the wrong idea. If these books are mysteries they are the worst ones written because they offer no clues, progression, or red herrings at all for the reader. 

For example, if you take some time to play with ideas about who Rabum Alal is you will notice most ideas (even my own) cannot cite evidence from either book. They either pull from past works or use subtext to support the conclusion. While this can at times be interesting it is guesswork at the best reliant on reaching for straws that don’t really exist. We don’t know and we can’t figure out who Rabum Alal is because the book isn’t going to tell us who he is or give us any clues. 

A similar problem is evident with the incursions. As we reread the series together you are going to notice that information about the incursions is strictly limited to the first three issues of New Avengers. We have not learned anything else about the problem until just recently in Time Runs Out. Information about new players did crop up periodically but nothing about how to solve the issue or that address Tony’s three main questions from issue 2. And often we, the reader, are going to be left in the dark about what the Illuminati are thinking. What little information we currently have still revealed nothing about their approach. The only detailed ideas at combating the incursion problem we have been told to date are from Sunspot and Captain America. Nothing from Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Beast, Dr. Strange, or anyone else.

So if you are reading New Avengers and Avengers as a mystery, you are simply doing it wrong. What are they then? Character studies.

“[Previously in Avengers](http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/2q0496/rereading_avengers_2_and_3_birth_of_an_idea/)”

Avengers issue 4 opens with a recap of the first arc. Ex Nhilio fires off several bombs to recreate the Earth and ready it for its new future. The earth is saved because of the intervening of Captain Universe, the mother of the universe and all creation. We are left with a question over “why” she would choose earth to make her home to which Captain America presumes because it’s an Avengers World. The newest issues of New Avengers (28 I believe) takes a stab and what it means to be an Avengers. Even after reading I can’t share Caps sentiments for reasons we’ll see in Infinity.

The first scene in the issue is an evaluation over the damage done by Ex Nhilio. The bomb site locations are now on lockdown to contain their spread. Investigations are starting. “[The Hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_%28comics%29)” apparently are among the first to break into the Kobe site, their status unknown. Omega Flight is being sent into the Canadian site. The Perth location is shut down to only Australians after a covert SHIELD project was uncovered.

Project Perseus gets named dropped but goes completely unexplained. I assume it has something to do with turning humans into gods, but this is where my ignorance to Marvel history starts to shine through.

Five sites, two controlled by SHIELD, one being searched by the Hand, one by Omega Flight, and another by the Australian government. But wait, there might be more.

A sixth location is determined to exist after Hyperion shows off a bit by staring at a monitor and correcting issues created through using binary systems. Hickman has a tendency to just shit on binary systems. Manhattan Projects has another example of this. I guess this plays a bit into the New Avengers problem as Cap’s “binary” outlook is what creates problems with the Illuminati. So basically we are gonna need to look for a “Third Force” here in solving these problems. Anyway, new bomb site is found in the Savage Land.

The issue skips between two plots, the sixth bomb site and Hyperion’s history.

Hyperion is a Superman analogue. His origin reflects this perfectly, escaping from a dying world to be found by an elderly figure who adopts him and teaches him morality, ethics, and how to use his gifts to help others over himself. What this typically means is whenever you see “Hyperion” you can fit in “Superman” and figure out how Hickman is using the character. But there are still some distinctions (the direct Superman replacement comes much later). Where Superman protects society he rarely makes the jump over into directing how it should behave. Superman is always an example of how to act, never forcing his ideas.

Hyperion is raised a bit differently. His task is to guide humanity and bring about change. Not to watch as humanity progress and act as protector, but to be involved in that progression as well as protecting it. Hyperion could be argued to be a more proactive Superman. Where Superman reacts to problems Hyperion sets out to change the circumstances that create those problems. The underlining principle for Hyperion is his understanding of community and the role of the individual. His father teaches him that a community is dependent on each individual that makes it up. Like the body is made up of several working organs a community made up of different individuals. We can change the minds of individuals but, what is more, practical is to change the minds of entire groups. Rather than solve the issue of one organ, fine tune the entire body.

So to remake a world Hyperion is going to need to appeal to society as a whole. So he becomes a hero, gains their trust and promotes three core values. 

Truth without compromise.
Thought without error.
All things for the betterment of the whole.

With these platitu- I mean values Hyperion is able to remake his world. Creates utopia, everything is great, perfect, and wonderful. Except Hyperion isn’t exactly a true believer in what his father taught him. The issue states over and over that there are two Hyperions. One that everyone knows, sees, and has made up stories for.[ And the other he keeps deep down made up of his true thoughts and anxieties.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMe1qlyuMXQ) Now the issue never tells us exactly who the other Hyperion is but we get a few clues.

Hyperion, like Superman, can see things we can’t. The atomic make up of ourselves. He can witness the creation of new life as couples unite. He sees the chemical process that creates the emotion of love. The miracles and mysteries of our life he can see as regular functions of natural process. Hyperion is struggling with understanding the human element of what at a fundamental basic level is just a meat sack made up of chemicals that cause reactions and our very being. The second Hyperion is Dr. Manhattan. And like Dr. Manhattan he is having trouble finding the meaning in life, death, and the human conscious.

Back to the sixth site. When did the Spider-woman/Ms. Marvel friendship end? Instead Black Widow and Jessica start getting a bit chummy and that’s going to carry on for a while. You know looking back it’s funny how this six man team is split. SW and BW who go off on their own. Thor and Hyperion who get sent off into the space between spaces. And Hawkeye with Captain Marvel who join up with Rogers. Don’t know if it’s relevant but its kinda interesting. We also get a scene with some homosexual overtones between Hyperion and Thor. I blame Kuberts' art for it mostly. Thor looks way too pretty and is giving Sun-bro “that look”.

So the avengers aren’t alone on the island, AIM is also there investigating the bomb sites. They plug an intern with a sample from one of the cocoons and he dies. Avengers show up and we get another flashback of Hyperion’s past.

So Hyperion succeeded in his “perfect” world. But one day the sky turned red and another Earth appeared above them. The heroes tried to push it back but everyone by Hyperion died off (why is never explained and the panels don’t show any attackers). Hyperion, alone, places himself between each Earth and tries to hold them apart but fails and the destruction of two universes maroons him “the nothingness”. Until AIM found him and pulled him from it into Earth 616. Just another example of the best of the best not being enough to stop a problem. Superman can’t hold back to universes and his perfect world failed to protect itself. Hickman is again stressing “this is kinda a big deal”.

So AIM is in the Savage Land researching, apparently has diplomatic immunity because AIM Island is now a nation-state, but because Thor is a “god” that doesn’t mean dick. Unless Roxxon is suing you then suddenly you have to show up in court. Avengers fend off an attack by the dead intern, capture the AIM scientist and confirm the sixth bomb site.

After extraction Hyperion was locked away by AIM until he was rescued and called to be a hero by Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man. Cap asks him to join, and again who can say no to Captain America? Not even Superman. We have a slight more allusion to Cap being akin to the voice of God. Where in Avengers 1 he spoke the words and brought to life Avengers World, and in his history he gives the call “assemble” and everyone does so, and here he is calling out to Hyperion who takes him up on the offer. No wonder he becomes such a dick later on, full on God-complex I tell ya.

We learn a bit more about Hyperion’s inner conflict. He finds fault with his fathers teachings as was hinted at before via some of the panel art and here is laid out bluntly. What exactly he finds wrong with these? Likely that they do not provided meaning for existence. For what purpose do we tell the truth? Why can’t we be wrong? What is the betterment of society for? Where is the humanity in these ideas? Again Hyperion is struggling with the systematic formulation of life. The scientific approach that demands logic and reason over emotion and feeling. Hyperion sees the parts that make us all machines, he wants to see where the humanity then is. So he starts out again. This time to develop a society that embraces life and finds meaning from death. This time he’s the father raising sons.

Issue closes with the revelation of a seventh bomb site. One in Norway that SHIELD is unaware of. This will eventually be the site where Pod was created. That surrounding area has also changed. Where in Avengers 2 it was a barren white tundra now it’s in the middle of a snow covered forest. Think this is more just an “oops” in Avengers 2 than a suggestion of a forest growing over night. Pretty sure the flashbacks in the TMO issue showed some trees.
 
The issue follows the trend of the first three in being about “life”. Hyperion’s backstory is the clear focus and where the bulk of this issue’s purpose lays. We have a hero, who is a replica of Superman, looking for the “Life” in life. His power allows him to see everything far to close. All the cogs that move and formulate “Us”. And in this he can’t see purpose, he can’t see what makes anyone special, and it bothers him. He wants to find “Life” in humanity. He wants to see what it is he is transforming the world for. And it’s a question that plagues a lot of people. 

New Avengers has a similar problem. The vast scope of the incursion problem clouds the value of life. The Illuminati are talking about saving universes, they have to look at the big picture and can’t see the smaller concerns of everyday people. Whereas Hyperion sees the finest of details of the smaller problem and does not see the value in even addressing the big picture. "
2qgy2t,113,2014-12-26,I wasn't the one holding people down. It was me being held down.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2qgy2t/i_wasnt_the_one_holding_people_down_it_was_me/,"I was sitting here today, thinking about something that happened three years ago. I thought I should share. 

I had an incredibly abusive ex and he had an equally abusive mother. My ex was away at college, I went to college nearby, and his mom demanded I would visit her and talk with her. The first time, she got drunk and would yell and scream at me, then start laughing, wash, rinse, repeat. She blamed me for putting a ""curse"" upon her house.  The second time I was rather reluctant but only did it to make my ex happy. She said I was holding down her son, that I should drop out of college, and that I was nothing but a liar (my ex sexually abused me after I screamed and kicked ""no"" several times, went to the police, he was thrown in jail, etc.). My ex wasn't really too keen on me going to college. I wanted to go into a STEM field, and he was in Psychology. He told me I was horrible at math, physics, and programming, that I should go for a liberal arts degree or stay at ""home"" and take care of him. 

And I believed it. I thought I could never succeed. I bounced between majors, because he would put up a protest about it. I was severely depressed because I felt useless. Until right before I broke up with him, I suddenly had an epiphany; he was afraid of me. He was afraid that I was going to make more money than him with the least amount of education. After the messiest of all messy break-ups (his mom committed suicide and tried to use that to keep me), I started supplementing my Geography degree with Computer Science courses. And all the stuff he said about me being horrible at math, physics, and programming? Well shit, those were the classes I did great on.

I graduated this year, got an internship as a Graphic Designer, now I am going to Microsoft next week as a Geospatial Operator, working on Bing Maps. I have a bright future for me and I did it because I stopped listening to the people holding me back.

2qhd78,0,2014-12-26,My best friend has a boyfriend that is 15 years older… I don't know how to feel about that!,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2qhd78/my_best_friend_has_a_boyfriend_that_is_15_years/,"I have no idea how to start this post so sorry if it's a bit confusing. It's a long post, but I really need to get this off of my chest!

Okay… Well, my best friend, Jess, has never been an out going type. We were always the stay home-girls and watch anime together, stuff our faces with popcorn and candy, talk about whatever nonsense we could make up, that's why she was my best friend. I could be really me around her, I could tell her everything! I've known her for three years and we've never even had a small argument, but something changed over the summer.

Last summer, while I was spending my holiday in Kenya, she started going out with one of her childhood friends. I have no problem with people going out and partying or doing whatever, but she didn't even tell me when we skyped. I found out that she was going out with her (slutty) childhood friend when college started again! I asked her why she didn't tell me, because I was surprised. Her excuse was: ""I forgot."" 

Like I believe that bullshit!

She started talking to one of our other friends about this guy called Mark (her now boyfriend). I asked who he was and she said he was a guy she met while going out. You guys don't know Jess, but she had NEVER had a boyfriend before Mark, so I was actually excited for her until I asked her how old he was. She was 18 and he was 33! I did not know what I was hearing. I was stunned! 15 years older is a lot. I can handle age difference, but as her FIRST BOYFRIEND! I didn't know what to do or who to react, but I wanted her to be happy so as long as he had a job and had his own house, I would except it…

Or so I thought.

Jess kept pestering me about going out and eventually I said yes, we would go out and I would stay at her place, but guess who arrived at her place a couple of hours before going out. Marc! Let me tell you, he looked like he was 48, not 33. He had dark messed up hair, like he had just gotten out of bed, stubbles on his face and clothes that a 16-year-old would wear, but he actually seemed nice enough. SEEMED being the key word here. 
We went out and I had an okay time (What happened out there is another story), I was happy that he decided to stay at the house though. 

Couple of months ago (Two months into Jess and Marc's relationship), I was having a sleep over at out other friend, Simone's, place. Jess wasn't staying so we could talk about her and Marc all night. Simone had never met Marc, but she was totally against Jess's and Marc's relationship. The age difference was too much for her and she didn't like what Jess had ONLY told HER, not ME (I'm her best friend!) Apparently Marc had a ""job"". He handed out leaflets through the mail and made cat litter in the back of his garage! 

I make more fucking money then he does and I'm a student! I only work weekends!

Making cat litter in the back of your garage is not a job! Not real job you can support someone with! Turned out that he didn't have prepaid or a driver's license either. He's 33!!! I also found out that Jess and Marc had slept together two weeks in their relationship! Jess had always told me that she wanted to wait 1 year to 18 months before sleeping with a guy because she didn't want to give her virginity to just anyone. TWO WEEKS IS NOT 18 MONTHS!! I seriously started doubting Marc and Jess's relationship after that talk with Simone. For some reason Jess hadn't told me all those things! It hurt to hear them from someone else. I asked her if it was true and she said that it was. I asked her why she didn't tell me and she just shrugged it off!

Jess's mom is okay with their relationship, her dad isn't (her parents are divorced.) and Jess decided to cut off all contact with her father. Just like that! 

After the talk with Simone, I was not okay with Marc and Jess's relationship anymore. About a month ago, Jess had gotten an IUD placed (She was fucking 18!) just so they wouldn't have to use a condom anymore. Jess still has pain from the IUD, even though she tried to hide it. That thing isn't placed right and they just continue having sex with anything. I am so mad at her for that! I am furious at Marc too! That he even allows her to do something like this when she's 18! Jess doesn't want to go to the doctor because it's ""supposed"" to feel like that.

On December 9th we went to the Hobbit Marathon (Jess, Marc, Simone and I). Simone had met Marc for the first time and we had already decided that she would sit farthest from him, because she really REALLY doesn't like him. I sat next to Simone, Jess next to me and Marc on the outer side of the row. For some reason Marc kept reaching over Jess and to my knee, trying to tickle me. I had to slap his hands from my leg three times before he got the message. Jess didn't even say anything about it! I felt Marc's hand mark on my knee through the whole first movie!

After the marathon (Hobbit movie 1, 2 and 3) I was really sad. I'm not going to spoiler anything, but the fact that it was the last movie had me really crying and in tears. I had had 3 Monster energy cans (I never drink energy) so I was really hyper. Hyper and sadness don't go well so I was crying and walking around to shake it off. Marc told me to go get some water and I just said ""Yes daddy"" In a really mocking way, but it really got to him. 

I didn't care. At this point I really think that he is a pervert and just uses my best friend for sex. All I hear from Jess is that they go on for rounds and rounds and only have sex. I really don't like this guy! 

But when I tell Jess that I don't like this guy and don't trust him, she just tells me that it's okay and that it's all fine. She even told me that she would like to marry this guy some day. HE CAN'T EVEN EARN A PROPER AMOUNT OF MONEY! Jess is still in that pink cloud, thinking that everything is okay and that she can do whatever she wants, but I'm really worried about her!

To make me even feel worse is that I'm leaving for America soon (I have an internship there), I'm going to be gone for a year. I'm afraid that if I leave something is going to happen to her. Like she get's pregnant and he leaves her or that she's just going to get used like some sex toy and throw away her life. Jess doesn't have an internship yet and she needs one if she wants to finish college and she says that if she has to do a year over that she'll quit and just start working. That doesn't work here in Holland!

I really don't know what to do anymore. I am the only one that is actually still trying to pull her the right direction. I want Jess to finish school, I want her to have a proper job in the future so that she can make some money (Jess's family don't have much money, they always barely make it through the month). I want her to see that what she's doing now isn't right for now. She can have a (BETTER) boyfriend after she finishes college, when she has a diploma and can stand on her own feet.

I really don't know what to do or think about this relationship. I don't want to say that they have to break up, but I want her to think of what she's doing. She's giving up everything, school, family, to be with this guy that isn't helping her forward in life. I want her to have so much better, she's such a great girl and there are so many better guys then someone who's 15 years older then her.

---


What would you guys do? I want to leave for America with a steady mind and not worry about my best friend 24/7.

2qhn5g,10,2014-12-26,Can I just vent to ladies about my drama causing aunt?,MissMaya212,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2qhn5g/can_i_just_vent_to_ladies_about_my_drama_causing/,"Not sure if this is the right place, but my aunt really upset me yesterday

So last night, me and my family went over to my grandmother's house for a few hours, just to catch up and have dinner.  After we've (me, my parents, and younger brother) have been there for about three hours we decide it's time to go because we've all been up since 7 that morning and my dad has to get some sleep for work.

As we all get our coats and are ready to walk out the door, my aunt calls me into the dining room and wants to have a conversation with me (mind you, we have all been there for three hours and she only spoken like five words to me the whole time).  She spends the next 20 minutes minutes basically calling me a bad niece because I don't spend that much time with her and don't call her and that I don't love her like I do other members of the family.  Now, I don't mean to not spend time with her a lot, but I'm in college and in class most days from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and I spend weekends studying and applying to grad schools and internships (I know it isn't the best excuse, but it's true, and I take responsibility of this).  She told me that it's my responsibility to spend time with her and if I don't it shows her I don't care about her.  At this point I'm feeling really bad and I have tears in my eyes.  I tell her I'm sorry and to stop because she's making me feel bad and she says ""good, that was my intention."" and finally says her goodbyes and let's me leave.

I'm just so upset that she always has to cause drama and make something out of nothing.  Just a few hours I learned that when my cousin arrived to my grandmother's house the first thing my aunt says to her is that's she fat and gaining weight (my cousin is NOT fat, btw and I always thought she was slim), causing my grandmother to have to reassure her that she looks good, and also tried to cause problems between my brother and his fiancee by bringing over a family friend and bringing up that she used to have a crush on my brother (stunts like that are why I refuse to bring my boyfriend to family functions if she's going to be there).  I just wanted to get through the day with no drama and that really ruined my day :/

2qhtjv,0,2014-12-26,Need advice on a living situation,goingtoh8myself4this,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2qhtjv/need_advice_on_a_living_situation/,"I've been in in a relationship for over three years with my boyfriend. We're both 21 and (I'm also female btw) and in college. We go to a five year college where a year of internships is part of the curriculam and have a year left after this semester. We live together and up until recently he's been the man of my dreams. He tells me he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. Perfect right?

Well not really. When school was ending last year he was encouraging me to go and find an internship near where he lived so we wouldn't have to be apart from each other (our respective family homes are 8 hours apart). At the time I was torn between studying abroad in Italy or holding out for an internship that I might get in his hometown. It was time to make a decision about whether or not I was going to Italy so I decided to stay and see if I'd get the internship rationallizing it with the thought of Italy being expensive, and working in the summer in America to save money for school. Well low and behold I got the internship. A few days before we both had to leave for the summer to start our internships in his hometown he told me he didn't want to live with me over the summer and not to follow him. He wanted me to stay in new york and because I didn't have  place to live in his hometown and it was too  last minute to find anywhere to live. Crushed I had to call up my internship (embaressed) and tell them I no longer could come, and had to beg for my shitty school job back. Thus I worked a crappy shit job I hated fourty hours a week and lived by myself all summer and became extremely lonely and depressed.

Fast forward to the end of summer he comes back to school (we're still living together because we resigned the lease for a year before he told me not to come) and he wanted me back I don't know what made me take him back because I was angry at him for so long, but I think me being by myself for so long and being so depressed made me latch on to him again. We'd already had been together for two years at that point so moving on was really hard for me to even try. He talked me into taking him back because he said he was afraid me and his hectic home environment would have been too much to handle which trusting depressed little ol me was willing to accept to feel better.

I which I hadn't taken him back because ever since he's been back all he does is put me down and insult me. He even made out with some dumb bimbo in front of me when he was drunk because he was ""being spiteful"" for something I said earlier to him. Needless to say we aren't together again but we still live with each other and he's made it clear that he doesn't want to see me dating anyone or moving on while we're still living together. I need advice on what I should do. I still care about him but he's hurt me too much and the insults and put downs are making me really depressed. I've been secretly going to counselors and taking anti depressents but they haven't really helped. The put downs are really getting to me though and I've addressed this to him before but he doesn't listen......I don't know what to do for the next six months and I can't get out of my lease. I just wanna be happy again :( Help?  "

Please help.",PoopyInMyPants,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/2qhzcj/got_in_to_an_argument_with_mom_dont_know_what_to/,"So I'm at my family's house for Christmas, and it's like my Aunt, uncle, few cousins, and some of their cousins. We're all sitting in the living room talking when my cousin brings up the BB gun that I bought like 4 years ago and left at their house. Excited, I go and get it and plan on putting it in my suitcase to bring back to college. Now my mom starts saying how I probably won't be able to bring it on the plane because its a gun and I explain to her how I can check the bag that it's in and it'll be fine and it's perfectly legal. She starts arguing against that and it gets pretty heated and I say how she's wrong and is overreacting to a BB gun...It gets more heated and she freaks out and says, ""Don't call me when you get arrested! Sorry I don't want to get that call and pay for a lawyer again!"", referencing 4 years ago when I was 17 and got arrested for marijuana possession. Everyone quieted down, it got real awkward. I got pissed, said, ""Okay, now I'm leaving. No idea why you had to just insult me like that."" and said ""Fuck you under my breath as I walked out."" I left to walk to my Aunt's house where my brother and I were staying down the street. Keep in mind ever since I got arrested I had turned my life around - Got accepted to a top 20 engineering school, just finished with a high profile internship, so it's safe to say I rebounded and am now doing great. About an hour later, my mom comes to the house I'm staying at and berates me about how I don't respect her opinion, how I ""embarrassed her"" in front of everyone by saying she was wrong and ""making her feel like an idiot."" I explained to her how that's not nearly as bad as bringing up an extremely personal instance of which everyone has moved on from for no reason in the middle of a petty argument. We argued some more, I brought up how she needs to move on from when I got in trouble, and she starts crying and says ""That was such a hard time for me."" I then say, ""I know, I know, it was hard for me too and I had apologized for putting you through that, but you have to move on because I'm doing great now."" She explains to me then how I haven't really changed, how I have no common sense for wanting to bring that BB gun on the plane. I explain to HER how it's perfectly legal and it's almost statistically impossible to get arrested to check a bag with that on the plane. She tells me that she wished she took her opinion respectfully and had my aunt ship it instead of trying to prove a point by getting on the plane with it. She cries, tells me she doesn't know me anymore, and that I can find my own ride to the airport in the morning.

What the fuck did I do? I get berated in front of my entire family and I'm the asshole because I told her she was wrong? Now I feel bad because she's my mom and she's crying in her room alone because of some fucked up scenario she made up in her head...part of me feels like I fucked up, where the other part is still waiting for an apology that she in no way is going to give me. I don't know how to solve this."
2qi14i,0,2014-12-26,"I (26/M) really like a girl (22/F). Not only is she a soon to be co-worker, but she also has a Boyfriend (26/M)",toocooldeep,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2qi14i/i_26m_really_like_a_girl_22f_not_only_is_she_a/,"So I really like this girl from work who was an intern but is now coming on full time. We really hit it off at the company holiday party and have hung out several times since then. For the first few times, I didn't know she had a boyfriend though I had heard from a mutual friend that she may. Every time we have hung out - gone out drinking, dancing, clubbing, to a christmas party on christmas with me to my friends house - there has always been a third person around, and ever since the boyfriend was confirmed, I've intentionally held back from making a move, even though we have great chemistry. 

Sunday is her birthday and she'll be turning 22, but her party is tomorrow night and it is being hosted by her boyfriend at some fancy club, who happens to have only invited his own friends to the party. I'm fairly certain I'm the only person she has invited to her own birthday celebrations and I'm at a crossroads about that and everything else in general.

The friend/coworker (another female that we both trust very much) that told me about her boyfriend says that the she has to like me because otherwise she wouldn't spend so much time with me, or stay up until 3-4 in the morning texting me all night, bring me up when talking to her and her friends, ask about me at work, etc. Her theory is that she's just confused because on one hand she has a boyfriend, but on the other she also likes me. I trust in the opinion of my friend because she understands not only our work culture, but her and the girl are from the same part of the world so she understands the girls cultural differences that I would need time to grasp. The only problem is my friend hasn't given any actionable advice. 

After spending so much time together, I've begun to wonder if perhaps we actually have a huge communication barrier since english isn't her native language (though she does speak it quite well). Meaning that I'm also confused now because I can't tell if she doesn't realize that I'm flirting with her/she is naive, or if she is actually just pretending because she doesn't know what to do. 

But damn, women are difficult. 

TLDR: I like a girl from work who has a BF, but keeps spending increasing amounts of time with me. Her birthday party is tomorrow night and she invited me even though her BF is the one who put it together and didn't invite any of her friends. What should I do about the party, and well, the whole situation altogether?"

After lurking for the past 4 months, reading everything in the sidebar, and lusting over all your glorious watches, I've decided to pick up a nicer watch for myself as a late Christmas present. I've already got a beater watch I take backpacking with me, so I'd like recommendations for a nice dress watch.

Background, 20 year old college student majoring in Business and Accounting (Go Vandals!). I've already got an internship lined out in an accounting firm and I feel that a nice dress watch would compliment me nicely. I've got a budget of sub $200 but could possibly go $250 if the watch is worth it.

Watches I'm currently looking at are:

1) [Seiko SNZH57](http://www.amazon.com/Seiko-SNZH57-Automatic-Black-Stainless/dp/B004673QPE)

2) [Citizen Eco-drive AO9000-06B](http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-AO9000-06B-Eco-Drive-Stainless-Day-Date/dp/B00843L4S2/ref=pd_sbs_a_6?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=18ABN88RFNQQ0MBN5FY9) or [BM6752-02A](http://www.amazon.com/Citizen-BM6752-02A-Eco-Drive-Gold-Tone-Stainless/dp/B009G6XXCG/ref=pd_sbs_watch_6?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0WB6QKKSCP8VMVPAA0EY) (Something about those blue hands is nice)

3) [Orient FER27003W0 ""Sympothy""](http://www.amazon.com/Orient-FER27003W0-Symphony-Stainless-Leather/dp/B00I364FDQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419659866&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=orient+symphony+watch) or [ER24001B ""Bambino""](http://www.amazon.com/Orient-ER24001B-Bambino-Automatic-Mechanical/dp/B00529W5CK/ref=pd_sim_watch_5?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1SJZHCMTCKAKRYFMA3PN)

We were interns together earlier this year although I had been at the company for 6 months before Leah started. Leah eventually got a job at the company mid-year while I moved to another city for work. A few weeks ago, I came back for Christmas and eventually went to the holiday at the company mainly because I'm close to a lot of the staff. 

I show up later after everyone's had dinner and are now mostly inebriated and dancing. I walk in, I'm mobbed by some former co-workers. One of my best friends, another former intern (from my first session), is there and tells me Leah is at the bar. I go up to her and surprise her. She's happy to see me but is ""upset"" that I didn't tell her I was in town/coming to the Christmas party. She slaps me and then kisses me on the cheek and says she's glad I'm here. She then goes to get me a glass of wine and to get me drunk.

I can tell she's kinda drunk but she frequently disappears (the holiday party is somewhat big in number of people and the room everyone's dancing in). Later on, the music dies down, and she comes to me, sits down, and holds my hand and says she's really glad I'm here. I can tell she's kinda into me, but I also know she's had a few. It's also weird because we're friends, but we're not super-close. Regardless, the holiday party is over, and the younger staff go to a nearby bar for an after-party. I'm driving and I've been to the bar, so Leah, who's riding with one of her best friends ""Ryan"" follows. Leah has a mini-freakout outside the bar (long story), Ryan says he can drop her now, and I kinda support that notion, but she says no, she wants to go in, so I say I can drop her at her place later, because the boyfriend of another of my best friends is having a birthday at a bar literally down the street, so I'd drop her and head over there.

So Leah and I go in, and she buys me, herself and a co-worker drinks. Eventually, she starts dancing on me and then we start making out. We dance, make out, talk etc throughout the night and we're both having a good time. After all of our co-workers and friends are leaving, we head out. She asks if I can take her home, and I say yes. I told my friend I'd go to her boyfriend's birthday party at the bar, so I tell her, since it's a 1 minute up the street, we'd stop there for a few minutes and then, I'd take her home. We hang out for a bit, and we go to her place.

As I pull into her driveway, she asks me if I want to come in. I do, and we go in. We talk for abit and then go to bed. We wake up in the middle of the night, talk and joke some more, and then fall asleep. I have to leave early in the morning, so I get dressed. I kiss her goodbye, but she pulls away before it can get heavy. Later that day, I text her and we text back and forth for most of the day. A few days later, I text her if she wants to get drinks or watch a movie at her place, and she says ""No I can't. I'm sorry."" I say it's no problem. Two days later, I text her a gif that reminded me of her about the party, she asks if she was really that bad, I say the embarrassing stuff happened when only Ryan and/or I were around, and I get no response. That was three days ago.

So basically, it comes down to the fact that I had never looked at Leah romantically previously, and although I live in a different state and don't want a relationship with anyone, after what happened, I can't stop looking at her romantically, and now that she's aloof and distant, I'm pretty confused, and not sure of myself anymore.

We were interns together earlier this year although I had been at the company for 6 months before Leah started. Leah eventually got a job at the company mid-year while I moved to another city for work. A few weeks ago, I came back for Christmas and eventually went to the holiday at the company mainly because I'm close to a lot of the staff. 

I show up later after everyone's had dinner and are now mostly inebriated and dancing. I walk in, I'm mobbed by some former co-workers. One of my best friends, another former intern (from my first session), is there and tells me Leah is at the bar. I go up to her and surprise her. She's happy to see me but is ""upset"" that I didn't tell her I was in town/coming to the Christmas party. She slaps me and then kisses me on the cheek and says she's glad I'm here. She then goes to get me a glass of wine and to get me drunk.

I can tell she's kinda drunk but she frequently disappears (the holiday party is somewhat big in number of people and the room everyone's dancing in). Later on, the music dies down, and she comes to me, sits down, and holds my hand and says she's really glad I'm here. I can tell she's kinda into me, but I also know she's had a few.

2qjrmd,2,2014-12-27,Me [25M] and my now ex-girlfriend [23F] broke up after three months and I need general advice for coping.,Throwaway2210439,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qjrmd/me_25m_and_my_now_exgirlfriend_23f_broke_up_after/,"Hi.

We started dating late September and hit it off amazingly. Things went well and we had time to hang out at least a couple of times a week. We both had been single for at least a year and we both talked about how this was the first significant relationship we'd been in for a long time and how awesome it felt.

She's plays acoustic guitar and sings covers and she finished writing her first song in years while we were dating and it was about me. I brought her around my friends and family, which is huge for me. It was clear we had had a major impact on each other. We never talked about what that meant though. We never really talked about what we needed out of the relationship because things were going really well and I think we just wanted to ride that feeling for a while.

Well December came around and our relationship was put to the test in a variety of ways. I began to realize that she probably wasn't able to put as much time and effort into the relationship as I would have liked because she has two jobs, goes to school full time, and is starting an internship next semester. Also, her dad is about to start dialysis. Me on the other hand, I'm relatively set financially and I have a rather stable and well-paying day job and I'm living with my brother in my dad's old house, who died back in July. But at least we both have daddy issues! So I told her that I was having some doubts about whether or not this relationship was right and that I needed her to think about what being in this relationship actually meant to her and whether or not it was something she could make work.

In the end, it didn't work out. She claims it's because of bad timing, which I can agree with to a certain extent, but I also think if this was something she really wanted, she would have made an exception. During the breakup discussion, she did say that right now she just wasn't able to give this 100% but she hopes that later on down the line maybe things could work out but I feel like she was softening the blow with that one. Plus, holding onto that hope will just hinder my future relationships and make it that much harder to move on. We broke up last night so things are still pretty fresh but I've deleted her from all social media, deleted all pictures, texts, and anything else I could think of and I'm ready to mope around for a bit, then try to move forward.

I could just use some help from strangers right now.

---   
**tl;dr**: First relationship in a long time didn't work out and I'm super bummed. I know how to move forward and that I should move on, but I could use some perspective and advice."
2qk8q0,4,2014-12-27,Looking for some feedback: yelling at people in my head.,Colemancount,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/2qk8q0/looking_for_some_feedback_yelling_at_people_in_my/,"Dear Redditors,

I've been recently diagnosed with Aspergers, and I'm currently in the whole discovery-/criticizing-my-diagnosis phase. The more posts I read in this subreddit, the more confused I become; I can relate to part of the characteristics posted here, but to a large amount not at all. I feel I need to discuss a lot with my psychologist. :)
The most important characteristic I want to ""cross-reference"" is the main reason why I went to the psychologist in the first place. Does anyone recognize the following?

During my Master's research internship, I was the only guy who had any decent computer knowledge, and was thus assigned to the IT-part of a large project. Working on this part of the project didn't yield much results; it was a large database that was either ""finished"" or ""not finished"", which gave me the feeling that I hadn't accomplished anything during the later months of my internship. Creating the whole database was too much work for one person, but my supervisor wasn't able to know that, due to her inexperience with this kind of research.
Nevertheless, the feeling that I hadn't accomplished anything plagued me, which for a couple of times led to the following: I only needed the feeling that time was running out for me, a simple setback, or the idea that I wasn't performing well enough to become mentally paralysed. In my head I start yelling angrily at my supervisor, certain friends, interviewers or random people. These mental rants (they're not random fits of cussing at people) would occupy my mind from half an hour to two hours and would leave me completely unable to work or focus, feeling very sad and tired, and cause me to turn introverted. Talking to a friend was able to stop this 'storm' in my head, once.

So, I went to the psychologist, told her this and another thing that was bugging me (The feeling I was doing all the work and would never get a satisfying reward; a thought that recurred to me the previous year, when I was doing my Bachelor's internship and had a couple of projects with very reluctant coworkers on the side.) and she tested me for ASD. This brings me back to the start of my post.

So, does anyone recognize this and does it have anything to do with Aspergers?"

**COMMUNITYSTUCK, YEAR 1, DAY 239; 71 DAYS POST-CONDESCENSION**

PSN where you at. 

Ah well, I'll just play Far Cry 4. May as well; I bought the friggin' thing. 

Anywho, welcome to CommunityStuck, you newcomers. I may as well get this out of the way at the beginning. [Please, enjoy this ""fireside chat"" we participate in on a nightly basis. These are only going to get later in the evening, so please, sit down. Have some cocoa, some coffee, some tea, or whatever your pleasure. We're going to talk about your day, my friend(s). Then, everyone is going to answer some casual questions, some ""conversation starters"", if you will. We're really going to get quite chatty, so let's live it up.](/kv)

Well, today was a small day. I woke up substantially earlier than yesterday, at around 11:30 in the morning, after a night of drinking. It wasn't a very good night, and we ended up watching Advent Children because my buddy is a stubborn jackass. I wasn't a huge fan, but riffing the movie (a la MST3K) made it a lot of fun. 

You see that ""a la"" phrase up there? See, that's one of the (scarce) advantages to typing this on mobile. I can put the accents up there on my phone. Not having 'em bothers the hell out of me. 

Now, let's get down to one last bit of business: **TOMORROW'S COMMUNITYSTUCK WILL BE POSTED AT 6 PM CENTRAL. I'M MAKING THEM LATER ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP DOING THEM AFTER WORK.** 

So don't freak out at 5:45 cause CommunityStuck isn't up yet. 

Of course, the advantage of me telling you the time is that you can go ahead and post it if you feel I'm not up to snuff. 

So where was I? Ah. 

Yesterday, I went to the local bar before a coffee date with a friend of mine. The bar was called The Growler, and it served only craft beers. 

So I picked up some Coffee stout. I gotta say, that shit was *delicious.* I mean, it was like I was drinking coffee, but it was an ice cold beer. 

Christ in a sidecar, beer is good.

Then, in the mood for more stout, I bought some of Shiner's birthday brew, a chocolate stout.

Oh my god that was terrible. I'll stick with Shiner Bock from now on, thank you very much. 

With all that business finally settled, let's do some Questions of the Day (QOTDs). 

[Submit your QOTD ideas here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RcFV71Uo0bTmu-WE181TbDnFE6YwilkfnaqUQp7bHBM/edit?pli=1)

Also. Let me know if I've missed yours and need to go back for it. I'm looking back, and I have no idea because I'm a shit who can't keep track of his used QOTDs.

QOTD1 (*submitted by /u/Dermon*): What would be the reaction of past you (from 1 year ago) to present you?

""Holy shit, my grades are going to be *how* bad now? And I *still got a fucking internship?!*""

QOTD2 (*submitted by /u/drippingcandle*): If you could have one character from any franchise as your matesprit, who would it be?

Hee hee, I've always been a fan of Noire, from Fire Emblem.

Every small business should be looking to minimize costs that are unavoidable. Small business are at a disadvantage compared to larger firms because the larger business are able to purchase the same products necessary for every business at a lower rice due to their increased volume. This system already tips the competitive advantage to those firms that are bigger than yours. However, a workaround exists.

I am a entrepreneur who working on a few side projects while I am still in school. In the meantime I am completing various internships in different business fields. This spring I am working in sales with this relatively new start-up that is GPO(group purchasing organization) that focuses on delivering massive discounts on necessary business products to non-profits and small businesses. The discounted products include the following:
--35%-93% almost all staples products and free shipping on any order over $35, these prices are specifically on contract and only offered though our GPO.
-- Payroll system through Zen Payroll that will beat the price of your current system and you get 2 free months to start
-- BCMS credit card processing will beat the price of your current system, especially if you are getting ripped off by a company like square.
-- Cloud computing through ADAR, this is the first cloud computing in the GPO world. The advantage of cloud computing include never having to renew your software products (as much a s $500/2 years) and never having to buy new hardware. 

We also offer additional services considering travel, expense reports, and business cards/printing.

While I can not directly say the company here due to a confidentiality agreement I signed, please email me or comment here if you are interested in these discounts. 

BY THE WAY: While, I usually receive commission for generating sales, it is against the posting rules here so I will not take any commission from people on this sub. Im just trying to grow a business I really believe in. I don't even officially start till next month.

Oh the best part is since we target non-profits and small firms, there is NO MEMBERSHIP FEE, there is literally no catch. The only hard part is getting everybody on board because its a win-win for everybody. 

Thanks for listening, I hope you all can cut needless costs on required business services and re-invest that to make your company or non-profit the best version it can be."

At this point she was in college studying animation and 3D modeling. She had hopes and dreams of working at Pixar. She even had a Disney internship with their animators. I looked up to her so much, and even followed her into the same college. When she found out she was pregnant, she didn't want to keep the baby because she knew she was right in the middle of college and couldn't afford it. Her boyfriend was ultra conservative and very very Christian and pretty much forced her to keep the baby. My sister is a very passive, peaceful person so she obviously went along with this because she loved her bf and wanted to make him happy. So flash forward through pregnancy, now there's this kid, and she's graduated, and married with no full time job in her field and her and her bf living in a studio apartment, both working at burger king to make ends meet. I can't even tell you how sad it was to have my sister, someone who I looked up to since I was a little girl, have to ask me for $20 to buy diapers and be on food stamps. I feel like this is when I started really hating my nephew. He was a cute baby, so everyone conveniently forgot how ""horrible"" it was that my respected sister got knocked up, and how much he was draining their already pitiful finances. Everyone except me. I could LITERALLY see the life and passion draining from my sister, and it killed me, and made me resent the kid for taking that away from her. He's 4 years old now, and both my sister and BIL have full time jobs, but I hate him now more than ever. It's not just that he stole my sister's dreams away but he's turning into a nightmare child, refusing to listen, screaming all the time, not playing well with other kids etc; but he can get away with it because everyone thinks he's ""so cute"" and is ""a kid just being a kid!"" I need help. I get anxiety when he’s around. I can’t talk or look at the kid without welling up with anger. I moved back in with my parents after graduating college (temporarily while searching for a full time job), so now I have to be around him more than ever. He’s over at my parent’s house at least 4 times a week (sister and BIL live 5 minutes away).  No one understands where I’m coming from, not even my parents. They just say ""lighten up! He's just a kid"" or that I should quit being so selfish. I’ve never been able to talk to my sister about these feelings; because I know me telling her about this would hurt her deeply. I know how much she loves this kid and her husband. I don’t want to run away from this or hide upstairs in my room anymore (which is what I normally do when he’s around). I feel so guilty that I feel this way about a kid, who hasn’t even done anything to deserve these angry feelings besides just existing. I also feel terrible that I can’t say that I love him. How do I get over these feelings and start getting along and being OK with my nephew? (I mean he's going to have to be a part of my life whether I like it or not)"

2qlpl5,2,2014-12-28,Dealing with an extremely insecure and jealous S/O? We fought b/c I couldn't spend X-MAS with him.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2qlpl5/dealing_with_an_extremely_insecure_and_jealous_so/,"So me and my bf have been going out for about 2.5 years now, and although it has gotten some what better...i'm beginning to wonder if my bf is just covering his jealousy better or what? B/c it seems to me that when we take 3 steps forward, we eventually end up taking 10 steps backwards. 

Let me start off, I am now a senior in college, and we've been dating since i was sophomore. Over the course of our relationship-I've lost many friends..and def many guy friends, friends that I've never had any kind of romantic history with too. I love him, he does a lot for me, and he helps me emotionally and sometimes financially when I am in need. I do the same for him. However, sometimes his jealousy is overwhelming. He gets jealous over me spending time with family, friends, anything. I get tired of constantly having to prove myself.

This Christmas he got mad at me because I didnt want to drive 1.5 hours to go see him in our college town (he lives 3 hours from my home town, so we usually meet in the middle- where we go to college), it wasn't that I didnt want to really, I just felt bad leaving my family, a lot of them were just getting down that day to come see me. So i told him no, and he went off on how he will never be on the same level as my family..blah blah. That's not true at all. We spend all other holidays together. He started comparing us to other couples how they spend the holidays together. Didn't matter how much I tried to reason with him..saying distance was a huge factor-he still didn't see it from my perspective.

I don't know what it is, i feel like he can be delusional sometimes. He refuses to see things from my perspective, like if he thinks it, he's right..or if he thinks he saw something -then it happened. For ex: me and my best friend were coming back from dinner, and he was at home-he swore on his life that we came from another street (insinuating that I really wasn't coming from where I said i was coming from), but I know for sure what street we came from..but he refused to believe me. I even had my best friend vouch for me. Its frustrating because no matter how much I defended myself he still didn't believe me. I mean the guy swore on his freaking life I came from the street he ""saw"". 

Not only that, but I feel like he makes me feel shitty for wanting to move after college. He is currently taking a ""break"" right now from school. He will say stuff like ""oh I guess we only have til May (graduation) to be with each other then.."" giving the relationship an expiration date. This past summer he made me feel bad for interviewing at an intern 1 hour away from our college town, saying stuff like ""oh you always want to be far away from me, why couldn't you apply to any interns here??"" I tell him to apply for interns. I try to motivate him to hurry up and finish school so we can move away together. But no..excuse after excuse. I was so upset..like why couldn't he just be happy for me? And I did apply to interns near him, I just didn't get any call backs.

My question is, how do I deal with this? How do I get him to see things from my POV? I'm at my wits end..and the fact that he put an expiration date on the relationship hurts me. Do people like this ever change?"

Unless you're older, just join the military. I did it for 4 years, got a few certs, an associates degree, security clearence and the world was at my fingertips at the end of my enlistment. 

Each branch usually has a networking, systems, and PC tech field. You get free training, and essentially a paid internship.

Within 3 months of joining I was configuring cisco switches and routers and getting more experience than I would have ever imagined. I was one of 5 engineers maintain two top secret networks with over 5000 users on each.

It sucked sometimes,  but it was the best career move I've ever made, and for anyone struggling for a entry level position it is an easy route to get that experience, get certified, and start your life.

The pay is good enough to support yourself and your family and the rewards are much more than what little sacrifice is made.

Someone else can probably chime in on whether or not other countries have similar military positions, but in the US they are easy as pie to land.

This has probably been mentioned before, and I'm no recruiter.  I just want to share that it was the best career move many of my friends and I have made and young people should take it into consideration if you're scared or having a hard time starting out."

Let me give you some background information before I start my questions :-)

So my name is Lotte. I’m from Belgium and I’m studying Tourism and Recreation management. I already have a bachelor’s degree in Event and project management, so I’d like to head in that direction with tourism as well. Organizing trips and such. 

To finish my education I need to do an internship of 16 weeks and my mind in dead set on New York city! 

My school does not offer any internships in America and therefore I’m not in the running for a  scholarship either. This was a deal breaker for my mum, so now I have a few weeks to prove that New York city is awesome and that it’ll be worth it doing my internship there. 

So my questions are:
-	How inviting are companies to take on a trainee from other country?
-	Where can I find these companies? And how is the best way to approach them?
-	Is there a cheap way to live in New York? Maybe live in the suburbs and use public transportation? Is this a possibility?
-	Is there possibly a way to live with a roommate? Where could I find someone who is interested in this?

Thanks in advance and I hope someone can help me!

We both talked about it and decided on an open relationship while he was there. During the past five months, I ended up moving to New York to help a buddy for one month which turned out bad. Then I got really depressed and I told my boyfriend that I just want to be together again but now he loves Israel so much he's not going to come back to live in the US. We're going to hang for a week when he comes back for the last time in Feb and the possibility of going to Israel for a bit is there so I want to wait for him because I love him. Though because I'm pretty depressed due to having nothing in my life (no family that cares, no friends that are in the area, no job/school, etc), he is getting increasingly distant and it's making me feel so much worse. I have no idea what to do with myself or with us, I think about wanting to die every day. He just doesn't understand how much he means to me and how much I need him right now, I feel so bad. I don't know what do to, I want to be with him which means giving up my life here and I have no problem with that, but he isn't even sure and I hate being stuck like this."

The character development, the office politics, the romance and depiction of family life etc., were really well done and beautifully executed. All the actors were great and had fantastic chemistry. The pacing of the show too was just right.

-----

I have three doubts, and hope you can clarify it -   
The last scene of the last episode shows Mr. Oh bumping into our hero (?) while attending a funeral. Any idea whose funeral he was attending? 

And secondly, I remember seeing a preview / trailer of Misaeng before it aired. Don't remember where I saw it ... Anyway, it had a scene where Geu-rae confronts Ahn Young-yi asking her why she didn't give his number (or gave the wrong number) to the day-care teacher who was interested in him. (Remember the day-care teacher asks Young-yi whether she is dating Geu-rae and asks for his number while both of them are sitting on the bench in the day-care playground?) Since I watched Misaeng in a marathon binge session, I don't know / recall if they showed that confrontation scene ... ? Did they? (If not, I guess it must have been saved for season 2).

Third - who was the ""connection"" that actually got Geu-rae the internship position? Earlier episodes mention an ""executive director"" and later someone mentions about a ""CEO"" recommendation?"

2qnt7f,2,2014-12-28,Board Meeting,Damie904,GLRP_EastBlue,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLRP_EastBlue/comments/2qnt7f/board_meeting/,"Click...clack...click...clack. A sound that you’d hear quite frequently within these walls. This was a business, which employed some of the best business men and women around the world. Their job? To make money. That was their job description, and that was the companies goal. To go against that philosophy within these walls, might as well be suicide. Down one of the many hallways came two men, both with papers in hand detailing some kind of meeting.

“[So...you’re telling me this idiot managed to drop damn near every single contract on his way over here?](/cc)”

“[That’s the jist of it. I tell you, that kid’s gonna be lucky if he can still take leak standing up after this. Boss did not look happy.](/gt)”

“[Couldn’t say I blame him. I mean any random idiot could’ve picked those up.](/cc)”

“[Well, that’s what this meeting’s supposed to be about.](/gt)”

*The two men, along with a few others, poured into the board all taking their seats at the long table. Behind all of them one gentlemen, with his hair slicked back and with several folders in his hands. The man began to speak, not even giving a good morning or an intro to what was going on.*

“[Alright, so as you know one of our interns, Jimmy was handling some of our contracts. Unfortunately, Jimmy seemed to have mishandled them, dropping several of them on his route to the office. Luckily, no one managed to see his face, but we’re gonna have to address each of these failures.](/sgt)”

*The man then began passing around folders, which contained information on each contract.*

“[Four of our assassination contracts were taken. Only one seems to have been completed. The Kinsdale mansion was set aflame about forty-seven minutes ago. Loguetown firefighters are already doing their best to contain the flames from spreading to the surrounding forest. Intel says all family members, including the maid, are dead. Their murderer appears to be a Ms. Lucille Cassidy](/sgt).”

*Lucille’s photo is among the few that seem to be within the files.*

“[For whatever reason, she took it upon herself to take on the contract and complete it. We suspect that this may have been the case with a few of our other contracts.](/sgt)”

*One of the women, wearing a pink blouse under her blazer clears her throat to speak.*

“[But, surely we’re not going to make that assumption, just off one contract being completed, right?](/stg)”

“[Of course not.](/sgt)”

*He then directed everyone’s attention to four other folders.*

“[Two contracts are currently being performed by unknown quantities. One Eddward Duvius and Leah Rose. An idiot pirate aboard the Blue Bird Pirates and one local merchant who seems to be involved with their captain. Currently, they just entered where Sia’s arrow gun is being stored. We've already sent a team to retrieve it, before two can get a hold of it. The other contract was bomb placement. There seems to be a small red headed girl wandering the grounds with them so, the moment, we’re going to be keeping our distance until she leaves the area. We don’t wanna alert anyone to any knowledge we might have. If she decides to turn them over to the marines for whatever reason, we’ll be detonating them.](/sgt)”

*These last contracts spoke of explosives in a casino and infiltrating the marines.*

“[These last two contracts were also dropped, but we at the moment, have no idea who took them. Just to be safe, we’ll send one of our agents to head to the meeting zone and we’ll detonate the explosives sometime tonight. Destroy the evidence and anyone who might have them. If we’re lucky, the vault will still be blown open.](/sgt)”

“What about the people who took the missions? How are we handling them?”

“[Case by case basis. If anyone completed those contracts pay em, plus a little extra to keep their mouths shut. It’d draw too much attention if too many people go missing. The marines are already on super high alert after that bullshit with the milkshakes. The Duvius kid is a pirate, so we’ll just retrieve the object. If that Rose girls tries talking to the marines we've got photos of her talking to his captain. She won’t make it out of the main building if we didn't want her to.](/sgt)”

“[Hold on, how do you know this kid is Eddward Duvius? I’ve seen that kid before, this looks nothing like him.](/at)”

“[He’s taken one of those pills Seuss made. Seems Seuss decided to give some out to some of the pirates who didn't get arrested.](/sgt)”

“[I don’t see why we allow him to just waltz around freely like this. He’ll get caught if he keeps this up](/ag)”

“[Trust me, he knows what he’s doing. In house testing is limited, and we need much more test subjects to find any potential bugs. He knows how to get his product out there and he knows how to make sure people will use it. His findings so far are those without devil fruits seem to have unstable reactions, causing them to change form in twenty four hour cycles from ingestion. Wouldn't have found this out otherwise.](/sgt)”

“[Fine, fine.](/ag)”

“[At any rate, this means our contractors will need a change in job. Not paying them would not be profitable for us.](/sgt)”

“[Well, if we can get the arrow gun, the last job would probably still be possible. Just let them all know the parameters have changed, but they’ll all still be getting paid.](/sgt)”

##Meanwhile, somewhere near the La Fortuna...

*Somewhere on a nearby rooftop were two men, one of them with a sniper rifle, the other smoking a cigarette. Both men had suits on, which might look odd if anyone had noticed them.*

**Smoker**: “[So, me and Hanson are at this bar, not too far from the shopping district and we see this girl walk by. So, you know Hanson, always has to hit on every piece of ass he sees. Leaves the counter, walks right up to her and starts flirting with her. Only thing was, she started flirting back.](/tg)”

**Sniper**: “[You’re kidding me.](/tc)”

**Smoker**: “[I know, right? So, they’re talking with her for at least fifteen minutes, both of them couldn’t have had more than two drinks each in them. He smiles, she puts his hand on his leg, and they both just run out the door, don’t even pay. Had to cover both of them before the bartender blew a gasket.](/tg)”

*The sniper seemed to be loading odd looking bullets into his rifle. They were tipped glass containers that housed some kind of yellow gas. The sniper looked at it disgustingly, like he was handling something gross.*

**Sniper**: “[So, Hanson finally got laid, huh?](/tc)""

**Smoker**: ""[Not exactly. See Hanson comes back to the bar about fifteen minutes later and he looks all sweaty, and he looks ashamed. Sits back down next to me and asks for the strongest drink, looks over at me and says “...That wasn't a woman.](/tg)” 

*The sniper began lining up his shots, trying his best to hold back hysterically laughing at the story. He began breathing deeply to get the laughter out of his body as he looked through his scope. Three people, standing in a circle. The bullets contain some kind of tranquilizer so he just need to hit the ground.*

**Sniper**: ""[Alright, get down there. In and out and thirty seconds.](/tc)""

*The smoking man took his last puff and his made his way down the building at the sniper counted to twenty. Before they two people leaving the ship could walk away. He fired off a single round, dispersing a mixture of tranquilizer and sleeping gas throughout the area. The range of disbursement was small, but the gas was potent. Knocking most people who breathed it in out, within seconds. All three people, before they could realize it, would be knocked out within seconds, drooling on the floor as they enjoyed a nice three minute nap. Within that time frame, the second man was come strolling out, and looking at the bullets work.*

**Smoker**: ""[Shit, this thing worked like a charm. Guess he’s getting a better hang of this stuff.](/tg)""

**Sniper**: ""[You wouldn't be so happy about it, if you knew how he produced it. Anyway, it wears off fast, so don’t waste time.](/tc)""

*Picking up the arrow gun, and briskly walking away before anyone could notice. He looked it over, noticing that it seemed to pulse with some sort of weird energy. Yea, this was it alright. But, what the hell did they want this thing for anyway?*

##Sometime later that night

*Per instruction, they left a small package on the Navis Stultorum for* [Lucille](/stg)*. The box contained about* **8,000 beli** *and another note in fading ink, asking her to keep quiet about the whole ordeal. She was apparently, the only one that even found, accepted, and completed her contract with no hassle to them, so they had no qualms with paying her properly. They doubted she even knew what was really going on.*

####Barry, Borasco, Kiske, Argo, Leah, and Edd can't receive payment. Rei and Tullipe's contracts are still ongoing."
2qntm6,1,2014-12-28,Controlling Mother won't let me go away to college.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2qntm6/controlling_mother_wont_let_me_go_away_to_college/,"Hi, thanks so much to whoever reads this and replies. I feel trapped and have no idea what to do or where to turn.

I am 19 years old and a sophomore at a private university. I actually just withdrew from the college a few days ago, and plan on taking a semester off to intern and work, then attend a public state university for Fall 2015. I would like to go away to said public university but the thing is, my mom has always been 100% against me dorming in college. I've been taking the bus for an hour and a half to and from school, daily since Freshmen year and it has been hell. And it's my only means of transportation. On top of that, I fell into depression late Freshman year because 1. I was incredibly shy and had anxiety, which resulted in me having barely any friends. My mother usually wanted me to come home straight after my last class, so I didn't really have an opportunity to get out and mingle. 2. I had absolutely no support in my household regarding college since I will be the first one in my home and practically family, to attend college (besides my uncle who attended community college). No one really cared about ANYTHING relating to what I did or had to do, in school.  I became depressed, I started to flunk my difficult classes, I lost major scholarships because of low grades, and I was unable to register for the coming semester because of accumulated debt that we didn't pay ($9,000). 

I told my mother, I would attend a community college and she was very happy about that. But then after much research I realized that the tuition o fa public state university and the community college were quite similar. But the cost of living on campus would be added to it. Well, I brought this up to my mom and she FLIPPED. HER. LID. She said she will never allow me to dorm and that a community college and a university are the same but one is so much harder than the other (no one knows much about college in my house). She said I'm weak and make bad decisions (since I got depressed and flunked). She said that I'm not going to anymore universities and I'm only doing it to impress people (I got accepted to all 6 private universities I applied for in high school). I brought the topic up in a happy and calm mood (as usual) and she just started screaming, shouting, and cursing me out over this.

I've been discussing this ""going away"" topic with her sporadically over the past 2 years and it always results the same and I don't know what to do. I tell her that the Community Colleges doesn't have any of the programs and opportunities that I am looking for, and she literally doesn't care. I know I can do great things but she thinks that me going away means she was a bad parent. She says she's done everything she can for me and now I want to go live somewhere else. I feel incredibly trapped and there is no changing her mind. She says I need to just go to community college like my uncle did, graduate, and be satisfied. 

The thing is, she never EVER gives me a solid reason as to why I can't go away. When I was entering college as a Freshman, I wanted to dorm and she either ignored me by walking away or she started yelling and shouting like a young child and she says that I'm giving her a headache and that I'm going to make her end up in the hospital because of stressing her out. I told her that I don't feel as if I am getting the full college experience because I am forced to come home after class also. And this semester, I had later classes that ended at about 6pm almost everyday and she would call me a liar, saying that I was actually gong to hang out with friends and I didn't have class that late and threatened on several occasions to ""call my school"" and ask where I was and to request my schedule (because she obviously thinks that college is just like high school). 

When I first got the news that I lost my scholarships and that my out-of-pocket costs skyrocketed, I didn't know what to do. I went to find out really late, about a week before registration for the spring semester and was told that if it's not paid in full by my registration, that i will not be able to register. After having such an unpleasant time at the school, I just decided to withdraw from it and find a cheaper alternative. I still have to pay the $9,000 before I get to apply anywhere else. When I told my mother all of this and told her that Community College may have to be my next option, my mom felt so good. She was happy and said she wanted me to do that the whole time but I kept pressing to go to a University so people could feel proud of me (which I clearly don't understand). She wanted me to apply as soon as possible and actually showed interest in my college education for the first time. But yesterday, after much indecisive deciding, I revealed the plan to go to a state school and she went ballistic. Her face got red, she was standing up and shouting. She said I'm a lunatic for wanting to go away and she will NOT allow it. Because I used one ""big"" word during our conversation, she proceeded to tell me how I'm not smarter than she is and she can use big words too. I was literally crying the entire time, which seemed to have been fueling her to attack even more.
 
I recall my sister wanting to go to a Culinary Arts school in Rhode Island (we live in New York) and my mom went off on her, flipped out, and my sister accepted it and went commuted to a random cooking program-like school close to us(i don't really know what it was; my sister and I don't talk to each other) and graduated top of her class. My mother was ecstatic and says that people who go to ""higher up"" schools usually don't amount to much and it's the ones who follow their parents wishes to go to a close to home ""lower"" school who are happiest and come out as better adults. I really don't know wtf she's talking about and I always ask her why she doesn't want me to go away and she dodges the question like bullets. She never went to college so therefore have not had a ""bad"" dorming experience. So I really don't know where it is coming from. 

I can't enlist friends or family to intervene either. I know that my mother is very narcissistic and I have definitely been the scapegoat child for all things wrong and my 23 year old sister just verbally abuses me nonstop, so I have no desire to speak to her. My 11 year old brother is highly controlled and brainwashed by the both of them. My mother thinks of herself as the best person in our whole family, and thinks that our family is the ""model family"" so we don't really communicate much with our family. Also, she hates every single one of my female friends, even the one she doesn't know. She says all my friends bully me and our jealous of me and just want to see me crash and burn (which is far from reality), and literally tells me she does not want to meet any of them and to keep them away from her.

2qoi2t,6,2014-12-28,Two Semesters Left of College - Terrified,TerrifiedActuary,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2qoi2t/two_semesters_left_of_college_terrified/,"Alright, so basically, I have come to here in search of a few things. One being (hopefully) reassurance, another being help, probably some other things not mentioned as well. I apologize and warn ahead of time that my mind is not in a great place right now. I am questioning myself a lot and my thoughts are sort of all over the place. I already know I will probably jump around in thoughts, so I am sorry if it is hard to follow at some points. Please, stick with me though. I would appreciate it. 

I am currently on track to graduate in the Fall 2015 semester. I have been studying to become an actuary for about a year now. In that time, I have completed all except 5 courses pertaining to my degree and I have passed an exam. I am currently preparing for another exam as well and see no issues with passing it, I just do not know when I will be able to sit for it due to not being able to afford the registration fee.

So, that all sounds pretty decent right? All that in a year seemed pretty good to me. This past recruiting season at school (early Fall semester), I applied to very many positions (both internships and professional positions). I received some interviews after attending the career fair held by my university and I felt pretty good about two firms in particular. However, none of the companies I spoke to offered me anything. Well, that sucks, doesn't it? Now I am left with no promising outlook on the future because I was really given the impression, especially from one of the two firms in particular, that I was going to receive a job offer. This was quite demoralizing to me and I have been questioning if becoming an actuary is the right path for me. I feel like if some company really wanted me, they would have offered me something. Now, despite the heavy demoralization, I do not want to give up. I enjoy the schoolwork and projects I have done and have met many people I like through my university's program. I feel like I would lose friends and let myself and family down if I were to call it quits at this point, especially having this upcoming semester being my 8th formal semester. My concern, though, is I do not know where to look for available positions, especially internships.

I firmly believe that the leading reason I did not make it past 2nd/3rd round interviews is because I do not have an internship under my belt. I did not qualify for any internships this past summer because I was still in very early classes in my university's actuarial program and I did not have an exam passed until May (being new to the program and all, I don't think this is really something that can be truly held against me at the time; if it were still the case that I didn't have an exam passed this close to graduation, then I'd see a problem). Anyways, as I was saying, I did not qualify for internships this past summer, but I do qualify for them for this upcoming summer. I just do not know where to look. My school has a website that allows companies to post open positions for internships and professional positions, but those are all long gone, finishing with the recruiting season on campus. I am just trying to find some help in where to look. I am in the Midwest and I am okay with travelling. If a position is open in another state and they offer some sort of housing or a stipend for living expenses, I am willing. I feel like if I do not land an internship for this summer, companies will see me next recruiting season as someone who either slacked off or as just overall unqualified and inexperienced (though the inexperienced will technically be correct). 

Though I do hope you read to understand where I'm coming from and fully understand my question:
TL;DR - I have two semesters left but no internship experience. I don't know where to look for available positions after exhausting my university's resources. I am worried I'm screwed. Help. Where do I look? What do I do?"

So I think now that I can plug a new device into my TV that will likely operate better than my 360 does, I might as well do so.

So now that I have a TV that will allow me to use Apple TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire Stick, or the Roku Stick, I'd like to know what everyone's thoughts are on what the best TV-accessible option of viewing the Network is.

I'm a 22/F. I have one semester left in my undergrad and graduate in early May. I then have a few weeks until my internship starts in June, so I figured it would be a great time to travel.

The problem is I really only have 2 people I would want to travel with (boyfriend &amp; best friend) and both of them are too broke to go.

When my mom found out I am planning to go solo, she freaked out, saying it was way too dangerous and what if I got robbed or sick and no one was there to contact them. We had a fight about it in which she and my father ""forbade"" me to go and I was flabbergasted because I'm an adult and do not need their permission. They do have a problem though where they seem to treat me like I'm still a teenager and they have agency over me (my mom will manage my investment accounts and sign off on things for me even though it's all legally mine). I understand they still pay for school for me, but I adamently refuse to be manipulated with money and would gladly take out a loan for my last semester if they attempted to do that.

My parents have always been somewhat overprotective/paranoid and they have kept me from some life experiences in the past. Now my mom says that she understands that I want to travel, so she will go with me as a compromise. Which still confuses me because I have no reason to compromise anything.

But for the sake of getting them off my back, I am at least thinking about it. The problem is that I wanted to do backpacking/hostel travel and I can't imagine that I could do that with my 50-something mother. I think she would be tired from the jet lag and walking around so much. Not to mention she is a bit embarrassing to travel with (my family went to Europe when I was 14. They wore money belts and had to unzip their pants every time we paid for something. I wanted to die).

Her other idea is for me to join some kind of tour group which.... just, no.

Does anyone here have experience travelling with a parent? Should I let her come with me, or should I hold my ground and go alone to show them that they cannot keep trying to exert power over me?"

I have no idea what I am doing with my life though. I have applied for a few jobs in the fall semester but I got rejected from all of them. Interviews for me are so incredibly stressful to the point where I just stopped interviewing and gave up. It also does not help that I have absolutely no self-confidence at all (pretty no self-confidence in any aspect of my life) pretty much to the point of self-loathing. I actually get very good grades (basically 4.0 GPA) but that is pretty much the only thing that I am good and it doesn't really correlate to being good at computer science interviews or being happy.

The extreme anxiety / lack of self-confidence that cause is a big part but it is not the only reason that I gave up interviewing. I don't really have much in my life (my family passed away before I started university) and my social anxiety causes me to have very few friends. In fact, after I graduate college, I am very likely to lose the only two friends that I have ever made (they are currently the closest thing that I have to family but that's probably not reciprocated since they have their own families etc.). I just feel that after I graduate, I will have nothing (no friends, no family) and since there really aren't many things that make me happy, it is hard to justify going through all of the stress of studying and preparing for interviews. I also do not want to ruin what is likely to be my last few enjoyable months of my life with that anxiety.

Hell, even if I got a job, I don't even know if I would be able to enjoy since my anxiety might make me feel uncomfortable in such a situation (I've had an internship this past summer and the experience was pretty horrible but it was also because they made me do nothing but menial tasks). There are other big problems that I need to overcome that make all this seem more hopeless that I haven't mentioned yet such as my lack of a driver's license (causes me way too much anxiety) or my anxiety around alcohol (I try to avoid any situation where alcohol is present). I don't see how I am going to overcome all of these things, especially after I graduate where I will essentially have absolutely no support system.

Once I graduate, I don't really know what I am going to do but at this point I just don't care and don't want to think about it. I have considered suicide at that point, or maybe just being homeless, but I really just feel like I don't care since from my perspective my life is over at that point."
2qpujz,15,2014-12-29,Why you shouldn't lie about your job,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2qpujz/why_you_shouldnt_lie_about_your_job/,"Last summer a friend and I did an internship on the same company after we finished our 2 year programming course. After 3 months the internship ended and we were told that they couldn't hire us at the moment but as soon as there was an opening they would call us.

So on the following months I kept studying on my own and my friend decided to join one of his friends and make a blog/magazine about anime/manga or something like that (a casual thing, not a full time job and with no revenue). This is relevant, because he decided to update his Linkedin account and list this as his job, something like Editor for X Magazine. 

I should note, that on this 6 months we've lost contact and I don't really know much about what's going on about his life.

3 days ago my old boss (from the internship company) calls me to set up a meeting for today to talk about a position. So today I went there, expecting to see my friend too (We were told they wanted the both of us on summer), but he wasn't there.

I went to the meeting and the boss just offered me the job, explained what would I be doing, salary etc. And then he explained to me why he didn't call my friend. He had us both as friends on Linkedin and monitored our profiles. Since my friend had been doing updated about his new ""job"", my boss thought it would be best not to tell him to not mess with his priorities.

So instead of having to compete for a job (Mind you, I live in Spain with a 25% unemployement), it just got handed to me because he lied on his profile.

2qq8lf,0,2014-12-29,I [22M] was just told by a coworker [20F] that she has had a crush on me since I started working here. Then she found out I have a girlfrI end...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qq8lf/i_22m_was_just_told_by_a_coworker_20f_that_she/,"I feel like some exposition is in order-

I have been with the same girl for four years. She is my first and only girlfriend thus far. We started out with a really casual relationship, just letting things go naturally. 

At first I didn't really realize how much I liked her at first, but now we've grown so close that I can't fathom life without her in it. She isn't the most beautiful or the smartest, but she's mine, and although it wasn't always like this, I know I always have her heart.

Until now, I've never known what it's like to be the object of a person's attraction, beyond my GF. I assume that some girls notice me since my GF has pointed out lookers in the past to me, but never have I been *pursued*, likely since they all see my sweetheart with my arm around her.

However at work this one girl has shown up who managed to get my attention. My standards for girls are absurdly high as to be unattainable (maybe 4 girls in my life have ever turned my head.) and most of the time I just shrug off any idea of romantic potential that any girls might have. I have many friends who are girls, but I can never imagine a relationship with any of them.

Back to work girl, who I'll call WG now. She started talking to me a bit in my first weeks on the job. I quickly realized we had a measurable number of qualities in common. I was immediately suspicious, because I'm a really introverted guy with a lot of unusual interests and from what I could see, WG was the type who clicked well with a different kind of crowd.

But WG and I would keep having brief exchanges between shifts and I started realizing that she might be interested in me. She'd playfully touch my back when she walked away, and sometimes call me things like ""sweets"". So I asked another coworker if they saw anything odd and they just told me ""WG is probably just a flirt. Don't sweat it.""

I decided the best thing to do would be to paint my girlfriend into WG's picture of me. That way if she were interested, I wouldn't have to hurt her by saying no straight to her face. As my GF began coming up in conversation, WG started flirting less, but she would still be exceptionally sweet to me when we talked. At this point, so much unspoken cat-and-mouse had gone on between us with so little being said, that I was determined to know the truth before we both finished our internship and went home, if only for my peace of mind.

With a week left in my internship I decided to do what I do best- just bluntly ask if she was interested in me. Surprisingly she immediately said yes, she was really interested in me, but then I mentioned my GF and she was sad.

I decided since had been so honest that I should be too- I told her that, in another universe where I had been single, I definitely would have asked this girl out. We genuinely had a lot in common and she was extremely beautiful, but I love my GF and I would never imagine cheating on her. I've seen my dad cheat on my mom and was even cheated on once myself. I know just how horrible that sting can be.

Right now I guess I'm just frustrated that I was right about WG. I imagine my girlfriend as my soul mate, we tell each other everything and can practically read each other's minds.
I think because I've been with her and ONLY her my whole life, I don't really know what else might be out there. Then WG showed up, and for the first time in four years I have actually asked myself ""Is my GF really the best person in the world for me, or are there 10 other WGs that might come around in the next 3 years?""

---   
**tl;dr**: Been with only one girl my whole life, thought it was as good as it gets, another girl showed me that I don't have much perspective on what kind of person is best for me."
2qq8vj,0,2014-12-29,On rewarding Alpha Behavior and having the social life you deserve and surrounding yourself with examplar people,[deleted],TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2qq8vj/on_rewarding_alpha_behavior_and_having_the_social/,"In the end we are treated the way we deserve to be and we have the social life we deserve too. 

You can know a lot about someone simply by looking at the people he hangout with.

You got cheat on ? Your fault for not being the best.
You got shitty friends ? Your fault for not having the social awarness to surround yourself with awesome people.

So today I was waiting at the bus station, reading my homeworks. Then I saw this tall algerian dude, he was good looking and quite fashionable, wearing white shoes and a motherfucking berret. He started to strike small talk with everyone waiting at the bus station, asking the time and whatever.

I immedialty said to my self "" Could he be a player too ? I like his attitude "".

And soon enough he talked to me too. And I discovered he was new in my city and doing great for himself (a phd in the best engineer school of my region and fresh out of the airport). 

For a little bit of background, I'm living in France and this dude who was algerian (this community is right behind the Gypsies when it come to bad rep') was super high smv and far from the stereotypes.

The dude was new in my town didn't know the cool place to hangout  but I had this feeling that he was high smv from his daring attitude, body language, and open mindedness and conversational skill.

 So I gave him my card and I'll introduce him to the international student party scene where I'm quite the alpha of my wolfpack (it took me a year to create a huge network of people from all around the world throwing the coolest party in my city).

And guess what ? I'll even introduce him to a lot of girls.

I'll be going abroad in a few month to do my last internship before having my master degree and I do hope I'll meet people as cool as me to introduce me to the places to be too.

It only took to this dude to say hello to a stranger at a bus station to be introduced into a cool social circle. So you guys go out too and approach people and play the number game. If you're not high enough smv for people to approach you and attract people in your awesome life, you've got to start from scratch and meet the right people by approaching. 

For some it could be seen as competition to introduce a high smv guy that could amog you in your circle. But I do believe that you've got to befriend powerfull people.

 High smv guys have the social awarness to realize that rather competiting for the pussies you should share. That's the best move and a win-win situation.

Isn't there a special law in the days of power that says that you should befriend your potential enemy ?

In my practical case it means surrounding my self with the highest smv people, because high smv attract HBs. And if you somehow controll all the pussy magnet in a given environment you'll get your share too.

What I did was an investment. Sure by introducing a good looking high smv guy in my circle he'll be able to plate some of my girls. But by having him around me, I'll also get to have access to his girls.

 In the past years working on my game I realized that young and fresh pussies are one of the highest form of currency in term of value in the social market. 

Everyone wanna hangout with someone who can get you laid, you can enter every club you want when you're surrounded with girls and know the right people. And my wingman skill and game are top notch. Social proof is everything.

On the short term I'll trade some of my HBs to have this high smv guy in my pocket and in exchange I'll have access to his network too. And damn does he got potential.

I might be wrong but I like risks and bets. And that's the daring attitude you've got to have with girls too. This guy could use me and steal some of my girls. But I don't care I've got many. And it's the same with girls too, you've got to take the risk to approach. Some of them could be the unicorn / RPW you're looking for.

Thanks for reading.

Tl:Dr :

- You've got the social life you deserve
- Surround yourself with high smv people because that's how you get to increase even more your social proof and attract the cool people and meet the coolest girl.
- Befriend your potential enemy and take risks

2qr8g8,2,2014-12-29,Early 30s. Finally got a book deal. Now falling apart.,walruspenguinduck,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2qr8g8/early_30s_finally_got_a_book_deal_now_falling/,"I feel like I just need some place to talk to other people. You know, because I feel like whenever I tell people I'm depressed, the overall reaction is ""how could you be depressed?!"" 

Some background. I'm early 30's, happily married, no children living in a large city- I spent a great deal of my 20s working hard writing on something that I (once, thought I...) felt passion for. Finally had some luck, and a publisher came to me about a book deal. They offered me money and I've been working with them for some time. It's in the non-fiction realm. And its exactly what I always hoped would happen...

...however, I just struggled with it an in immense way. I'm paralyzed by my own belief that I am utterly and horribly incompetent- and that it will all be exposed when the book comes out. I'm so depressed that I've entertained (over halfway through) just returning the money, bracing for a lawsuit, and waiting it out until it all goes away. And my mind is preoccupied with the incessant notion of finding an other way to get out. I would never describe myself as seriously suicidal, but its a background thought that seems to loom. 

Anyway, I'm seeing a therapist- but because I've gotten so good at faking(?) being outgoing and a competent human being, most of our sessions seem to turn into career counseling. I'm stuck in a city that means I need to keep a day job (which I also think I'm incompetent at, waiting to be exposed) because I have an immense amount of student loans from a Masters' degree (from one of the most prestigious schools in that field, to which I got a significant scholarship-) which I am not using in either my writing or professional career. I didn't even get a call back for jobs in that field despite finishing near the top of my class. I suppose having to work and not being able to work without salary in this city and do the requisite internships was more of a disadvantage than I thought....

I'm rambling a little bit. But put this altogether and I have this feeling of being trapped and that I am of absolutely no worth whatsoever. That I'm not good at anything and you're all going to find out. That you're going to find this on reddit, piece it together using complex clues based on my sentence structure and syntax, and use it as proof that maybe I really am a fraud. 

I've been depressed for a long time, nearly as long as I can remember. So I can in my public life acknowledge that there's evidence I'm not a fraud. and that I do have worth. But despite all that people say, that share- the evidence otherwise. I think I'm terrible and can't stand being/me.

I have no idea. Really, just suppose I need to say something and put it out there. I feel like I'm losing and unable to cope. and not even sure if there is an answer to my desire to sit here, and do absolutely nothing with my life whatsoever, except some perhaps self destructive things. Who knows? and this intense episode all seems to stem from finally achieving my goal: to get a book deal and to do what I want to do for a living. I feel like a complete ass. No, something worse for feeling this way about getting a book deal. Isn't this the dream? How can someone feel so bad for getting to do something few people get to do? I think this feeling has prevented me from being more open about how I feel. In my personal life, I don't think there's any sympathy for this struggle. I'm not sure I'm going to get any here. But I felt the urge to try. "
2qrqpe,1,2014-12-29,Advice for a lost soul,zektarstek,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2qrqpe/advice_for_a_lost_soul/,"So.. First of all hi!  

I'm new to this sub and I was hoping you could give me some advice about my situation. 

I recently moved out and started college this fall. Through a friend of mine I was reunited with a girl that once did a internship ship year at my school. She didn't interested me at the time but now that we met again she surprised me with her beauty and kindness. We made a really good connection and talked for hours the first time we saw each other again. 

She lives in a different city (hah!  Duh!)  but I have had the opportunity to go to her city a couple of times, she lives 2.5 hours from where I live. 
We met a few times more and I could say the connection we have is really strong but in a skinny love way. Through our common friend I know she said she doesn't want to have boyfriend or be in a relationship... She also started college recently and is very fixated with the idea of having very good grades. 

Like I said, I think it is still at a skinny love stage but I can see the fire in her eyes and how she looks at me and it's   almost like I had found my other soul mate... Sadly she is not the type of girl that you can chat with all day and all night long, making things harder. 

I need your advice because I would do anything to date this girl, I think I've fallen in love inadvertently and would be ready to travel each weekend to visit her. But I don't have the experience of long distance relationships plus I don't know if she would be ready to get in a serious relationship. 

Please r/longDistance, help me out, I would do anything for this girl! :( "
2qrrc2,2,2014-12-29,"I[20F] feel like I'm completely lost. I want to change several things in my life. Namely, how I deal with my friendships, romantic relationships, etc.[Personal Issues]",hadbeenthrown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qrrc2/i20f_feel_like_im_completely_lost_i_want_to/,"Quick rundown:  
-20F, upper-middle class, sophomore at flagship BIG10 university (3.4 GPA in liberal arts area, looking at internship and fellowship).

-Diagnosed with Asperger's at 10, anxiety disorder throughout my life.  Therapist and I are considering ADD-PI to add to that list (yay conditions!).  Have sought therapy throughout my life.

-Have had ~4 relationships in ~4 years, can never keep a single group of friends.  

I've always been socially awkward, and a bit of an oddball in terms of my humor, interests, and ways of interacting with people.  The Asperger's is the main function of that, but lately I've also been feeling emotionally unstable.  I have gotten much better at it in the past 2 years alone, but I feel like the ""natural""-looking part of it will never come to me.  I feel as if, while I'm finally developing the ability to socialize and hang out with people, that they don't like me.  I met a group of friends my first semester (Spring 14), and they seemed ok/cool/nice.  Mostly the active nerdy type, lots of arts (film, etc.) and comm. majors, and they like to talk about comic books, movies, etc. a lot.  Started hanging out with them towards the end of the semester (that semester was a wreck with a bad roommate, my anxiety disorder out of control, and grades).  Kept trying to hang out with them this semester.  But I feel like whenever I try to hang out with them, especially the more stubborn/headstrong girls of the group, I'm the awkward runt who never really fits in.  I don't know where to jump in on the conversations; they have all of these in-jokes and ways they all interact with that.  I feel like a total outsider.  It seemed to be going well at first, but now it's just......it feels really contrived and awkward.  Partially due to the not being there at first, but also because my lack of social skills.

But then there are the people that either want to hang out with me, or it feels like they're trying to fake being nice to me.  I keep pushing them away, even though, realistically, they're nice people, and they'd probably be good friends.  But instead, I keep either avoiding them because a) they're the *weird* kind of weird.  Which I probably am too, I just want to accept it.  or b) because it's like.......I don't know how to keep up with people.  How do you invite someone out to something?  Keep up conversation without sounding weird?  I usually talk to more people if they're in the caf, their rooms, etc.  I never actively seek out people......which is probably a problem.  I desperately crave them, but I have no idea how to.

I'm also super negative.  Like......I'm getting better at carrying on conversations about their interests, but what's pushing on my mind is the negative stuff, and I keep talking about that.  How I had a bad day at work, how my test sucked, etc.  I realize that's offputting too, but I can't seem to change the dialogue in my head.  I can also change moods depends on what happens, almost at the drop of a hat.

I also feel like I don't have stability with boyfriends.  I've been dating since 16, now 20.  I've had 4 boyfriends (depending on how you define it).  Yeah, young, experimental, whatever.  But it feels like I can't not have a boyfriend.  Let me explain.  I broke up with Addison in August, right before I came back.  We were getting irritated with each other, and I initiated it.  I start dating Finn in mid-September, even though I tried to tell myself ""I need to take time for myself"".  Admittedly, I'd mentally broken up with him in May and I'd known Finn for over a year, and there was a mutual attraction.  But I feel like........there's this pathological desire that if *I'm not with someone, then I feel so lonely*.  I'm not terribly clingy (I'd hope....), but I tend to focus my attention a lot more on my boyfriend a lot more than my friends, especially at first.  Finn is great.  He's sweet and kind, not bad-looking, but I feel this nagging sense of being able to do.....better, and it's not fair to him.  He's getting a research position soon, and he's been working on himself.  But I feel terrible because I want that guy who's hotter and has more of his shit together, even though Finn is on his way and absolutely kind.  He has depression, and doesn't have many college friends (he keeps in touch with some people from high school).

I've been feeling shit about that a lot.  I've also been overloading myself in work just to feel like I'm doing something.  If I'm not drowning in work, I don't feel ok.  Never mind the fact I can't start anything until last minute.  I pushed back voluntary research for over a month and a half because it had no actual deadline.  Nothing is done until panic, unless I have an inspired flash of energy and then I whip out something, though it's never what I actually need to do.

Yes, I have a therapist, but I feel like she was a great help in Spring Sem., but this past one she wasn't.  I need concrete solutions.  I feel like I have to keep up a certain expectation with her, that I'm doing fine/perfect, or whatever.  The problems feel shallow.  Idk.  Yes, I realize that's not the point of a therapist.

As a result of this and work,  I feel tired/burned out right now, even 2 weeks into break.  I feel like there's all this pressure.  I want the friends, I want the perfect internship, I want satisfaction.  But I have no ""legs"" to get it.
---   
**tl;dr**: More of a confessional than anything, but I feel completely dissatisfied with friends, boyfriend, etc.   I feel like I need to do better constantly, but don't have the motivation/means to achieve it.  There's probably not going to be a clear cut answer, but maybe someone who is/has been similar can offer advice?"

""You have a mouth, and you will scream.""

""A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

One of my cousins recommended a mansion at Saidapet accomodation comes to 4k for a single person excluding food and he told me to look around the internet for places at kandanjavadi,Perungudi and Thorraipakkam.

2qtmro,9,2014-12-30,Permanently closing the gap. Not sure if I'm getting cold feet or if I feel like my independence is being compromised.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2qtmro/permanently_closing_the_gap_not_sure_if_im/,"Hey everyone, sorry in advanced if this ends up being a long post, I'm just trying to give as much info as I can.


So my SO [M24] and I [F23] have been dating for two years. One year together in college and one year long distance when I graduated school and he finished his last year. My SO graduated college this December (yay!) and we've been discussing closing the gap for a while now, but we both decided it would be best for him to move up to me in NY.


My problem is, being long distance I can't help but constantly question wether this is the right decision or not, but the slightest thought of a break up almost has me in tears.


I just feel like a big step like this would be easier to make in the same state. It's hard to communicate on the topic over text or the phone or Skype. 


I know living with him wouldn't be too problematic since college I basically lived in his room and we were inseparable. He's very easy to live with, he's neat and tidy (would probably be getting on my ass about cleaning more than the latter) and we had our first few fights of our relationship (when he had a summer internship in NY and stayed with my family) and we were amazingly cooperative when resolving the issues in a timely matter. 

I just feel like sometimes I'm too much of an independent person to be moving so quickly. I don't want to be engaged until at least my late 20's (realistically until most of my school loans are looking smaller and I'm fairly financially stable/at a job I love.. Although my job with the bank is pretty spot on) and I know my boyfriend is so perfect for me and he's like my other half (I just lose sight of that being long distance and away from the immense amounts of love I'm showered with daily when I'm around the bf) but even like last night.. I was telling my friends he was coming here and we were going to move in and a friend said, ""oh so you're all hubby-ed up now?"" And that phrase just struck me with fear. I didn't even know what to say because part of me is saying, I love him so much I know I'll marry him some day but the other part of me is saying, you're 23! You can't be ""hubby-ed up yet!"" I mean I really really hate being ""that couple"" who's always together and you can't invite one without the other and all they do is just talk talk talk about their SO and all that crud. But once he's left his hometown to come here I'm all he has and we become that couple without even meaning to.

I just worry a lot (if you haven't figured that out yet) and I'm a planner.. I like to try to plan everything and not lose sight of my goals which is what's making this big step increasingly difficult for me. I love my boyfriend to the end of the world and back and I have no qualms about what our relationship will be once he's here because I know (for the most part) it will be sweet bliss. I just can't get these constant worries out of my head and I feel like I have no friends who understand.. 

So I turn to my fellow LDRers (if that's a word) I'm always trolling so ask any questions you feel I didn't explain throughly and I'll try to inform you in the best way I can. Thanks everyone here on this sub, I swear sometimes you keep me sane."

2qtyy6,10,2014-12-30,How to tell FSIL I've changed my mind??,KiwiF,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/2qtyy6/how_to_tell_fsil_ive_changed_my_mind/,"So when my FH and I were dating his sister and I talked about how amazing it would be if she designed the bridesmaids dresses, she's graduating with a degree in Fashion Design and her collections are really gorgeous. But as I've finalized who I want as bridesmaids I've realized that that is going to be very difficult. 

One bridesmaid is my oldest friend and lives in Texas, but she actually works as a clothing designer. While I'm sure she can obviously get her own measurements, I'm afraid that as a designer she might be upset to have a student design her dress. Plus she won't be able to fly to Alabama until the week of the wedding, so fitting would be difficult.

That brings in the Matron of Honor who is my older sister and lives six hours away in Mississippi working on her graduate degree and will also have a hard time getting fitted because she's doing her internship over her summer vacation.

Another bridesmaid also lives almost two hours away in the town where we met and went to college in and recently had a baby. She's not working so they don't have a lot of extra money to spend on gas to be making trips for fittings either.

Only one of the bridesmaids, the Maid of Honor, and the groomsmaid live in the same town. AND the FSIL doesn't live here. She lives in Tennessee and visits for holidays, birthdays, and other events.

So how do I nicely tell her that it's just way too much trouble?

TL:DR FSIL is in Fashion Design and offered to make BM dresses when FH and I were only dating and I agreed. Now that we're engaged and thinking about the wedding party I've realized it's just way too much of a hassle and can't figure out how to tell her."

We are approaching a new year, and at this time, I become reflective, not just of the past year, but of my entire life.

As I was reflecting today, it was difficult for me to not focus on some recent unfortunate events. A few weeks ago, I was nearing the goal that I set for myself that I would undoubtedly reach before Christmas. I was going to squat 300lbs. For a guy who only weighs 155lbs, this is a pretty big deal.  As I was mid-squat for 295lbs, I felt 2 sharp pains in my back. It turns out I herniated a disc in my upper back and I have a severe muscle strain in my lower back. I was so close, and now I am not sure if I will ever squat heavily again. This was just the start of a difficult month.

This week, I was beaten for an internship position that I spent months preparing for, and felt so confidently about securing the position after the interview. On top of this, I was also reminded this week about the girl that I loved throughout my teen years, lost my virginity to and managed to slip away in a summer that sent me into a crippling depression. I deleted my facebook account months ago just to get away from her, and she just recently asked a mutual friend how I was doing. My friend told me she is now married and has moved away, and that brought back some repressed feelings.


There are more things I could mention about what went wrong this month, but here is my point. This week has reminded me of everything I have lost throughout my life and what I continuously lose- close friends, girls, jobs...but it has also taught me something very valuable. I will never give up, no matter the circumstances, for one important reason. You guessed it- I don't give a fuck. 

I hurt my back. So what? It will heal. I didn't get the internship I wanted. So what? I will find another one. The girl I loved throughout my childhood is married now. So what? Quit being a loser and find another girl.

My advice for you today is this: embrace your failures. Keep failing if you have to. It's not so bad once you realize that failure or sadness or regret can be used as fuel for your success. Stop wishing things were different. Accept it and move on. This is why we are here in this sub. This is why you are reading this post. You don't want to care about things you shouldn't care about, or things that are completely out of your control. SO STOP CARING ABOUT IT.

I hope this is as cathartic for you as it was for me. "

Yeah the main villain was paper thin (Loki takes up a lot of airtime from the other villains in these movies) and Darcy and her intern were annoying, but I loved the atmosphere and look of these movies and its action scenes are right up there with the best marvel scenes. The Thor/Loki/Odin triangle is great to watch, and I loved seeing another infinity stone get introduced into the movie canon. Heimdall, Sif, and the Warriors Three while underused are great in the scenes they do get and the ending with Loki and Odin missing is a great set up for the third film in the series.

I'm back with more stories about Torch, our favorite professional victim. Last we saw of him in [Part Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/2qrs2b/the_karaoke_chronicles_part_2_torch_wants_to/), Torch hulk smashed a window at my favorite dive bar and disappeared for a month without so much as a word. Red and Flash just started dating officially and everything seemed peaceful in The Dive. But we know better than to assume things will stay that way.

A refresher of our players.

&gt; Red: Red headed college senior with brains and beauty. Head over heels in love with Flash who she has been officially dating now for two-ish months but had known for three years. Quiet and reserved but witty and very funny. Helps Flash run karaoke. Object of Torch's obsession.

&gt; Flash: Thirty two year old karaoke DJ and bartender. Currently trying to move in with Red and is adorably smitten with her. Dating Red.

&gt; Me (Ren): Best friend of Red, the hot sauce to her scrambled eggs (I'm from the south, it's delicious, roll with it) Currently seeing Glasses on a semi-regular/semi-serious basis.

&gt; Torch: Neckbeard in personality and sense of entitlement, not so much in looks. Fancies himself of a bit of a bridge burner, his side burns have now grown out and given him evil powers probably. Last we saw him he showed his first aggressive behavior by breaking a fucking window near my head and disappearing from the bar for a month without so much as a word.  

Minor Players

&gt; Joplin: Nineteen year old hippie chick who despite smelling like patchouli and weed all the time, is pretty chill and radical chick.

&gt; Glasses: Cutie hipster boy who likes me and I like him. Has glasses. Is cute. 

Setting: The Dive. My regular hangout spot in my college town.

**Let's get ready to rumble**

It's been a month since the window smashing incident and all of us regulars at The Dive foolishly believe we are actually rid of Torch. We're dreamers. Anyway, for weeks we have been holding our breaths to see if his lanky frame will cross the threshold and throw the bar back into madness. We're not even sure if Masshole, the Bostonian raised owner of the bar, will even let Torch back in after he punched and broke the front window of the bar. I finally convinced my semi-regular hookup Glasses to come to karaoke and watch me embarrass myself. It’s gonna be a good night.

However I'm running late to karaoke because of my internship. I get changed in the back of my car and end up meeting Glasses outside my place before we walk over to The Dive together. I'm kinda stoked that I get to flaunt Glasses around and nothing can really damper my mood. Until I get a text from Joplin.

&gt; Torch is here, he's with some girl I've never seen and he's standing on the dance floor instead of sitting in his usual dark corner.

Weird. Weird that Torch was in the bar. Weird that Torch was with an actual human female. Weird. All very weird. I put my phone away and cuddle up to Glasses as we arrive at the Dive. Sure enough, Torch is there with a girl on his arm and is standing right in the middle of the dance floor with her, in the line of sight of Red and Flash who are setting up karaoke on stage. Joplin and I meet up while Glasses leaves to buy himself an IPA. 

&gt; Joplin: You know what he's doing.

&gt; Me: Obviously. He's trying to make her jealous with some random girl.

&gt; Joplin: Does he know she’s doesn’t care?

We assume he probably doesn’t, considering Torch has shown no social awareness up until this point. We go on and on about the possible motives that Torch could have for bringing this girl to the bar. We of course assume that he has concocted another crazy plan to win Red over and vanquish Flash.

But there is a small part of my mind that thinks he might have moved on. It's been two months since Flash and Red started dating. It could be that Torch just didn't know how to handle his feelings and reacted because he was drunk. And maybe him bringing this girl is a gesture to show he's over Red and is going to leave things as they lay.

I *really, really* wanted Torch to be a normal dude.

Glasses comes back with a drink for me and we start getting drunk. The night is going very well. I sing Foreigner and only miss most of the notes while Glasses laughs at me from the crowd. I assisted a lovely Bachelorette party by taking their photos during their group song, and Torch is keeping to himself with no hiccups. 

Could it be? Is the bar finally at peace? Are we all finally acting our age?

...

No.

Of course not.

Torch's name gets called to sing a song and he walks up to the stage, preparing to sing. Until he grabs the microphone and makes an odd speech before his ""song.""

&gt; Torch: I know this is karaoke but this town lacks proper open mic nights, so I hope you all won't mind if I slow things down a bit and read you some poetry I've written about my favorite lady instead of singing her a song.

He whips out his iPhone and goes to what I assume is his blog of poetry. Chaucer himself is rolling in his grave as Torch begins to clear his throat and prepare for this impromptu poetry slam.

The bar is noticeably thrown off by all of this. Just the sound of some drunk dude reading poetry sounds terrible. But Joplin and I know about Torch’s questionable history and previous antics. Something tells the pair of us that this is more than a simple poetry reading. I grab another beer, bracing myself for this impending cringefest. Note that the Dive is in fact a *dive bar.* So we are used to some weird shit coming through the doors between the townies and the lofty grad students but this was still a bit out of left field.

Torch then begins to regale several poems about an aloof and mysterious girl he cannot wrap his head around. How her curves are ample and her smile is, shy, yet knowing. He commends her on her clinical approach to life and curses the God he doesn't believe in for making her just barely out of his reach.

The poetry reeks of 7th grade Live Journal and his writing skills are questionable. We know immediately he'd talking about Red based on the content of the poems and the growing look of confusion on his female guests face. Below is the only poem he wrote about Red that didn't have some sort of NSFW content in it. (The lines for which I'm getting directly from his blog, which he linked us all to after his performance and I still read to this day)

&gt; The existential crises of “am I some regret?”

&gt; A fair haired dreamgirl and I awoke in a night sweat.

&gt; How do friends like these have relationships like yours?

&gt; I’m in love with you right now as we were back then and it pains me to say as much.

&gt; Papers cuts and an origami heart. I bleed black ink over silken pages.

&gt; Kindness to you is a poison, let me give you the antidote.

When he finished, his performance was met with scattered applause. We realize that home girl that Torch brought to the bar with him is a DECOY. Which is first of all, that's fucked the fuck up to bring someone to a bar just to try and make someone jealous. But secondly, to read poetry about another woman while leaving her confused and upset in the audience? Not the nicest behavior coming from a self proclaimed Nice Guy ^TM

Red is uncomfortable, having just watched a drunken weirdo alternate between scratching his now growing out side burns and telling an entire bar full of strangers how he'd like to explore her body as if it were an ""untouched region of the ocean."" I don't care how much purple prose you use to talk about something like that, it's unconformable. She gets up from the table on stage and walks outside to smoke while Flash follows her to try and comfort her. 

I excluded a lot of the more intimate things he added about her body and the things he would do to it. Something about her skin being like creamy milk (so original) and him wanting to have sex with her while they travel the world together. But let’s just say Torch isn’t letting his mother read these poems. Or maybe he is, he does give off a bit of a Norman Bates vibe.

Torch brushes past his now confused female date and sees Joplin and I standing in the corner of the dance floor staring at him in disgust when he saddles up to the bar to get another drink. Glasses is confused by the entire situation and decides that he needs to wrap his arm around me as Torch walks over. Torch notices this protective move and casually tosses his head over in our direction and says,

&gt; Torch: Who's this?

&gt; Glasses: I'm Glasses, I'm here with Ren.

&gt; Torch: Wasn't asking you. Ren, who's this?

&gt; Me: He just told you.

&gt; Torch: So you let men talk for you now? That's oddly submissive of you. Didn't know you were spoken for.

*For the record, being referred to by Torch as submissive made my fucking skin crawl. I don't want him thinking about me in any sort of submissive position.*

&gt; Me: I'm not spoken for.

&gt; Torch: Good. If your taste in men is as good as your best friend's, he's probably an asshole. No offense.

Glasses grip on my waist tightens. I know that Torch isn't attracted to me, he's just being a jack wagon. But Glasses doesn't know that. He's trying to pull a power play while making sure I know that he thinks Red is making a mistake. I rub my hand on Glasses' arm to try and calm him down so nothing fucking stupid happens. I don't wanna talk to the police tonight.

&gt; Torch: Well Ren, sorry if my outpouring made you uncomfortable. But I've decided to stop keeping myself from the the things in life that make me happy. I'm not leaving The Dive. Get used to it.

Torch leaves. Glasses is pissed off and at this point thinks I'm the one that Torch was writing the poetry about. This is no doubt an attempt by him to try and stir everything up. He wants confusion and chaos in the bar because if he can't be happy, nobody is allowed to be happy. I spend the next few weeks trying to convince Glasses that Torch and I never had a thing (gross) and explaining the situation about Torch and Red to him.

Now that nothing is off limits to Torch and anyone is fair game to be mind fucked with, the group spends our free time wondering how the dynamic is going to change. First it was just Red, now he's trying to grand stand against any guy in the bar who is talking to a girl he knows. All while on a deliberate mission to play Cupid and break up any relationship he doesn't deem worthy, whether out of jealousy or just thinking he knows better.

We wouldn't get our clear answer about how far Torch was willing to go until another four months later, when Torch found a way to ruin my 24th birthday celebration at the bar."
2qv9j7,3,2014-12-30,[Discussion] The Shield talk,ColossalKnight,RandomActsOfGifting,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGifting/comments/2qv9j7/discussion_the_shield_talk/,"Welp, Christmas has come and gone for another year. This year, one of the ""movies"" I got is season one of one of my favorite TV shows. That show is The Shield. 

For some reason, I always think of [this Guns N Roses song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxn0KVl03Q) with the show.

So been spending the past few days writing and watching that. I've been a big fan of the show since back when it was still airing new episodes. Today I watched two episodes and was reminded of probably two/three of my favorite scenes of season one, all involving the character Dutch.

Dutch has always been my favorite character. (Yes, we all know it's coming so we might as well relax with me :p) Ratisan once said to me how she can tell I like to convey things using things like gifs and videos and songs and how she was like that too. I think that's how I am sometimes with characters from movies and shows or whatever...well of course I've talked about that before. I just like to sometimes relate things in that way or something. I remember last year with some people talking about this stuff..one guy said Hawkeye (from MASH) for him while one of my one or two characters included Dutch I could relate to to some extent or another, the other being the Misfits character I've talked about.

Like I love music and movies from 80's. Always have! Even wanted/planned on being a police officer at one point. Just things. You know how it is. lol.

***
***Assigned to the Farmington district of Los Angeles, Dutch is often the first called to investigate violent crimes due to his specialization in offender profiling and serial killers. Along with his partner, Detective Claudette Wyms, Dutch is widely considered to be the moral center of the show due to his willingness to do the right thing, in spite of the temptation to engage in illegal police activities.*** 

***Because of his unhappy childhood and his treatment as a pariah amongst his fellow detectives, Dutch carries around a great deal of bottled up anger that borders on outright rage. Occasionally, when he has been put through a great deal of stress or frustration, Dutch's containment of these emotions is unleashed, sometimes in very public outbursts.***

***In the first season, Dutch thoroughly interrogated and psychoanalyzed a man named Sean Taylor he suspected to be a serial killer. The man then did the same to Dutch with great effectiveness, dwelling on Dutch's lonely and awkward nature. However, in a private moment later that same night, Dutch broke down and cried due to the truth of his attacker's words.***

***Dutch appears to be a big fan of 80's music. On a blind date (set up by Claudette), The Strike Team catches him singing ""Hungry Like The Wolf"" by Duran Duran.  In Season 6, when taking Tina Hanlon back to his house for dinner, ""I Ran (So Far Away)"" by A Flock of Seagulls is playing in the background.*** 

***In the Season 5 premiere Extraction, Dutch nearly strangles to death a man who tried to push Detective Wyms over the second story railing of The Barn, and has to be physically separated from the attacker by Mackey.***



***For a long time, Dutch Wagenbach's only true friend was his former partner, Claudette Wyms. The two have a rather complex and symbiotic relationship: Claudette uses her emphatic touch to counterbalance Dutch's psychological means of solving violent crimes while Dutch is able to keep Claudette grounded emotionally, so as to prevent her from allowing her personal grudges and vendettas keep her from seeing the big picture towards their jobs as detectives.***


****

Two of my most favorite Dutch scenes are in the first season, one being the above mentioned deal with the serial killer. This guy was caught masturbating in an alley (which reminds me of the time I was a police intern at my university and I had to go stop the people masturbating in the computer lab) and later turned out to be the person who murdered this 14 year old girl in this case Dutch was really attached to who tried turning the tables in psychoanalyzing Dutch, basically hitting on his loneliness, low self-esteem and roughness with people. The whole time Dutch is like ""Yeah, whatever bud. None of that's true, I'll have you know. I may not be the most popular person, but got laid all the time in high school. And I'm dating someone who's hot. So there.""

Then later in his car, he broke down crying because it *was* true.

[My other was this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE1-s5xCbS0) Nothing grand, just him talking to another police officer, who he happens to kind of have a crush on, apologizing about his reaction from earlier in the episode. Basically he had to stop working on the case (the one he solved in the later above psychoanalytical scene) and kind of let his frustration make him get a bit snippy at her.

I think I've even said similar before lol

I always did love this show though. Sooner or later I'll get around to buying the other six seasons. I'd say the show is very possibly among my top five shows, or at the least definitely in the top ten.

So yeah. I'm hungry. Like the wolf.

I am currently in college, my girlfriend graduated two years ago from the same university. We currently live together and everything has been going quite well. We've lived together since early August. She has a full time job that she seems to enjoy, and is appreciated at, making 26k. 

I'm a senior, about to enter my last semester before graduating. I have the amazing opportunity to intern within the federal government in Washington DC for my final semester. While in DC, I hope to find a permanent position within the federal government, or related to my degrees- Economics and Political Science. I think I have a good opportunity to do so, and so does my girlfriend, especially with the internship I've accepted in the next two weeks. She has been wholly supportive of being away for the semester, and it will obviously be difficult for both of us to have distance. 

Job outlooks for me locally are pretty poor, especially with the nearly automatic promotions within the federal government if I am able to secure a position while interning. I believe job outlooks are quite reasonable for both of us in DC, and would like her to come with me if I got a job after graduating in May. 

I don't know that it's fair or reasonable to expect her to come with me, leaving her job ( just promoted two months ago) and her nearby family to come with me to DC. She doesn't know what to think either. On one hand we want to be together, on the other she was just given a new position in her company and would be moving 600+ miles away while only knowing one person in the new environment, myself.

Also of some consideration is our current lease expiring on July 31st. 

I can see myself being with this woman for the rest of my life if we can get through a couple more conversations about our lives together, which I think we would be able to do. Now may or may not be the time to have these conversations. I want one kid, in the past she's said she might be willing to have one child, but is overall anti-kid. Our sex life could be marginally improved. We agree on almost if not everything else important to me, and I think her. We're comfortable around each other, but I think I still need a little time to make sure I want to marry her. I think she would be a little less hesitant to move if she had a ring, or if she had a guaranteed job in place, both of which are currently up in the air. 

I don't know what to say to her and what our current plans should be. I know I don't want to live where we are forever, and she doesn't either, but I don't know if she's willing and/or able to leave her job and proximity to family to move across the country with just her boyfriend (albeit quite serious and nearly 3 year). I don't want to do long distance for more than the semester, potentially until the end of the lease, and am not willing to find a lower job to remain in the area for more time before I decide to marry this girl or not. 

TL;DR: don't know what to do with relationship with longtime girlfriend when moving across the country for a permanent job. 

Sorry for the long post, I can clarify or answer questions if I was unclear or omitted anything. Best!"
2qvkf1,1,2014-12-30,Really thought it'd work this time...,garret12289,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2qvkf1/really_thought_itd_work_this_time/,"I've been a lurker on here for a while, but now I've got to get something off my chest. Thanks in advance for reading.

3 years ago I met a girl at my internship. We became friends, we talked all the time outside of work, and eventually started flirting.

I can remember giving her hugs goodbye on train platforms as we went our separate ways. I should have kissed her then, but i'm shy and reserved.

Nothing happened during the internship, but we always talked about going out and really being into each other. After the internship ended we went our separate ways, but even when seeing other people we'd send the random text to see how each other were out of general desire to stay in touch. 

Two weeks ago we finally reconnected. She texted me out of the blue to see how I was (we're both single now), we flirted, joked, and caught up. She works in NYC so I went in that weekend to grab lunch during her break. (I don't live far at all from the city)

It was the best hour and a half i've had in a long time. We went to a casual place, grabbed some food, and spent the time catching up and joking around. She was so easy to talk to even after all the years. All my nerves went away. It'd be a lie if i said i don't have feelings for her, but I wasn't going to push it. I enjoyed being around her enough to just be friends. 

After lunch she walked me back to the subway and we said our goodbyes. Hugging her I asked when I could see her again. She answered, ""Soon."" Holding her there I looked in her eyes, felt an honest connecting, and took a chance. I kissed her and felt my knees go week. I had trouble letting go, but when I did she pulled me back in for another kiss.

After getting home we talked for a while on the phone. Again the conversation flowed so easily. She even made a point to say it was nice talking over the phone and that she really liked that I kissed her. 

The next day we talked casually about our days, more flirting, more laughing, and more happiness. We both said we wanted to see each other soon.

But of course all good things must end. I texted her a day or two after with no response. Laying in bed a few days later I got a text at 2 am. Telling me how her ex had some sort of surgery and asked to see her. She said he had hooked up with some girl and it took that for him to realize he wanted to be with her. I was crushed, but she also said she just wanted to leave there. I'm assuming nothing happened (who knows).

Days later I texted her ""merry Christmas"" to receive no response. I got a text this weekend saying she had a horrible week. Saying how she thought about everything, and she was sorry for leading me on. I responded saying I could understand. I've been through my share of ex drama and know how much it sucks. I asked if this meant we couldn't stay friends. 

She said she thought that'd be best. Since then I haven't heard from her. It takes all of me not to call her, or even text her. The connection I felt with her 3 years ago and then 2 weeks ago makes my head spin. I've been alone a while. I've been dumped, cheated on, taken advantage of, you name it, but she made me feel again. She gave me hope again.

I'm fine being alone. I've got great friends and family, but I feel like there's a hole in me. I haven't been able to get to sleep, and when I do my dreams are sad ones honestly. They've been of me waiting. Wherever I am in my dreams I just feel like I'm waiting for something or someone. 

I just wish I could see her one more time. To even be her friend. I'm just not the type to cut people out of my life, especially not people I connect with like her. I could be her friend, but it seems she doesn't want any part of me. Even if it's the last time, just to say how I feel about being her friend, my romantic feelings aside. Now I just feel empty… 

Thank you for reading, just needed to put that all out there..."
2qwaj6,3,2014-12-31,My heart problems recurred on Christmas Day after 20+ years with no problems,TRK27,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/2qwaj6/my_heart_problems_recurred_on_christmas_day_after/,"So first a little background - I'm in my early-mid 20s, and was born with the congenital heart defect TAPVR with ASD (basically the pulmonary veins were hooked up to the wrong side of my heart and there was a hole between the chambers, so that de-oxygenated and oxygenated blood mixed freely). I underwent life-saving open-heart surgery as an infant. I had regular check-ups with my cardiologist throughout my childhood, and was assured throughout that my heart was fine. However, the scar was still there, and it was sort of a perennial health boogeyman for me - between it and my family history of heart disease, I used to morbidly wonder if I would make it to 40. Yet still, nothing happened, and I thought that perhaps I had avoided it.

Then last Thursday, late on Christmas day, I noticed a slight ache in my left arm. The pain got worse, and, accompanied by a pins and needles sensation, it spread to my chest. My heart pounded painfully and uncontrollably. I was rushed to the ER, and thankfully, it wasn't a heart attack, but ""only"" supra-ventricular tachycardia (SVT). Eventually the doctors were able to get it calmed down, and sent me home with a bunch of beta blockers. 

Since then I've still been having a variety of symptoms, not all concurrent. Extreme tiredness, sweating profusely, muscle aches, a sort of sensation I can only describe as an ""electrical shiver"" in my left armpit and chest, a pins and needles sensation that starts in my left armpit then spreads across my chest and retracts back in the course of 2 hours... etc. 

I went back to the ER on Saturday night after being unable to sleep from the ""electrical shiver"" and what felt like rapid heart rate, only to be told that my vitals were 100%, my blood looked fine, and that what I had was purely nerves and panic. They prescribed me some Vistaril and sent me home. 

I have no closure. I still don't know what caused the SVT, nor the recurring symptoms, which persist regardless of my mood (ie, they're not from panic attacks). Today I woke up at around 11 AM, and by 4 PM I was exhausted and drenched in sweat despite having done nothing more than go downstairs, eat lunch, and then browse the internet. I can't walk up three steps of stairs without having to pause to catch my breath.

So I'm sitting here about to try to go to sleep with a largely undiagnosed heart problem, wondering if I'll wake up tomorrow. But in a larger sense, what this means is that I can no longer really rely on my heart. What does that mean for my academic and professional career, going forward? I had lined up an internship abroad this summer, will I still be able to do that? Will I be able to enjoy old age, or will I die at age 51 from a heart attack like my grandfather did? Or at age 63, like my other grandfather? 

I've been trying to play it cool these last few days, telling myself that all I have to do is survive the day, act normal, distract myself from things that make me anxious... but AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

2qwg9u,1,2014-12-31,I don't know what I want anymore,Altocount,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2qwg9u/i_dont_know_what_i_want_anymore/,"Apologies as this is my first time posting.

I guess I've never really known what I wanted. I've been struggling with depression for almost four years now. Four years seems like nothing compared to how long a lot of other people say they've been depressed. And yet, I've barely made it to where I am; I can't imagine how you people are making it through 10 years, 20 years, or even the rest of your lives.

I'm in my second year of college now. Senior year of high school and the first year of college were near unbearable. Throughout the entirety of those two years I had been planning how I was going to die. Everyday, I woke up and was either thinking about nothing at all or how I was going to die. Along comes the summer and I end up doing nothing with it. I wasted all my time everyday sleeping until 4 in the afternoon and staying up till 6 or 7 in the morning playing games. All the while my parents were saying how I need to do something, how I need to get an internship or a job, how I need to not be sitting at home all day everyday. Lo and behold I don't find a job/internship.

My second year of college started off about the same (if not, worse) as the first year. Sit around, play games, do nothing, struggle to go to some classes. Then some fucking how something started happening between me and one of my few friends, we'll call her Q. Long story short, Q and I decided to try the whole dating thing. All the while, every night, I lay in my bed telling myself that dating Q is the worst thing that I could do right now. I'm struggling with keeping myself afloat. I skip classes, I sleep most of the day, when I'm not sleeping I'm playing games, I don't do anything with anyone outside of class, and I don't even want to live. Dating Q while I have all of these ""issues"" just seemed like a terrible idea. Why should I bring someone else down with me? Eventually I told Q about my depression and a lot of what's happened over the past couple years. Q told me that she would help me, that she wouldn't think less of me or anything.

I guess that in general, I've felt a little bit better having Q around to help me with just being ""normal"". I actually went out of my apartment instead of sleeping or playing games. I didn't feel like a complete waste of space all the time anymore. Who am I kidding though? While I wasn't feeling as shitty as I normally did, that didn't mean that my world was suddenly fucking rainbows. Most nights I still struggled with my suicidal thoughts and there were still days where I just felt like complete shit. But those shitty days were not as often now.

Anyways, fast forward to the end of the semester, and we're all home from school. Q actually doesn't live that far from me, as a lot of the people that go to my college live around my area. Q and I still get together and hang out and meet our respective friend groups. Considering how poorly I handle social situations, meeting all of these new people was among the most terrifying things that I've ever done. But, one way or another, I met everyone.

Today, Q wanted to talk about some things that had been on her mind regarding our relationship. Every point that she brought up was very valid and it all just destroyed me inside. Throughout these past couple months I essentially had been doing all of these things that she eventually realized were ""hurting"" her in some manner. Whether it was that we spend too much time together, or that we might be moving too fast in some regards. Realizing how much I messed up is just making me feel absolutely terrible. All of this led to me reconsidering everything about my life choices this past semester. I just don't know if I'm really capable of being in a relationship while I have this depression constantly hanging over my head. I keep failing to give people what they want and every time I realize how I failed, I just die a little bit more I guess. I can't take it. I just don't think that I have what it takes to be a ""normal"" human being that lives life and interacts with all these people. I would much rather just curl up and sleep all day for the rest of my life. I just don't think its fair for me to keep dragging Q along this terrible path that I seem to be walking when there's another perfectly good path for her to walk down instead. 

I honestly don't really know what I'm talking about anymore. This is pretty much the worst I've felt in really long time and I just had to vent all of this out somewhere. If you managed to get all the way down here then I truly thank you for reading my poor excuse for writing. I'm also sure that I've forgot plenty of important things that would probably help this make more sense. But I don't really know what else to write. Thanks for reading."
2qwjd1,2,2014-12-31,"Email: Hey mom, about this internship",zombieauthor,SecretSubreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretSubreddit/comments/2qwjd1/email_hey_mom_about_this_internship/,"From: Intern729

To: AllOffices

This place is an insane asylum. A well funded and well-staffed insane asylum. I'm three days into my internship. The only thing I've learned so far is that anything is possible within these walls... that is why you always have to watch your back.

For example, I woke up today and was going to grab a bite before my shift in the Communications Department. I had a calm walk to the mess hall. The hallways were quiet except for the gentle buzz from bars of ultraviolet light. My slow trudging was echoing off the cold pavement as I strolled passed doorways to various labs. Each door labeled with bright yellow letters announcing their specialties and sectors. I'm pretty sure I even heard someone snoring as I weaved down one hallway and up another.

Still wiping the sleep away from my eyes, I rounded the corner to the mess hall.

Except it wasn't there.

The entire mess hall is nonexistent.

Large broken chunks of concrete littered the area. Some of the bigger slabs looked like they had black scorch marks on them. The entire scene was glowing and pulsating with a purple energy field. I'm sure the field was there either to protect people from the blast before it happened. Maybe the field was there to protect people from something that might have tried to escaped after.

Neither would surprise me at this point.

At this point, a tall fellow with graying hair was walking past me from the other direction. The man was wearing large tinted goggles on his face, and he had what looked like a large high tech drill mounted on one of his arms. He must have noticed the look of shock on my face because he paused a second. Looking from the remnants of the mess hall and back to my face before raising his goggles to look at me with his cold dead eyes. After a minute he remarked, ""If our rite of virtue won't get us into heaven, then we shall celebrate in hell!""

Defeated, and now a little confused, I resigned myself to going into work early. I happened past an open doorway with one man screaming threats to another who was begging for his life. Looking in I saw a scene that will haunt me for the rest of my days.

Tubes and coils seemed to have exploded from the walls and taken up residence in all corners of the room. One man was strapped to a desk chair his hands lashed behind his back as a man in a white labcoat held a knife just under his neck. He was shouting down at the other man with rage, ""knife skills are essential in cooking!"" Dwarfing this scene was a large robotic head perched above. It had lasers emerging from tentacles off of its monstrous face. The lasers seemed to pulse and fire off in random directions as the tentacles flexed. I didn't know what this was but I had enough. Somehow, I had finally found an ounce of courage and rushed into the room with my hands up begging for them to stop this experiment.

The man in the labcoat stood up shocked at my sudden presence then cleared his voice before asking, ""Experiment? You think this is a science lab?""

My eyes drifted up to the giant robotic head firing lasers as I nodded.

The man in the labcoat coughed, then leaned forward again pressing the knife to his victim's throat. His victim squirmed a bit before lab-coat guy added, ""No no... this is the finance department.""

What the fuck have I gotten myself into?

Did I even mention the vents? They talk. They whisper nice things to me, trying to invite me into them and sometimes they ask for cookies.

If you remove the fact that the voices are coming from the vents it almost sounds pleasant. Except I'm sure whatever is whispering promises through that voice is planning to murder me.

I don't even know my job, and I'm PRETTY SURE that most of the folks here aren't well versed in science. The scientists seem like they just woke up one day and decided what lab they were going to work in. What (or whom) they were going to experiment on and then they were granted a massive amount of doomsday technology to do just that. I'm almost certain most of them just succumbed to insanity and decided that they'd use and abuse this system to combat their own demons. I meant that figuratively, but there could also be actual demons here. 

I hope I addressed this properly, mom. I haven't been given training in the communications department yet. Getting emails outside of the intranet seems tricky.

Your son,
Untrained Communication Array Specialist (Stan)"

2qyibp,61,2014-12-31,"The Karaoke Chronicles: Part 4, Torch goes out in a blaze.",[deleted],neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/2qyibp/the_karaoke_chronicles_part_4_torch_goes_out_in_a/,"Greetings y'all. We're at the end of our saga with Torch but of course, no saga is complete without someone having their birthday ruined. Last time Torch made his triumphant return to the Dive in [Part 3 ](http://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/2qv9c0/the_karaoke_chronicles_part_3_torch_fancies/)and forced a bar full of people to listen to his self indulgent prose poetry about Red before grand standing that he wasn't going anywhere.

Here are all those affected by Torch and his actions.

&gt; Red: College senior and self proclaimed X-Files aficionado. Dating Flash and only having relationship problems because of Torch trying to break them up. My best friend.

&gt; Me: College senior and self proclaimed slacker of the century. Support system to Red who is currently going through terrible times at the Dive, where we both now work part time. Torch is making both our lives hell.

&gt; Flash: Thirty two year old boyfriend of Red and karaoke DJ. Isn't hip to our young person drama and is being an old man about all of this. Wasn't sure what Twitter was, thought Tumblr was a sex thing. Trying his best to keep Red calm through all of this. 

&gt; Torch: After (maybe) selling his soul to Satan, has gone from professional victim neck beard loser to full blown monster powered by Mountain Dew flavored vodka and rage. Drinks too much at the bar and has really let his hygiene go. Tries to fight anyone he can to try and establish a reputation of being tough at the Dive. Has a reputation for trying to make anyone uncomfortable he can at the Dive.

Minor Players

&gt;Joplin: Hippie stoner chick, unfortunate fan of the Boston Bruins ^^^but ^^^I ^^^forgive ^^^her ^^^anyway

&gt;Glasses: Cutie hipster who thinks I’m cute. Is cute. Do like. 10/10.

Setting: The Dive, four months after the poetry incident.

**Ba boom. Let's rock**

In this story I'm turning twenty four! *Throws confetti.* My birthday is in the hot, hot month of June which means day drinking and no classes or internships. It's the first birthday of mine since I started college that I have a day to actually celebrate, so Red and Glasses decide that they are going to make sure it is a special one. Glasses takes me out for brunch and we start day drinking at my house and whatnot, all gearing up for karaoke that night. I'm looking pretty cute. I have a new red dress and my hair is actually cooperating today. 

Over the past few months Torch has been a slow brewing storm. When he can’t find Red to drunkenly try and pine after, he enjoys finding myself and Glasses and trying to pick a fight. He’s even gone so far as to spread a rumor that he and Joplin used to sleep together when she started bringing a new guy around the bar. Thankfully both Joplin and her dude are always way too stoned to care.

Torch has evolved. When we first met him he was a whiney Beta who nearly threw a temper tantrum because Red wouldn’t date him. Now he has abandoned his Nice Guy ^TM act and decided to be a borderline sexual predator. It’s gotten so bad that I won’t stand alone in the bar without another friend or Glasses by my side because Torch will find you and pull some 80’s movie bully bullshit on you. Red doesn’t leave Flash’s side and Torch has even managed to scare off some of the long time regulars with his antics. 

It should also be mentioned that I am now a part time employee for the Dive as the door girl, and Red is a bartender is training. Flash hooked us up with jobs. So our usual tactics against Torch are no longer options because he is a customer and we are technically employees. There's no telling him off, ignoring him or even making bitchy comments while in the Dive when I'm on the clock. A fact that Torch has been taking full advantage of. His most inappropriate comments towards myself and Red come on nights when we're working so we can't say anything back. It blows.

So we get to karaoke and Flash has decorated the bar and even bought me a little sheet cake from the grocery store. The Dive is small and the regulars are really tight knit so it was chill to have them surprise me like that. Torch shows up and wishes me a happy birthday, to which I reply with a standard 'thank you' because I'm not about to stick my head into a lions mouth. Anything other than a thank and you might put him into a rage. It’s my birthday and I’m hoping we get the mild version of Torch tonight. Or at the very least, that he leaves me alone.

I'm not working the door tonight and Red isn't behind the bar, so we all start drinking. Soon we're drunk. We're karaoke-ing. We are getting down on the dance floor. Sheet cake was a great plan because drunk people love food and everyone is complimenting my dress and being real sweet. Then Torch gets called to sing his song and that nervous feeling I get whenever he's just around hits me. Now what? What is he going to do? Is he going to make us suffer through another poetry slam? I’m almost expecting him to get on stage and give a speech about the friend zone and how bitches only date assholes. The guy is a loose cannon.

Torch sings 'Invisible' by Clay Akin, you know, the one about watching women in their bedrooms? The entire time he’s doing this weird hip swivel and his mouth is so close to the microphone I’m afraid he’s going to try and deep throat the thing. It's grossing me out. Glasses and I excuse ourselves to go smoke outside because I'm afraid to even make eye contact with him while he's putting on his little show. When his song is over he gets off the stage and walks over to the bar. I come back in and get called up to sing my favorite song. Mr. Brightside. It's my birthday so they're letting me sing whatever I want and I am taking full advantage. I’m on stage, doing my little dance and singing this song as though I’m all torn up that my girlfriend is sleeping around. I’m a regular Brandon Flowers y’all.

Then out of the corner of my eye I notice something happening on the dance floor. Red, Torch and Flash are all converging in the center right in front of the stage. It's a perfect storm. It looks like the climax in the movie. It's like the Sharks and the Jets are meeting for the final time. 

This next part is dicey because the only thing I have are visuals of what I saw. I didn't actually hear the exchange because I was too busy bringing the house down, but here's what I witnessed. 

Red, walking over to Torch and getting in his face about something, I'm assuming the creepy fucking stalker song he just sang about her.

Flash, standing behind Red and eventually moving her behind him before he gets in Torch's face to give him the business.

And Torch, screaming back and then **punching Flash in the face.**

This isn’t your typical one-two hit. It was a bitch ass move. Torch waited until Flash wasn’t paying close attention and clocked him once right in the eye. I don’t get in many fights but I think the other person should know that’s where the situation is going before you try and cause someone Ocular Trauma and possibly fucking blind them for life. Or maybe just don't fucking hit people because it's rude but whatever.

I stop singing and get off the stage to see what is happening. Masshole, the Bostonian raised owner of the bar, flies over before I can figure out what happened, and before Flash can get back on his feet to wring Torch’s neck. Masshole grabs Torch by the shirt, pulling him out of the bar. We all gather around the windows and door like children watching the first snow of winter. And what we hear is music to our ears.

&gt; Torch: He was asking for it.

&gt; Masshole: You went too far this time. This is a business. You're not welcome anymore.

&gt; Torch: You'll lose business if I leave the bar and find a new spot.

&gt; Masshole: Yeah and I might just get back some customers you keep scaring off. Get lost Torch, if you come back to the bar, I'll call the police and have you arrested.

Torch leaves the bar and pauses outside the window he'd broken a few months earlier. He looks like a caged beast. For months we'd all put up with him running the show but now he was finally and officially banned from ever coming back to the bar. I wish I could say I acted maturely in the face of all of this but I didn't. Torch has his fists clinched and we're all sitting on the inside of the bar waiting for him to give his grand finale.  

He gulps in a big breath of air and starts screaming at the top of his lungs. Note, we can hear what he's saying from inside because people have cracked the door to get a view of his meltdown.

&gt; Torch: I don't even need this bar. I don't even LIKE this bar. You're all the lowest common denominator of human scum. 

He points to Red.

&gt; Torch: You're a temptress and a whore. Fuck you Red. Fuck you and your fucking rapist boyfriend. I hope he rapes you. Then you'll know what I was talking about. You'll know I was right about him being scum. And I won't help you when he hurts you. I won't let you cry to me. Fuck you. You fucking deserve it.

He points to me.

&gt; Torch: You're a spineless bitch. You run your mouth behind everyones back and pretend to be their friend. Fuck you. Have fun being the less hot one. Nobody wants to fuck you. You're going to die alone because you're an ugly, mean spirited cunt.

He points to Flash:

&gt; Torch: And *you.* Take her! I don't want her anymore. She isn't worth the effort. You won by being an asshole and mistreating her. Society wins again and the jerk who rapes people somehow gets the girl. Good job. I hope she cheats on you. I fucking hate you.

Torch goes to say something else but by now Masshole has walked outside with the police dialed and Torch has to leave. He stands there and I wonder for a second if he's going to try and punch the window again. Instead he huffs out one last breath and takes off down the street, into the night. And we never saw him again. 

Glasses was pretty bummed that Torch didn't say anything about him because he was curious. Joplin was pretty sure that Torch would've just ragged on her for smoking pot. And despite the fact that my birthday is now ruined, there's an odd calm in the bar. For the first time in months there is no sneaking around to avoid people, no watching what we say, no hiding in the girls bathroom to avoid him. There's just calm. 

I still haven't seen Torch to this day and I'm not holding my breath. But that's the end of how Torch almost ruined my favorite dive bar. And on record, Flash is not a rapist. Torch was just trying to rustle some jimmies and decided falsely accusing someone of rape was the way to do it. 

I'm glad you've all enjoyed this and read it. This has been pretty therapeutic to do. And my only advice is if you've got a neckbeard in your life and you're thinking about writing about him/her, do it."
2qylhl,3,2014-12-31,"Finally left my job, aaaaand now I'm sad",puddle_stomper,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2qylhl/finally_left_my_job_aaaaand_now_im_sad/,"Today, the last day of 2014, was the last day I spent at my university office tech support job of almost 3 years. From the time they interviewed me, they knew I wanted full-time work, but the position was only part-time. The department director met with me multiple times over two years to discuss creating a full-time position for me. I worked harder, hoping to prove that I deserved it. They kept giving me more and more responsibilities. By Spring of 2014, I started to realize that I was being strung along the entire time. There would never be a full-time position for me, and the only person making less money than me was one of the interns. I never had a raise during my entire 3 years there.

So when I was offered a full-time position in another department, I was elated and accepted it immediately. I was happy to leave a place that didn't care about me, that didn't appreciate the hard work I put in. I sent my letter of resignation and worked my last two weeks (actually last one week since I had already planned my holiday vacation).

Today was my last day. I realized that some of the people I worked with (you know...the ones who were just doing their jobs, needing my tech support, and had no power over how much money I made, how much work I was given, or the fact that I was still part-time) were possibly my closest friends. Two girls specifically were people I was happy to see and talk to every day. We were often all assigned the random menial tasks together like moving filing cabinets or organizing things that others had messed up, and we got along really well. We were close friends at work but never hung out outside of work. I talked to them every day, and we knew more about each other's lives than I know about any of my few non-work friends.

And now I won't get to talk to them every day. We will try to keep in touch and try to get lunch together occasionally, but it will never be the same as seeing them every day. (Reminds me of a quote from Buffy: -""Yeah, but he's in your life. He gets to be there when I can't. Take your classes, eat your meals, hear your jokes and complaints.""_)

i spent 3 years building a great relationship with a select few people at this job, and now it's done. It's hard for me to make new friendships. I'm going to feel very alone in a new building with new co-workers (or i guess I should really just call them ""users"" since I won't ever work directly with any of them). The new job will really help me grow professionally, and it seems like a really good environment, but change is really rough. The reality of it is just starting to set in, and I am getting ready to spend NYE with friends that I don't know as well as my work-friends, though I won't be able to stop thinking about the fact that I will rarely see the people I felt closest to in the future.

I know this is somewhat melodramatic. Maybe writing it out and realizing how sobby it is will help me realize that it's going to be just fine. I know that if anyone reads this, they will probably think, ""It's not like anyone _died_ or anything!"" But change, friendships, and goodbyes are difficult for me. At least I did a great job of not showing that throughout the day. "
