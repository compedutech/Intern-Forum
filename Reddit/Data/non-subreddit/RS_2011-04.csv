[This is my wife.](http://imgur.com/vorYr) She’s an intern at a local art gallery in Lansing, MI. The owners told her she could have the month of April to put together an exhibition. She chose to feature her fellow alumni and faculty from the art school she attended. On top of her day job as a middle school art teacher, she poured herself into this project, making phone calls and trips all over the state to pick up pieces to include in the show.

Now, some key people who were *supposed* to help her out have made it clear they don’t believe in her, even telling her not to get too upset if ""nobody comes to your little show."" Let’s prove them wrong!
If you’re in the Lansing area, or know anyone who is, please consider stopping by and showing her some support.

It’s free! And there’ll be food!

Here’s the info:
Sat, April 2 from 6-10pm
Gallery 1212, Turner St, Lansing MI 
(in Old Town)

**Edit:** The quote above isn't meant to encompass the entire situation, of course. This has been an ongoing thing for a few weeks now, and in the meantime they haven't followed through on almost anything she was counting on them to do to make the exhibition successful. Whether you think they're ""real"" haters or not, it's a pretty crappy situation and she could use someone in her corner. Not asking for any nasty emails or anything, just if you happen to be in the area, maybe swing by and take a look."

I am a rising senior at JMU and am currently enrolled in the SMAD program (School of Media Arts and Design) with a converged/interactive media concentration. So far, I have been taught basic css and html, some experience with photoshop and dreamweaver, and that's it. Within my course studies I will touch lightly on Java and flash, but that seems to be all that is covered. It seems to me that every internship, much less job, has a LONG list of programming languages/softwares that I need to learn or be familiar with in order to be considered for a position. I am most interested in the coding side of web design (back end) because I am not a graphic designer. I can set up a nice layout and edit in photoshop but have no artistic talent for graphic design. I get the feeling I should have been a computer science major, but it's too late...or I may have to consider getting a bachelor in science for a cs degree, which would mean starting all over when I only have 1 year left to get my BA double majoring in SMAD and English. I just don't know what to do!

Please, tell me if you know what the best options I have are. The things I'd like to familiarize myself with are:

- HTML 
- CSS 
- PHP 
- Javascript 
- AJAX 
- ASP.NET 
- MySQL 
- Joomla 
- Drupal 
- WordPress 
- Adobe Photoshop 
- Adobe Dreamweaver 
- Adobe Illustrator 
- Adobe InDesign 
- Adobe Fireworks
- Flash
-JQuery
-C++

Also, just to give you a reference of what I can do (not much)...here's the only web site I have designed so far. This should give you an idea of my amateur level of knowledge and help you steer me in the right direction hopefully. And please bear with me, I know it's cringe-worthy...

http://www.countrykids.biz

I just don't know where to get experience with these. I know a lot of it can be self taught, but I do so much better with a structured program. Does anyone know of online courses/distance learning with a good university that could help supplement my BA degree in Media Arts and Design? Or do you have any other suggestions for me? Your help would be greatly appreciated."

I am interested in interning at (psychological research organization) over the summer of 2011. I learned of this opportunity through a current research assistant at your organization, Derpela Herpette.

My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with a broad range of expertise in disciplines that closely parallel the requirements of this internship.

A high level of concentration and excellent organizational skills have helped me achieve a strong academic record at HerpaDerpa College which reflects my diligence and commitment to success. Rigorous liberal arts courses and a concentration in psychology—involving in-depth research and analysis—have provided me with sharp analytical, problem-solving, and research skills. I have also developed research skills in a different capacity by compiling and analyzing data in Experimental Psychology and Statistics courses.

Furthermore, my academic career has been complemented by my diverse professional career. My tenures at Herp City Council, Law Office of Attorney Herpen Derpowitz, Derp LLC, and Herp Inc. have required me to interact with people on a day-to-day basis in both formal and informal settings—which has helped me develop strong interpersonal and communication skills.

This internship would provide me with an ideal opportunity to assist your organi­zation, and to expand the breadth of my knowledge and experience. I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to your organization, and I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

I'm a graduating college senior finishing with an engineering degree and pretty much starting last semester I started to despise my choice in getting an engineering degree.  The only reason I chose engineering was for the job security and I somewhat had an aptitude for math and science but now after some internships I realize that for the next 30-35 years I'm going to be behind a desk, doing shit that I don't enjoy, just so I can have a steady income and because my parents were proud that I chose the career path that I did.  Also, I know as a salaried position you put in more than just a straight 8 hour workday and it pisses me off to know that I won't be able to leave after my 8 hours is done.  Additionally, I've taken a strong interest in the arts whether it's cinema or theatre, since I've been in college, I wondered if it had something to do with an emotional output, but I really didn't know.

I can't help but thinking about Fight Club and Tyler Durden's saying, ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.""  If I could say ""fuck it"" to having a full time job and find something I like I would, but the things I enjoy doing are not profit making activities.  I feel what I ultimately lack is a goal in life.  Every morning I wake up and get out of bed, it's not because I want to, it's because I have to.  

And then there's the problem with attracting the opposite sex.  I feel like when I engage in conversation with a girl,  I can't actively enjoy the conversation without passively thinking ""is there more to this"" or ""should I make a move"".  Whereas  if I talk to a girl with no ulterior motive I enjoy the conversation, but miss an opportunity to possibly make something more than just an acquaintance.  And sometimes I'll think back and remember how the girl I was talking to was really smiling and enjoying what I had to say, I should have gotten her number.  And when I do get a number, there's texts back and forth but when it comes to setting things up, there's always an excuse for why she can't make it out and it's usually multiple times, which I've internalized and stopped pursuing girls.  This inability to just simply connect with people has left me feeling really lonely.  I can have base conversations and idle chit chat with people, but to truly connect doesn't happen, I don't know if this is just due to inexperience or if I'm just being blind and not taking a leap of faith.

I don't want out of a relationship someone simply to answer my problems and take care of me; but for me getting to know someone on an intimate and personal level is what I desire.  I've never had a relationship at all on an intimate level with a girl and as I grow older it's the one thing I truly fear will never happen. "
gih74,0,2011-04-04,SEO Intern Needing Help with Family Run Site,HarbingTarbl,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/gih74/seo_intern_needing_help_with_family_run_site/,"First time poster here, anyway I have a few questions about SEO.

Right now I am working as a paid SEO intern at a small family run website, www.stretcher.com, we focus on articles that deal with anything from how to cook to finding cheap car insurance, but the main idea behind most of our articles is how you can become more frugal and spend less money. I started working for them about the same time the semester started and I have been trying to help get their site to show up higher in the search results but lately (Partly due to the new “farmer” update) I have found it near impossible to fix the site. 

A little background, I am a college student with an AS who knows almost nothing about SEO, I have been learning what I can from online courses as well as articles/blogs/youtube but I am still very inexperienced when it comes to improving a sites search ranking. Why would I apply for an internship in SEO if I knew nothing about it you ask? Well they kind of asked specifically for someone like me, someone with little to no SEO experience who would, as they put it “Learn on the job”.

The farmer update hit us really hard (We went down 45%), while we have been working to get back to where we used to be, I’m wondering if it’s even possible. 

I think one of our major problems is our high bounce rate, at the moment the average bounce rate is around 85% for the entire site and I am honestly not sure how I could improve it. Right now we are trying to manually add “Related Content” sections to each article that is still doing well after the update, but with over 7500 articles it’s going rather slowly. 

I have also read about how Google (and people) generally don’t like waiting around for a web page to load, and that our long load times (an average of seven seconds per page) might be causing us to lose traffic/be ignored by Googlebot, is this true?

Currently we are working on just putting keywords and re-writing each individual page in an attempt to improve our ranking, but I honestly don’t think that’s our biggest problem. 

If someone could give me some suggestions as to how we could improve our ranking it would be appreciated, I know we could try getting some links into the site but they (the site owners) doubt how effective it would be and would rather have me sit here for hours rewriting articles.

I'm in a tough situation and need help making a decision. I have the opportunity to choose between and internship at IBM and an internship at NASA this summer. I know I'm in an great situation and probably can't go wrong either way, but I would still like to make the best choice and not just wing it. I ultimately want to go to grad school for something in Computer Engineering or Computer Science. The internship at IBM involves working with a database of microprocessor simulation results using SQL in IBM's Custom Microprocessor department, where they develop and test processors for major game consoles such as Xbox, PS3, and Wii. For NASA Ames Research Center, I would help analyze a database of power management data using MATLAB algorithms. The database information is coming from their Sustainability Base, a building developed by NASA that utilizes zero net energy, meaning it generates as much energy from renewable sources as it draws from he power grid: 

http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/sustainability-base/index.html

I'd really love to hear from anyone that has worked at NASA ARC as an intern or IBM. It's a really tough choice for me because they both seem amazing and I'm glad to have a chance with either of them, let alone both of them at the same time. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks!"

gl4tl,9,2011-04-07,Struggling college student asking anyone who has been to college for their input. Please.,FavoriteFlatPillow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gl4tl/struggling_college_student_asking_anyone_who_has/,"I'm currently a junior in college majoring in mechanical engineering. I finally mustered up the courage to write this post in hopes that there would be some people here that can provide some helpful information. I think today was my ""breaking point"" as I just bombed my second introduction to materials engineering exam. 

I am sorry if I am being overdramatic about trivial issues, but this has been a large concern for me for my entire college career. I'm not sure how to piece the ""problems"" together, but I will try to make this as clear as possible. It might be kinda long, but if you're bored, I'd greatly appreciate any feedback. **I bolded the questions that I wanted to ask you guys, so you don't have to waste your time reading this entire thing.**

When I was growing up, I always had an interest in taking things apart, figuring out what made things work, repairing things, etc. My parents noticed this as I grew up and instilled in my mind that I would make a great engineer. Momma always knows best right? I can't say for sure, but maybe this was a wrong move. People have always said to choose your major based on your interests. But at the time, I really did think that engineering would be a great thing. I was involved in an electrical engineering internship my senior year in high school. I made test fixtures that monitored mail sorting devices. I knew that being a high schooler, my tasks would be limited to smaller, easier things. But just sitting in that firm building, with it's dull concrete floor and musty air, I couldn't imagine doing this every day for the rest of my life. Maybe that should've been sign number one. . .

Anyways, I got into college afterwards majoring in electrical engineering as well. Short story short, I switched out after my first semester because I truly believed it was not something I wanted to do. I was never interested in electrical circuits and programming (no offense, I was just extremely terrible at it). After that I have and still continue to pursue an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. I am expected to graduate Spring 2012, which is in about a year. 

I have never performed extremely well in my engineering classes. They are a majority C's, with some B's, and one or two A's. Okay, just to put everything into perspective, I have a cumulative GPA of 2.7. Before you sigh and tell me that it's not bad, it's definitely not good either. The reason it is a big deal is because: 1) Scholarships are given here at 3.25 and above, which isn't(for many others) a hard GPA to achieve, 2) I have always been interested in studying abroad, but it requires a 3.0, 3) At resume clinics and workshops, I'm the kid that is told to leave my GPA out, or include ""Financing 100% of education"", and 4) Most employers won't even give you a chance at an interview without a 3.0. This makes me feel like shit. I'm embarrassed and I hate feeling like my best only amounts to mediocrity. Like I'm mentally incapable of handling this material. 

Everyone keeps telling me GPA doesn't matter as much as on-job experience, but I have been getting denied at every single internship I have currently applied to. Many internship postings also require a 3.0 GPA or higher, so my options are constantly limited. In addition, I don't have the money for out of state internships unless they offer relocation and housing assistance, further limiting my options.

Somewhere transitioning from high school to college, I guess I lost my motivation to learn. As much as the topics I'm learning right now are unique and interesting, my only motivation to learn the material is due to the deadlines for homeworks and exams. I don't enjoy learning this material, I only learn it so that I can graduate and get the fuck out of undergraduate school. 

I know that I haven't been working as hard as I could or should be. I know what I am supposed to do, but I just have no motivation to act upon them. It seems like my only motivation at this point is just my fear of failing and letting my parents down. I know my parents will get over it, blahblah, but they gave me the opportunity to pursue my education. I feel like this is something I have to do at this point. It's just stressful when considering the amount of money I might waste just because I did not try hard enough in school. **How am I supposed to study and focus on material that I don't enjoy?** My mentality at this point is, ""I just want to pass these classes."" Of course I always try my best, but the ultimate goal is just to get through the semester without having to retake any courses. So far, I have. . . luckily.

My studying habits are a mess too. My sleeping habits are terrible. I basically live a graveyard shift. I sleep right after class for about 3-4 hours, then I get up around 10-11pm and do the work that is due the next day. I admit, I procrastinate heavily. I don't want to deal with the work until it is necessary. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I have an 8am, and so I usually just stay awake until then. This cycle keeps repeating day after day. I have tried to break it, but even when I do stay awake during the day, I have no motivation to start my work. I guess I'm just terribly lazy when it comes to school.

In terms of examination preparation, I cram study 1-2 nights prior to the exam. I always tell myself that I would start early, work little by little, but it never goes as planned. I've just been so used to pulling 1 or 2 allnighters prior to an exam that it's just been the routine system of studying for me. Also, although I am a sociable person, when it comes to classes and studying, I try to do everything on my own. I know this is a terrible mindset and that my peers would help me out, but I feel the need to be capable and responsible of handling all of this on my own. Obviously at this point it seems like I can't, but I could never study with other students. 

 In the past, my study schedule worked enough. . . I guess. But this semester is by far the hardest one for me. I'm terrified that I'm about to fail 3/5 classes, my engineering courses. It's funny that my other classes, like technical writing, come so easily compared to my major courses. I honestly feel like the idiot of the class. My first exam in my circuits(Ugh) class went terribly. The week following the exam my teacher displayed a grade distribution for the entire course. 88 students. Far left of graph, 30/100, # of students: 1. The next student was at least in the 50s and there were many kids in the upper 80s-100s. I was the worst student in that class after the first exam. I mean, I didn't understand all the material, but I did feel like I could've at least performed at the average grade.

With that said, I'm wondering if you all have **any tips for me when it comes to studying, particularly engineering or computational materials.** The classes I'm taking right now are circuits, materials intro, and fluid mechanics. **If anyone has any good resources available that could assist me, please let me know.** I just recently discovered /r/engineering and found a really good website I wish I found a long time ago. 

Also, **when you study (this is directed more towards computational classes, not memorization and facts) how do you study? Do you even bother reading the book and taking notes? Do you just take notes off the lecture slides? Or do you mostly just solve practice problems? What is the best approach to preparing for an engineering class examination?** Of course I know this all depends on the type of teacher, the quality of the book, and all, but do you think there's one thing that's most important to focus on? Such as either understanding concepts vs. understanding how to actually solve problems.

Goodness, this is very lengthy. I apologize. I'm just looking for some feedback. . . maybe some reassurance if applicable? Haha. . . I'll just list off some of the questions I have for you guys.

**Anyone with a similar experience, how did you deal with it? Did you switch majors? Or did you persevere?**

**Is it best to stay in my major at this point (considering money, happiness, security, etc.) with one year left to go?**

I do have a backup plan to pursue a masters in business/management if my experiences with mechanical engineering remain the same after some actual work.

**Any test-taking skills or tips?**

I am terrible at taking tests. I actually feel decently prepared coming into exams, but once I see the test, I sorta get a test anxiety. My mind races and I can't concentrate because I'm afraid I'm gonna run out of time. So I start one thing, get stuck and freak out, and just skip to another one.

**Anyone with other experiences/insight/realizations, I would enjoy hearing them**

**What would be your first step in my position?**

Again, I apologize for the length. If you read the entire thing, I greatly appreciate it. I'm pretty sure I'm leaving out many questions, but I'll ask them as I remember them. I haven't slept since Tuesday night. . . so please excuse any errors in my writing. I just wanted to submit this before I backed out again. I think I'll take a nap now. 

Thanks again. 

**tl;dr I'm unmotivated, disinterested and failing my major required courses. I'm terrible at taking tests and I have bad studying habits. I'm scared that my future will either be unhappy or unstable. Just want any feedback.**

I was heavy my whole life, I ended up going to independent study my last 2 years of high school because of it. I started staying home all the time, on WoW or reddit, living off mass amounts of poptarts. At 20 years old I was 215-220 pounds, I used to just stare in the mirror and glare at my body, like it was its own fault for being so fat.

My boyfriend went away for an internship for 3 months, and I decided that I would take the time and throw myself into my weight loss. After 3 months I had lost about 30 pounds, and I just kept going. I'll be 21 in less the 2 weeks, and I weigh in at 135.

I just want to thank you internet. I have almost no friends(still working on that.. weight loss doesn't cure awkwardness unfortunately), so /fit (on 4chan) and reddit have been my main support sources. So, thank you all for inspiring me on days I didn't want to ride my stupid stationary bike to exercise. Thank you for motivating me to keep going after I binged and ate that whole large pizza. Thank you for sharing all of your inspiring stories that helped me see that you can change yourself for the better, even if it seems impossible.

The before picture is from late 2009, before I was even at my heaviest. I meant to take some good before pictures, but I had failed at losing weight so many times I really didn't believe I would make it.
The after picture was taken yesterday.

My friend, Jess, got a great internship in Uganda this summer at a health clinic for children who have been affected by HIV/AIDS. She first budgeted $300 for medications for vaccines and immunizations but the total cost has ended up being $792.84, because her insurance unexpectedly wouldn't pay for it. 
Here is a link to a blog she has created with a detailed description of her situation and exact prices for the medications, as well as a link to paypal.

glsmk,3,2011-04-08,"My first heartbreak, how do I get through this?",Kyato,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/glsmk/my_first_heartbreak_how_do_i_get_through_this/,"Hey Reddit, here's the story.
My ex and i are both 19, we broke up three weeks ago.
We were together for 9 months, and it was amazing. We have the same sense of humor, interests, and we were crazy about eachother. 


Things ended when I realized we both wanted different things out of life, I know that doesn't seem like something to break up over if we are both only 19, but like I said, we were both crazy about eachother and knew we would be together for a very long time. We have different spiritual beliefs, so we worked out every issue we might have because of that before we even started dating, all of our bases were covered. Because of this, we had 0 fights. 


I know that the breakup was for the best. he doesn't want to get married to anyone until he's 35 (the end of his education and internship), and I want to have kids before I'm 30. Like I said, we wanted different things. 


This is my first real heartbreak, I've dated guys and gone through breakups before, but nothing like this. I'm in agony, I even tried to get him to go out with me again the next day, which I understand was very cruel of me.


I've done a lot to help me through this heartbreak. I've started working out more, focused harder in school, taken up hobbies, and even do things like write down how I feel whenever I'm upset to get though this as healthily as possible. I deleted his number off of my phone, but I still have his facebook. Even so, there are days where I can't pick myself off the floor, can't focus, and can't stop bawling my eyes out, hanging onto the hope that maybe he'll call me, and change his mind. 

The problem is, I have all the tools that I seemingly need to get over him, but Im not. Its been three weeks. 
The breakup makes sense, I get that, but I just don't want to be with anyone else, I cant even think of another guy. 
I could really use some advice on how to get through this, I must be missing something. "

Bachelor of Science?,justin_144,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gldgx/need_some_inputadvice_from_cs_majors_cs_bachelor/,"First off, I know a lot of you guys have degrees in Computer Science and could really help a fellow redditor out with choosing his career path is CS. 

I'm majoring in Computer Science and am at the point where I need to choose between a BA or BS in Computer Science. I'm comparing and contrasting the two and I am in a quandary. For one, the BS will require a considerable amount more math than the BA degree. I am not very good at math. I struggle through it, and I feel like I may fail some of the math classes that are required in the BS degree plan. (I have a very high GPA and don't want to wreck it with these math classes). But will I have more chances of landing a higher paying job with a BS degree? 

I am going to do an internship at a company called Raytheon this summer, where I will be working on programs for  infra-red systems. If the internship goes well, do you think later on, if I go for the BA degree, that they would still be interested i me? 

My main concern is that I don't want to ""settle"" for a BA degree, if a BS is better, and will get me further. But I also don't want to waste time, and effort on the BS degree if I can do just as much with a BA degree. 

With a BA degree, I will be done with school in ~2 semesters, compared to ~5 semesters with the BS degree. Should this be a factor to consider?

TL;DR: Which CS Degree is better? Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science?"

I just feel so reserved I hate putting my self out there. In high school I was always a C or D student I would always just put in just enough effort to get by. I probably wouldn't even be in college if I didn't have a wife that I felt I need to make something of my self for. I feel like I'm so worthless compared to her she works 60 hours a week and is going to school for her masters in biology. She was second in her class in high school. Just really someone who works very hard. Now I'm in college going for Computer Science because I feel like I need to get through a difficult degree to make my self feel like I'm worth something. I'm getting a 2.9 GPA which feels like a huge accomplishment to me. Yet I'm still not doing well enough I should really be above 3.0 GPA to get into any internships and I really feel like this semester of school is not going to help my GPA which is just really bothering me because I want to do well for my wife. I've really been struggling with trying to feel like I'm worth anything. 

My dad died in a car accident in 2004. I struggled with that for a year really not being productive at all. Just trying to get out the depressed rut I was in. After that year my family ends up getting a settlement out of the trucking company of the truck that hit my dad. So I end up getting $300,000. I at 20 years old have $300,000 in my bank account. I really should have handed it over to someone else to take care of for me but no I end up just keeping it cause I am an idiot. Well I end up blowing all the money and loaned my mother (who has less money management skills then I do) $30,000 which was supposed to be paid back to me last year. Nope she filled bankruptcy and I won't be seeing any of it. I know I should not really being looking at money as all my problems but I just keep thinking that way. I am not making any money for my family right now I'm just concentrating on school. While My wife works 2 jobs and is going to school for her masters in biology. I really should get my self at least a part time job but I just can't motivate my self to. 

I know I'm rambling and this article really is to long and probably doesn't make any sense on what my problem really is to sum it up is that I feel like I'm worthless."
gndal,5,2011-04-11,Dimming infrared halogen lamps,MrMountains,AskElectronics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/gndal/dimming_infrared_halogen_lamps/,"Hello AskElectronics,
I’m a student in an internship. My assignment is to design some extra implementations for an infrared-cabin control panel. One of these implementations is to be able to dim [Dr. Fisher Vitae halogen lamps]( http://www.dr-fischer-gmbh.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;Bereich=8&amp;DBereich=8). The lamps will have a total power of 1200W. This has to be done by pushing on a button on a control panel, so I was thinking of writing a piece of code (which has to be in assembler) to change the duty cycle of a signal and using that signal at the gate of a TRIAC. I was thinking of using [this TRIAC]( http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/2936.pdf).
My questions to you now are:

*Is what I’m trying to do possible?

*Can I directly connect this signal to the gate?

*Have I chosen the right TRIAC for the job?

*I’ve read about buzzing of the wire and how it will disrupt radio receivers. How can I avoid this?

I will try and keep an eye on this topic but I’m from Europe and the time difference could be bothersome when trying to give quick responses.

Or would I come off as creepy?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gok8h/should_i_look_for_him_or_would_i_come_off_as/,"So I met this guy(well call him bob) and his friend on a plane. Bob is very humble, kind, and not flirtatious at all. He was genuinely a super nice guy. We hit it off immediately in a very platonic way as we played games together and even shared food. He laughed at the stupid things I would say and we'd even make fun of his friend (in a playful way). Bob's 24M and I'm 18F(both him and his friend agreed I did not seem 18 at all). I was going to ask for some contact info once we got off the plane since we live in different states but we ended up getting separated and I had to catch my next flight.

I know exactly where he works and this summer I have an internship in the same city (The place I'm going to stay at is on the same ave as him interestingly enough). He's such a great guy and I find myself constantly thinking about him! Would it be weird/creepy if I found his number through his work and called him? What would you guys think?

I asked my 23yr old friend and he said it would seem a bit creepy since I would have had to go a lot out of my way to search for his number.. Your guys input?

EDIT: I think ultimately I will try to contact him (he works for a company with more than 100k employees.. I know which office he's at so hopefully it won't require too much work). As you all were saying, I really have nothing to lose! It's a bit nerve racking and if he does end up having a girlfriend, as Stalked_Like_Corn said, I should just play it cool... try hard not to come off as creepy. And if he IS creeped out, I don't have to see him again. 

Thank you RA! If anything ends up happening this summer I'll be sure to update you guys."

* We won a group which featured Inter Milan (not progressed, WON)

* We beat AC Milan, who are the current leaders of Serie A
* We got further than Arsenal

I know we had no part in that last one, but it makes me feel better.

We knew before the first leg that this wasn't going to be an easy match. And with a bankroll like Real Madrid has, it would expected they would top us. But we put in a tremendous effort tonight, and I am so proud of you Spurs!

gpbrx,129,2011-04-13,[FR] A girl at work gave IOIs... I capitalized like a boss (+ deep details &amp; lessons!),acartoontiger,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gpbrx/fr_a_girl_at_work_gave_iois_i_capitalized_like_a/,"Hey everyone, so this happened in the summer before I found Seddit but I just remembered and thought that it would make a good at-work FR.

**Background**
I'm 21, recent college grad.  One of my jobs is an intern post at a small animal park.  I am a physiologist/pre-vet.  I go in once a week to feed animals, do maintenance, pat tigers (yeah, pat tigers.  We have a liger too, she is nice).

**HB7 19years Brunette**
A few days in I notice that HB7 who also interns is giving me *the look*.  You know that look.  Its the *I want you to look back and smile* look.  I do look back and smile.  I see a look in her eyes that is **very** revealing about what she is thinking.  At this moment I have an epiphany... **Girls that are younger than me eat up my minute gaming points like candy**.  At this point we have not yet spoken, so I decide to remedy that and I walk up to her and her friend HB6.  

* Me:  ""So do you give that sexy look to all the new guys or can you just tell that I am one of the good ones?""
* Her: *Obviously surprised that I would say something like that, giggles and smiles*
* Me: ""I'm Felix, whats your name?""
* Her: ""I'm HB7 and this is HB6, do you work here too?""
* Me: ""Yes I come in to play with the animals and charm the employees when I'm not away at school...  Oh wait, I shouldn't be flirting with you, you could be the boss' daughter or something.  I'm so embarrassed"" (smiling)

This exchange results in us chatting for a while and her asking me about myself which I knock out of the park.  She wants to be a vet too but she is a few years behind me in the process and is very impressed by where I go to school.  I am polite to HB6 but eventually I want her gone so I suggest that we go get fruit from the kitchen and hand feed the monkeys.  HB7 says yes enthusiastically and HB6 evaporates (victory).  

**Isolation Lesson:** Acknowledge the fact that you and HB*target* are flirting verbally in front of the obstacle and then find a reason to change locations.  If HB*obstacle* is a good friend she will see that her friend is having fun and make herself scarce.  It worked.

Anyway we feed monkeys and flirt for a while, her buying temperature is extreme.  It sounds cocky, but at this point I could just tell that I had it in the bag and she was hooked (60minutes).  Since we are at work I find it difficult to take her into a closet and fuck her, so I settle for giving her my number and telling her that we will meet up in a day or two outside work.  She runs her hands up my shirt before I leave to go back to my part of Tahoe.  I feel like I left her wanting more (I was right).

She texts me that night like, 6 hours after I left work.  We send a few sex heavy texts back and forth, you get the idea. 

**Insert Tactical Maneuver**  
She eventually says that she wants to see me the next day and I say NO.  I could have just said yes and worked from there but I wanted to make her wait because I was enjoying having her on the hook.  I was also working the next day at my other job (vet practice).  We set a day to go swimming in the lake together.  We teased each other a bit about swimming skills so this was a natural activity.  I grew up in Tahoe, so I know several secluded spots to swim and lie on the rocks.  Perfect

We swim and flirt for a while and the day is beautiful so we lie on a towel on some comfortable rocks.  *She had a towel too but she laid on mine with me*.  This is the last straw, we are alone.  She is laying on her back with eyes closed (totally awake though).  I lean over, place a hand on her waist/stomach and use the other one to gently lift up her chin and kiss her.  **Guys, Do This!**  Its golden and it always gives them an extra boost of being turned on right before you kiss them.  I do it almost all the time, even in my LTR, she loves it.  Anyway, there is rarely any speaking after I make my first kiss and this was no exception.  F close, by the lake.  Very picturesque and she had no inhibitions, totally hot sex.

We swim again and have sex again about an hour later, it was awesome.  I liked this girl, and before we parted at the end of the day she said one of the nicest things to me I've ever been told.

*""You touch me like I'm so beautiful, I love it""*

It stuck with me, and it was a huge confidence boost for my future endeavors.  We have had several ""booty calls"" I guess I would call them since that day.

I know this FR is long and sounds kinda cocky but I don't care.  Shit happened just like this, blew my fucking mind.

**Lessons Learned/Reinforced**

* Flirt with your coworkers, good things happen
* Assume initial attraction, in this case it was totally true
* Friends of HB*target* will get out of your way if you make your intentions clear and they can see that their friend wants it
* Learn to read facial expressions and eye movements.  I can't stress this enough.  Just as it is important to be able to recognize the *save me!* eyes from across a bar, it is important to be able to recognize the *look at me and smile!* eyes everywhere.
* Take bitches swimming and lying in the sun, bitches love swimming and lying in the sun.
* Always go for the kiss if the situation is conducive to passionate sex, its worked out for me many times and its worked out for others many more times.
* Don't be afraid, sometimes they want you more than you want them.  They are just waiting for you to charm their pants off.  Do it!

I wish the best of luck to everyone here, and I really enjoy giving back to the community so I am happy to answer questions and talk game.

*Getting out in the field gets easier and more rewarding every time,*

gp64n,1,2011-04-13,Feel like things are getting worse again...,modestmoose5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gp64n/feel_like_things_are_getting_worse_again/,"I've had a fairly long history with depression (never diagnosed, never talked to any sort of professional to be honest). Growing up, my mother was pretty insane. She would flip a shit over really insignificant stuff, basically every memory of christmas or family vacation from my childhood is dominated by her having a crazy episode, many times in public. She was also extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative to my father, who was a complete doormat. I never really realized how bad it was until my early teens. Until I was 14, all I wanted to do was get good grades and make my parents proud. When my parents had a horribly messy divorce right before my freshman year of high school, I stopped caring about, well, just about anything. 

I stopped caring about my grades and started hanging out with a pretty bad crowd. This continued throughout most of high school. I was horribly awkward, never so much as kissed a girl throughout all of hs and kept the same few weird friends the whole time. I only managed to get into a decent college based on an athletic scholarship and good SAT scores.

My first year and a half of college was probably my lowest point. I didn't make any friends at all in school and found myself eventually driving home just about every weekend just to get away from it. I started getting heavily into drinking, weed, psychedelics, pain pills and thought about suicide a lot, as well as other ""existential crisis"" type shit. However, things did get a little better. I eventually started making friends and becoming more social. My senior year I even started dating a few girls and felt like I was really starting to leave my depression behind, but every time I would get dumped due to inexperience/latent depression and attachment issues I had that would eventually arise by me being clingy and dependent. I also had this impending sense that once college ended, I didn't know what I wanted to do with myself.

After college, I lived at home for about 6 months trying to get my shit together while doing some part time work. At this point I have a few really close friends that are actually not losers and that I really enjoy spending time with. However, they're all moving on with their lives and I know that I'm going to have to do the same.  I find an internship in a field I'm interested in in NYC and I just so happen to have a place I can stay for about a month to see if I can start a life for myself.

The first month is great, honestly one of the best times of my life. I immediately start hanging out with a couple people I knew back in high school and I'm doing really well at my internship. I meet a girl that I come to like a lot and we spend the first 4-5 weeks I'm up there sleeping with each other ~4 days a week. My boss at my internship is dropping really obvious hints that I'm going to get a job once my internship is over, and I start planning a life in NYC.

This is when shit starts going sour. Things between me and the girl get really intense for a couple weeks, I think we got too emotionally invested in each other too fast.  I can tell she's having second thoughts, and the more she pulls away, the more my insecurities start to show. This also happens to be at the same point my boss informs me I would not be getting the job. My best friend from home also abruptly stopped contacting me or responding to my calls.  Basically, the stars aligned and a lot of the shit I valued and took for granted in my life went to shit.

This all happened roughly a month ago.  In the ensuing 4 weeks or so, I decided to sublet a place for a couple months and try to find a new job.  I actually have a couple promising leads, but now I'm wondering if I even want to stay up here. I still hang out with those two other people a couple times a week, but the rest of the time I'm basically jobhunting for a few hours every day, then wallowing by myself. I've lost 15 pounds because I can't even make myself eat anymore. The girl I was seeing before hasn't explicitly ended things between us but we've hung out less and less in the last 4 weeks, and I haven't even seen her since two weeks ago saturday. We talked on the phone yesterday for about 5 minutes, and I was almost hoping she would just tell me it was over so I could stop thinking it was even a possibility anymore, but all she said was she's extremely busy with school and work for the next month, and that she'll let me know if we can ever hang out in the mean time.

Sorry for this extremely rambling post, I just don't know what I should even do at this point. I am so moody lately, sometimes I'll think everything's ok but that usually only lasts until I fall asleep.  Every morning I wake up I feel depressed.  I've started sleeping upwards of 10+ hours a night and my sleep is interrupted constantly by weird/scary dreams. I've started thinking about suicide again but honestly I don't think I'd ever have the balls to do it, death scares the shit out of me.  If anything I'll die stupidly getting wasted/taking drugs, which I've been more cavalier with lately as well. I just want to run away and start somewhere new where I don't know anyone, but that's basically what I just did 2 months ago and that didn't work out well at all, so now I have no idea what I should do. 

I really do want to get over my issues but I don't know where to begin. I've never been able to turn to my family for any kind of support other than financial (which I am very appreciative of, if it wasn't for that I don't know where I'd be). Every time I try to talk about my personal life they just change the subject, and that's the way it's always been. I don't think I can afford getting professional help, but honestly I've never even looked into it, I really regret not talking to my school counselors when I had the chance. I don't even know what motivated me to post this, I guess I just hope someone can tell me where to begin getting over this shit for good, because obviously the bootstraps method has done nothing but hide my issues until something shitty happens, then it seems to all come out at once.

I am graduating this June and have concentrated in web development. I've had three internships at a advertising agency, so I at least have some experience I can put on my resume.

What is considered a good starting salary for an entry level position in web development (I live in Cincinnati)?

For anyone who has been in the field for a while, what do you consider to be some of the pitfalls that you can run into? Is there anything specific that you get burnout on doing?

What languages/technologies should I continue to learn in the future? I think html5 is going to huge, but it's going to be a while before it has enough browser support to see wide spread use.

Any other advice or knowledge would be appreciated."

I have resisted for weeks now in anticipation of a drug test (if i get the job), but i am unsure of how big of a deal it is if say, they ask for one and i tell them that i smoked this weekend and either need time to let it out of my system, or that i will simply stop all together. are they looking for just harder drugs? or is cannabis use a means for termination? or lack of employment? will i get a chance to explain myself or is it a big deal to them?

gr9b6,19,2011-04-16,Busted - Epilogue,cuffd,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/gr9b6/busted_epilogue/,"Ents, I give you now the follow up to my post from some quarter-year ago, [Busted - Moving Forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/eot6w/busted_moving_forward/)

**Previously on ""Busted""**

Mid-December of 2010, Cuffd was cuffed in his own home, being triumphantly eyed by two officers of the law.  Their modest triumph amounted to just under 1/4 oz., two grinders, a pipe, and a MFLB.  The charge was possession, with another three counts of paraphernalia.  Up to $2,500 in fines and/or a year in jail.

I didn't know if I'd go with the public defender or go in alone.  /r/trees tells me to explore a NORML-affiliated attorney, I do.  My future seems to be slipping away.  My job and life are at risk.

**Desperation**

I settled on the counsel of a criminal defense attorney.  Somewhat high-profile, well connected, and well established.  I had to do the best I could.  His retainer was $2,000.  I figured I'd still end this cheap.

He knows about my prior incident, some two years back.  He's ready to fight in court, that the search was illegal.  But he talks to the state's attorney and he gets me a deal.

**Humility**

My court date is postponed, pending my enrollment in a government-chartered voluntary program.  I'm assigned a caseworker who comments on my maturity, I'm a little bashful.  I have work to deal with, as well as school and a new internship.  I made sure he knew I didn't intend to be slowed down.

The program entails two months of weekly drug testing, a class (originally four classes, but bumped down thanks to my caseworker,) and twenty-four hours of community service with a DOC work crew.  I take my enrollment certificate to the judge at my next court date.  One year from then, so long as I complete the program, I can get the charge expunged.  My future aspirations are secure.

**Hitherto**

The community service is in eight-hour shifts, picking up trash on the side of the road.  The drug testing is straightforward, pissing in a cup.  The class is the usual ""drugs are bad"" routine.

I mold my job, school and internship around it, as much as it pains me to do so.  I have to keep up with all my obligations, no exceptions.

**Now**

Oh, now is the good part.  Sunday is my last day of community service.  Monday is my last drug test.  Monday I get my program certificate and I'm officially done.  I've kept clean and on the straight and narrow.

Ents, you shouldn't be the least bit surprised that anyone can remain capable, efficient, and effective across long periods of smoking and sobriety.  To the untrained eye, nothing has transpired, and that's just the way I'd have it.  My future is secure.

**The World of Tomorrow**

Monday is the 18th, and the end of drug testing.  It's the end of the scrutiny which would be any higher than on the average, law-abiding citizen.

Wednesday is the 20th.  It's 4/20.  I guess it all worked out alright.

I'm no stoner, as much as I love trees and as quickly as I'll once again enjoy them.  I'm a writer.  I can finally relax just a little and believe that I can pursue a career in writing and film.

We all have our dreams, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to chase after mine just a little longer.

I'll smoke one for all of you.  For everyone who has never had to get caught, and can smoke in peace.  For everyone who's been in my place.  For everyone who's seen their life needlessly ruined by these draconian drug laws.  So far as I'm concerned, we're all in it together.

**TL;DR - ** Everything went better than expected."
gr7wq,0,2011-04-15,Help needed to pursuit my childhood dream of playing cricket for my country(India),[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/gr7wq/help_needed_to_pursuit_my_childhood_dream_of/,"Hi everyone, I am not sure if this would be of any importance to people here as I see so many more deep concerns posted here. But I would still like to state the current assistance that I would be needing as it could pave way to my childhood dream of playing cricket (sport) for my country India. 
I am an international student(from India) currently studying computer engineering in a Canadian University. Since the age of 4(when I was introduced to the sport) I wanted to play for India, but my parents wanted me to get an engineering degree first from a reputed university and hence sent me to Waterloo to earn an engineering degree. As I am an international student, the tuition for me is very high (around 13k for 1 term) and therefore most of the money that i had earned in my internship went towards paying my tuition and the rent for next term. Since summer is the only season in Canada to play cricket, I was picked up to play in the southern ontario cricket league by a club, but they require me to pay then $150 as the season player fee. I am not being able to accumulate that much money out of my account for the next term as, if I do that, then I will not have sufficient funds to keep me alive (food) for the next term.
Earlier I decided to not play the league and just train but doing the drills on my own, but then I have not been able to be at peace with this decision and always feel a kind of restlessness that asks me to go for this opportunity as it will keep me alive with the sport and when I return after my graduation to India, I will have good experience from the league.
I am not sure if this is a cause to ask for monetary help, but I think I should at least try and ask for help.I am trying my best to keep alive in the sport and hence would like some assistance in this regard.
Thanks :)"

I live in Athens currently, but got an internship this summer with the Ohio EPA in downtown Columbus. I am now in search of a place to live this summer. I am looking for basically whatever is cheapest. 

3 girls I'm good friends with offered to let me sleep in their basement on Maynard for $250 a month including utilities, but 1) I don't really want to live with them, and 2) they already have 3 people in their tiny little 2 bedroom duplex, and I don't want to add to the claustrophobia. So basically, this describes what I don't want.

So I'm good to pay anything under $400 a month probably, but am really trying to get as close to $300 a month including utilities as I can. I will only be there June 13th through about 2 weeks before OSU starts classes again.

I am fine living with people I don't know. I get along with everyone I meet and am fine with most people's lifestyles. So ya.

I had to leave my job because my school requires a 6 month internship. Mine was across the country and with 50+ work weeks I couldn't transfer to a location there. So I'm trying to get back in the business (any of the three positions I've held are fine with me) but GM seem to be hesitant. I understand  some concerns (because I'm graduating in June they fear they'll train me only to be gone a few months but I plant to stay here in the city and stay with whatever job I have for awhile) but the biggest thing is that I haven't had an industry job in over a year. They question why I would come back (a love of food, great atmosphere/experience, and service) and think it kind of suspicious. They all seem to like me and think I'm very personable but that seems to stop them.

How do I get it across that I actually want to work in this industry still and that even thought I have ""little experience"" I'm very enthusiastic and hard worker without having to repeat it the millions of times I have in interviews?"
gtvao,2,2011-04-19,Need some advice,DepressedDontKnowWhy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gtvao/need_some_advice/,"I'm a 24 years old french guy that just got his first job in Paris (I will begin in may) and so will move here soon. This job is relatively well paid and is in the field I studied to work in (computing). So I think I'm supposed to be happy, right ? Problem is I'm not, and in fact I'm completely depressed since a few days, and unable to get over it. I lost a good part of my appetite, I want to cry many times a day or feel like I would like to broke everything near me and then for a few hours it gets better and then it gets worse again (I'm not even able to successfully fap...). I lost interest in everything and without my parents pressuring me to take this job I think maybe I would abandon it.

I'm confused about what exactly makes me sad as there is a lot of thoughts in my head. I think that's mostly fear of future and feelings about missed things I would not be able to do anymore and my generally uninteresting life.

I got treatment for depression a few years back, while I was in the process of choosing which studies I wanted to do. At the moment, the problem was pressure about the urging need to choose what to do with my life. I was anxious as I didn't really know and needed to choose quickly because school year was about to begin. I got something called Venlafaxine as treatment, which I kept for ~3 years, as hopefully It was supposed to also help overcome my shyness, until a few months ago when I decided to stop and decreased the dose from 2*75mg pills per day to currently only one 37.5mg pill every three days. Maybe this treatment was keeping me from depressing and I should not have stopped taking it, but I was never convinced of it's usefullness and anyway I don't think spending my entire life drugged is a solution.

I've always been shy and never really got a *real* friend, nor a girlfriend. Thereis a few people with whom I share interests which I shared some activities with in recent years, but I'm generally not the guy who is considered interesting. I'm not invited at parties or anything, and if I don't make efforts to talk to others, nobody will come talk to me. I I'm not here, it goes unnoticed.

I spent the last three years in some middle-sized french town (Caen) where I was going mostly fine, even if was alone almost every moment spent outside school, I still managed to make some friends or maybe they are just half-friends. Anyway, it improved slowly. I then did an internship for my last school year where I met some people with whom I was able to socialize and even began doing some sport whith them (something I avoided nearly my entire life).

I then graduated and spent a few months searching for work, going back to live with my parents (where I'm still currently until I move to Paris) as with studies ended I get no more aid to pay rent. As my parents really live in the middle of nowhere, I spent the last few months really alone, feeling generally bored, with no contacts with any people of my age outside a few Internet conversations. I thought being independent, finding a job and moving to a new place will improve that.

And now I know I'm going to Paris in two weeks with a job and... I've never felt that bad. I'm going to a place where I don't know anybody, I will not have free time anymore, I feel trapped as I'm almost obliged to take that job now.

I'm not sure anymore I want to work in IT. Well, I was never sure what to do with my life, but stopped thinking about it during my studies. The field now seems boring to me, and I'm thinking I should do something else, maybe artistic or whatever (if only I knew...). But it's too late.

I never really enjoyed my youth, I was just beginning to make friends at the end, and now it seems behind me, while I'm stuck with a boring job that will take all my time.

The few friends I had began to make during the last years, whith great difficulty, are lost and I will now be in this huge frightening town, with not even school to help me meet people of my age.

I know I'm probably exagerating, that things won't go that bad, but I feel lost and anxious and I'm unable to get over it. I feel like an asshole bragging about my life when some others have much more problems than me.

Anyway I feel trapped in my life, I don't control it and it seems it going in some direction which isn't what i wanted and I don't know hat to do.

I've probably forgot many things about my feelings and anyway I'm not sure how I feel myself, but this post is already too long.

(please forgive this long and somewhat unstructured post, my feelings on the subject are not very clear nor organised. please also forgive eventual english errors, I'm not a native english speaker)

gtgx8,15,2011-04-19,Can we have a calm discussion about the psychological and physical effects of cannabis without resorting to exaggeration/hyperbole?,kwood09,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/gtgx8/can_we_have_a_calm_discussion_about_the/,"After the post warning about daily cannabis use yesterday, and now the parody post about television viewing today, I'm compelled to say this:

Cannabis is a wonderful drug. It can be used safely and responsibly. I don't do it very often these days because I'm very busy, but there was a time when I was a multiple-times-daily smoker, and I definitely think it's a do-able thing. But there are a couple of things to remember:

* As has already been pointed out multiple times, smoking anything will have deleterious effects on your respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Vaping, however, virtually eliminates this risk.

* Let's face it though: the physical side effects of cannabis use are not usually that serious. The real danger is the manner in which you consume it and the effect that has on your mental/social/emotional health.

Let's talk about that second part. In this sense, cannabis is like food. There is nothing physically or inherently dangerous about it. But, used in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons, it can be dangerous. It is certainly not physically addictive. But people can still develop a dependence on it.

I can say that I have been able to jump right in and out of multiple-times-daily smoking on at least three occasions in my life. For me personally, it has never been a problem. When it's been appropriate and desirable in my life, I've smoked like you wouldn't imagine. And when I lost my desire, or when other obligations got in the way, I was able simply to stop. No problems whatsoever.

But this is not the case for everyone. I know people who simply don't do shit because they smoke weed all day. Two guys I know at college got a combined GPA of 0.2 last semester at a $38,000/year college because they just get high and skip class. Now, these guys are also lazy by nature. I'm not *blaming* cannabis for their failure to go to class. I'm simply saying that it's a contributing factor. One of the guys was applying for an internship this summer that was going to be really lucrative. He had all his shit filled out and needed only to take the drug test. Two weeks into his weed break, though, he just said, ""Fuck it,"" and decided to get high. Called up the place the next day and said he found something else. Now he's going back to work at his job at a snow cone stand over the summer.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I am saying that he would have had a nice internship if he didn't have the desire to smoke weed so bad. The point is, he couldn't control it. Again, I'm not *blaming* weed or anything like that. I'm simply saying that it's really naive of you guys to treat cannabis as if it's some sort of magical rainbow miracle drug of happiness. You know how when you get really high, you get fucked up? That should tell you that it's pretty serious business. 

I imagine that most of you guys who act like cannabis could not possibly have any ill effects are in one of two categories. (1) you might just be naive. OR (2) you might be like me: very lucky that smoking cannabis has never led to any problems for you.

A lot of us are lucky that we can smoke all the time, float in and out of the lifestyle, and manage all of our affairs without a problem. That's great, and I encourage people to do that if they can do it. But you can't forget that there *are* people taking cannabis inappropriately by using it to escape their emotions, using it as a sort of mental crutch to rationalize not doing anything with their life, or using it in some other way that is detrimental to their mental, emotional, or psychological health.

Listen guys, I fucking love to smoke weed. I encourage ya'll to smoke weed too, if that's what you're down with. But please, you could be sending really wrong signals to people who might not understand that cannabis, while mostly harmless, still is a drug. "

gu5yf,3,2011-04-19,"College is ending, and the world is scary.",Aurora_B,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/gu5yf/college_is_ending_and_the_world_is_scary/,"So I'm graduating with a Computer Science degree in June and I'm freaking out. I've been looking for a job since October. Within the last 6 months I've sent out at least 70 resumes, got 30 call backs, and had 15 interviews within the last 3 weeks. I never hear back from companies, and if I do its either ""No thank you,"" or ""You're a good candidate...."" and nothing more. 

What's harder is that ALL of my friends have jobs lined up after college. I'm the last one in our group to get a job, and a lot of my friends are questioning why I can't get one. Yesterday a friend of mine went as far as to jokingly end a sentence with ""...that's probably why you can't get a job"". It hurt really bad, and I called him out on it, but I was still pretty upset. 

Right now I'm thinking about moving to Canada or somewhere very far away and never coming back. At least then I can start over, maybe get a new degree. I don't know anymore. 

So my question to you reddit is, is this type of freaking out normal? I feel like I haven't accomplished anything, which isn't true. I'm graduating with honors, I've had an internship with a big company, I have a lot of development experience, and I'm very involved with school. And I understand that it just hasn't been my luck lately, but I still feel like I'm stuck right now. Do you guys have any advice? "

Pretty good pay, pretty good benefits. There are a few requirements.

* Number 1: You must have completed a four-year technical degree from a **real** university, i.e., a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Engineering. Chaos Mathematics, Quantum Physics, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, they don't really care, as long as you have a **technical** degree, no Business, Management, Finance, etc., sorry. This is not my requirement, this is an HR requirement so don't hate on me.
* Number 2: You must have an interest in security systems engineering. This is not an anti-virus management role or a firewall management role or a network security role. You will need to be able to analyze security requirements, **develop plans** for meeting those requirements, and build documentation and use cases for implementing and testing those security requirements.
* Number 3: Ideally, you should have at least a couple of years of experience. I think they would be willing to entertain entry level, but you still have to meet 1 and 2. They'd be willing to invest time in mentoring and training, but you will have to be pretty outstanding in all other regards, and have at least a few internships under your belt.
* Number 4: You have to be legally authorized to work in the United States. We can't do any sponsorship for this role, sorry.

If you're interested, message me and I'll give you more details and point you to the formal application process."

gvndk,1,2011-04-23,Am I completely deluded or insane?,Sacoud,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gvndk/am_i_completely_deluded_or_insane/,"Apologies for the amount of text but I can't explain this without going into detail.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, I have many things going for me, money, a good family, a girlfriend, a summer internship. However I am incredibly lonely and wherever I go I feel completely unwanted. I used to have loads of friends when I was 16 but as we grew older many drifted away however I always thought I was being treated badly people would often call me an idiot (incuding teachers) and not in a joking way ( I am now though doing very well for myself), now I was obese as a young child and was bullied horrifically I'm talking getting punched , spat on , random people coming up to me and making fun of me. I lost the weight now but it still hurts.

So anyway I moved from my town and went to university about 20 miles away, most of my ""friends"" didn't go and stayed in my town. During my first year of university I made quite a few friends I played in a football team and was enjoying myself, I would go back to my town as much as possible to see everyone although I was working so it was hard to get back so I would invite my friends into where I lived to catch up.

During my 2nd year almost every friend I had made dropped out. At this point I was in uni 4 days a week, work experience on the 5th day and a part time job on weekends so getting back was very difficult and so I didn't see many people over this year. I tried to organise events as I wasn't getting invited anywhere but people just weren't interested.

Now.. I hear that my old best friend is moving to Australia and he says that we and everyone should go for a few drinks before he goes. Of course I'm more than happy to do this. So the day comes I tell everyone ""he's going we have to see him off"" I drag everyone out I get him a going away present... 9pm comes and he still isn't here, I ring his house and his Mum answers ""oh he's gone out with X"" 15 years of friendship.. he's moving away and he doesn't see his ""best mate"" before he goes.(we were best friends for about 10 years but sort of drifted apart recently) I was absolutely devastated. I sent him a message telling him how humiliated and sad I felt but I just cut him loose. 

 Another old friend I tried to organise a get together hadn't seen him in 8 months I get people out.. I get a text ""not coming hanging with my work friends"" , this wasn't the first time he had done this and I couldn't take being friends with him as it was making me miserable. I cut him off aswell.

I was getting incrediby lonely at this point and my other friends woudn't come to see me when I tried to organise events. I did however manage to start a 5 a side football team with them, I thought that maybe if we get that team spirit there would be team bonding and we'd all do things together but I couldn't be more wrong.

I organised an event, soccer saturday drinking game one week it was the day before and they all told me they cancelled to go paint balling with another friend so I thought I'd do it another week. So it's Saturday I'm excited, I get the girlfriend to go out for the day, I tidy the apartment, I go out and buy enough beer for everyone... no one shows up... I ask what's going on and well no one really has a reason as to why they've didn't come. At this point I said and I quote ""for fucks sake I turned down football tickets yesterday from my Dad because you guys said you were coming"". I didn't get a single apology and that night they all went out without me. To make it even worse one of them actually replied ""for fucks sake"" as a dig at me when the football centre made a mistake and our game was rearranged for a different time

With the 5 a side football there was no conversation with me and them, for 3 weeks in a row I would walk in and say hi and no one would say a thing.. not even a goodbye when I went. The only thing I would get out of them is ""how much is it then"". After the 3rd time I think I spent the whole of the next day crying and I told them over the internet that I was leaving the team to concentrate on my uni work.. but the truth was I was leaving because I was so depressed I couldn't take it any more.

I spent so much time alone.. a friend in uni asked if I wanted to play 5 a side football with them for a game.. so I did.. it was on the same night as my other ""friends"" they saw me.. first time I'd seen them in 3 months and one of them just gave a dig ""I thought you were too busy"".

I do wonder if I'm the problem or if it's them. But I really do think I'm fun to be around, I know I make people laugh.

A few weeks ago I went to a pub to see another old friendship group ( Like I said I had a huge amount of friends when I was 16) and it was one of the best nights of my life, when I got back home 3 people had their Facebook status with something like "" If you want to have fun when you get drunk *insert my name* is the man to go to"".

Another friend came back from the navy for the weekend, I organised a night out with the above friendship group.. most of them didn't turn up after saying they would... it sucked hard.. my navy friend did organise another night the next night but it was the people in my 5 a side team and other people who were less than nice to me in high school. I was going to come until I found out who was going I then text him saying ""nothing against you but after last nights no show I'm sorry but I can't be arsed"". I'm pretty sure he's pissed off at me. 

I don't think I'd ever do it but suicide comes into my head pretty much every other day.. I am so alone and I talk to almost no one apart from my girlfriend. I don't know if I'm deluded or not as I feel the bullying from my childhood may have affected my judgement.

I had a few questions regarding what I can do to most effectively groom myself for law school. I am a Poli Sci major sophomore with a minor in philosophy. Against better advice, I am intent in being a lawyer, and I want to do everything in my power to get there and get into a good school. 

I have an UGPA of 3.6 (on the rise after a mediocre freshman year), I am going to be interning in the fall at the local Public Defender's office and I plan on writing a thesis my senior year. 

My questions are as follows:

1. Would I do better to consistently take challenging courses or take the easy road for a GPA boost?

2. How far out of my way should I go to try to get more legal internships?

3. What else can I do beyond GPA and LSAT to be more appealing/distinguish myself?

4. Any other tips, tricks or advice you wish you would have had a few years ago.

gw6dg,2,2011-04-24,Dear Reddit Austin: I'm a 17 year old teenager who is fluent in technology and needs a job. Help? (Resume inside),DesperateJobSeeker17,Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/gw6dg/dear_reddit_austin_im_a_17_year_old_teenager_who/,"Reddit, I love you. I know you make wonderful things happen and I know that anything is possible with your help. 

Let me explain.

I am about as nerdy as you get without being “nerdy”. I spend my time using Linux, attempting to learn code, migrating to the cloud with my CR-48, editing band videos with Adobe Premiere, and Googling whatever I can't figure out on my own. I'm an Eagle Scout and an executive officer in my high school band. I don't play video games, I don't even own a major console. I lied. I do have a Wii – to which I spent more time installing homebrew on then actually using. I can install a motherboard blindfolded. I have a Power Mac G5 dissembled next to me. I have drawers and shelves full of random pieces of hardware. I am good at putting on a face and interacting with people. I understand hard work. And I need a job.

Ideally I need a job that has something to do with technology. But, alas, who wants to hire a dumb 17 year old? It's easy to look at me on paper and throw me away. I'm sorry that I don't have enough time to get A+ certified. AP classes take up most of my time and whatever money I have left is spent on phone bills, insurance, and gas.

I have applied to Best Buy, a local computer repair shop, and tech support positions. I have called them all back. And all of them have denied me. What did I do to deserve such treatment?

So, Reddit, I come to you in a last ditch attempt before I end up working for McDonalds. Does anyone know a way for me to get a job with technology or have good connections? I could even work as an intern. School is still going on and I wont be able to work full time until the summer, but that's not too far away. I live in Round Rock and would be willing to drive about 20 minutes for a decent paying position. 

Here is a link to my resume without my contact info. PM me if you want my full resume with references and contact information.

If you're at MIT the Job ID is 13069 on the CareerBridge website. 

The IT Intern will be assisting Department of Technology staff with the daily maintenance of Servers, MIS systems, desktop and end user support.

For the right candidate there are opportunities to expand their technical skills during this internship. This includes WinForms .Net development in VB.Net and C#.Net, office automation using VBA and AutoHotkeys, and web development with ASP.Net, classic ASP, Sql Server 2008, php, and MySql.

Other related duties may include participating in our ground up redesign, production, deployment and support of our new B2B and B2C websites. This would also be an opportunity to learn about SEO, Google AdWords and other web marketing techniques.

This role is scheduled to last for 3 months over the summer. Start and end dates are flexible in order to accommodate student's needs.

Enthusiasm, a sense of humor, and a desire to learn are key. Prior related experience is desired.

gx1zq,1,2011-04-25,Need help figuring out where to go from here...,Which_Route,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gx1zq/need_help_figuring_out_where_to_go_from_here/,"Ok, the numbers and such first:

This is a throwaway account.
I am 28, she is 25.
She has two children. A boy who is 3 and a girl who just turned 7.
  We have officially been together for 10 months but have ""talked"" and had an inappropriate relationship for about 4 years (she was married, husband was verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive).  

The quandary:

So, we became close while she was still with her husband.  At first we were just friendly and became close enough that I became aware of the situation.  Husband had hit her before and constantly put her down. She was the bread winner while he sat at home and got high and ""watched the kids"".  Nothing was ever done when she got home so she worked 12 hour nursing shifts only to come home and have to do everything around the house.  Obviously she may have been best served to have left sooner, but I can't begin to understand how difficult that decision is.  Eventually we became much closer and an odd sort of ""relationship"" developed.  We convinced ourselves it wasn't a big deal because her relationship with her husband was dead and he was basically a shitty roommate.  Thinking error, I know.  So over that four years there were plenty of good times and bad times.  She was living a hellish life and I was the one she was most comfortable with so I got a lot of flack that wasn't really meant for me.  

August 1, 2010.  She left him. Great on so many levels.  Mostly just for her to begin her adult life again without that burden.  She absolutely adores her kids and bends over backwards to give them what she can afford.  So that's a positive for sure.  

Over the last 5 or so years I have been in regular bi-weekly treatment for extreme depression, some substance abuse (no longer happening), and other issues.  I've also participated in a weekly therapy group for about 4 of those years.  I am in a place now I never thought I would reach.  I am happy, proud, have a 3.94 GPA in college and have an amazing internship this summer.  I am living evidence that no matter how hopeless you feel and it all seems... you can get out of it and become happier and more successful.  I am driven.  I hit the ground running.  I am all about solutions, solutions, solutions.  Now, I was not like this even 2 years ago, but I finally go on the ball and now see how worth it it is to really push yourself to be productive and continue moving forward.  It's GREAT!!  There is a reason I say all this.

She is having a very hard time.  Since she left her husband she has still been extremely depressed.  She's even talked about cutting herself before.  She works the 7pm - 7am hospital shift and then comes home to sleep.  She never gets 8 hours.  6 hours is generally the best she will get.  The husband was part of the equation at first when it came to the kids. He would keep them nights when she worked but she still had to pick them up every day from school, losing sleep in the process.  Now she is working on the divorce and the attorney recommended that we cut off contact until after the divorce.  She said the judge needs to see, if even for 4 months, that she can handle the kids all on her own.  I hate not seeing/talking to her but am more than willing if it means that the kids will not have to be apart of the father's life.  I won't go into how terrible of a father he is, but he is.  She is having an even harder time with this.  She is still calling/texting me and I begin getting upset because I don't want there to be issues when it comes to the judge.  She has been very, very needy of me in general since she left her husband and I get annoyed easily.  I forget that it took me 5 years to get where I am and not am annoyed that she is not just instantly here with me.  Should I be concerned about how much she leans on me and needs me?  Calling me sometimes 8 or 9 times a day, even after I set a boundary of needing to focus on homework?  Being manipulative at times to just find ways to talk to or see me?  Not evil manipulative.. but asking if I can bring her a soda at her house or something at like 10pm when I'm studying for a test.  Or... should I realize that she left a horrible relationship not a year ago, after a crappy childhood, and is probably just in a bad place still?  She is going to therapy biweekly as well.  I just feel like I put up a boundary ""We cannot talk because your lawyer said so"" and she won't respect it. I tell her this and she says she understands and will stop but then calls me a couple days later.  Should I be patient? Annoyed? Concerned? What? I love her to death. I want to be with her and realize somethings take a long time to heal and work on... I just need to know which things I should be concerned about in the present, if any.  So sorry this was so long. Thanks for any help. Any questions are welcome if you need clarification or more info.

TL;DR: Woman was in abusive relationship, we saw each other before she left.  She has been very clingy, needy, depressed since Aug. 1, 2010, when she left. Now can't talk, based on lawyer recommendation, until divorce is final in August. I can handle it, in much better place mentally due to 5 years heavy therapy and she just started therapy. She is having very hard time with it.  What do I do? Be concerned? Patient? Worry?"

People don't seems to realize that to be a librarian (in the US) one must get their Master's from an accredited Master of Library Science Program, so I thought it would be nice to do this AMA to tell people what I'm studying, what I will be doing in my career, and generally talk about what libraries are and what librarians do.

So, to give a bit of an overview: I am in my second semester in my program, which generally runs for two years. I am trying to graduate a semester early (in Dec 2011) by taking what is scientifically known as a 'crap ton' of summer classes.

My first semester I was enrolled in Reference, Collection Development and Management, and Computer-Based Information Tools. Reference was an intro to being a Reference Librarian (shocker). Basically, we learned about various credible resources for finding out information and how best to conduct an interview with a person needing information. (That is, how to find out what a person needs to know in spite of how badly they phrase their request.)

Collection Development and Management was really interesting. As the name implies, we learned what a librarian must do to acquire and maintain a good collection. This involves: 1) Knowing the community and their wants and needs, 2) Assessing how the current collection meets those wants and needs, 3) Determining which materials should be purchased to improve the collection's quality, and 4) Removing them materials which are not an asset. This task is on-going; no collection is ever 'complete'. It is a constant job that requires a vast knowledge of popular and technical literature. For example, when Pluto was recategorized as not a planet, I would have to know that that happened, find all the science books which call it a planet, remove them because they now contain outdated information, and replace the weeded books with new ones which are accurate.

Computer-Based Information Tools was a giant headache to me. We went over simple enough topics like databases, search engines, Excel, etc, but we also did UNIX and HTML which were a challenge.

This semester I'm enrolled in Public Library Management, Cataloging, and International Information Issues. Public Library Management is pretty self-explanatory, we discuss what all must be done by a Library Manager in order to keep the library relevant and well funded. We talk about budgets and funding, issues with patrons (ie what to do when a homeless man bothers other people), privacy issues (fuck the Patriot Act), pornography, etc etc...

Catalogers are the ones who decide how a new material is sorted and labeled so that it can easily be found by anyone who wants to access it. It's a nightmare. My stress level goes through the roof when I do assignments for that class (as I ought to be doing now, final project due Thursday). There has to be a standard, of course, but how do you standardize and sort an author's imagination? or a book about the history of feminism as told by modern-day psychiatrists? It's a tedious process, let me tell you.

International Information Issues is a freakin blast. There are just 13 of us and the prof, so we just sit and chat for 2:45 each week about a variety of topics: international copyright laws, the popularity of smart phones in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wikileaks, the roll of the internet in Egypt's revolution, poverty and illiteracy... I could go on and on. It's always fascinating.

This summer, I'll be doing my internship at my hometown public library, as well as taking two workshops: learning to conserve books and to write grants.

So that's a basic overview of what I've learned and how it will be used in my career. AMA!

TL;DR: Librarians have a huge variety of skills to master in order to be good at their job.

I am not socially graceful around people I don't know really well and I am not good at sports or anything else. My mission in life is to be good at my work because that is the only thing that gives me any sort of worth.

This horrible feeling of mediocrity started when I got my SAT scores. I only got in the 80th percentile, so basically it was a miracle that my school even accepted me. Obviously I couldn't get into any of my dream schools.

Right now, I am a senior engineering student at a so-so university. My first year I did horribly - I got several F's and D's and had to drop a class. However, my second year onward I got my act together and did very well, only ever getting A's and B's and getting straight A's for 2 semesters. However, the first year still reflects on my GPA - so much that no good employer will consider me.

I keep seeing my friends around me get hired by Facebook, Microsoft, Google, TI, and other good companies. I know I will never get hired by good companies like those because my GPA is just so lackluster. I have no internship experience because every semester I was either working to get money or taking summer classes to advance my degree.

I had pushed it to the back of my mind until one of my friends heard back from Google. They asked him for his SAT score and a letter of recommendation so they could decide whether to interview him. He said maybe I should apply.

I just felt like bursting into tears - that fucking score taunted me for so long, and I thought I had left it behind me.

I remembered my dreams in high school - I thought I would do something really amazing with my life like make video games or help in feature animations.

I know this may not seem important but please consider that I have nothing else. I am not the favorite child. I have never had a girlfriend, and don't want to because I am not emotionally capable. I only really have one friend and we are drifting apart for unrelated reasons. I just don't know who else to turn to. I was hoping maybe someone here has gone through the same feelings, and maybe has some advice."

Any kind of job. Flipping burgers, I don't care. I'm a student, but I don't really require that flexible of a schedule. I have 5 day weekends, every weekend. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not stupid either. I can use a computer like a boss, I'm articulate, well groomed and work well with others. I'm outgoing and make new friends with ease.

I've tried applying online at many different businesses, none of them have yielded a response except for a Toyota dealership which is too far away to get to (I don't have a car and it would be over an hour on BART). I have tried walking into businesses, but most of them tell me they aren't hiring or I'll fill out an application and get nowhere. I had an interview at a Starbucks in a nearby city, but when I called back, the manager had no idea who I was and I definitely didn't get the job.

I have some skills and have a small portfolio of graphic design stuff that I've done, but I don't feel ready to apply for an internship or a design related job yet. I'm only half way through school. I'm pretty good in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc. and I have a couple of freelance web design jobs lined up, but the pay isn't consistent and isn't enough to be able to sustain myself. I'm still mostly relying on money from my parents, but it isn't enough. I'm 23 and have $5,000 in credit card debt, plus I've been late with my phone bill for the past three months. I need a source of income that doesn't make me feel guilty.

Am I going about this the wrong way? I've only had two other jobs in my past. I did some drafting work for my civil engineer father, and I worked at his friend's gun store on and off for about 5 years. I've never found my own job before except for the freelance design stuff I've been doing which has only made me $350 this semester.

Can you guys give me some pointers? I have no idea what to do."
gypcs,19,2011-04-27,DAE feel useless no matter how many accomplishments they have made?,smartyskirt01,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gypcs/dae_feel_useless_no_matter_how_many/,"I'm at a premier university, have a 3.9+GPA, am involved in research and internships, have tons of awards and scholarships and recognitions, people come to me for advice...and yet...

...every time some little thing doesn't go perfectly, I sink down into this crazy depression where I feel like I'm completely useless, can't do anything right, and am a horrible human being. It's like all of my self-worth is tied into achieving perfection and every time I make a mistake, I feel like the scum of the earth. Then, as is usually the case, I spiral down and the accessability of failure makes it even more and more difficult to come out of. Eventually I lose motivation for even trying, simply because I have convinced myself that I will fail no matter what. 

The same thing happens interpersonally. I go out of my way to do nice things for people, to help people when they need it or even appear to want it, and then when I receive a single piece of criticism, all of the good things that I have done or people have said to/about me disappears and all I can do is focus on the negative. 

At other times, I feel like I can accomplish anything and sign up for too many things at a time and end up overloading myself to the point that I crash once again. 

I understand what the problem is, yet I am helpless in actually doing anything about it. It's almost like I watch myself in a movie during my day-to-day life and instead of making my own decisions or actually *doing* things, I just notice myself having done things and watch the experience unfold before me. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this, and if so, how do you cope? If I focus too much on the positive, I overextend myself and end up failing. When I fail, I lose motivation and give up trying. Vicious cycle."

So, my question is: how do I best represent myself in these settings? Mention that I'm a bit older and maybe more mature than the competition? Or does that sort of raise the question of why it took me so long to get my act together and get to school? Mention previous jobs? Or do people in technical fields look down on menial job/service industry stuff enough that it would harm my chances rather than help them? 

Is there anything I should know about the process? Any protips from people who have done this before (or even people who hire for this sort of position)?

This next semester I will be a senior and part of the curriculum involves me working an externship over the summer. As far as I understand, an externship is similar to an internship, but I would get paid. (What I get paid, is absolutely up to the employer.)

This externship involves me working approximately 360 hours over the summer, which is about 9-40 hour weeks. Preferably, I'd like to be rotated around different stations or positions within the kitchen, but that is up to the employer.

I have never worked in a restaurant, but I have worked several school functions. I've taken 3 years' worth of culinary classes, and have a great grasp on the basics of cooking and baking. Among the courses I've taken are Classical French Cuisine, Baking, Garde Manger, and a Bistro class (Essentially a student-run restaurant). I learn relatively easily and work well with other people.

So needless to say, since I'm a full time student, I've been watching these with some trees the last few weeks.

It seems to me that these shows are most comparable to the  gladiator fights of ancient Rome. I had this original thought reading the IAMA Maury Intern a few days ago. She said that the show isn't so much racially exploitative as much as it is exploitative of our lower social class. She also said the guests get paid a small amount of money ($150) and they are encouraged and amped up to fight before the show.

So, in essence, we are putting our lower class on stage in front of an audience to fight each other; verbally as is most accepted these days, but often they break into the physical. To complete the comparison the audience is constantly booing or clapping in the most basic of reactions to complicated situations, and they seem to follow the gist of whoever is playing the Emperor role (be it Jerry Springer, Maury, or Steve.)

So, someone should make me a picture of Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator with his thumb in the middle position and put Maury's face on it. It will be a wonderful piece of social commentary, and I think I'd enjoy it in my current state.

Why don't I do it? Too busy with my trees. :)"

I have been coding as a hobby since I was 14 (20m currently) and I even feel like I am learning nothing significant while in class. I have been getting As on everything till this point, all homework, quizzes and tests have been 90 or greater. My code compiles correctly and I have just one logical error in the code, which has now been fixed. My teacher took off 50% from my midterm grade because of this single error.

I have been fucking livid since I got my grade back, this would never happen on a math test. This takes out 7.5% of the total points for the class. I sent him an email asking if I can fix it and at least get credit for the code after the error. I haven't been sleeping well, I just barely made it to class that day and had a rather huge panic attack during the midterm.

I need some advice on how to handle this situation, I want to stay in the good graces of the faculty since it can get me an internship and I want my grades to be accurate to my abilities.

Information that may be relevant:
I am a pretty decent 20m college student.
My teacher is an old guy, looks about 47 give or take 3 years.
I have currently lost 8.5% on my total grade for the class, I can still pull off an A if I study my ass off for the last written exam."
