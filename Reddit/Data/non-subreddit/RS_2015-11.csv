I applied for a dev internship at a great company but during the hiring process I learnt that they were only hiring quantitative analyst interns (more math focused). Despite being pretty bad at the math section of the interview I got offered the internship and accepted since it was an amazing opportunity and I figured they wouldn’t hire me for something I wasn’t suitable for. 

So I started a couple of weeks ago and it has become obvious that I am way below the usual standard for an intern. All the other interns are (male) math majors and significantly more knowledgeable about everything we are working on. Initially the FT employees were receptive to my questions but as time has passed I can see them getting fed up and unimpressed with how little I know. I actually really like the company and think that I could like the job if I was given proper training but it doesn't seem like this is going to happen. 

I am trying to stay positive but it is really knocking my confidence feeling so stupid all the time. All the other interns have produced about 5 times as much work as me because it is taking me so long to read up on everything I don’t know. I can’t think of any reason that I was hired besides being female (which I know they are actively trying to recruit) and whilst I wouldn’t mind this if I was actually good at the job I just feel embarrassed by it right now. I don’t know whether to stick out the internship for the next 3 months because it will look great on my CV or whether I should just quit now because it is destroying my confidence. Any help?

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone that took the time to write these replies. I was honestly expecting a couple of people to say that I should just quit and find a job that I'm good at but since everyone is so adamant that I should stick it out I will give it my best. At the moment it seems like my skills are just a subset of the skills of all the other interns and it seems like they can do everything that I can and more but if I think of a way that I can contribute in particular I will suggest it to my supervisor. I have been told that I compare myself to others too much and it's something I'm trying to work on - if I take a step back and just think about my performance then I do think I am probably improving."

so I've gotten some good news from my manager lately. I started at this company as an IT intern in Tier 2 about June of this year, my title specifically being ""IT Consultant"", and it is a pretty open ended internship. (meaning I could choose to work on a project that was challenging, furthered my career, and solved a need for the company).

Fast forward up until now, I have learned enough powershell scripting to do automation tasks and I am developing small tools to help out the back end team. There was a huge management shake which left my current boss's boss to be a different person and apparently, my current boss is/was the only one whose position did not change dramatically.

I am seriously considering doing PowerShell and SCCM automation as a career now due to the fact that, my manager has given me serious responsibility - he gave me the same privileges that he has on SCCM and it is more than some of the other (more senior members in terms of overall IT experience).

The issue is that, I may or may not be converted to a different contract, or have my contract extended. My manager has constantly reminded me that I am an intern in title only, and it has taken me some time to really get that in my head and realize the responsibility that is required in administering servers from SCCM standpoint and given others reports (such as which production servers are being patched when).

My questions are two part:
1) How much can a junior SCCM automation engineer make as a starting point in their career ? (I am in the Washington D.C. Metro area).

2) Would you bet your career on PowerSHell development and SCCM automation, knowing that Microsoft is/has been pushing PowerShell from the past several years and really trying to automate the point-and-click part of IT Administration?

(My plan B is finishing up my B.S. in Software Development degree in Java/Android, I have not been told a definite 'Yes' or 'No' from my manager regarding my contract extension, and My contract will end November (this month) if my boss's boss decide not to keep me around for whatever reason.)

Thank you for your time and advice."
3r37vp,0,2015-11-01,Need Advice: Keep Saving or Pay Off Loans?,throwawayoilfieldpay,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3r37vp/need_advice_keep_saving_or_pay_off_loans/,"Hello Everyone,


Currently I am working in the oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico. As everyone knows prices are really cheap, great for economy but not so good for us oilfield workers. There has been a lot of downsizing in the beginning of this year and there could be more next year. The number of offshore rigs has decreased considerably. So I been debating a lot for months about what I should do with my money. Save or pay off loans?




* Annual Salary: $60,000 - 80,000
* Savings (Emergency Fund): $20,200 
* Car Loan: $12,823 at 4.5% interest rate, min pay $390
* Student Loan: $4,700 at 5.0% interest rate, min pay $66
* Credit Card: $2,200 at 0% interest rate till 2018, min pay $39 (interest goes to 19% after January 2018)




Monthly bills add up to $2,000. 
For the bills I cut out everything that wasn't needed. 
Necessities (groceries,gas,toiletries,pets,etc) on average is $500-700.
I also have medical and 401k coming out pretax. 




After all this I usually have about $300 - 700 left. Up until August I was putting it towards paying my second car and I finally paid it off (I don't have this car anymore, car crash). My plan was to then use that money to pay off my other car.




I keep hearing from people that the oilfield will not pick up till 2018. Add that with more and more companies slowing down with drilling and I'm not sure what to do. Should I use my spare money towards further increasing my emergency fund? Or Use it towards paying off my loans? 




I'm really worried that I might lose my job and the amount of time it would take to find another. I have an engineering degree so I should be okay but I also have to worry about my wife. She's going to school right now for a few more years. I wouldn't stress so much if I could move elsewhere but I really don't want to do that to my wife. She's put a lot of time into school and transferring is always such a headache. But the positive side is that tuition is incredibly cheap so we wouldn't want to move since that would mean an increase in tuition for her.




I keep going back and forth between saving and paying off the loans. It's starting to stress me out pretty bad. I keep thinking about how amazing it would be to pay off my car loan or my student loan sooner. But then I think what if I get laid off and only have 5-8 months of emergency fund. I would have to look for another job in a state that currently is not hiring for my field. I can't move because of school. I honestly would not mind working retail/restaurants but not sure if I could afford all the bills. 

My wife doesn't work and I will not let her because I want her to focus on keeping her high GPA. She tried working part time but it affected her GPA. School is paid by loans she took out. During the summer she gets internships that pay minimum wage, so that will help a little. 


I have all these scenarios running in my head and I'm just looking for what other people would do in my situation, unbiased opinions.


Thank you for reading! All help is appreciated.

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

We have one day set aside where I would like to get some diving in and my wife would like to try a discover scuba. I'm looking for recommendations as there are so many operators in the area.

When I started I never did a discover scuba, so I'm not 100% sure what the normal is. Obviously I want her to have the best experience, here's what I had in mind:

1) Some pool work in the morning, then out on the boat for a shallow reef dive in the afternoon.

2) A fantastic instructor is the most important thing here. I don't want some place that is constantly cycling interns.



Then myself(AOW, nitrox, drysuit), I haven't ocean dove before. All my experience has been in cold dark lakes with poor visibility(typically 3 to maybe 10 ft.).

1) I'd like to do two deeper dives in the morning, then tag along with my wife and her instructor when they do the shallow reef dive in the afternoon.

2) I'll be by myself in the morning, so I'd like to pair up with someone else on the boat. I've noticed some operators don't allow this -- I don't really want to shell out 70-100 bucks for a guide.

3) I'd like to avoid the ""cattle car experience"" that I've heard so much about.


Based on what I have in mind, are my expectations reasonable and any recommendations?"

I made a reddit specifically to ask this question. This may be very long and have a lot of explaining in it (it may not be very coherent either), and I am sorry

My mom is extremely emotionally and verbally abuse to me and my father. It is an everyday occurrence for my father, he is forced to leave the room whenever she enters, and he is yelled at for eating. He is forced to sleep on the floor in either the living room, or must be confined to sleep in his recliner within his office room. He is called horrible names, and is forced to pay almost all of the bills for the mortgage and everything else because she won't even speak to him. She has physically assaulted him on numerous occasions, threatened to hurt him with knives, scratched, smacked, thrown things at him, and the police had been involved before. This is not even 10% of the manipulations and emotional abuse she pulls, on me and him both. Dad definitely has it the worst though.

Well she has been even more emotionally abuse towards me than usual as of late, because I have had to take off for the first time this semester off from school, and I am without a job. 

I had a very good internship which I finished less than a year ago, and I have been taking 15-18 credits a semester since I have graduated high school, and that includes summers. I had to take off because my money is bad and I can't afford to go, and I wasn't working while in school after my internship because I needed to focus on my school work, which I was struggling in. 

I have been looking for a job for months, but have had to recently quit because I have a very large swelling of my lymph node on one side of my neck, and have been feeling like absolute shit. I got it looked at in the ER and they said they thought I had mono, but I tested negative. They sent me off, but it has gotten worst and I feel worst.

My mom has been telling me I have been doing nothing because I am lazy, and that I am actually not sick and am actually feeling fine (regardless of the huge swelling on my neck). 

Well I started to feel bad about myself, and was getting worried for my health, so I went to see a family doctor. He reaffirmed me in being worried, and he says my swelling on my neck is extremely unusual for mono, and now I have to see him again in a few days as well as get a CT scan. He says that it is something to be concerned of.

Well that doctor's visit was 2 days ago, and when I came home my mom asked me what the doctor said. I told her that he said I was actually sick and that my neck is something to be concerned of, and she again told me it was because I ""don't do anything"" and that it is mono (even though the tests are negative) and literally anything else she could think of.

I got really upset, and I totally snapped and called her out on all the horrible ways she treats me and my dad, and I told her how she was physically abuse to me as a child. She totally denied it, even though she had hit me just a few weeks ago! 

Safe to say she doesn't hit me very frequently anymore now that I am bigger, but she completely denies ever physically abusing me as a kid. She was smack me across my face and pull my hair whenever I did something wrong. She denies it ever being a frequent thing but it was. She totally denies it. She would be so angry when she would hit me, she would grit her teeth and scream and then slap me in the face so hard it would sometimes ring me silly. 

Sometimes I would try to run away but she would chase me and corner me in my room. I used to have dreams of her plotting to kill me, and I once had a dream the attacked me with a knife. 

My dad downplays it because he usually wasn't there, but he was on occasion and I remember instances where he had to put himself between us. I feel like he denies it because he feels partially responsible and wasn't always present when it happened, and now my mom is holding that against me as ammunition as well.

She said all kinds of other horrible things to me that day, but her denial is what really got to me the most.

Just about an hour ago, she came to my room (where I hole myself up when we're both home) to give me some half-asses apology about ""how she is sorry about how we don't get along"". 

I told her I forgave her even though it will happen again, and she got upset and said I should apologize to. I said I apologize only for the things I had said which I intended to be hurtful, but the merit of what I was saying about her abuse and past abuse I wouldn't apologize for.

She then immediately again denied physically abusing me as a kid by slapping me in my face all the time, and said that I ""have a psycological disorder"" that makes me think that, and she refuses to acknowledge that any of that ever happened.

I feel crazy. I only have partial validation from my dad on this, who I think is playing both sides a bit, because again I believe he feels he is partially responsible, and also wasn't there for all of it nor wants to further invoke my mom's anger. 

Am I wrong in saying this was physical abuse? I almost feel stupid for asking, I don't want to know to use it as a weapon against my mom; I don't even want to speak to her, and I regret even having mentioned it. I just want to feel validated that it was abusive.

 But I feel crazy now, I read some of others' stories here of being tied up and such, and nothing like that happened to me. But she WOULD hit me across my face HARD frequently, and I was scared to death of her when she was angry, to the point where she frequented my nightmares. 

I'm starting to feel like I am just oversensitive and maybe she is right and I wasn't abused. She makes me feel so shitty about myself to the point where I had used to be suicidal, but maybe I am wrong in this part. I just want to know what others think. 

Thanks for reading this far and I'm really really sorry for how incoherent and scattered it all is, I'm just feeling really depressed with my life right now. Thank you for reading all this and I'm sorry"
3r44t9,2,2015-11-01,"An email I just sent to Nate Silver, the statistician who founded FiveThirtyEight, subject: ""Women's thoughts on sexism in the Democratic primaries?""",bunnylover726,GrassrootsLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrassrootsLetters/comments/3r44t9/an_email_i_just_sent_to_nate_silver_the/,"If you've never heard of Nate Silver, he's the editor in chief and founder of FiveThirtyEight, a website with statistical analysis of stuff in the news. He's very well respected by the media, and I was thinking that if Nate Silver did an analysis of the claims of sexism in the campaign, the media would run wild with it. Anyway, this is his email: nrsilver@fivethirtyeight.com and here's what I wrote:

&gt; Dear Mr. Silver,

&gt; My name is (obviously female name), and I'm a scientist and engineer following the presidential primaries. I love reading FiveThirtyEight because data driven analysis of politics means so much more than random opinions and fluff. **To save your valuable time, I put the TL;DR, the questions that could be answered by data/analysis in bold.**

&gt; I've noticed that the media, superPACs (like Emily's List) and voters have all had different opinions on Secretary Clinton's accusations that Senator Sanders is sexist. [Some say it's ""ridiculous"".](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/hillary_clinton_is_smearing_bernie_sanders_as_a_sexist_it_s_an_insult_to.html) Mika Brzenzinski called it ""pathetic"". [Others are painting Bernie as being careless and maybe putting out insinuations that he is sexist.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-sexism-bernie-sanders-215375)

&gt; [An article was also recently put out by Salon citing anecdotal evidence that Sanders has mostly male supporters.](http://www.salon.com/2015/10/26/lets_storm_the_sanders_he_man_women_haters_club_hillary_plays_the_gender_card_while_bernie_fans_rage/) and it was picked apart by [an article from Jacobin citing data from a poll by YouGov and The Economist.](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/10/clinton-sanders-democratic-presidential-primary-caucuses/) (The Jacobin article links to the raw poll data, but I'm sure you've seen it already).

&gt; I apologize for what was basically a ""dump"" of links. I know you (obviously) follow the news and that was probably unnecessary. The media is once again painting a political picture without collecting data, based on whims and anecdotes and opinions. I'm a Sanders supporter, but before that, I'm a statistics supporter. **Is there any data indicating how many women think Sanders is sexist?** I could write emails to polling agencies all day, but I'm just a random girl (yeah, I'm pretty young) from Ohio. Whereas you're *Nate Silver.*

&gt; **Because Clinton is a member of a ""special interest group""** (in quotes because women are around half the population but are still viewed differently by the political machine) **wouldn't it make sense to collect and analyze that sort of data?**

&gt; There's a book, *Big Girls Don't Cry: The Election That Changed Everything For American Women* by Rebecca Traister that I'm almost done reading. It discusses the 2008 election. Traister isn't a statistician, she writes about politics and gender for Salon. But it's easy to tell that she writes more as a journalist (hooray facts and citations) than as a gender studies theorist. Before calling Secretary Clinton's claims of sexism, ""pathetic"", Mika Brzenzinski said that Secretary Clinton has faced ""real"" sexism. The book I mentioned is a valuable source of those incidents of ""real sexism"" (the author cites her sources to go back to). The book mentions that the feminist blog ""Shakesville"" has been tagging posts with ""Hillary Sexism Watch"" since the 2008 primaries. Blogs aren't really my style because they're just opinions, but I mentioned it to show you how the feminists on the far left are painting Senator Sanders. (If you need more relevant page numbers/quotes from that book, you can ask me- I highlighted and annotated my copy for reference. But it's also cheap and a would be a quick read for a staffer and/or intern to highlight/sticky note a copy for you).

&gt; The book seems to suggest that it was sexism that propelled Clinton to have a surge in the polls during the 2008 primary season. I'm going to quote the prominent excerpt, from page 98:

&gt; ""But what centrist politics and flawed self-presentation should have gotten Hillary was a lost caucus, then a lost primary, and then more lost caucuses and primaries, until at some point she was out of the race and pundits could shake their heads and score her errors. But that was not what was happening in the first week of January. She had lost a single caucus, and instead of simply reporting on it her critics had rolled around in it, celebrated it, made it mean exponentially more than it ever should have. Their ardor for Clinton's abasement had reverberated with an unmistakable vibe, the loosening of a clenched resentment that it had been a chick who had dared be confident about her ability to win the Democratic nomination, who had exercised infuriatingly tight control over the press, who had for more than a year appeared to exert unrelenting dominion over her male competitors."" The author also mentions many remarks by Chris Matthews as part of this. She dedicates a whole book chapter, Chapter 7: ""Boys On The Bus"" to sexism among liberal/democratic men.

&gt; **Mr. Silver, is their any actual data backing up Rebecca Traister's assertions that sexism helped Senator Clinton perform better in the 2008 primaries?** It's too late to poll people in 2008, but **could this sort of thing happen again if liberal commentators and Sanders supporters say the wrong things? Could someone collect or at least watch and analyze data on that front to see what people think? Or the likelihood of that being a real thing? Many feminists have been saying ""You can't be a feminist unless you vote for Hillary Clinton."" How many women agree with that statement? How many self-identified ""feminists"" agree with that statement? (Liberal pointer- some men also identify as feminists, so a gender split in polling of self-identified feminists could be indicated and reported.) What about an analysis of the voting records and previous statements between the two candidates related to women and women's issues?**

&gt; For the voting records, according to VoteSmart, [Senator Clinton didn't vote on S Amdt 3330](http://votesmart.org/bill/5719/16080/55463/grants-to-organizations-which-perform-abortions#.VjZgzCtvCQI) (Grants to organizations that perform abortions) on 10/18/07, [HR 3963](http://votesmart.org/bill/5729/16159/55463/childrens-health-insurance-program-reauthorization-act-of-2007-chip#.VjZhBCtvCQI) (CHIP reauthorization act of 2007) on 11/1/07 or [S Amdt 3896](http://votesmart.org/bill/6286/17357/55463/prohibiting-the-funds-in-s-1200-from-being-used-for-abortions#.VjZgyStvCQI) (Prohibiting the funds in S1200 from being used for abortions) on 2/26/08. Maybe she was too busy campaigning to be in Congress, I don't know. But other than those votes, both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders have excellent records of introducing and voting for legislature that benefits women. 

&gt; **Another data question: Issue Salience?** [This paper](http://sppc2014.indiana.edu/Papers/Bromley-Trujillo%20et%20al.pdf) was sent to me on that topic. It talks about climate change, but I think the same concept applies to women's issues. **Is there data on how many women would vote for the first woman president just because she's a woman?** I imagine the results of a good anonymous poll on that would be interesting either way. **How many women consider ""women's issues"" to be a top priority? Do women care more about abortion and contraception than the economy? Does Gallup have data on how many women are even in support of things like abortion, contraception and comprehensive sex ed?** I was raised in the pro-life movement and can tell you that certainly not all women are in agreement on that. **What about childcare? Headstart? Pre-K? Maternity leave? Paternity leave?** (Paternity leave is one of the best ways to level the playing field between men and women and is touted by famous feminist Gloria Steinem).    

&gt; **I'm sure that there's a lot of questions to ask, polling to be conducted and data to analyze on women in the election. I bet it would get FiveThirtyEight a lot of site traffic too :)**

My boyfriend and I of about ~4 years have been long-distance for a little over half of our relationship when I moved cross-country to go to college. We got together when we were very young (met in high school) and essentially grew up with one another. He is wonderful to me, and perfect for me. We always laugh together, we get over fights within minutes, we are kind and loving. We understand each other on a level that I thought was impossible. I can't see myself with anyone else in my life.



I think it is important to note that I have been suffering from depression and suicidal ideations for about four years now. I have sabotaged many relationships because I have never felt worthy of people's love or friendship. I feel like I deserve to be alone.



Almost exactly a year ago I met a guy at an internship and he quickly took a liking to me. At social events, he made me feel pretty uncomfortable but I just ignored him because I didn't want to start anything with people from work. Then one night, a bunch of work friends went out drinking. I drank a shit ton and blacked out and woke up in his bed. Hating myself. How I could do anything like this to my boyfriend was completely beyond me and I didn't know how to cope. I couldn't tell my boyfriend. I thought that maybe if I tried to get to know this guy and found out that he ""wasn't so bad after all"" it would help me feel better about what I did. (Looking back, I don't know where this logic came from). I didn't find him attractive. I didn't even like him that much. I didn't care about him in the slightest. But I continued an affair with him.



Meanwhile, my boyfriend is across the country confused as to why I am acting distant and cold. I came home in December, and he went on vacation with me and my family. On the last night, still confused from my behavior from the previous semester, he went through my phone and found out I had cheated on him. The drive home was one of the worst things I've ever experienced. I swore to him that I would block this guy on all forms of social media and I ""dumped"" the guy without a second thought. After three weeks of horrible confusion, countless almost-breakups, and literally begging for him to give me another chance, he decides to forgive me and move on. It was a really rough time. He gave me a beautiful diamond promise ring at this time, about three weeks after he found out.



Two days after he gave me this promise ring, I had a trip to Asia scheduled to conduct some field research for a project in school that I was involved in. This was really hard for him because our communication was incredibly limited for two weeks, during his time of need and healing. I felt awful that I couldn't be there for him. After the trip, I was able to go home for two days and see him before school started again. The months following were hard, including moments where I found out he had gone through my Facebook, but we worked through them and began the rebuilding process.



Fast forward a couple months. I was taking a class with a young-ish professor who ripped my grade apart on every assignment. This was a subject that I was previously very strong in, so to receive copious amounts of negative feedback about my performance was really hard for me. I put all my effort into the assignments but was still not receiving the grades that I wanted. Not only was the subject difficult, but the professor was also giving me weird vibes about halfway through the semester. I knew something was up when the professor emailed me about a non-academic related topic. I responded. He continued to keep tiptoeing the line but never actually crossed any line. On the last day of classes, he told me some very personal things about himself during office hours when I went to check my final grade, including information about how he had slept with students before and how he currently had a girlfriend. He also told me ""After today, I am no longer your professor. We are equals.""



He gave me an A even though I knew I deserved, at most, a B. I felt really guilty about my grade because I knew I didn't deserve it, but I have an immense amount of pressure to keep my grades up as I have plans to go to law school after graduation. However, he told me, ""The numbers are the numbers,"" and I awkwardly said thank you before heading out. He quickly packed up his stuff and followed me and asked me if I wanted to take a walk on-campus with him. I said yes (and didn't listen to my gut). During the walk, he proceeded to tell me about his research and things he liked to do when he was younger and I listened, but I didn't find him or anything he had to say interesting. Then he said something very shocking to me: ""How badly do you want this A?""



You can guess the rest of the story. I said yes for the second fucking time and I hated myself for it. I was too scared to report what happened to the university and I felt like it was entirely my fault. I felt like a whore -- weak, disgusting, and used up. It was also after the last day of classes, so it wasn't like he was formally considered my instructor anymore. While it was happening, I was completely numb, just lying there and letting him have his way with me. When he left, I started sobbing. I was so confused and angry and my self-hatred was at an all-time high. I called one of my friends to come over so I could talk to someone about it, and in my sadness and confusion, my friend kissed me. I felt like he took advantage of my weakness and vulnerability but I didn't stop him. So we also hooked up. That same fucking day. I hate them both.



Since then, I have a recurrent nightmare of my professor in which he is shaped like a monster, with green eyes and horns and a lizard tongue, chasing me and asking me how badly I want the A. As soon as he gets me, I wake up.



I took the longest shower at the end of that day. I wanted to kill myself. I felt pretty coerced by my professor, and even though I never stopped him I wanted to so badly. Something was holding me back. Is this considered rape? I'm not sure. I know this is completely my fault. I never told my boyfriend about any of this and I don't know how I ever can. If he finds out that I lied to him and cheated AGAIN, after breaking his heart once and after he gave me a promise ring, we're completely done. I don't know what I'm going to do without him. It's almost like I know this relationship is doomed but I'm hanging on to every last moment because I am only happy when I'm with him. I feel like everything will be better once we're no longer long-distance. He forgave me once, but how could I possibly explain that I made the same mistake two more times during our time of healing?



Another important note is that I know it's so easy to judge the cheater. I've wanted to die for so long and prove to everyone that they'd be better off without me. I know I'm a piece of shit but I can't find the strength to tell my boyfriend the truth. I have always relied on validation from men to feel good about myself. I don't know how else to get self-respect. I really fucking hate myself, but I am so in love with my boyfriend. Just trying to figure out why I would do so much fucked up shit to him. This is all my fault. This guilt really makes me want to kill myself. I cry myself to sleep every night.



I don't know what to say to my boyfriend or how to say it.



tl;dr: Suicidal, depressed for 4 years. Cheated on my boyfriend, then was coerced by professor to hook up for a grade. THEN hooked up with another guy in numb confusion. Still in love with my boyfriend. Don't know what to do now."

* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries.

**#1: The Intern**
I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom).

**#2: The Office Affair**
Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...
***
I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

3r4w8k,1,2015-11-01,Want to move to Israel - and have some questions about jobs. Please answer if you have spare time!,martalt,Israel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/3r4w8k/want_to_move_to_israel_and_have_some_questions/,"Hi Guys,

I fear this may be somewhat of a long post. I just have some questions about moving to Israel and specifically finding employment there.

My general query is about how quick can I expect to find suitable employment in Israel post-aliyah and if there are websites/services that can help me with planning.

For background, I'm from Azerbaijan; 24 y.o., and *not* Jewish according to halakha (my father is Jewish). That said, I qualify for the Law of Return (according to the Jewish Agency), but mentioning this in case it can create additional hurdles.

I've been to Israel a couple of times visiting relatives; my Hebrew skills are pretty terrible and amount to ordering stuff at cafes and asking for directions. I understand a lot of what's being said but that's about it.

My English is pretty top-notch and I've graduated (BA+MPhil/MSc) from a top-10 British institution. Lived in the UK for like 6 years; have about 3.5 years of working experience in 3 countries; mostly in entry-level positions.

The biggest problem is that I have next to no savings (like 5k USD to be exact); so if I do make aliyah and don't find a job pretty soon I'll be broke.

I so far understand it's nigh impossible finding a job given my level of Hebrew. Is that true? I know about ulpan arrangements but I just really don't fancy being unemployed until I do finish ulpan, because of money situation.

I've also just today discovered jinternship programs, which seem pretty swell because they generally don't require anything above basic hebrew skills. Does anyone know if any of these programs are paid? 

Please understand I'm not looking for some super-salary here, just for a way to make aliyah and make myself financially independent. Any internship that at least compensates me somewhat would work.

I have decent-level working experience in marketing, QHSE, oil/gas industry, sports events management, real estate, and academic (history/philosophy) research. Some of these have been at big, known companies.

I speak fluent Russian and Turkish in addition to English.

So that's about it, if anyone with recent aliyah experience can help, that'd be swell. If someone provides an action plan then great. I'm not in a particular state of hurry, so I can put in some arrangements and start learning proper Hebrew before I make aliyah. That said, I'd rather be in Israel in about 5-6 months from now.

But will I?,NJ_Yankees_Fan,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/3r5a5u/i_feel_like_my_problem_is_i_havent_found_my/,"I'm a 21 year old college senior, and professionally I'm doing pretty well. My grades are solid and I'm graduating in May, I've had internship opportunities and I'm getting better at my craft.

But socially, I've struggled my entire life. I have Aspergers and social anxiety, so it's been so hard making friends. I have had fun with people in general, but I've never been able to have a consistent circle of friends. I know people and then they exit my life. Maybe I just don't make the initiative. I've never had someone I can rely on to be there for me and for me to be there for them.

I can't even go out anymore because nobody ever invites me. I often have to invite myself, other times I go out and I have nobody to talk to. I feel like I'm the weird guy nobody likes and nobody invited. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but not necessarily for no reason.

Honestly, all I want is to have people to be close to and maybe get an apartment with when I graduate. But it's more likely that I'm just going back to my mom's house when I'm done school, and I don't know anyone in her area since we moved after I graduated high school.

I feel like I have made improvements, but I'm not even close to where I want to be. It's freaking hard. IDK what it is. I feel like I'm so paranoid and I never take risks.

I also have problems interacting with women. I feel so stupid, because they're people too, but I'm just scared to talk to them because I'm convinced I'm just going to get rejected, because I always do.

I think I've met a couple of people who want to be in my life, but will circumstances bounce my way? I just feel so paranoid and unworthy of anyone's affection.

Honestly, I'm so sick of being an outcast. I never know what's wrong, or if there's anything wrong and I'm just too scared. Uncertainty is the worst feeling in the world. "

My boyfriend and I of about ~4 years have been long-distance for a little over half of our relationship when I moved cross-country to go to college. We got together when we were very young (met in high school) and essentially grew up with one another. He is wonderful to me, and perfect for me. We always laugh together, we get over fights within minutes, we are kind and loving. We understand each other on a level that I thought was impossible. I can't see myself with anyone else in my life.



I think it is important to note that I have been suffering from depression and suicidal ideations for about four years now. I have sabotaged many relationships because I have never felt worthy of people's love or friendship. I feel like I deserve to be alone.



Almost exactly a year ago I met a guy at an internship and he quickly took a liking to me. At social events, he made me feel pretty uncomfortable but I just ignored him because I didn't want to start anything with people from work. Then one night, a bunch of work friends went out drinking.

I'm doing all the education I can but to get full certification I have to get work experience as a pm, and we all know how easy it is to get a job without prior experience (cue hysterical laughter, crying). 

Right now I work at a tea shop which in a way is pretty amazing because I'm obsessed with tea. But pretty not amazing because 1 hr+ commute and minimum wage in the bay area. So it basically only just covers daycare as long as I eat cheap sandwiches for lunch. I'd totally bring my own but we're not technically allowed to use the fridge for our own stuff. So on the off chance one of my hard-ass employers are in that day I could be out a lunch. (yes I have witnessed people throwing out someone's lunch) 

And just all the ""fun"" stuff that comes along with working for a big-ish corporation (shit scheduling to cut costs ie, no breaks). I'll be scheduled till 1 so it looks good to the company but the day before (or the day of) I get asked to stay longer (cuz really, how can I leave at 1 if no one else is coming in until 1:30??). So any plans I wanted to make are out the window (cue messy house, crying). I get all excited about having a couple days to myself to catch up on said messy house and my certification only to be asked to work. Yeah I know I can say no, but it's still a shitty position to be in. It's on the minimum wage slaves save their asses because they wanted to look good in front of corporate. 

I'm so tired at the end of the day. Especially if they have me working up to the second I have to leave to get my kid from daycare. (omg this is turning so long) Anyway, it sucks to be so tired because I have no energy for my kid at the end of the day, and I get more grumpy with him than I'd like. I want to be close with him and play and have fun with him. It's been rough enough that I passed out at work, likely due to stress. I also had (possibly still have) a cyst on the inside of my wrist. Which means a lot of work stuff is difficult and can result in a night of intense pain. I got a week of ""light work"" which for me meant having someone with me at all times to open tea tins (the lids are on there ridiculously tight) and stock items. The times I've been left alone (lol what are drs orders??) I've had to have customers open their tea tins so I could make their drinks. People would walk out because I was taking so long to do everything one handed. My heels are bruised because I was an idiot and went walking for too long wearing flip flops. And how do bruised heels get better, you ask? Staying off your feet hahahah (more sobbing, feet rubbing). 

It's so much piling on and I'm not looking forward to the holidays at all. Part of the reason I took this job is because they led me to believe I'd be able to become a manager and possibly serve tea at events (free tea at pride, festivals etc.). They said it'd be especially likely because there are more stores opening all the time. So, a store is about to open close to my house and I think I'm a shoe-in for assistant manager. Nope. Given to the guy who's worked half the time I have. Because I'm a mom. Not even joking. This was all explained to me in this way like ""oh I don't want you to miss out with the little one"". He goes to bed at 8, I can drive over and close at least if I need to after he's in bed. Also, my husband is capable, if he needed to he could take care of kiddo. 

It feels really shitty to miss out on advancement because I'm a mom. Yes I do have to get my son at daycare by 6. Maybe I'd get a nanny for after if I got paid enough! But let's be honest, that nanny will be making more than me, so not worth it. I know I said I want to be a pm but I think it'd be pretty kick-ass to be more involved in the tea business. Hell I could do both.

Ugh getting that out helped. Now I just need to figure out what to do. I'm getting the certificate, but how do I get any kind of office job that doesn't require a bunch of experience? Should I look for an internship? I have some experience managing people and products from my previous job but not five years. I'm really damn good at organizing, planning and scheduling. What I've learned about being a project manager has been awesome, and I used to do stuff like it for my old church so I know I can do it. I'm good at working with people and getting things done diplomatically. It's so daunting seeing all the requirements for jobs though and I worry I'm not good enough. 

Right now part of me wants to quit and focus all my time finishing my certificate and job hunting. The other part thinks I should just keep working where I am until I can find another job. If I do the first one I'll have way more time to finish and look for a job but then we're out the meager amount I bring home. The second option gives the income but it's pretty draining emotionally and physically.


I'm going to try and apply to eight places this week. There's one that looks promising. It's a startup with vague enough language that I think I could do it. 

Well that's all I think. Any advice/kick in the butt is appreciated. I know the list of bad at the tea shop is long, but there are good parts. I love being able to talk about tea to whomever wants to listen. I like making stuff for people that they enjoy. But as much as I like it I don't know that it's sustainable. I don't expect to be district manager next week but I also don't want to be on the bottom because I'm a mom. Ok I think now that's all.

Also the cats have fleas wooo (crying, explosions, vacuuming the carpets ragged)"
3r5wfk,7,2015-11-01,What is your advice for an early careerist? How did you get into your current role?,Uhhhhlisha,healthcare,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/3r5wfk/what_is_your_advice_for_an_early_careerist_how/,"I am reaching out in hopes to get some insight, advice, and perhaps direction when it comes to being an early careerist and getting your foot in the door. I recently graduated from a CAHME accredited Master's program for Health Services Administration and although I have been working in a hospital for over 4 years, had two wonderful (but short) internships, competed twice at the UAB Health Administration Case Competition, and am a co-author on two chapters in ""The Handbook of Healthcare Management"", I fear I don't look great on paper. There are a lot of characteristics and strengths I feel I possess and could contribute to an organization, such as my ability to learn new concepts, programs, technology, and roles very quickly and with little assistance, i am a self-learner and have taught myself how to do things outside of my field such as basic coding and applications development, just to name a few. However, these skills and capabilities are not necessarily transferable to paper (or if they are, I have yet to be advised on how to do so).

Has anyone ever been in this type of situation and if so how did you overcome it? Where did you begin your career in healthcare and how did you get to where you are?"
3r60cr,11,2015-11-01,[M4A] [M4M] Re: HR Policy Clarification [Office],booksmut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3r60cr/m4a_m4m_re_hr_policy_clarification_office/,"I want to tell you that I love you.

I can already hear how you'd react: you'd furrow your eyebrows slightly, and there'd be the faintest hint of a frown at the corners of your mouth, that one that you get when somebody hasn't met your expectations. And then you'd say that I don't really know you, so how I could I say I love you? Okay, fine, then, maybe I don't love you. In that case: I want to tell you that I want to love you.

But the thing is, I do know you. I know you better than your employees, I know you better than your employers, and I sure as hell know you better than the friends you play golf with on Wednesday afternoons. (And ever notice how all of your ""friends"" are also your colleagues?) I knew you were nervous before your presentation in front of the Board last week--or at least I knew you were something I'd never seen you before in the year that I've worked here, even more tense, even quicker to anger. And when you came out of the meeting and you walked back to your office and Jamison asked you how it went and you said ""fine"" and you shut your door and didn't leave until 9:00, I knew it hadn't gone fine at all.

And I know you love your family. I know you keep that picture of them, your spouse and your young children, on your desk because you really do love them. I know that you do all this for them, and I know you worry that it's not enough, or that it's too much--that maybe working like you do to keep them more than comfortable has been a mistake. I know you feel guilty about that, and I know that you feel even guiltier about the fact that when you are home, you feel like you're suffocating. I know that you feel like you're hemmed in, like you spend your time moving from one little square box to another--from your house to your car to the train to your office to your vacation house on weekends. I know you look back at your life, and the choices you've made in it are starting to look less like choices and more like sentences. I know you feel like you'll never do anything ever again, really *do* something, make a choice or take an action that hasn't already been predetermined by your responsibilities or your duties or your obligations.

And I know you probably think I have nothing to offer you: you're successful, worldly, experienced, and I'm just some kid. Okay then, fine--if I have nothing to offer you, I won't offer you anything. I'll step inside your office door, and lock it, and turn to you, and I'll take off the tie my parents gave me as a graduation present, and I'll strip off the suit I bought with money I didn't yet have to start this job, and I'll slowly unbutton my shirt and let it slide off of my shoulders and puddle around my ankles on the floor. And I'll step forward, I'll step toward you, naked and trembling and bare and yes: with nothing to offer you.

I want to tell you that I love you.

So what was it that I did tell you this morning, when I came into the office? What was it I said?

""Here's your coffee, Mr. Rosetti.""

*Hey there--thanks for reading this far! I'm new to dpp, but hopefully that massive wall of text gives you some sense of my style. In honor of Office Vanilla Sunday, this prompt is geared toward something romantic between an executive who's anxious to feel young again and an intern who's anxious to feel mature. While vanilla and romantic and intense, this is probably going to not end happily; self-destruction rarely does. But think of this just as a rough blueprint; I'd love to work out ideas about characters (ours or others) and plot points with a creative, engaged partner!*

*Since I'm a full-time student, rapid back and forth is hard for me to keep up unless it's a day I don't have anything going on; ideally, I'd be looking to exchange longer messages over a longer term. If you're interested in something more immediate, we're probably not a good fit. While my normal sexual interests are wide and varied, let's keep this vanilla in honor of the day.*"

3r66ey,3,2015-11-01,How do I [21 M] talk with my manager 40's [M] about quitting/shortening my internship?,hate_my_job123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r66ey/how_do_i_21_m_talk_with_my_manager_40s_m_about/,"So I come to the good people of /r/relationships to ask this as I have no clue how to approach this situation. So for a little bit of Context, i'm currently contracted at a Fortune 500 tech company for 1 year as an engineer and thus far this misadventure has been the biggest mistake of my life. I absolutely detest the work, as 90% of the day i'm stuck in a cubicle bashing my head against a problem that someone else created. Furthermore, the culture of this company is such that although we work in teams it is anything but just a conveinient way to delegate work. There is little to no collaboration among members, and anytime i attempt to go ask for help it is given with a large dose of ""how incompetent"" you are. It's gotten to the point where i prefer to struggle rather than bother my co-workers. I've already brought this up with my manager but i was hit with you should work harder, which would be fair criticism if I didnt already work from 9-8 every day and by which time i'm the last to leave the office.

So all of this would be the end of the world if I didnt have an opportunity available. To put it bluntly, I have the option of going back to my old job which i absolutely adored and is much more in line with my future career. I could go on forever about how amazing this company is and I would be still there had I not signed a contract with my current company before joining the older one. So reddit, how do I in no uncertain terms tell my manager that i want to quit/shorten my current contract of 1 year to 4months without making a huge scene and utterly destroying my reputation/word.
  
**tl;dr**Hate my current job as an intern and i want to go back to my old amazing job, how do I discuss this with my manager?"

I am having a moment of existential crisis. The tired cliché of the tortured artiste doesn’t apply to me. I am no artist, just a brutish writer of words, and this torture is simply the absence of pain. But I am in a crisis nonetheless. I am torn between my ego’s hunger for purpose, to build monuments and carve my namesake into the universe with the same brutality I write with. And yet, perhaps I have been reading too much Bukowski, because I find myself wondering about the purpose of purpose.
I don’t know why I live, why I am here, or what it will matter when I die – and yet I seem to be facing this crisis with a grim-faced apathy. The need to be remembered, to echo through the halls of centuries has vanished quite utterly. It seems like mere vanity now. I don’t know if this is free I have found, if this is the unbridled acceptance of death and futility, or a false flag operation by my psyche, that will leave me at the end of my live feeling hollow and brimming with regret. And so, caught between these two seemingly immovable titans that argue silently in my subconscious, I find myself in spiritual purgatory. I take daily communion in beer and all I can really feel is the ache in my teeth from clenching my jaws too much and too often. I never seem to notice when I’m doing it, only afterwards, when a dull ache pulses through my molars like a lazy drumbeat.
The hunger has dulled to an ember and everything has lost its pallor apart from the allure of beer and pussy. But this is not depression, not ennui or melancholy. This is a new beast who only wants to watch the world sluggishly pass by through heavy lidded eyes, never quite sure if anything changes from day to day, never quite sure that even matters.
But I don’t know any of this. Not yet anyway. All of that is to come. Right now all I know is I have to catch the 07:04 tomorrow and it’s probably going to rain.

I’ve been taking the same train for the last six months now, five days a week and I have become friends with my fellow commuters. My headphones are always in, so I never hear them talking but I know them nonetheless. There’s the young Pakistani guy who I’m pretty sure is gay and never wears any socks with his shoes, the two loud bleach blonde middle aged women who I imagine work in offices with 17 floors and huge glass windows wearing pencil skirts just a bit too tight, and their quieter brunette friend. There’s a beautiful woman in what must be her late forties with the most astonishing red hair and faded blue eyes that seem to have a sad sparkle about them. I always hope to get her attention, get a smile, but her eyes are always cast on her feet. There’s Hugo the eastern European bodybuilder who has been growing a beard lately. I don’t know if he’s Eastern European or if his name is Hugo but that’s just what his face says to me. Finally there’s the man with the grey suits who likes to sit and read the Qur’an and play with his prayer beads. I’m not sure if play is the right word but I’m hardly religious so it seems like an apt word to use. There are others of course, like the blonde girl who always wears leggings, for which I am eternally grateful, but they don’t get on at my stop, they come after, they are not my friends – merely acquaintances. 
Today I’ve forgotten my headphones, so I get to hear my friends talking for the first time. The first of the blonde women gets on and she is waved to by the man with the Qur’an.  She hesitates, caught between not being rude and the fact that she doesn’t want to sit next to him. Unfortunately for her she’s English so her tight-lipped civility prevails. She waves and sits as far from him as she can in the six-seater. Eventually the other Pencil Skirts join her and conversation begins in earnest. It seems our Muslim friend has been sending his son to an Islamic school on the weekends and they seat the girls at the back of the class, separate from the boys. As he talks, I find myself wondering which of the Pencil Skirts he wants to fuck. Personally I’d pick Pencil Skirt number two, I’ve never been much for curvy women but beggars can’t be choosers, especially in hypothetical scenarios. Two also seems to talk less, but still very happy to contribute. I like a woman who talks. It means if she bores me she can entertain herself. I wonder where the Redhead is so I can stare at her without her noticing me and wonder what’s wrong with me, why she won’t look. She’s probably intimidated. Or she thinks I’m creepy. She doesn’t understand that I’m in love with her. Or that looking at her is a pleasant respite for me; my girlfriend doesn’t let me look at other girls.
It turns out that the seating arrangements at the Islamic school are less to do with sexism and obscure passages from scripture and just human nature. The girls are at the back because they’re better behaved, if the boys were there they’d be distracted by the girls, and probably distract the girls too. Of course the sexes have to be separated, something to do with preventing sin or impure thoughts. Clearly whoever thought that up has never been a young teenage boy, the levels of ingenuity and depravity they’re willing to stoop to in the pursuit of impure thoughts is astonishing. Pencil Skirt One is stumped by Prayer Bead’s answer. I’m certain that Brunette is tittering to herself with her eyes, amused by the sudden stop of verbal diarrhoea. The absence of her keening has made me realise how much I wish I had remembered my headphones. What started off as amusing has fast descended into a carnival show of idiocy, and I need something to distract myself from the ridiculously long-legged man who has sat in front of me. I have self-diagnosed myself with mild claustrophobia. I get an incessant current running through my legs if I feel like I can’t move them. My toes dance and my muscles start to tremble and time becomes mired in the increasingly heavy air. This fucker has put his laptop bag down too instead of up on the overhead, taking up even more room. Hell thy name is Home Counties commuters. I just wish we’d derail, exit the mortal coil en masse in an explosion of twisted metal and oily smoke. Perhaps the glass in the windows will shatter and cut straight through my jugular, something quick, just make it quick, I can’t fucking stand this bastard with his far too new brown shoes anymore. After a few minutes of willing a tragedy to be splashed on the screens of BBC South East news I decide to take a nap.

To paraphrase the great William Tecumseh Sherman, work is hell. I’m not sure who he is; I had to Google that quote. Apparently he fought in America’s civil war. I always thought the quote was Hemmingway. I’m starting the walk from the station, wondering if I should get something to eat. I’m getting fat but food is the only unsullied pleasure left to me these days. I’m always too tired to read, she doesn’t want to sleep with me anymore, and I never seem to have the money for drinking. Food is my love. Food is my saviour. It is the balm for my wounded soul. A double sausage and egg McMuffin will slow the gnawing dread, doo doo doo do doo.  
Brick Lane always seemed so appealing on sunny hungover Saturdays, but in the dreary autumn it isn’t quite so becoming. It is supposed to be the creative heart of London, but I’m slowly finding that the heart is a lot smaller than everyone thinks, and is surrounded by vacuous hanger-ons who seek glory through their fashion-blogging friends they know through six degrees of Kevin Bacon like clotted fat around the arteries. The douchier-than-thou attitude that masks a complete absence of personal merit. But maybe it’s the weather turning me into a misanthrope. Or maybe it’s the prospect of another day sat opposite the snotty bastard whose haughtiness is bred so thoroughly into his genes his nose turns up at the end by its own accord. I don’t think I’ve ever come to despise someone so thoroughly and so quickly. He is incompetence incarnate – perhaps if he was better at his job he wouldn’t have to feel so angry all the time. Impotent rage is born of incompetence. Perhaps if he tried being less of a dickhead his eternally suffering (or so I assume) fiancée would actually want to fuck him and loosen some of those facial muscles that work so hard at a permanent frown. 
This is a brick walled cuboid of mediocrity and tedium. Everyone is the same. Everyone looks the same. There’s the girl in the corner with the legs but she keeps catching me looking. I’m not sure what I’d say to her if she said hello. I’d probably stay awkwardly aloof before calling the love of my life for an emotionally draining conversation where I am accused of flirting and cheating followed by two days of icy texts. We are in relationships with our phones. Every heart aching sentiment boiled down to 10 point letters and emotion in caricatural icons. My personal favourite is when she uses the monkey who covers his eyes, a pixelated smile on his little monkey face. It says charming, cute and embarrassed all in one, perhaps with a hint of coyness.  It reminds me of the reasons I love her, how I adore her smile and reaction in my stomach when that playful glint enters her eyes. I have never laughed nor cried so much as when I am with her. I would die for her. I am killing myself for her. I am killing everything she loves about me and soon she will leave me and I will be empty and I will be dead and I will have to begin the task of resurrecting myself, but I wouldn’t know where to begin. I guess I’d go for a beer. See if Legs from the office will join me. Maybe I’ll watch romantic comedies until late hours in the morning, chain smoking Marlboro lights and write about how much everything fucking hurts, and how much I am addicted to the pain she causes me. 
When I turn up at hers she’s in a bad mood. I don’t know why. It doesn’t matter. It’s my fault, and if it isn’t yet I’m about to make it my fault. From a young age we are taught that it is vital we take responsibility for our actions, and I was always someone who paid attention in class. So I took those lessons and I learned them hard until they were scoured into my synapses. The beauty of this is, she doesn’t need to blame me, I blame myself, I become implicit in the crime and she becomes innocent. She’s not talking, no nothing’s wrong, stop asking me that, I hate it when you do that. 
She hasn’t even kissed me since I got here. 
We met two years ago now. I was seeing someone else but it was decided it wasn’t anything serious. I had no say in this matter. I walked into the bar riding a wave of confidence brought about by a heady mix of Jägermeister and a new haircut. She walked past me and I stopped, it took me five minutes to get all the way up her legs, and there was something about the stormy colour of her eyes that had my dick and heart tightly gripped in equal measure. It all started with such intensity, we fucked like tigers night after night and day after day. We fought and screamed and tore ourselves apart with jealousies. We bit and scratched and drew blood, savouring the pain and the pleasure it bought. When I left the first morning it was a pain unlike any other, like my chest was iron filings and she was the magnet, and to wrench myself away from her was against the highest order of nature’s most basic laws. This was love. This is what the poets wrote about. Oh this was love in all its glorious wretched misery, it broke and consumed me. It hooked itself into every branch of my veins and pumped me full of opiates. We were so happy our hearts broke with every kiss. Every change was to be feared with truest terror. We were balanced on a precipice so delicate but we believed our foundations were of the firmest stone.  
Something broke in us though. We would spend days never leaving the bed, even to shower. Now she’s disgusted by the way I eat. She says she can hear me eating and it puts her off her food, it makes her feel sick. She sullied the only unsullied pleasure I have. She tarnished the untarnishable, and when I am with her I cannot eat with the lusty heartiness that every man deserves to eat with. Now I have to play lord of the fucking manor, no elbows on the table and no licking the plate. White people, it seems, are very conscious of table manners. They say that to be disgusted by your partner is the first sign of no longer being in love. This terrifies me. She of course thinks it’s another thing I’m complaining about, another way I’m telling her she’s not good enough and don’t I know if it wasn’t for me she’d be much happier. I am not sure we know what love is anymore. Either that or we never knew. 
Disney has convinced us of the existence of the soul mate. That one must simply find them and the vacant hole in your soul, the incompleteness that makes us human, will be filled with a solar flare that radiates warmth from your very core to the tips of your toes. There’s nothing else to it, the pieces fit like a puzzle and you have achieved your purpose. Disney says nothing about the way she won’t kiss you the same in front of certain friends. Disney says nothing about the look she gets in her eyes when she sees him even though she says it’s been years and they’re just friends. Disney never mentioned the fact you ‘ll find it hard to reconcile the love you feel for her and the way you so desperately want to get her friends naked. They were right about the pets though. If they like you, you’re in. 
She seems to be coming round. I’ve been quiet which works well, I let her finish what she’s doing and she comes back to me when she’s ready. It used to be so hard, I physically ached to see pain on her face, but I am growing tired of every day being a painful one. Happiness shouldn’t be so hard. Should it? She’s nuzzling on my shoulder now and I can smell her hair. Somewhere in the depths of my stomach a sad voice whispers ‘how can you love her so much when she has to work so hard not to despise you’ and I don’t know what to say back. I am lost for words. I say nothing. I hold her in my arms and hold back the tears. Then I start to wonder when I had my balls cut off.

He is asking me to finish the accounts for him again. I stare at him. No, that’s not quite right. I stare not just at him but directly at the gall in his stomach, the audacity in his jaw and wonder how he holds himself so haughtily when he is so utterly lacking in spine. There is another I inside me, and I rages. I spits in his face and knock the folders out of his hand, I screams so hard I’s nose bleeds “finish them yourself you selfish, lazy, sanctimonious cunt, you begrude me every free fucking second but waste your hours in your crooked ivory fucking tower, promoted to the point of incompetence where you are no longer capable of doing what they fucking pay you to. I’m going to burn that tower down around you, grind those walls to dust and knock that worthless crown off your balding head. I will hold a mirror before your smoke-stained, tear-streaked face and show you how lowly and empty you truly are. And you will break inside knowing that you have achieved utterly nothing, everything is a lie and you will pass through this world like a fart in the wind and no-one will remember your name. They’ll only come to your funeral for the free canapés. They’ll whisper behind your cold stiff back how fat your wife’s gotten and that even in death you’re a cheap piece of shit. They’ll go back to the jobs they despise and the only instance you’ll occur to them is when they find themselves wondering why lately their days have been a little less shit.”
I do not spit, I do not vomit a profanity laden diatribe. I stare steadily into his eyes. I see nothing, but I let him see the other I. The I who stalks like a half-deranged wildcat in the filthy confines of Beijing zoo. Daily tortured by the banging of the glass by grubby infant hands, who’s seven by seven enclosure is nothing but a cell, who impatiently waits to cast death around him in indiscriminate glory. Break the glass, he whispers, break the glass and let it be so.  
Spineless’ gaze falters.
“Actually I think I – I’ll finish them myself, yeah… yeah I’ll do that.”
He walks away.
He doesn’t look back.

The evening train is always an ordeal. If I manage to leave the office at a half decent time, it seems the rest of London follows suit. Wall to wall is a seething mass of tired, sweaty human flesh that brings me out in such unparalleled disgust. Awkwardly pressed into carriages of which there are always one too few. It’s as if the train companies take away the carriages one by one, reducing costs, increasing profits. They push and push until something breaks and they meet resistance at the hands of customers that refuse to be beaten down beyond a certain point. And here’s where the magic happens. They add another carriage, magnanimous bastards that they are, because the customer is always right after all, and our happiness is their highest priority. And our raging semis settle back down, calmed by that human disease that is the ability to be reasonable. After all, they gave us what we wanted, surely we can’t keep complaining? That would be so terribly rude, and I do have such pressing matters to attend to. And as we lie back, sedated on cheaply made seats, the board cackles at another victory and conspire how they’ll push us next. Well maybe they don’t cackle. But they sure as fuck crack a smug smile and wonder with incredulity how they managed to get away with it again.
My neighbour’s three legged cat is standing outside his front door. He’s waiting patiently, like a guest that’s rang the doorbell and looking expectantly upwards. I’m not sure if it’s the lack of sleep getting to me but I could relate to Charlie then. He lost his foreleg a few years ago; they think it was some sort of car accident because he’s always very jumpy around them now. He didn’t like me when we first moved in; he’d scratch me just for going near him. I made fast friends with his brother Smudge who acted more like a dog than a cat, but Charlie seemed to despise most everyone. Sadly, Smudge passed away a couple of years ago, and since then I think the bitter old tripod has been getting lonely. He’s still a tireless curmudgeon with strangers, but we enjoy each other’s company now, even if it’s not quite as intimate as what I had with Smudge. I do wish I could be more like Charlie, who takes years to love. His walls are high and clear of footholds; there is no easy way up. You simply wait for the elements to wear down the stone. Once you are granted entrance into the city of his heart though, you are welcomed with a fierce loyalty, and kept there, no matter how long you may be away. The gates to my city open at the touch of the wind and never seem to shut firmly. It is a home for broken refugees who flee struggle, for the lost ones. They come with nothing and are treated with kindness – but more often than not they leave behind only bloated corpses of the people they used to be, and loot the churches’ treasures. Over time these bodies have multiplied and the churches grown more puritanical. I fear now the gates are too hard to open, on account of the corpses piled up against them, and they are hardly worth the effort, after all, the altars lay bare and the stained-glass windows are shattered, coloured pieces littering the floor like deceptive gems that catch the sunlight and light the room in rainbow hue’d glory. A show of smoke and mirrors though, a trick of the light and nothing more. I see Charlie standing expectantly, bearing the scars of his past, and in him I see myself. I see my friends. I see our generation. He has all but forgotten those scars, but they cripple him still. You see it in the way he runs, a loping gait, almost comical, but compensated for with the sheer aggression he pushes forward with. He stands waiting for the door to open, to come in from this bone biting cold – he wants to return to the warm and hazy place he remembers, where there is comfort and love abound, the place he was always promised. The place he left behind, because his claustrophobia became too overpowering, because the copious love was too suffocating. But he has tired of the cold and now he wants to return. But no-one comes to the door. He may or may not know he has to ring the doorbell, to get their attention, let them know, to say ‘I am here, let me in, show me your kindness and warmth once again because I miss it more than I ever thought I would’. But he doesn’t know how to say it, he doesn’t know how to ring that bell, and he couldn’t reach it if he tried. So he sits waiting. 
No one opens the door.
But he’s still sitting there.

I think my emasculation is complete. I am sat in the dark of the cinema with tears rolling down my eyes as a 3D animated couple are reunited after years apart. It’s astounding how such simplified shapes and faces can convey such a multitude of emotions. If anything that’s what so endearing about it. What any of us would give to be able to read each other’s faces so simply. Instead we are a tangled mess of misleading signals that we were never taught to read. Understanding the depths of human emotion through each other’s faces is like asking a 5 year old child to crack the Enigma machine. The beauty of these characters is in their simplicity, they are unburdened with years of emotional torture, the cruel fickleness of life. Happily ever after can only exist in such a simple world. Where our self-esteem can bounce back unscarred after tragedy and where egos aren’t so irreversibly inflatable. I find myself wondering what I did wrong, what could I have changed so that our love would have been as fierce and undying as what’s playing out in front of me. My friend tells me that men have a tendency to blame themselves for everything, we are fixers by nature and when faced with a problem we are programmed to seek a solution. When that solution fails, we have no option but to blame ourselves. 
I’m not entirely sure she is right. I think there are two types of men, and I’d wager women fit these categories too, but I’m hardly qualified enough to make that statement. There are certainly people who take too much responsibility for the world around them. They are the leaders of the world, they take us under their wings and drive us forward whether we like it or not. They march us to war and broker peace and they toy with us for the sake of our own good. They are purveyors of intolerable arrogance, they believe that everything is a direct result of their actions, they paint themselves as selfless martyrs but inwardly lament that no-one has built them statues. They are the ones who will break your heart by being too afraid to break it. The others are those who take too little responsibility. These are the charming, bumbling adult-children of the world. The ones with the easy smiles and artfully dishevelled hair. The ones who make your mother blush and giggle even as she warns you to stay away from boys like them. And boys they are, they refuse to mature – they are the irresponsible Peter Pans who will float through their lives, oblivious to the destruction they leave in their wake, they walk with an impossible lightness because deep within their subconscious they know there will always be someone to pick up the pieces. They are the ones who’ll break your heart, never knowing they were the ones taking care of it. I long so endlessly to be the later, but I fear I am the former – the thought of dying having never made a mark is a prospect far more horrifying than dying itself. 
But I have hope. The ending of a relationship can be seen as a chance to rediscover who you were. But the way I see it, who I am is what got me here in the first place, crying like a bitch at a kids’ film, unemployed and inexplicably lonely. No, this time the ending will not so much be a rebirth but a new beginning. The essence of my character has been torn down after years of compromise and weakness – it has not served me well, and it is time it is put down. I drag it forth from the dark corners of my mind and push it onto its knees, before the coliseum of my consciousness. The baying crowd for once is silent. This is a moment of ceremony and it must be witnessed with solemnity. On his knees, he almost wants to beg. The tears are spilling but I am callous to his pain, he has caused far too much for me to care for his. I cock the hammer, the cold rough steel spreading goosebumps down my arm. He hears the click and he whimpers. ‘Die like a man’, I whisper through gritted teeth, ‘die like a fucking man’. He knows he has outgrown his usefulness, that there is no room for him in this new world, he is a relic now, and a purposeless one. He is a grovelling pitiful wretch, a haggard dog who shoulders the blame for all the world’s woes and yet never sees that he is the one responsible for all of this. He is why she stopped loving me, he is why I was fired, he is why I swim through mires of self-pity. He heated the blade, he cut the skin, the tubes, he cauterised the wound and suspended my balls in a jar of formaldehyde like a fucking Darwinian curiosity. His reckoning is now and I am terrible judgement who will strike fast with fire and lead. ‘Die like a man’ I tell him again, but he shakes his head no, for he has never been a man. For all his talk of responsibility and sturdy upper lips, he has never been a man. And he never will be. The gunshot claps like thunder –no-one can hear it but me. He slumps to the floor in the lethargic way he did everything. I bury him in an unmarked grave, and whisper his name with nothing but callousness now. I light up a cigarette and walk away. Tomorrow is coming, and I have a long way to go to find what I need.
The lights slowly turn on in the cinema. This man-made sunrise marks a new beginning, of that I’m sure. Of what? I don’t know. I know that we are all sick and lost, with more questions than we started with. I know with a certainty that I am not alone in this. I see it in the dead eyes of my friends when they start to ponder the future, the slow fatigue that overcomes them when the beer sets in and all our defences rot and fall apart. I know that I need something, something more than all of this. I know the answers aren’t going to be found in her, or in the loss of her. Promotions and office politics aren’t going to fill the hungry dread in my stomach, the dread that doesn’t fear financial ruin or job security, only the curse of not mattering. I write this to give and to find answers. I seek to show you where to wander now that we are lost – but I am as lost as you. I may lead you deeper into this forest and we may all just die in unmarked shallow graves amidst the ancient trees. I will warn you now; I have no idea where this ends.  I only know where it begins.

There could be no greater punishment than to be trapped in a prison of mirrors. 
When I am alone, my mind is unoccupied and free to wander dank and fetid alleys. It is disobedient and carefree, if it were a teenage daughter you would be sat in your living room night after night wondering if the next time you open the door it’s to her or the police. There are dark parts to our souls, better left untouched. Ancient demons lurk there, seeking to prey upon those who step too close or too lightly. In some these dark parts are sealed behind intricate locks dusted with cobwebs, and in a lucky few those seals never have and never will be opened in their life time. For others the locks are rusted, forced on hurriedly after surviving an onslaught and ever threatening to break open once more at the slightest touch. Then there are those for whom the doors have been torn off the hinges, and these ancient demons stalk freely through the undergrowth of our consciousness, the apex predators in the deadly game of our sanity. My mind has a tendency to pull on the seals; it grows bored of peace and craves the rush of peril. When I am alone, my mind it seems develops unparalleled lock-picking skills and opens doors I’d long forgotten existed. When I am alone, I have no choice but to face the darkness, to face myself.  There could be no greater punishment than to be trapped in a prison of mirrors, as you are forced to look upon yourself, wherever you turn, to see the depths of your depravity, to be reminded of every scalding memory. The first girl who laughed in your face when you told her you liked her. The humiliation of having the shit beaten out of you and the weakness you felt for months on end at not being able to look other men in the eye for fear of it happening again. The first time the knife broke the skin and you felt the rush of pain flow from your heart to your bleeding skin. The hollow feeling in your stomach when you woke up the first time to the news someone you loved had died. The slow realisation your life has been one humiliation after another and you’ve never been enough of a man to do anything about it. The dawning that you aren’t even sure what it means to be a man anymore, all you know is you’re missing something. 
The mirror is a capricious friend. The kind who you’re not sure why you’re friends with, they seem only to put you down, and when you finally gather the courage to stop wasting your time with them, they show you an act of kindness deeper than anyone has shown you before. The sort of friend you cannot bear to be without, though you know they’ll be the death of you. On some days I feel genuine physical revulsion at the sight of myself, I wonder why the girls in my life ever even looked at me, I am fully aware that I will die alone. Then, one evening I will look once more and see an Adonis, a veritable slayer of pussy. Those times I am caught between going to a bar or simply smiling to myself, preening all night. As a generation we have grown up with mirrors all around us. Perhaps Ovid was something of a Nostradamus as well as poet, and predicted the downfall of humanity in our unrelenting narcissism. We are so busy caught in our mirrors, or the front facing cameras of our phones, we are blindsided by what is happening around us. Our elders lament our self-obsession as they line their pockets with our money. They buy all the property and wonder why we don’t just move out, lament to their friends about useless sons and daughters who can’t hold down a decent job as they hire and fire unpaid interns like condoms used and thrown away. We are so busy finding the right filter to put on our lives, so we can pretend to our peers that we are happy that we don’t notice the our chance to be happy is being stolen from us. By politicians who cater to their voters, not the ineffectual youth who have lost too much faith in them to turn up. By employers, parents, teachers. We did everything we were told to do. We are the epitome of the obedient Victorian child. We followed the rules in school, letting them crush the individuality out of us. We found a university and worked hard, expecting the next chapter in our lives to unfold as the others did. But we were lied to. Every entry level job requires experience, but there is no experience without working. Terribly paid internships are all that wait for us, if they even pay at all. But despite these companies insistence that it’s an important part of the process, to find who is truly dedicated, we can’t help but feel like we are free labour, easily found, easily thrown away. Even if we took the ‘higher ground’, state that we refuse to work like this, we deserve better – there are hundreds and thousands of other desperate hungry graduates just like us, more than willing to take our place. We have no choice but to join the raging horde of dispirited twenty-somethings. I am jaded now. For two years I have sought what I was put here to do, I have worked for the money, I have worked for what I thought was passion. I worked for something inbetween, and the light is lost from my eyes. The hunger has dissipated to an insipid rumbling in my stomach, and dreams of world shattering importance are making way to thoughts of simply getting by, doing what needs to be done. Hard work is not rewarded in this world, so there is a voice that rumbles disquietly to my subconscious while I sleep - why break our bones over a paycheque when simply stubbing a toe will do? 
Apathy is our modern epidemic. This is what will bring our civilisation down. It will not be a catastrophic apocalypse brought about by extremist Islamic militants, or fuel hoarded by Russian warmongers. Our society will not collapse, it will simper and stumble. Progress will become a slow trudge through memories of a better time, and the core of what we hold sacred will become bloated and rotten. We will flourish, like mould on the unattended plates of lazy students, but it will be the death of passion, the death of culture. All becomes grey, and this will be how the world ends, not with a bang, but a whimper.
From what I have seen of my friends, there is an abundance of latent rage. There is displacement, confusion and darkness ahead. We are a generation caught between understanding the transience of life and the importance of achieving. Not the importance of our fathers, not financial stability and a neatly trimmed pension. We are cursed with a desperate need to matter, to carve our names into the universe and leave it a better place than we found it. We are tormented by what Kundera called ‘the unbearable lightness of being’. 
The very people who made us believe we could achieved anything have raped the world, burdened us with insurmountable debt, tying millstones around our necks, all the while flogging us to move forward. They are filled with contempt for our entitlement, our laziness. We are bitter, we were promised the world if we worked with all our hearts, and now our hearts are broken and we are left with nothing. Less than nothing. Everything we own, we owe to the banks that hide behind imposing brick walls and cheap smiles on cheap suits. We numb the pain of existence with drink and the soft glow of television screens. We are scared to face a world that feels as if it has nothing to offer us. 
We seek purpose so desperately but are weighed down by credit scores and rising rent. Those of us who can’t even afford to live away from home lapse only further into childlike disinterest of responsibilities we are simply unable to shoulder. We know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell but can’t fill out a tax return. We are encouraged to pursue our creativity but creativity is crushed out of us by an education system whose purpose it seems is to build obedient automatons and hit arbitrary targets in order to build more. We live in a time where the most important career in society, the education of the younger generation, is only a backup option for disillusioned arts student. Those precious few who are truly passionate about teaching strive to make their mark, but are ever threatened by the overshadowing menace of apathetic schoolmasters that gave up years before, and OFSTED inspectors more concerned with their clipboards than the young futures they crumble in their hands.
We are tired of listening to your age old advice that has turned out not to be so wise. You are a generation driven by fear and greed, and we are your obnoxious and narcissistic spawn, seeking instant gratification and wanting to change the world. We crave the material and reject ownership. Transience is our M.O. We want to shake down the old world but have never been taught how to leave our comfort zones. We live and love by maxims we preach to others and never follow ourselves. We write our lovers poems then one day decide to never talk to them again. There is always something better around the corner – why settle when the perfection you’ve sold us smells so tangibly close. This is a rejection of and an ode to rampant consumerism. Forgive me if my narrative seems jumbled, but we are the confused generation intent on living life with nothing to die for.
We are a generation of Peter Pans and our modern middle-class society is our never never land. We are too fucking lazy or too entitled or too jaded to grow up. We have spent our lives looking into ourselves, too busy to see what was being done to us. When we look at each other’s parents we see boring fuck-ups intent on living in fear, following a destiny that was written with human hands, not God’s. We dream of grandiose bohémien lives, free the burden of societal norms, and live out these fantasies through substance abuse and apathy. We have no greater fear than responsibility. We do not fear death, but we fear the burden of adulthood.
We are trapped in a prison of mirrors as our homes are looted around us.  
We are angry.
But we aren’t sure if we have a right to be.

I have been putting off writing this for some time now. The apathy is creeping over me and I have been reluctant to face it. The days are fading into weeks and I’ve lost what little sense of purpose I had. There has been a lot of drinking, hazy memories that start the same way but always end differently. I am craving adventure, something different, so I seek it with abandon in the dark of the night. I follow every possibility presented to me, and if it hasn’t answered the questions my soul is asking me, it’s made for some great stories. Like the girls outside the local who flashed me and asked me to compare their tits, or breaking up a fight between my friend and a Kurt Cobain lookalike outside a strip club. I’ve found myself coming out of my stupor playing a kazoo in a crowded bar with strangers trying to guess what I’m playing, or in the house of two girls I’ve just met. I was convinced I’d finally done it, I’d reached that unattainable immortality all men seek and I was about to have a threesome. Instead they fed me pizza, gave me wine and we discussed the situation in Palestine and the life of Alexander the great. I tried to kiss one of them, but she said she wasn’t like that, so I left. But every day, I fall out of my bed in the afternoon, as lonely and empty as the day before. I drink not to numb the pain, but to feel something. Conrad said to immerse oneself in the element of destruction and I am doing just that.

Any advice?,lavjey,CreativeProcess,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreativeProcess/comments/3r78fw/showing_i_dont_know_where_to_take_my_novel_from/,"So a year or so ago I thought I'd take a crack at writing a novel. I got about 7,000 words in and I just ran out of steam. I took a lot of what was going on in my life, but I was in a pretty dark place and I didn't know where to take the story, because I didn't know what I was even doing in my life. Anyway, I'm keen to take another crack at it and would love to hear your guys advice/thoughts on what the best way to get this moving / where I could possibly take this is. Thanks in advance!

I am having a moment of existential crisis. The tired cliché of the tortured artiste doesn’t apply to me. I am no artist, just a brutish writer of words, and this torture is simply the absence of pain. But I am in a crisis nonetheless. I am torn between my ego’s hunger for purpose, to build monuments and carve my namesake into the universe with the same brutality I write with. And yet, perhaps I have been reading too much Bukowski, because I find myself wondering about the purpose of purpose.
I don’t know why I live, why I am here, or what it will matter when I die – and yet I seem to be facing this crisis with a grim-faced apathy. The need to be remembered, to echo through the halls of centuries has vanished quite utterly. It seems like mere vanity now. I don’t know if this is free I have found, if this is the unbridled acceptance of death and futility, or a false flag operation by my psyche, that will leave me at the end of my live feeling hollow and brimming with regret. And so, caught between these two seemingly immovable titans that argue silently in my subconscious, I find myself in spiritual purgatory. I take daily communion in beer and all I can really feel is the ache in my teeth from clenching my jaws too much and too often. I never seem to notice when I’m doing it, only afterwards, when a dull ache pulses through my molars like a lazy drumbeat.
The hunger has dulled to an ember and everything has lost its pallor apart from the allure of beer and pussy. But this is not depression, not ennui or melancholy. This is a new beast who only wants to watch the world sluggishly pass by through heavy lidded eyes, never quite sure if anything changes from day to day, never quite sure that even matters.
But I don’t know any of this. Not yet anyway. All of that is to come. Right now all I know is I have to catch the 07:04 tomorrow and it’s probably going to rain.

I’ve been taking the same train for the last six months now, five days a week and I have become friends with my fellow commuters. My headphones are always in, so I never hear them talking but I know them nonetheless. There’s the young Pakistani guy who I’m pretty sure is gay and never wears any socks with his shoes, the two loud bleach blonde middle aged women who I imagine work in offices with 17 floors and huge glass windows wearing pencil skirts just a bit too tight, and their quieter brunette friend. There’s a beautiful woman in what must be her late forties with the most astonishing red hair and faded blue eyes that seem to have a sad sparkle about them. I always hope to get her attention, get a smile, but her eyes are always cast on her feet. There’s Hugo the eastern European bodybuilder who has been growing a beard lately. I don’t know if he’s Eastern European or if his name is Hugo but that’s just what his face says to me. Finally there’s the man with the grey suits who likes to sit and read the Qur’an and play with his prayer beads. I’m not sure if play is the right word but I’m hardly religious so it seems like an apt word to use. There are others of course, like the blonde girl who always wears leggings, for which I am eternally grateful, but they don’t get on at my stop, they come after, they are not my friends – merely acquaintances. 
Today I’ve forgotten my headphones, so I get to hear my friends talking for the first time. The first of the blonde women gets on and she is waved to by the man with the Qur’an.  She hesitates, caught between not being rude and the fact that she doesn’t want to sit next to him. Unfortunately for her she’s English so her tight-lipped civility prevails. She waves and sits as far from him as she can in the six-seater. Eventually the other Pencil Skirts join her and conversation begins in earnest. It seems our Muslim friend has been sending his son to an Islamic school on the weekends and they seat the girls at the back of the class, separate from the boys. As he talks, I find myself wondering which of the Pencil Skirts he wants to fuck. Personally I’d pick Pencil Skirt number two, I’ve never been much for curvy women but beggars can’t be choosers, especially in hypothetical scenarios. Two also seems to talk less, but still very happy to contribute. I like a woman who talks. It means if she bores me she can entertain herself. I wonder where the Redhead is so I can stare at her without her noticing me and wonder what’s wrong with me, why she won’t look. She’s probably intimidated. Or she thinks I’m creepy. She doesn’t understand that I’m in love with her. Or that looking at her is a pleasant respite for me; my girlfriend doesn’t let me look at other girls.
It turns out that the seating arrangements at the Islamic school are less to do with sexism and obscure passages from scripture and just human nature. The girls are at the back because they’re better behaved, if the boys were there they’d be distracted by the girls, and probably distract the girls too. Of course the sexes have to be separated, something to do with preventing sin or impure thoughts. Clearly whoever thought that up has never been a young teenage boy, the levels of ingenuity and depravity they’re willing to stoop to in the pursuit of impure thoughts is astonishing. Pencil Skirt One is stumped by Prayer Bead’s answer. I’m certain that Brunette is tittering to herself with her eyes, amused by the sudden stop of verbal diarrhoea. The absence of her keening has made me realise how much I wish I had remembered my headphones. What started off as amusing has fast descended into a carnival show of idiocy, and I need something to distract myself from the ridiculously long-legged man who has sat in front of me. I have self-diagnosed myself with mild claustrophobia. I get an incessant current running through my legs if I feel like I can’t move them. My toes dance and my muscles start to tremble and time becomes mired in the increasingly heavy air. This fucker has put his laptop bag down too instead of up on the overhead, taking up even more room. Hell thy name is Home Counties commuters. I just wish we’d derail, exit the mortal coil en masse in an explosion of twisted metal and oily smoke. Perhaps the glass in the windows will shatter and cut straight through my jugular, something quick, just make it quick, I can’t fucking stand this bastard with his far too new brown shoes anymore. After a few minutes of willing a tragedy to be splashed on the screens of BBC South East news I decide to take a nap.

To paraphrase the great William Tecumseh Sherman, work is hell. I’m not sure who he is; I had to Google that quote. Apparently he fought in America’s civil war. I always thought the quote was Hemmingway. I’m starting the walk from the station, wondering if I should get something to eat. I’m getting fat but food is the only unsullied pleasure left to me these days. I’m always too tired to read, she doesn’t want to sleep with me anymore, and I never seem to have the money for drinking. Food is my love. Food is my saviour. It is the balm for my wounded soul. A double sausage and egg McMuffin will slow the gnawing dread, doo doo doo do doo.  
Brick Lane always seemed so appealing on sunny hungover Saturdays, but in the dreary autumn it isn’t quite so becoming. It is supposed to be the creative heart of London, but I’m slowly finding that the heart is a lot smaller than everyone thinks, and is surrounded by vacuous hanger-ons who seek glory through their fashion-blogging friends they know through six degrees of Kevin Bacon like clotted fat around the arteries. The douchier-than-thou attitude that masks a complete absence of personal merit. But maybe it’s the weather turning me into a misanthrope. Or maybe it’s the prospect of another day sat opposite the snotty bastard whose haughtiness is bred so thoroughly into his genes his nose turns up at the end by its own accord. I don’t think I’ve ever come to despise someone so thoroughly and so quickly. He is incompetence incarnate – perhaps if he was better at his job he wouldn’t have to feel so angry all the time. Impotent rage is born of incompetence. Perhaps if he tried being less of a dickhead his eternally suffering (or so I assume) fiancée would actually want to fuck him and loosen some of those facial muscles that work so hard at a permanent frown. 
This is a brick walled cuboid of mediocrity and tedium. Everyone is the same. Everyone looks the same. There’s the girl in the corner with the legs but she keeps catching me looking. I’m not sure what I’d say to her if she said hello. I’d probably stay awkwardly aloof before calling the love of my life for an emotionally draining conversation where I am accused of flirting and cheating followed by two days of icy texts. We are in relationships with our phones. Every heart aching sentiment boiled down to 10 point letters and emotion in caricatural icons. My personal favourite is when she uses the monkey who covers his eyes, a pixelated smile on his little monkey face. It says charming, cute and embarrassed all in one, perhaps with a hint of coyness.  It reminds me of the reasons I love her, how I adore her smile and reaction in my stomach when that playful glint enters her eyes. I have never laughed nor cried so much as when I am with her. I would die for her. I am killing myself for her. I am killing everything she loves about me and soon she will leave me and I will be empty and I will be dead and I will have to begin the task of resurrecting myself, but I wouldn’t know where to begin. I guess I’d go for a beer. See if Legs from the office will join me. Maybe I’ll watch romantic comedies until late hours in the morning, chain smoking Marlboro lights and write about how much everything fucking hurts, and how much I am addicted to the pain she causes me. 
When I turn up at hers she’s in a bad mood. I don’t know why. It doesn’t matter. It’s my fault, and if it isn’t yet I’m about to make it my fault. From a young age we are taught that it is vital we take responsibility for our actions, and I was always someone who paid attention in class. So I took those lessons and I learned them hard until they were scoured into my synapses. The beauty of this is, she doesn’t need to blame me, I blame myself, I become implicit in the crime and she becomes innocent. She’s not talking, no nothing’s wrong, stop asking me that, I hate it when you do that. 
She hasn’t even kissed me since I got here. 
We met two years ago now. I was seeing someone else but it was decided it wasn’t anything serious. I had no say in this matter. I walked into the bar riding a wave of confidence brought about by a heady mix of Jägermeister and a new haircut. She walked past me and I stopped, it took me five minutes to get all the way up her legs, and there was something about the stormy colour of her eyes that had my dick and heart tightly gripped in equal measure. It all started with such intensity, we fucked like tigers night after night and day after day. We fought and screamed and tore ourselves apart with jealousies. We bit and scratched and drew blood, savouring the pain and the pleasure it bought. When I left the first morning it was a pain unlike any other, like my chest was iron filings and she was the magnet, and to wrench myself away from her was against the highest order of nature’s most basic laws. This was love. This is what the poets wrote about. Oh this was love in all its glorious wretched misery, it broke and consumed me. It hooked itself into every branch of my veins and pumped me full of opiates. We were so happy our hearts broke with every kiss. Every change was to be feared with truest terror. We were balanced on a precipice so delicate but we believed our foundations were of the firmest stone.  
Something broke in us though. We would spend days never leaving the bed, even to shower. Now she’s disgusted by the way I eat. She says she can hear me eating and it puts her off her food, it makes her feel sick. She sullied the only unsullied pleasure I have. She tarnished the untarnishable, and when I am with her I cannot eat with the lusty heartiness that every man deserves to eat with. Now I have to play lord of the fucking manor, no elbows on the table and no licking the plate. White people, it seems, are very conscious of table manners. They say that to be disgusted by your partner is the first sign of no longer being in love. This terrifies me. She of course thinks it’s another thing I’m complaining about, another way I’m telling her she’s not good enough and don’t I know if it wasn’t for me she’d be much happier. I am not sure we know what love is anymore. Either that or we never knew. 
Disney has convinced us of the existence of the soul mate. That one must simply find them and the vacant hole in your soul, the incompleteness that makes us human, will be filled with a solar flare that radiates warmth from your very core to the tips of your toes. There’s nothing else to it, the pieces fit like a puzzle and you have achieved your purpose. Disney says nothing about the way she won’t kiss you the same in front of certain friends. Disney says nothing about the look she gets in her eyes when she sees him even though she says it’s been years and they’re just friends. Disney never mentioned the fact you ‘ll find it hard to reconcile the love you feel for her and the way you so desperately want to get her friends naked. They were right about the pets though. If they like you, you’re in. 
She seems to be coming round. I’ve been quiet which works well, I let her finish what she’s doing and she comes back to me when she’s ready. It used to be so hard, I physically ached to see pain on her face, but I am growing tired of every day being a painful one. Happiness shouldn’t be so hard. Should it? She’s nuzzling on my shoulder now and I can smell her hair. Somewhere in the depths of my stomach a sad voice whispers ‘how can you love her so much when she has to work so hard not to despise you’ and I don’t know what to say back. I am lost for words. I say nothing. I hold her in my arms and hold back the tears. Then I start to wonder when I had my balls cut off.

He is asking me to finish the accounts for him again. I stare at him. No, that’s not quite right. I stare not just at him but directly at the gall in his stomach, the audacity in his jaw and wonder how he holds himself so haughtily when he is so utterly lacking in spine. There is another I inside me, and I rages. I spits in his face and knock the folders out of his hand, I screams so hard I’s nose bleeds “finish them yourself you selfish, lazy, sanctimonious cunt, you begrude me every free fucking second but waste your hours in your crooked ivory fucking tower, promoted to the point of incompetence where you are no longer capable of doing what they fucking pay you to. I’m going to burn that tower down around you, grind those walls to dust and knock that worthless crown off your balding head. I will hold a mirror before your smoke-stained, tear-streaked face and show you how lowly and empty you truly are. And you will break inside knowing that you have achieved utterly nothing, everything is a lie and you will pass through this world like a fart in the wind and no-one will remember your name. They’ll only come to your funeral for the free canapés. They’ll whisper behind your cold stiff back how fat your wife’s gotten and that even in death you’re a cheap piece of shit. They’ll go back to the jobs they despise and the only instance you’ll occur to them is when they find themselves wondering why lately their days have been a little less shit.”
I do not spit, I do not vomit a profanity laden diatribe. I stare steadily into his eyes. I see nothing, but I let him see the other I. The I who stalks like a half-deranged wildcat in the filthy confines of Beijing zoo. Daily tortured by the banging of the glass by grubby infant hands, who’s seven by seven enclosure is nothing but a cell, who impatiently waits to cast death around him in indiscriminate glory. Break the glass, he whispers, break the glass and let it be so.  
Spineless’ gaze falters.
“Actually I think I – I’ll finish them myself, yeah… yeah I’ll do that.”
He walks away.
He doesn’t look back.

The evening train is always an ordeal. If I manage to leave the office at a half decent time, it seems the rest of London follows suit. Wall to wall is a seething mass of tired, sweaty human flesh that brings me out in such unparalleled disgust. Awkwardly pressed into carriages of which there are always one too few. It’s as if the train companies take away the carriages one by one, reducing costs, increasing profits. They push and push until something breaks and they meet resistance at the hands of customers that refuse to be beaten down beyond a certain point. And here’s where the magic happens. They add another carriage, magnanimous bastards that they are, because the customer is always right after all, and our happiness is their highest priority. And our raging semis settle back down, calmed by that human disease that is the ability to be reasonable. After all, they gave us what we wanted, surely we can’t keep complaining? That would be so terribly rude, and I do have such pressing matters to attend to. And as we lie back, sedated on cheaply made seats, the board cackles at another victory and conspire how they’ll push us next. Well maybe they don’t cackle. But they sure as fuck crack a smug smile and wonder with incredulity how they managed to get away with it again.
My neighbour’s three legged cat is standing outside his front door. He’s waiting patiently, like a guest that’s rang the doorbell and looking expectantly upwards. I’m not sure if it’s the lack of sleep getting to me but I could relate to Charlie then. He lost his foreleg a few years ago; they think it was some sort of car accident because he’s always very jumpy around them now. He didn’t like me when we first moved in; he’d scratch me just for going near him. I made fast friends with his brother Smudge who acted more like a dog than a cat, but Charlie seemed to despise most everyone. Sadly, Smudge passed away a couple of years ago, and since then I think the bitter old tripod has been getting lonely. He’s still a tireless curmudgeon with strangers, but we enjoy each other’s company now, even if it’s not quite as intimate as what I had with Smudge. I do wish I could be more like Charlie, who takes years to love. His walls are high and clear of footholds; there is no easy way up. You simply wait for the elements to wear down the stone. Once you are granted entrance into the city of his heart though, you are welcomed with a fierce loyalty, and kept there, no matter how long you may be away. The gates to my city open at the touch of the wind and never seem to shut firmly. It is a home for broken refugees who flee struggle, for the lost ones. They come with nothing and are treated with kindness – but more often than not they leave behind only bloated corpses of the people they used to be, and loot the churches’ treasures. Over time these bodies have multiplied and the churches grown more puritanical. I fear now the gates are too hard to open, on account of the corpses piled up against them, and they are hardly worth the effort, after all, the altars lay bare and the stained-glass windows are shattered, coloured pieces littering the floor like deceptive gems that catch the sunlight and light the room in rainbow hue’d glory. A show of smoke and mirrors though, a trick of the light and nothing more. I see Charlie standing expectantly, bearing the scars of his past, and in him I see myself. I see my friends. I see our generation. He has all but forgotten those scars, but they cripple him still. You see it in the way he runs, a loping gait, almost comical, but compensated for with the sheer aggression he pushes forward with. He stands waiting for the door to open, to come in from this bone biting cold – he wants to return to the warm and hazy place he remembers, where there is comfort and love abound, the place he was always promised. The place he left behind, because his claustrophobia became too overpowering, because the copious love was too suffocating. But he has tired of the cold and now he wants to return. But no-one comes to the door. He may or may not know he has to ring the doorbell, to get their attention, let them know, to say ‘I am here, let me in, show me your kindness and warmth once again because I miss it more than I ever thought I would’. But he doesn’t know how to say it, he doesn’t know how to ring that bell, and he couldn’t reach it if he tried. So he sits waiting. 
No one opens the door.
But he’s still sitting there.

I think my emasculation is complete. I am sat in the dark of the cinema with tears rolling down my eyes as a 3D animated couple are reunited after years apart. It’s astounding how such simplified shapes and faces can convey such a multitude of emotions. If anything that’s what so endearing about it. What any of us would give to be able to read each other’s faces so simply. Instead we are a tangled mess of misleading signals that we were never taught to read. Understanding the depths of human emotion through each other’s faces is like asking a 5 year old child to crack the Enigma machine. The beauty of these characters is in their simplicity, they are unburdened with years of emotional torture, the cruel fickleness of life. Happily ever after can only exist in such a simple world. Where our self-esteem can bounce back unscarred after tragedy and where egos aren’t so irreversibly inflatable. I find myself wondering what I did wrong, what could I have changed so that our love would have been as fierce and undying as what’s playing out in front of me. My friend tells me that men have a tendency to blame themselves for everything, we are fixers by nature and when faced with a problem we are programmed to seek a solution. When that solution fails, we have no option but to blame ourselves. 
I’m not entirely sure she is right. I think there are two types of men, and I’d wager women fit these categories too, but I’m hardly qualified enough to make that statement. There are certainly people who take too much responsibility for the world around them. They are the leaders of the world, they take us under their wings and drive us forward whether we like it or not. They march us to war and broker peace and they toy with us for the sake of our own good. They are purveyors of intolerable arrogance, they believe that everything is a direct result of their actions, they paint themselves as selfless martyrs but inwardly lament that no-one has built them statues. They are the ones who will break your heart by being too afraid to break it. The others are those who take too little responsibility. These are the charming, bumbling adult-children of the world. The ones with the easy smiles and artfully dishevelled hair. The ones who make your mother blush and giggle even as she warns you to stay away from boys like them. And boys they are, they refuse to mature – they are the irresponsible Peter Pans who will float through their lives, oblivious to the destruction they leave in their wake, they walk with an impossible lightness because deep within their subconscious they know there will always be someone to pick up the pieces. They are the ones who’ll break your heart, never knowing they were the ones taking care of it. I long so endlessly to be the later, but I fear I am the former – the thought of dying having never made a mark is a prospect far more horrifying than dying itself. 
But I have hope. The ending of a relationship can be seen as a chance to rediscover who you were. But the way I see it, who I am is what got me here in the first place, crying like a bitch at a kids’ film, unemployed and inexplicably lonely. No, this time the ending will not so much be a rebirth but a new beginning. The essence of my character has been torn down after years of compromise and weakness – it has not served me well, and it is time it is put down. I drag it forth from the dark corners of my mind and push it onto its knees, before the coliseum of my consciousness. The baying crowd for once is silent. This is a moment of ceremony and it must be witnessed with solemnity. On his knees, he almost wants to beg. The tears are spilling but I am callous to his pain, he has caused far too much for me to care for his. I cock the hammer, the cold rough steel spreading goosebumps down my arm. He hears the click and he whimpers. ‘Die like a man’, I whisper through gritted teeth, ‘die like a fucking man’. He knows he has outgrown his usefulness, that there is no room for him in this new world, he is a relic now, and a purposeless one. He is a grovelling pitiful wretch, a haggard dog who shoulders the blame for all the world’s woes and yet never sees that he is the one responsible for all of this. He is why she stopped loving me, he is why I was fired, he is why I swim through mires of self-pity. He heated the blade, he cut the skin, the tubes, he cauterised the wound and suspended my balls in a jar of formaldehyde like a fucking Darwinian curiosity. His reckoning is now and I am terrible judgement who will strike fast with fire and lead. ‘Die like a man’ I tell him again, but he shakes his head no, for he has never been a man. For all his talk of responsibility and sturdy upper lips, he has never been a man. And he never will be. The gunshot claps like thunder –no-one can hear it but me. He slumps to the floor in the lethargic way he did everything. I bury him in an unmarked grave, and whisper his name with nothing but callousness now. I light up a cigarette and walk away. Tomorrow is coming, and I have a long way to go to find what I need.
The lights slowly turn on in the cinema. This man-made sunrise marks a new beginning, of that I’m sure. Of what? I don’t know. I know that we are all sick and lost, with more questions than we started with. I know with a certainty that I am not alone in this. I see it in the dead eyes of my friends when they start to ponder the future, the slow fatigue that overcomes them when the beer sets in and all our defences rot and fall apart. I know that I need something, something more than all of this. I know the answers aren’t going to be found in her, or in the loss of her. Promotions and office politics aren’t going to fill the hungry dread in my stomach, the dread that doesn’t fear financial ruin or job security, only the curse of not mattering. I write this to give and to find answers. I seek to show you where to wander now that we are lost – but I am as lost as you. I may lead you deeper into this forest and we may all just die in unmarked shallow graves amidst the ancient trees. I will warn you now; I have no idea where this ends.  I only know where it begins.

There could be no greater punishment than to be trapped in a prison of mirrors. 
When I am alone, my mind is unoccupied and free to wander dank and fetid alleys. It is disobedient and carefree, if it were a teenage daughter you would be sat in your living room night after night wondering if the next time you open the door it’s to her or the police. There are dark parts to our souls, better left untouched. Ancient demons lurk there, seeking to prey upon those who step too close or too lightly. In some these dark parts are sealed behind intricate locks dusted with cobwebs, and in a lucky few those seals never have and never will be opened in their life time. For others the locks are rusted, forced on hurriedly after surviving an onslaught and ever threatening to break open once more at the slightest touch. Then there are those for whom the doors have been torn off the hinges, and these ancient demons stalk freely through the undergrowth of our consciousness, the apex predators in the deadly game of our sanity. My mind has a tendency to pull on the seals; it grows bored of peace and craves the rush of peril. When I am alone, my mind it seems develops unparalleled lock-picking skills and opens doors I’d long forgotten existed. When I am alone, I have no choice but to face the darkness, to face myself.  There could be no greater punishment than to be trapped in a prison of mirrors, as you are forced to look upon yourself, wherever you turn, to see the depths of your depravity, to be reminded of every scalding memory. The first girl who laughed in your face when you told her you liked her. The humiliation of having the shit beaten out of you and the weakness you felt for months on end at not being able to look other men in the eye for fear of it happening again. The first time the knife broke the skin and you felt the rush of pain flow from your heart to your bleeding skin. The hollow feeling in your stomach when you woke up the first time to the news someone you loved had died. The slow realisation your life has been one humiliation after another and you’ve never been enough of a man to do anything about it. The dawning that you aren’t even sure what it means to be a man anymore, all you know is you’re missing something. 
The mirror is a capricious friend. The kind who you’re not sure why you’re friends with, they seem only to put you down, and when you finally gather the courage to stop wasting your time with them, they show you an act of kindness deeper than anyone has shown you before. The sort of friend you cannot bear to be without, though you know they’ll be the death of you. On some days I feel genuine physical revulsion at the sight of myself, I wonder why the girls in my life ever even looked at me, I am fully aware that I will die alone. Then, one evening I will look once more and see an Adonis, a veritable slayer of pussy. Those times I am caught between going to a bar or simply smiling to myself, preening all night. As a generation we have grown up with mirrors all around us. Perhaps Ovid was something of a Nostradamus as well as poet, and predicted the downfall of humanity in our unrelenting narcissism. We are so busy caught in our mirrors, or the front facing cameras of our phones, we are blindsided by what is happening around us. Our elders lament our self-obsession as they line their pockets with our money. They buy all the property and wonder why we don’t just move out, lament to their friends about useless sons and daughters who can’t hold down a decent job as they hire and fire unpaid interns like condoms used and thrown away. We are so busy finding the right filter to put on our lives, so we can pretend to our peers that we are happy that we don’t notice the our chance to be happy is being stolen from us. By politicians who cater to their voters, not the ineffectual youth who have lost too much faith in them to turn up. By employers, parents, teachers. We did everything we were told to do. We are the epitome of the obedient Victorian child. We followed the rules in school, letting them crush the individuality out of us. We found a university and worked hard, expecting the next chapter in our lives to unfold as the others did. But we were lied to. Every entry level job requires experience, but there is no experience without working. Terribly paid internships are all that wait for us, if they even pay at all. But despite these companies insistence that it’s an important part of the process, to find who is truly dedicated, we can’t help but feel like we are free labour, easily found, easily thrown away. Even if we took the ‘higher ground’, state that we refuse to work like this, we deserve better – there are hundreds and thousands of other desperate hungry graduates just like us, more than willing to take our place. We have no choice but to join the raging horde of dispirited twenty-somethings. I am jaded now. For two years I have sought what I was put here to do, I have worked for the money, I have worked for what I thought was passion. I worked for something inbetween, and the light is lost from my eyes. The hunger has dissipated to an insipid rumbling in my stomach, and dreams of world shattering importance are making way to thoughts of simply getting by, doing what needs to be done. Hard work is not rewarded in this world, so there is a voice that rumbles disquietly to my subconscious while I sleep - why break our bones over a paycheque when simply stubbing a toe will do? 
Apathy is our modern epidemic. This is what will bring our civilisation down. It will not be a catastrophic apocalypse brought about by extremist Islamic militants, or fuel hoarded by Russian warmongers. Our society will not collapse, it will simper and stumble. Progress will become a slow trudge through memories of a better time, and the core of what we hold sacred will become bloated and rotten. We will flourish, like mould on the unattended plates of lazy students, but it will be the death of passion, the death of culture. All becomes grey, and this will be how the world ends, not with a bang, but a whimper.
From what I have seen of my friends, there is an abundance of latent rage. There is displacement, confusion and darkness ahead. We are a generation caught between understanding the transience of life and the importance of achieving. Not the importance of our fathers, not financial stability and a neatly trimmed pension. We are cursed with a desperate need to matter, to carve our names into the universe and leave it a better place than we found it. We are tormented by what Kundera called ‘the unbearable lightness of being’. 
The very people who made us believe we could achieved anything have raped the world, burdened us with insurmountable debt, tying millstones around our necks, all the while flogging us to move forward. They are filled with contempt for our entitlement, our laziness. We are bitter, we were promised the world if we worked with all our hearts, and now our hearts are broken and we are left with nothing. Less than nothing. Everything we own, we owe to the banks that hide behind imposing brick walls and cheap smiles on cheap suits. We numb the pain of existence with drink and the soft glow of television screens. We are scared to face a world that feels as if it has nothing to offer us. 
We seek purpose so desperately but are weighed down by credit scores and rising rent. Those of us who can’t even afford to live away from home lapse only further into childlike disinterest of responsibilities we are simply unable to shoulder. We know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell but can’t fill out a tax return. We are encouraged to pursue our creativity but creativity is crushed out of us by an education system whose purpose it seems is to build obedient automatons and hit arbitrary targets in order to build more. We live in a time where the most important career in society, the education of the younger generation, is only a backup option for disillusioned arts student. Those precious few who are truly passionate about teaching strive to make their mark, but are ever threatened by the overshadowing menace of apathetic schoolmasters that gave up years before, and OFSTED inspectors more concerned with their clipboards than the young futures they crumble in their hands.
We are tired of listening to your age old advice that has turned out not to be so wise. You are a generation driven by fear and greed, and we are your obnoxious and narcissistic spawn, seeking instant gratification and wanting to change the world. We crave the material and reject ownership. Transience is our M.O. We want to shake down the old world but have never been taught how to leave our comfort zones. We live and love by maxims we preach to others and never follow ourselves. We write our lovers poems then one day decide to never talk to them again. There is always something better around the corner – why settle when the perfection you’ve sold us smells so tangibly close. This is a rejection of and an ode to rampant consumerism. Forgive me if my narrative seems jumbled, but we are the confused generation intent on living life with nothing to die for.
We are a generation of Peter Pans and our modern middle-class society is our never never land. We are too fucking lazy or too entitled or too jaded to grow up. We have spent our lives looking into ourselves, too busy to see what was being done to us. When we look at each other’s parents we see boring fuck-ups intent on living in fear, following a destiny that was written with human hands, not God’s. We dream of grandiose bohémien lives, free the burden of societal norms, and live out these fantasies through substance abuse and apathy. We have no greater fear than responsibility. We do not fear death, but we fear the burden of adulthood.
We are trapped in a prison of mirrors as our homes are looted around us.  
We are angry.
But we aren’t sure if we have a right to be.

I have been putting off writing this for some time now. The apathy is creeping over me and I have been reluctant to face it. The days are fading into weeks and I’ve lost what little sense of purpose I had. There has been a lot of drinking, hazy memories that start the same way but always end differently. I am craving adventure, something different, so I seek it with abandon in the dark of the night. I follow every possibility presented to me, and if it hasn’t answered the questions my soul is asking me, it’s made for some great stories. Like the girls outside the local who flashed me and asked me to compare their tits, or breaking up a fight between my friend and a Kurt Cobain lookalike outside a strip club. I’ve found myself coming out of my stupor playing a kazoo in a crowded bar with strangers trying to guess what I’m playing, or in the house of two girls I’ve just met. I was convinced I’d finally done it, I’d reached that unattainable immortality all men seek and I was about to have a threesome. Instead they fed me pizza, gave me wine and we discussed the situation in Palestine and the life of Alexander the great. I tried to kiss one of them, but she said she wasn’t like that, so I left. But every day, I fall out of my bed in the afternoon, as lonely and empty as the day before. I drink not to numb the pain, but to feel something. Conrad said to immerse oneself in the element of destruction and I am doing just that.

I am having a moment of existential crisis. The tired cliché of the tortured artiste doesn’t apply to me. I am no artist, just a brutish writer of words, and this torture is simply the absence of pain. But I am in a crisis nonetheless. I am torn between my ego’s hunger for purpose, to build monuments and carve my namesake into the universe with the same brutality I write with. And yet, perhaps I have been reading too much Bukowski, because I find myself wondering about the purpose of purpose.
I don’t know why I live, why I am here, or what it will matter when I die – and yet I seem to be facing this crisis with a grim-faced apathy. The need to be remembered, to echo through the halls of centuries has vanished quite utterly. It seems like mere vanity now. I don’t know if this is free I have found, if this is the unbridled acceptance of death and futility, or a false flag operation by my psyche, that will leave me at the end of my live feeling hollow and brimming with regret. And so, caught between these two seemingly immovable titans that argue silently in my subconscious, I find myself in spiritual purgatory. I take daily communion in beer and all I can really feel is the ache in my teeth from clenching my jaws too much and too often. I never seem to notice when I’m doing it, only afterwards, when a dull ache pulses through my molars like a lazy drumbeat.
The hunger has dulled to an ember and everything has lost its pallor apart from the allure of beer and pussy. But this is not depression, not ennui or melancholy. This is a new beast who only wants to watch the world sluggishly pass by through heavy lidded eyes, never quite sure if anything changes from day to day, never quite sure that even matters.
But I don’t know any of this. Not yet anyway. All of that is to come. Right now all I know is I have to catch the 07:04 tomorrow and it’s probably going to rain.

I’ve been taking the same train for the last six months now, five days a week and I have become friends with my fellow commuters. My headphones are always in, so I never hear them talking but I know them nonetheless. There’s the young Pakistani guy who I’m pretty sure is gay and never wears any socks with his shoes, the two loud bleach blonde middle aged women who I imagine work in offices with 17 floors and huge glass windows wearing pencil skirts just a bit too tight, and their quieter brunette friend. There’s a beautiful woman in what must be her late forties with the most astonishing red hair and faded blue eyes that seem to have a sad sparkle about them. I always hope to get her attention, get a smile, but her eyes are always cast on her feet. There’s Hugo the eastern European bodybuilder who has been growing a beard lately. I don’t know if he’s Eastern European or if his name is Hugo but that’s just what his face says to me. Finally there’s the man with the grey suits who likes to sit and read the Qur’an and play with his prayer beads. I’m not sure if play is the right word but I’m hardly religious so it seems like an apt word to use. There are others of course, like the blonde girl who always wears leggings, for which I am eternally grateful, but they don’t get on at my stop, they come after, they are not my friends – merely acquaintances. 
Today I’ve forgotten my headphones, so I get to hear my friends talking for the first time. The first of the blonde women gets on and she is waved to by the man with the Qur’an.  She hesitates, caught between not being rude and the fact that she doesn’t want to sit next to him. Unfortunately for her she’s English so her tight-lipped civility prevails. She waves and sits as far from him as she can in the six-seater. Eventually the other Pencil Skirts join her and conversation begins in earnest. It seems our Muslim friend has been sending his son to an Islamic school on the weekends and they seat the girls at the back of the class, separate from the boys. As he talks, I find myself wondering which of the Pencil Skirts he wants to fuck. Personally I’d pick Pencil Skirt number two, I’ve never been much for curvy women but beggars can’t be choosers, especially in hypothetical scenarios. Two also seems to talk less, but still very happy to contribute. I like a woman who talks. It means if she bores me she can entertain herself. I wonder where the Redhead is so I can stare at her without her noticing me and wonder what’s wrong with me, why she won’t look. She’s probably intimidated. Or she thinks I’m creepy. She doesn’t understand that I’m in love with her. Or that looking at her is a pleasant respite for me; my girlfriend doesn’t let me look at other girls.
It turns out that the seating arrangements at the Islamic school are less to do with sexism and obscure passages from scripture and just human nature. The girls are at the back because they’re better behaved, if the boys were there they’d be distracted by the girls, and probably distract the girls too. Of course the sexes have to be separated, something to do with preventing sin or impure thoughts. Clearly whoever thought that up has never been a young teenage boy, the levels of ingenuity and depravity they’re willing to stoop to in the pursuit of impure thoughts is astonishing. Pencil Skirt One is stumped by Prayer Bead’s answer. I’m certain that Brunette is tittering to herself with her eyes, amused by the sudden stop of verbal diarrhoea. The absence of her keening has made me realise how much I wish I had remembered my headphones. What started off as amusing has fast descended into a carnival show of idiocy, and I need something to distract myself from the ridiculously long-legged man who has sat in front of me. I have self-diagnosed myself with mild claustrophobia. I get an incessant current running through my legs if I feel like I can’t move them. My toes dance and my muscles start to tremble and time becomes mired in the increasingly heavy air. This fucker has put his laptop bag down too instead of up on the overhead, taking up even more room. Hell thy name is Home Counties commuters. I just wish we’d derail, exit the mortal coil en masse in an explosion of twisted metal and oily smoke. Perhaps the glass in the windows will shatter and cut straight through my jugular, something quick, just make it quick, I can’t fucking stand this bastard with his far too new brown shoes anymore. After a few minutes of willing a tragedy to be splashed on the screens of BBC South East news I decide to take a nap.

To paraphrase the great William Tecumseh Sherman, work is hell. I’m not sure who he is; I had to Google that quote. Apparently he fought in America’s civil war. I always thought the quote was Hemmingway. I’m starting the walk from the station, wondering if I should get something to eat. I’m getting fat but food is the only unsullied pleasure left to me these days. I’m always too tired to read, she doesn’t want to sleep with me anymore, and I never seem to have the money for drinking. Food is my love. Food is my saviour. It is the balm for my wounded soul. A double sausage and egg McMuffin will slow the gnawing dread, doo doo doo do doo.  
Brick Lane always seemed so appealing on sunny hungover Saturdays, but in the dreary autumn it isn’t quite so becoming. It is supposed to be the creative heart of London, but I’m slowly finding that the heart is a lot smaller than everyone thinks, and is surrounded by vacuous hanger-ons who seek glory through their fashion-blogging friends they know through six degrees of Kevin Bacon like clotted fat around the arteries. The douchier-than-thou attitude that masks a complete absence of personal merit. But maybe it’s the weather turning me into a misanthrope. Or maybe it’s the prospect of another day sat opposite the snotty bastard whose haughtiness is bred so thoroughly into his genes his nose turns up at the end by its own accord. I don’t think I’ve ever come to despise someone so thoroughly and so quickly. He is incompetence incarnate – perhaps if he was better at his job he wouldn’t have to feel so angry all the time. Impotent rage is born of incompetence. Perhaps if he tried being less of a dickhead his eternally suffering (or so I assume) fiancée would actually want to fuck him and loosen some of those facial muscles that work so hard at a permanent frown. 
This is a brick walled cuboid of mediocrity and tedium. Everyone is the same. Everyone looks the same. There’s the girl in the corner with the legs but she keeps catching me looking. I’m not sure what I’d say to her if she said hello. I’d probably stay awkwardly aloof before calling the love of my life for an emotionally draining conversation where I am accused of flirting and cheating followed by two days of icy texts. We are in relationships with our phones. Every heart aching sentiment boiled down to 10 point letters and emotion in caricatural icons. My personal favourite is when she uses the monkey who covers his eyes, a pixelated smile on his little monkey face. It says charming, cute and embarrassed all in one, perhaps with a hint of coyness.  It reminds me of the reasons I love her, how I adore her smile and reaction in my stomach when that playful glint enters her eyes. I have never laughed nor cried so much as when I am with her. I would die for her. I am killing myself for her. I am killing everything she loves about me and soon she will leave me and I will be empty and I will be dead and I will have to begin the task of resurrecting myself, but I wouldn’t know where to begin. I guess I’d go for a beer. See if Legs from the office will join me. Maybe I’ll watch romantic comedies until late hours in the morning, chain smoking Marlboro lights and write about how much everything fucking hurts, and how much I am addicted to the pain she causes me. 
When I turn up at hers she’s in a bad mood. I don’t know why. It doesn’t matter. It’s my fault, and if it isn’t yet I’m about to make it my fault. From a young age we are taught that it is vital we take responsibility for our actions, and I was always someone who paid attention in class. So I took those lessons and I learned them hard until they were scoured into my synapses. The beauty of this is, she doesn’t need to blame me, I blame myself, I become implicit in the crime and she becomes innocent. She’s not talking, no nothing’s wrong, stop asking me that, I hate it when you do that. 
She hasn’t even kissed me since I got here. 
We met two years ago now. I was seeing someone else but it was decided it wasn’t anything serious. I had no say in this matter. I walked into the bar riding a wave of confidence brought about by a heady mix of Jägermeister and a new haircut. She walked past me and I stopped, it took me five minutes to get all the way up her legs, and there was something about the stormy colour of her eyes that had my dick and heart tightly gripped in equal measure. It all started with such intensity, we fucked like tigers night after night and day after day. We fought and screamed and tore ourselves apart with jealousies. We bit and scratched and drew blood, savouring the pain and the pleasure it bought. When I left the first morning it was a pain unlike any other, like my chest was iron filings and she was the magnet, and to wrench myself away from her was against the highest order of nature’s most basic laws. This was love. This is what the poets wrote about. Oh this was love in all its glorious wretched misery, it broke and consumed me. It hooked itself into every branch of my veins and pumped me full of opiates. We were so happy our hearts broke with every kiss. Every change was to be feared with truest terror. We were balanced on a precipice so delicate but we believed our foundations were of the firmest stone.  
Something broke in us though. We would spend days never leaving the bed, even to shower. Now she’s disgusted by the way I eat. She says she can hear me eating and it puts her off her food, it makes her feel sick. She sullied the only unsullied pleasure I have. She tarnished the untarnishable, and when I am with her I cannot eat with the lusty heartiness that every man deserves to eat with. Now I have to play lord of the fucking manor, no elbows on the table and no licking the plate. White people, it seems, are very conscious of table manners. They say that to be disgusted by your partner is the first sign of no longer being in love. This terrifies me. She of course thinks it’s another thing I’m complaining about, another way I’m telling her she’s not good enough and don’t I know if it wasn’t for me she’d be much happier. I am not sure we know what love is anymore. Either that or we never knew. 
Disney has convinced us of the existence of the soul mate. That one must simply find them and the vacant hole in your soul, the incompleteness that makes us human, will be filled with a solar flare that radiates warmth from your very core to the tips of your toes. There’s nothing else to it, the pieces fit like a puzzle and you have achieved your purpose. Disney says nothing about the way she won’t kiss you the same in front of certain friends. Disney says nothing about the look she gets in her eyes when she sees him even though she says it’s been years and they’re just friends. Disney never mentioned the fact you ‘ll find it hard to reconcile the love you feel for her and the way you so desperately want to get her friends naked. They were right about the pets though. If they like you, you’re in. 
She seems to be coming round. I’ve been quiet which works well, I let her finish what she’s doing and she comes back to me when she’s ready. It used to be so hard, I physically ached to see pain on her face, but I am growing tired of every day being a painful one. Happiness shouldn’t be so hard. Should it? She’s nuzzling on my shoulder now and I can smell her hair. Somewhere in the depths of my stomach a sad voice whispers ‘how can you love her so much when she has to work so hard not to despise you’ and I don’t know what to say back. I am lost for words. I say nothing. I hold her in my arms and hold back the tears. Then I start to wonder when I had my balls cut off.

He is asking me to finish the accounts for him again. I stare at him. No, that’s not quite right. I stare not just at him but directly at the gall in his stomach, the audacity in his jaw and wonder how he holds himself so haughtily when he is so utterly lacking in spine. There is another I inside me, and I rages. I spits in his face and knock the folders out of his hand, I screams so hard I’s nose bleeds “finish them yourself you selfish, lazy, sanctimonious cunt, you begrude me every free fucking second but waste your hours in your crooked ivory fucking tower, promoted to the point of incompetence where you are no longer capable of doing what they fucking pay you to. I’m going to burn that tower down around you, grind those walls to dust and knock that worthless crown off your balding head. I will hold a mirror before your smoke-stained, tear-streaked face and show you how lowly and empty you truly are. And you will break inside knowing that you have achieved utterly nothing, everything is a lie and you will pass through this world like a fart in the wind and no-one will remember your name. They’ll only come to your funeral for the free canapés. They’ll whisper behind your cold stiff back how fat your wife’s gotten and that even in death you’re a cheap piece of shit. They’ll go back to the jobs they despise and the only instance you’ll occur to them is when they find themselves wondering why lately their days have been a little less shit.”
I do not spit, I do not vomit a profanity laden diatribe. I stare steadily into his eyes. I see nothing, but I let him see the other I. The I who stalks like a half-deranged wildcat in the filthy confines of Beijing zoo. Daily tortured by the banging of the glass by grubby infant hands, who’s seven by seven enclosure is nothing but a cell, who impatiently waits to cast death around him in indiscriminate glory. Break the glass, he whispers, break the glass and let it be so.  
Spineless’ gaze falters.
“Actually I think I – I’ll finish them myself, yeah… yeah I’ll do that.”
He walks away.
He doesn’t look back.

The evening train is always an ordeal. If I manage to leave the office at a half decent time, it seems the rest of London follows suit. Wall to wall is a seething mass of tired, sweaty human flesh that brings me out in such unparalleled disgust. Awkwardly pressed into carriages of which there are always one too few. It’s as if the train companies take away the carriages one by one, reducing costs, increasing profits. They push and push until something breaks and they meet resistance at the hands of customers that refuse to be beaten down beyond a certain point. And here’s where the magic happens. They add another carriage, magnanimous bastards that they are, because the customer is always right after all, and our happiness is their highest priority. And our raging semis settle back down, calmed by that human disease that is the ability to be reasonable. After all, they gave us what we wanted, surely we can’t keep complaining? That would be so terribly rude, and I do have such pressing matters to attend to. And as we lie back, sedated on cheaply made seats, the board cackles at another victory and conspire how they’ll push us next. Well maybe they don’t cackle. But they sure as fuck crack a smug smile and wonder with incredulity how they managed to get away with it again.
My neighbour’s three legged cat is standing outside his front door. He’s waiting patiently, like a guest that’s rang the doorbell and looking expectantly upwards. I’m not sure if it’s the lack of sleep getting to me but I could relate to Charlie then. He lost his foreleg a few years ago; they think it was some sort of car accident because he’s always very jumpy around them now. He didn’t like me when we first moved in; he’d scratch me just for going near him. I made fast friends with his brother Smudge who acted more like a dog than a cat, but Charlie seemed to despise most everyone. Sadly, Smudge passed away a couple of years ago, and since then I think the bitter old tripod has been getting lonely. He’s still a tireless curmudgeon with strangers, but we enjoy each other’s company now, even if it’s not quite as intimate as what I had with Smudge. I do wish I could be more like Charlie, who takes years to love. His walls are high and clear of footholds; there is no easy way up. You simply wait for the elements to wear down the stone. Once you are granted entrance into the city of his heart though, you are welcomed with a fierce loyalty, and kept there, no matter how long you may be away. The gates to my city open at the touch of the wind and never seem to shut firmly. It is a home for broken refugees who flee struggle, for the lost ones. They come with nothing and are treated with kindness – but more often than not they leave behind only bloated corpses of the people they used to be, and loot the churches’ treasures. Over time these bodies have multiplied and the churches grown more puritanical. I fear now the gates are too hard to open, on account of the corpses piled up against them, and they are hardly worth the effort, after all, the altars lay bare and the stained-glass windows are shattered, coloured pieces littering the floor like deceptive gems that catch the sunlight and light the room in rainbow hue’d glory. A show of smoke and mirrors though, a trick of the light and nothing more. I see Charlie standing expectantly, bearing the scars of his past, and in him I see myself. I see my friends. I see our generation. He has all but forgotten those scars, but they cripple him still. You see it in the way he runs, a loping gait, almost comical, but compensated for with the sheer aggression he pushes forward with. He stands waiting for the door to open, to come in from this bone biting cold – he wants to return to the warm and hazy place he remembers, where there is comfort and love abound, the place he was always promised. The place he left behind, because his claustrophobia became too overpowering, because the copious love was too suffocating. But he has tired of the cold and now he wants to return. But no-one comes to the door. He may or may not know he has to ring the doorbell, to get their attention, let them know, to say ‘I am here, let me in, show me your kindness and warmth once again because I miss it more than I ever thought I would’. But he doesn’t know how to say it, he doesn’t know how to ring that bell, and he couldn’t reach it if he tried. So he sits waiting. 
No one opens the door.
But he’s still sitting there.

I think my emasculation is complete. I am sat in the dark of the cinema with tears rolling down my eyes as a 3D animated couple are reunited after years apart. It’s astounding how such simplified shapes and faces can convey such a multitude of emotions. If anything that’s what so endearing about it. What any of us would give to be able to read each other’s faces so simply. Instead we are a tangled mess of misleading signals that we were never taught to read. Understanding the depths of human emotion through each other’s faces is like asking a 5 year old child to crack the Enigma machine. The beauty of these characters is in their simplicity, they are unburdened with years of emotional torture, the cruel fickleness of life. Happily ever after can only exist in such a simple world. Where our self-esteem can bounce back unscarred after tragedy and where egos aren’t so irreversibly inflatable. I find myself wondering what I did wrong, what could I have changed so that our love would have been as fierce and undying as what’s playing out in front of me. My friend tells me that men have a tendency to blame themselves for everything, we are fixers by nature and when faced with a problem we are programmed to seek a solution. When that solution fails, we have no option but to blame ourselves. 
I’m not entirely sure she is right. I think there are two types of men, and I’d wager women fit these categories too, but I’m hardly qualified enough to make that statement. There are certainly people who take too much responsibility for the world around them. They are the leaders of the world, they take us under their wings and drive us forward whether we like it or not. They march us to war and broker peace and they toy with us for the sake of our own good. They are purveyors of intolerable arrogance, they believe that everything is a direct result of their actions, they paint themselves as selfless martyrs but inwardly lament that no-one has built them statues. They are the ones who will break your heart by being too afraid to break it. The others are those who take too little responsibility. These are the charming, bumbling adult-children of the world. The ones with the easy smiles and artfully dishevelled hair. The ones who make your mother blush and giggle even as she warns you to stay away from boys like them. And boys they are, they refuse to mature – they are the irresponsible Peter Pans who will float through their lives, oblivious to the destruction they leave in their wake, they walk with an impossible lightness because deep within their subconscious they know there will always be someone to pick up the pieces. They are the ones who’ll break your heart, never knowing they were the ones taking care of it. I long so endlessly to be the later, but I fear I am the former – the thought of dying having never made a mark is a prospect far more horrifying than dying itself. 
But I have hope. The ending of a relationship can be seen as a chance to rediscover who you were. But the way I see it, who I am is what got me here in the first place, crying like a bitch at a kids’ film, unemployed and inexplicably lonely. No, this time the ending will not so much be a rebirth but a new beginning. The essence of my character has been torn down after years of compromise and weakness – it has not served me well, and it is time it is put down. I drag it forth from the dark corners of my mind and push it onto its knees, before the coliseum of my consciousness. The baying crowd for once is silent. This is a moment of ceremony and it must be witnessed with solemnity. On his knees, he almost wants to beg. The tears are spilling but I am callous to his pain, he has caused far too much for me to care for his. I cock the hammer, the cold rough steel spreading goosebumps down my arm. He hears the click and he whimpers. ‘Die like a man’, I whisper through gritted teeth, ‘die like a fucking man’. He knows he has outgrown his usefulness, that there is no room for him in this new world, he is a relic now, and a purposeless one. He is a grovelling pitiful wretch, a haggard dog who shoulders the blame for all the world’s woes and yet never sees that he is the one responsible for all of this. He is why she stopped loving me, he is why I was fired, he is why I swim through mires of self-pity. He heated the blade, he cut the skin, the tubes, he cauterised the wound and suspended my balls in a jar of formaldehyde like a fucking Darwinian curiosity. His reckoning is now and I am terrible judgement who will strike fast with fire and lead. ‘Die like a man’ I tell him again, but he shakes his head no, for he has never been a man. For all his talk of responsibility and sturdy upper lips, he has never been a man. And he never will be. The gunshot claps like thunder –no-one can hear it but me. He slumps to the floor in the lethargic way he did everything. I bury him in an unmarked grave, and whisper his name with nothing but callousness now. I light up a cigarette and walk away. Tomorrow is coming, and I have a long way to go to find what I need.
The lights slowly turn on in the cinema. This man-made sunrise marks a new beginning, of that I’m sure. Of what? I don’t know. I know that we are all sick and lost, with more questions than we started with. I know with a certainty that I am not alone in this. I see it in the dead eyes of my friends when they start to ponder the future, the slow fatigue that overcomes them when the beer sets in and all our defences rot and fall apart. I know that I need something, something more than all of this. I know the answers aren’t going to be found in her, or in the loss of her. Promotions and office politics aren’t going to fill the hungry dread in my stomach, the dread that doesn’t fear financial ruin or job security, only the curse of not mattering. I write this to give and to find answers. I seek to show you where to wander now that we are lost – but I am as lost as you. I may lead you deeper into this forest and we may all just die in unmarked shallow graves amidst the ancient trees. I will warn you now; I have no idea where this ends.  I only know where it begins.

There could be no greater punishment than to be trapped in a prison of mirrors. 
When I am alone, my mind is unoccupied and free to wander dank and fetid alleys. It is disobedient and carefree, if it were a teenage daughter you would be sat in your living room night after night wondering if the next time you open the door it’s to her or the police. There are dark parts to our souls, better left untouched. Ancient demons lurk there, seeking to prey upon those who step too close or too lightly. In some these dark parts are sealed behind intricate locks dusted with cobwebs, and in a lucky few those seals never have and never will be opened in their life time. For others the locks are rusted, forced on hurriedly after surviving an onslaught and ever threatening to break open once more at the slightest touch. Then there are those for whom the doors have been torn off the hinges, and these ancient demons stalk freely through the undergrowth of our consciousness, the apex predators in the deadly game of our sanity. My mind has a tendency to pull on the seals; it grows bored of peace and craves the rush of peril. When I am alone, my mind it seems develops unparalleled lock-picking skills and opens doors I’d long forgotten existed. When I am alone, I have no choice but to face the darkness, to face myself.  There could be no greater punishment than to be trapped in a prison of mirrors, as you are forced to look upon yourself, wherever you turn, to see the depths of your depravity, to be reminded of every scalding memory. The first girl who laughed in your face when you told her you liked her. The humiliation of having the shit beaten out of you and the weakness you felt for months on end at not being able to look other men in the eye for fear of it happening again. The first time the knife broke the skin and you felt the rush of pain flow from your heart to your bleeding skin. The hollow feeling in your stomach when you woke up the first time to the news someone you loved had died. The slow realisation your life has been one humiliation after another and you’ve never been enough of a man to do anything about it. The dawning that you aren’t even sure what it means to be a man anymore, all you know is you’re missing something. 
The mirror is a capricious friend. The kind who you’re not sure why you’re friends with, they seem only to put you down, and when you finally gather the courage to stop wasting your time with them, they show you an act of kindness deeper than anyone has shown you before. The sort of friend you cannot bear to be without, though you know they’ll be the death of you. On some days I feel genuine physical revulsion at the sight of myself, I wonder why the girls in my life ever even looked at me, I am fully aware that I will die alone. Then, one evening I will look once more and see an Adonis, a veritable slayer of pussy. Those times I am caught between going to a bar or simply smiling to myself, preening all night. As a generation we have grown up with mirrors all around us. Perhaps Ovid was something of a Nostradamus as well as poet, and predicted the downfall of humanity in our unrelenting narcissism. We are so busy caught in our mirrors, or the front facing cameras of our phones, we are blindsided by what is happening around us. Our elders lament our self-obsession as they line their pockets with our money. They buy all the property and wonder why we don’t just move out, lament to their friends about useless sons and daughters who can’t hold down a decent job as they hire and fire unpaid interns like condoms used and thrown away. We are so busy finding the right filter to put on our lives, so we can pretend to our peers that we are happy that we don’t notice the our chance to be happy is being stolen from us. By politicians who cater to their voters, not the ineffectual youth who have lost too much faith in them to turn up. By employers, parents, teachers. We did everything we were told to do. We are the epitome of the obedient Victorian child. We followed the rules in school, letting them crush the individuality out of us. We found a university and worked hard, expecting the next chapter in our lives to unfold as the others did. But we were lied to. Every entry level job requires experience, but there is no experience without working. Terribly paid internships are all that wait for us, if they even pay at all. But despite these companies insistence that it’s an important part of the process, to find who is truly dedicated, we can’t help but feel like we are free labour, easily found, easily thrown away. Even if we took the ‘higher ground’, state that we refuse to work like this, we deserve better – there are hundreds and thousands of other desperate hungry graduates just like us, more than willing to take our place. We have no choice but to join the raging horde of dispirited twenty-somethings. I am jaded now. For two years I have sought what I was put here to do, I have worked for the money, I have worked for what I thought was passion. I worked for something inbetween, and the light is lost from my eyes. The hunger has dissipated to an insipid rumbling in my stomach, and dreams of world shattering importance are making way to thoughts of simply getting by, doing what needs to be done. Hard work is not rewarded in this world, so there is a voice that rumbles disquietly to my subconscious while I sleep - why break our bones over a paycheque when simply stubbing a toe will do? 
Apathy is our modern epidemic. This is what will bring our civilisation down. It will not be a catastrophic apocalypse brought about by extremist Islamic militants, or fuel hoarded by Russian warmongers. Our society will not collapse, it will simper and stumble. Progress will become a slow trudge through memories of a better time, and the core of what we hold sacred will become bloated and rotten. We will flourish, like mould on the unattended plates of lazy students, but it will be the death of passion, the death of culture. All becomes grey, and this will be how the world ends, not with a bang, but a whimper.
From what I have seen of my friends, there is an abundance of latent rage. There is displacement, confusion and darkness ahead. We are a generation caught between understanding the transience of life and the importance of achieving. Not the importance of our fathers, not financial stability and a neatly trimmed pension. We are cursed with a desperate need to matter, to carve our names into the universe and leave it a better place than we found it. We are tormented by what Kundera called ‘the unbearable lightness of being’. 
The very people who made us believe we could achieved anything have raped the world, burdened us with insurmountable debt, tying millstones around our necks, all the while flogging us to move forward. They are filled with contempt for our entitlement, our laziness. We are bitter, we were promised the world if we worked with all our hearts, and now our hearts are broken and we are left with nothing. Less than nothing. Everything we own, we owe to the banks that hide behind imposing brick walls and cheap smiles on cheap suits. We numb the pain of existence with drink and the soft glow of television screens. We are scared to face a world that feels as if it has nothing to offer us. 
We seek purpose so desperately but are weighed down by credit scores and rising rent. Those of us who can’t even afford to live away from home lapse only further into childlike disinterest of responsibilities we are simply unable to shoulder. We know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell but can’t fill out a tax return. We are encouraged to pursue our creativity but creativity is crushed out of us by an education system whose purpose it seems is to build obedient automatons and hit arbitrary targets in order to build more. We live in a time where the most important career in society, the education of the younger generation, is only a backup option for disillusioned arts student. Those precious few who are truly passionate about teaching strive to make their mark, but are ever threatened by the overshadowing menace of apathetic schoolmasters that gave up years before, and OFSTED inspectors more concerned with their clipboards than the young futures they crumble in their hands.
We are tired of listening to your age old advice that has turned out not to be so wise. You are a generation driven by fear and greed, and we are your obnoxious and narcissistic spawn, seeking instant gratification and wanting to change the world. We crave the material and reject ownership. Transience is our M.O. We want to shake down the old world but have never been taught how to leave our comfort zones. We live and love by maxims we preach to others and never follow ourselves. We write our lovers poems then one day decide to never talk to them again. There is always something better around the corner – why settle when the perfection you’ve sold us smells so tangibly close. This is a rejection of and an ode to rampant consumerism. Forgive me if my narrative seems jumbled, but we are the confused generation intent on living life with nothing to die for.
We are a generation of Peter Pans and our modern middle-class society is our never never land. We are too fucking lazy or too entitled or too jaded to grow up. We have spent our lives looking into ourselves, too busy to see what was being done to us. When we look at each other’s parents we see boring fuck-ups intent on living in fear, following a destiny that was written with human hands, not God’s. We dream of grandiose bohémien lives, free the burden of societal norms, and live out these fantasies through substance abuse and apathy. We have no greater fear than responsibility. We do not fear death, but we fear the burden of adulthood.
We are trapped in a prison of mirrors as our homes are looted around us.  
We are angry.
But we aren’t sure if we have a right to be.

I have been putting off writing this for some time now. The apathy is creeping over me and I have been reluctant to face it. The days are fading into weeks and I’ve lost what little sense of purpose I had. There has been a lot of drinking, hazy memories that start the same way but always end differently. I am craving adventure, something different, so I seek it with abandon in the dark of the night. I follow every possibility presented to me, and if it hasn’t answered the questions my soul is asking me, it’s made for some great stories. Like the girls outside the local who flashed me and asked me to compare their tits, or breaking up a fight between my friend and a Kurt Cobain lookalike outside a strip club. I’ve found myself coming out of my stupor playing a kazoo in a crowded bar with strangers trying to guess what I’m playing, or in the house of two girls I’ve just met. I was convinced I’d finally done it, I’d reached that unattainable immortality all men seek and I was about to have a threesome. Instead they fed me pizza, gave me wine and we discussed the situation in Palestine and the life of Alexander the great. I tried to kiss one of them, but she said she wasn’t like that, so I left. But every day, I fall out of my bed in the afternoon, as lonely and empty as the day before. I drink not to numb the pain, but to feel something. Conrad said to immerse oneself in the element of destruction and I am doing just that.

I was supposed to graduate last summer, but I didn't manage to finish my final paper. I need to finish it before December but I've barely started. I'm doing a part-time internship and I'm way behind on what I should be doing, and last Friday I was supposed to help out at a conference and I just forgot to show up. 

I haven't talked to my boss since then, I assume she's not happy with me, but I'm to afraid to call her and find out. I don't have an excuse. 

I teach an instrument part-time and I haven't been doing a good job of preparing lessons lately. And I backed the car into another car the other day.

I'm just all-around fucking everything up. I just sit on the sofa all day. I got a flu the other day and I stayed home for over two weeks. I was sick for maybe 5 days, but the rest I just couldn't deal with life. I haven't even taken a shower in days, and my apartment is a mess.

I just want to get my life in order. And I can't shake the feeling that I'm proving my mom right. I've always been really together and done everything by the book. But now things aren't going well and I have no idea how to handle it. I'm so used to constantly having to prove my worth through work and school and general success, and now I'm failing at that, and I feel like I'm worth nothing. 

No one ever taught me how to deal with failures. What do I do? How do I get back on my feet? 

I'm sorry that I'm whining and complaining, I know many of you have much bigger problems. "

Usually, I'm a couple of days clean when I go in for these interviews. 


But when I PMO once, I go on a rampage. Don't show up at work because I was too tired, or show up completely exhausted sometimes PMO right before I head to work. Most of the time, it's a no call no show. I just kept giving up on good gigs. 


But this year, I've made it that I have to finish whatever shit I start by fire. I'm halfway through a fantastic internship. Halfway through a halfass semester (at least I'm going to finish). And I'm heading back to the marketplace for a job. I've been out of a job now for almost 9 months and this time with the clearest of heads.

Scientists across the world united to create the perfect crime stopper. The entire moon was repurposed into a giant satellite. With the most powerful supercomputer ever made. At the helm sat an AI they called Nolan.

It linked itself with every other satellite to monitor the planet. No matter where you were on Earth. Nolan was watching and computing the probability of a crime happening. Weather, body temperature, stress levels, traffic, poverty and any variable you can think of. Nolan observed everything with the help of robots that replaced the planets police forces. If any variable looked out of balance, Nolan sent it's bots to temporarily relocate whatever individual was most likely to cause a problem. For centuries the system worked perfectly. Nolan put certain variables in specific prisons depending on their current threat levels. If some of those people never made it back into society it was overlooked. Isn't world peace worth it, whatever the cost?

For 371 years, Nolan kept the world running smoothly. Until one day it didn't. The first crime was completely unexpected. News stations around the world jumped on the story of a lifetime. The body of what appeared to be a homeless man. Long, ragged hair, naked and a scar going around his skull in a perfect circle. Cause of death seemed to be that he bled out. There were holes in his wrists and ankles like something had been ripped out. It was a sensation. Who was this man and where did he come from? Who was able to commit a crime while avoiding Nolan?

The next day the coroner who performed the autopsy was declared missing, along with the body of the homeless man. The intern spent days going through the coroner's notes. Only to find a printed photograph of what appeared to be a bar code branded into someone's skin. As the intern headed to the office the next morning. A Nolan bot labeled him a variable and he was never seen again."

Anyways, I purposely started my MAcc over the summer to have an established GPA before fall recruiting. I really buckled down and got a 3.7 and have continued to do well this semester.

Working, it can't be helped sadly. No really; it can't. Why else would I be slaving away at this copious amount of paper - ""in need of processing"" - at this ungodly hour. It's not like I had any choice in the matter. In another life I would probably be spending this post-weekend day in some resort, pondering the meaning of life after consuming a plethora cocktails. But that's not the life I'm conciously living at the moment. Instead I'm sitting here, processing paper.

On a totally unrelated note, there seems to be a particulary buzzing working enviroment today. Not unlike last wednesday when Kevin - two cubicles to the left - started working again after being sick for almost a whole week (Shocker right? It's like he's almost human; he's not. I'm onto you *Kevin*). Jenny - three to the right - had been antsy the whole day because her ""Glad you're back Kevin""-cake had not been delivered in time. We fed of the drama that ensued after the cake turned out to say ""Glad your back Kevin"" for an entirety of two days. I don't know what the upset is all about this time. Will have to investigate.

`Monday October 12th 6:35 am`

After a succesful investigation I found out the source of the big hoo-hah. *We're getting a watercooler*. I mean, seriously? Could Kevin not think of any other mundane purchase that he could've made? If that thing were to have feet it would be a walking office cliché. *Fuck me..* 

`Monday October 12th 7:20 am`

The watercooler is actually pretty chill, it's pretty soothing to see it bubble whenever someone pours in a cool refreshing H2O. The conversations we have around it are also really nice, everyone seems to really be opening up. This might just end up being my next big timesink apart from farmville and candy crush.

`Tuesday October 13th 6:30 am`

Woo! Glad to be working again today. I've been looking forward to returning ever since I left here last night. Spend a good hour yesterday at the cooler because it was really amazing. It was as if we were at the Christmas party again when everyone had too much Eggnogg and Stacy blew André and Dick in the copyroom. We kind of shared our favorite fantasies with one another and got really deep into discussing the correlation between oral sex and overall work performance.

I feel really good aswell! I think I really should indulge in some more water drinking. Maybe I had been slightly dehydrated for a while now and needed that extra kick to just get in this awesome shape!

`Monday October 19th 6:30 am`

Can't believe it has already been a week since the cooler was implemented. I keep forgetting to write because I'm so jazzed working all the time. And when I'm not working I can't help but to feel just so *turned on*. I noticed too that everyone seemingly starts to look better in shape. Guess having the occasional walk and water instead of soda or coffee does the trick huh?!

`Monday November 2nd 6:30 am`

Pfew, can't believe a couple of weeks have gone by without me writing. I guess my time got demolished pretty hard with all of the crazyness happening over here. The amount of sexy shenanigans happening around here is absurd. Just last saturday the whole office was enjoying the *very* audible fuckfest Jenny and Stacy were appearently having in the bathroom. It was crazy let me tell you, the way the entire floor just applauded as they settled in their chairs all flushed red and messy haired. 

But alas, alack and alan! I must quickly rest my pen for now. We're meeting our new interns at the cooler in a minute of five and I want to refill first.

3r8s5y,0,2015-11-02,I wanted to kill myself [23M] because of her [22F] selfish actions. What does that make her?,Hurt_Not_Broken,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r8s5y/i_wanted_to_kill_myself_23m_because_of_her_22f/,"Long time lurker, first time poster.  This is a long-ass story, and I don't know who (if anyone) will read it, but here it goes.


Before I explain what happened, I want to attempt to express to you my history and what this girl was to me.  


I was a very emotionally sensitive child, and I am still a very sensitive person today (though I can manage it like an adult now).  I am an INFJ.  I was raised by extremely logical and judgmental parents.  They loved me (and love me) fiercely.  I know they do.  But as a very sensitive child, I couldn't discern the love in many of the actions of my parents, and over time this distanced me from them greatly.  Even today, I much prefer to have my relationship with them at a distance.  But as a Freshman/Sophomore in high school, I believed that I hated my parents.  In my subconscious mind, they were not my family.  They had lost that right by being continuously insensitive to my emotional needs as a child.  So when I got to high school, I was insanely happy to find friends who saw me for what I was and seemed to genuinely care.  My friends, I deemed, were my true family.


But HA! Good old Sigmund Freud.  He knew damn well that every boy's first love is his mother.  And since I was a sensitive child, this must've applied doubly for myself.  Little did I know, upon entering high school, the pedestal of ""mother"" was empty (and had been for quite some time) in my heart and subconscious mind.  And little else did I know, I desperately wanted/needed someone to fill that hole inside of me.  


Enter Ashley. (not her real name)  


We met online, on this writing website called Ficlets.  We both enjoyed writing stories of romance, and we were fans of each other's work.  So naturally, we decided to do a collaboration.  And what started as a simple romance story soon turned into a story about *us*.  We stopped talking about what chapters we were going to write next and started talking about seeing each other.  This was back in the days of AIM and the early years of Facebook.  We spent hours talking; on AIM, on the phone, on Facebook, on Skype.  This may sound like retarded 15-year-old bullshit (and it is), but the moment I saw a picture of her on Facebook, I fell hard as fuck, and I have never fallen for someone that hard since.  I *shook* whenever she called me during the first weeks we were ""seeing each other"".  


I had suffered from major depression before meeting her, and at the time I really didn't understand depression at all.  I just hated the way I felt, and I hated myself and my life because of it.  When I met Ashley, all of that changed.  The way she made me feel was incredible.  It was insanity, it was dizzying, like I was smoking crack 24/7.  Not only that, but every time I expressed some sort of emotional need to her, she would caress me with her words.  She would tell me everything was okay.  She would say my name lovingly, sing me lullabies (even though she couldn't sing), enumerate everything about me that she loved.  She did everything for me that I needed from a *mother*.  


Fuck.  Imagine the mind-blow I had when I psycho-analyzed this shit.


There was one problem with our perfect, star-crossed romance.  Ashley lived in Michigan, and I in Georgia.  And her parents (and many of her friends) hated the living fuck out of me.  Why?  Because I was ""from the internet"".  Ashley and I dated for 6 months before actually meeting face-to-face for the first time.  Her parents only allowed it because they thought she would dump me after meeting me and seeing ""how weird internet people are"" (I fucking hate these people).  But God was it divine.  It was divine to have her hold me in her gentle arms, to kiss me, to look me in the eyes, to whisper in my ear that she loved me.  At this point, Freud is having a fucking field day.  I'm 2 years old again, and Ashley is my mother.


Fast forward 7 months.  We haven't seen each other once since that one glorious week.  The pressure is on for both of us.  With the pressures of high school mounting and the thumbs of our parents pressing down upon us, we were powerless to even remotely do anything about seeing each other.  I had resigned myself to living in an imaginary future where the two of us somehow ended up at the same college and lived happily ever after.  But she was not satisfied.  Much as she loved me, she couldn't continue a relationship where there was no end in sight to the oppression we faced.  And yes, this was some fucking mean-spirited oppression on her parents' part.  So she starts talking to other guys, which I obviously don't tolerate.


Let me take this moment to re-iterate that at this point in time, Ashley is basically a mother to me.  She is my sun.  She is perfect and incapable of failure.  


And just as Freud predicted, mother shattered son's dreams of permanent love, by pursuing another man.  Ashley found someone else.


The force with which my snow-globe-esque heart shattered is incalculable.  At the same time, I couldn't comprehend it.  I couldn't understand Ashley's behavior.  This wasn't Ashley.  This was some other girl.  


""Who is this?  Why are they doing this to me?  Mom?  Where's mom??  I need a hug!""


Silence.  


Every morning I woke up, I would experience 5 milliseconds of innocent placidness.  Then my brain kicked into gear and remembered that my world no longer had a sun.  I couldn't understand anything.  I couldn't eat food.  Every day I went to school, and it felt like I was walking around with a missing arm.  I tried my best to contain the blood.


Ashley still wanted to talk to me after she'd claimed another man for her own.  She tried to call many times, and I would cry because of how bad I wanted to answer.  Eventually she stopped trying.


I spent 3 months in pure misery.  Then she came back.  


She came to my figurative doorstep, and I was too beaten and weak to ignore her.  I needed the pain to stop.  The boy she had dated turned out to be a meathead who only wanted her for her body.  She admitted she missed the way I knew everything about her.  So we continued a half-relationship; I had a sun again, except that it was tainted.  The sky wasn't blue anymore.  It was dark and stormy.  Ashley wasn't the flawless being I'd made her out to be, and I was still struggling to come to terms with this.  There were equal parts of love and resentment for her.  Some nights I couldn't say ""I love you"" to her because my tongue wouldn't let me.  I was so horribly torn.  I didn't know what to do about this person I accepted as my mother.


When senior year came around, I told her that I wanted to stop talking, and I didn't want to see anything from her Facebook.  I was terrified of having a repeat of the previous year, and I knew I wouldn't be able to succeed in my academic pursuits if I was dealing with that torment.  She reluctantly agreed, and so we did not talk for almost a year.  That fall/winter was difficult for me, because I still wasn't sure how to function properly without Ashley, but something curious happened in the spring.  I came to a point where I was bordering on major depression; there was a day where I could actually feel myself on the edge.  That's when I realized something: Ashley would not be there to help me.  She wouldn't be there to lift me up or make me happy again.  I realized that if I fell, &lt;b&gt;it would be for good.&lt;/b&gt;


So I did something.  I decided to love myself.  I decided that I wanted to live happily, regardless of whether Ashley was in my life or not.  So I did, for a while.  The summer after my senior year, I was sorely missing her.  The old longing to have my mother to come home to was tugging at my heart.  So I sought her out on Facebook, but was hurt to find she was with someone else.  Her profile picture was of the two of them, dressed up like it was a wedding day.  This obviously hurt a lot, but it was nothing in comparison to what I'd faced the previous year.  It prompted me to write her an overly-hateful email about how she had destroyed me and how she was an immature girl who only wanted to be with someone in order to cure her own loneliness.  She replied, saying that I was unreasonable and that she finally found someone whom she was ""very committed"" to.  I don't know what the fuck our relationship was, but I guess it wasn't worthy of her definition of ""very committed"".


I deleted everything about her from my life.  Hid all the notes she'd written me in a binder.  I threw away the keepsakes she'd sent me over the years.  I was moving out of state for college, and I desperately wanted a new start.  


Going to school far away from home was the best decision I could've made.  It opened my mind and cleared out the bible-belt bigotry I was raised around.  It helped me find new friends, new hobbies, new perspectives.  But it could not clear away all the leftover feelings I had for Ashley.  I couldn't explain why at the time, but whenever I met someone new and wanted to start a relationship with them, my heart would 'reject' the new crush.  I would develop the feelings, then my subconscious would crush them, ensuring my mother's rightful place in my heart remained undisturbed.


Mid-way through college, this phenomenon began to weaken slightly.  I was slowly becoming able to sustain feelings for other girls.  And I did have a short relationship that lasted ~3 months.  It was nice.  There was nothing groundbreaking about it, but it was so great to just share romance with someone new.  It ended because we were pretty different on fundamental levels, but the breakup was nothing catastrophic. 


Fast-forward another year.  It's the summer after my Junior year of college.  I haven't had another relationship since the short one I had during my sophomore year.  At this point, I am no longer feeling distraught or even miffed about Ashley.  I have spent years dealing with her, de-activating her power over me, sealing her away inside of me.  There now stood a figurative ""monument"" of her inside my heart.  I would appreciate it, gaze at it, wonder about it.  I had successfully turned Ashley into stone.


I was also kind of depressed.  Not majorly, but I had tried really hard to land an internship that summer.  I applied to 20+, and interviewed for 4.  I was rejected across the board, and it made me feel awful.  I was at home working a deli job when I should've been pursuing the start of my career in music/radio production.  It was nice to make money, but it was a real blow to my confidence to be there.  


The summer is almost up.  It's the end of July, and I'm starting to make plans about going back to school.  All of the fucking sudden, I get a message from Ashley.  On another writing website where we'd collaborated.  At first I am stunned.  I can't believe that she is reaching out to me.  At this time, I believe that I am in full control of her.  I am able to deal with her, because I have turned her into stone.  


I was so wrong.


We talked on the phone again, we skyped again, we talked about seeing each other again.  Well, let me be clear, SHE is the one who was pressing to make things romantic.  She wrote stories about us meeting and spending the night together.  She talked about going on dates with me.  She talked about how much she missed me.  I was stupid enough to ask her if she'd lost her virginity (I hadn't), and she said yes.  


That was when I lost it.  I took a drive at 2AM, and all I kept saying to myself was ""I don't want to go back"".  I did this for an hour.  The next day, against the will of my now-activated feelings for her, I told Ashley I couldn't talk to her any more.  I hung up, cried, went to work, didn't say a fucking word to anyone.  Everyone at the deli was concerned and asked what was up with me.  I didn't answer them.  


At this point, not only was I feeling like a failure professionally, but I was feeling like a total failure romantically.  Ashley had never been eliminated from my heart.  She had just remained dormant, retaining the pedestal of ""mother"" that she'd always had.  I was still a virgin.  I hadn't found anyone besides Ashley to develop a meaningful relationship with.  I drank heavily every night the rest of the summer.  It was the only way to forget about everything and feel kind of happy. 


I also became SUPER desperate.  I started doing online dating, furiously going through every profile I could find, but to no avail.  I continued drinking heavily into the school year.  Some days it would affect how much work I would get done.  Every day, the weight of feeling like a failure and not having the one thing that could make me whole (Ashley) dragged me down.  I let it hurt me way more than I should have, but I just didn't know what to do about it.  How could I not feel like a failure?  I was a college student, and according to society, all college students were supposed to have already lost their virginity!  I'm a millennial, and according to society, we're supposed to be incredibly successful directly out of high school!  It became a daily routine of hurt and anguish.


Fast forward 6 months.  I find out that I got an internship.  And, lo and behold, it's located 2 hours from Ashley's hometown.  I freak the fuck out.  I literally scream in my dorm room from excitement.  I waste no time, and the next day, I sent Ashley an email explaining that I would be close enough to meet her over the summer.  She replied by saying that she had another new bf.  She said I needed to move on, and that it wasn't healthy to hang on to someone who was so far away.  Okay.  Says the person who fucking contacted me in the first place after 3 years of silence.  Says the person who suggested we meet AND GO ON FUCKING DATES.  At this point, it's obvious that she really doesn't give a fuck about me as a person.  I realize that I am not truly a person to her.  I am just a placeholder; a boy; something to chase away loneliness.  That's why she contacted me, because she was fucking lonely and couldn't stand not having a boyfriend.  How fucking selfish and immature.  She didn't take into consideration the YEARS I spent dealing with her emotionally in order to live a happy life.


So, after this email, even though I realize she is bad for me, I still have feelings for her.  And I feel even worse, because now I know she is with someone else and is most likely fucking them.  Every time she crosses my mind, I want to kill myself.


And I really, truly think I would have.  If I hadn't met Diana (not real name).


I met Diana several weeks after receiving Ashley's email, and things developed pretty quickly.  She was really down-to-earth and didn't bother playing games, which I really liked.  But I had to deal with the massive fallout Ashley had caused inside of me, and it was hard to do that and develop a relationship with Diana at the same time.  Again, my heart attempted to crush my feelings for Diana because of the fundamental loyalty it had to Ashley.  But, through blood, sweat, and tears, I was able to do it, and I was able to have a very successful relationship with Diana.  And I did lose my virginity to her (•_•) / ( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ / (⌐■_■).  Haha, but in all seriousness, it was the first great relationship I've had after Ashley.  It did end, but only because we were too far apart and didn't want to hurt/limit each other because of that.  I still have feelings for Diana and would love to date her again if we are ever in the same city.


So, fast forward another 6 months, to the present day.  I have slowly but surely picked up the pieces, and I am almost to the point where I am feeling normal again.  There are still some days where I think of Ashley and feel a bit depressed, and there are still some days where I feel like a failure, but in general I am much better than where I was a year ago.  


Recently, I started using Tinder because why not?  And I've actually found someone who I feel has a lot of potential.  She is witty, conversational, open, honest, and on top of that pretty darn attractive!  Our first date went for 4 hours at a Starbucks.  I am very excited about the possibility of having a relationship that is real and has NOTHING to do with Ashley.  I still have some baggage to deal with, but it's not an insane amount, and I would be so happy to finally be with someone who is willing to work with me on that.


People ask me if I feel like Ashley ruined my life.  I want to say ""yes"", but is that really an accurate description?  I am working hard to pull myself out of the funk she put me in… and I'm slowly letting new lovers into my heart.  I guess what I'm looking for is someone to commiserate with.  Have you ever had someone who was SO FUNDAMENTAL to you, and they just didn't treat you with the care/respect you needed/deserved?  What does that make that person?  How did you reconcile this?  Did you find happiness elsewhere? 


______________________



TL;DR: I loved this girl (""Ashley"").  We dated in high school (LDR).  We broke up and didn't speak for 3 years.  She contacts me out of the blue last year and starts teasing me with talk about seeing each other/getting back together.  Major feels (on my part) ensue.  She doesn't want to commit.  She finds another bf, and tells me I need to move on WHEN SHE'S THE ONE WHO CONTACTED ME AFTER 3 YEARS OF SILENCE.  I spiraled into a major depression.  I would've probably attempted suicide if I hadn't met my most recent ex (sounds counterintuitive, but it was a great relationship).  Have you ever had someone like this in your life?  How did you deal with it?

3r8ts3,13,2015-11-02,My [29/m] girlfriend [26/f] is ending our relationship because of a surprise visit.,derricknh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3r8ts3/my_29m_girlfriend_26f_is_ending_our_relationship/,"A little backround: I met my girlfriend at a party at her house about two years ago. We hit it off, I left the party (I'm prone to irish exits) and she texted me to come back. We hung out everyday and a week later we went to Nice, France together (we're from the US, this was our first proper date). She is perfect in every way, very smart but does have some mental health issues. These are not a problem for me and I'm very understanding when she acts out or is irrational  about something. She, however, is not understanding if I've acted out or done something stupid and usually tells me I have to change because it's unattractive. 
In September I moved to the UK for university, while she stayed behind to save up money for her masters programme in the same city I'm now in. It was a good plan, a year isn't too long to be part and we skyped/called everyday. She seemed very supportive of my move and very keen on making the relationship work. 
About two weeks ago she found out she got into an internship in Asia and would be moving there for 6 months starting in December, so we wouldn't be spending my school vacations together like we planned. I knew I had a week off (this week) from school so I planned a surprise visit home to see her. I told my friends and family but told them to stay hush about it so she wouldn't find out.
I told her my mom was in town and wanted to take her to lunch, but when she showed up it was me instead. She was shocked! At first I thought she was just so excited, but it turned out she did NOT like the surprise. She fell silent and said she had to go clean her room. I tried to tell her that was dumb and we could just spend the couple hours she had before work hanging out but she insisted and left. I went and saw some friends, had some drinks and checked my phone at one point and she had called me 30 times, obviously having a panic attack. She sent messages that I wasnt letting her explain herself and that she called out of work and was going crazy, ect. I told her I'd need some space for a while but id come over in the evening and we could talk. When I showed up she was cold but allowed me to sleep in her (our) bed. She didn't touch me and rejected my cuddling. In the morning we went out for coffee and she seemed to be lightening up. I told her I'd get out of her hair before work and she told me we could see eachother when she was off of work (this was halloween). I went out and got pretty drunk and had a great time with my friends, but when she got home she was upset to see me at her (our) house. I went up to bed and she came up an hour later and told me to gtfo. I left and went to visit some friends in another city to get my mind straight and she just texted me to confirm the break up.

TL;DR My girlfriend left me after I flew across the ocean to see her.

Edit: here's the rundown

Before arriving: I buy the WiFi on the plane and we are texting the whole flight, and I purposefully wrote about how much I missed her and couldn't wait to be together again, which she was totally on the same page. I told her to bring some of my smaller items to give to my mom just to play it up. She packs my stuff in a little bag and writes me a note about how much she loves me and can't wait to be together again in england.

Meeting: she shows up on her bike and I walk outside and ask ""are you meeting someone here?"" Her face goes blank and I cover her in kisses, which she reciprocates. She says she has to sit down so we go to the park next door and she is silent, only says she needs to find coverage for work, which I told her she didn't it was fine because I had plans anyway (I knew she was working). She stays silent and I ask if she's hungry, she says sure but doesn't say anything else. We get food and sit, in silence and eat. I ask her eats bothering her and she says she was drunk last night and the room is a mess and she needs to clean it. I told her that isn't important and I don't care how messy the room is (I know she's messy, it's not a big deal). She INSISTS that she has to go and I say okay. She leaves and I decided to go to my neighborhood but not go in the house. I get off the bus and she rides past me as I'm walking and I flag her down. She immediately starts crying and keeps asking why I didn't tell her I was coming, but my reasoning doesn't make sense to her, she leaves and I continue to walk to my neighborhood. The rest of this day goes as I explained earlier, and when we meet up at night she just keeps telling me I clearly don't know her and how fucked up this whole thing is, I tell her I understand and I'm sorry, she agrees I can stay in the bed but turns over and ignores me all night, even when I ask for just a kiss she says no.

Halloween: we get coffee in the morning and she  starts acting more normal, but I am a little hesitant. She gives me some cute laughs and imitates my frown face a few times and starts talking about normal stuff for the ride home. I get out of the car and tell her I'm gunna head off and to have a good day at work, she tells me we can talk later. Friends, port wine, costumes, house show, party party. At this point I'm pretty drunk (not proud of it but hey, it's halloween). I am on the porch talking to a girl who she apparently hates (ex boyfriend's current girlfriend) and she only acknowledges my presence by saying my name with a tone. I realize this is my cue to call it a night (it's 130am) and head up to bed (in her/our bed). I wasn't thinking, it just felt normal to do because I've lived in this room for 5 years (her only 6 months). She came upstairs about an hour later and told me she didn't give me permission to sleep there and to gtfo. I left. "
3r95fa,0,2015-11-02,I'm starting to lose hope to find an actuary position,ActuaryHopeful603,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/3r95fa/im_starting_to_lose_hope_to_find_an_actuary/,"Hi everyone. I'm sorry if this is a repeated subject, but I've scanned through this subreddit for the past hour or so and am still unsure what to do.  I graduated with a stats degree with a minor in actuarial studies back in May.  I've passed P/1 and FM/2 and am also VEE certified in Stats, Finance, and Economics.  I'm also planning to take MFE in March. Since I graduated I've been applying to jobs across the states, but have yet to get any sort of interview.  My gpa wasn't the best, 3.0 and I didn't have an internship.  I feel like it's also worth to note that I took off the month of June to celebrate graduating and passing FM/2 and have been working since July.  I think that I have a well put together resume and a good cover letter.

After 5 months I'm really starting to get discouraged and am really considering looking for another position so I can at least get some sort of experience under my belt.  So my question is what is the best position in your opinions that I should start to search for?  Or should I just not lose hope and keep looking for an actuary position?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance."
3r9j8h,7,2015-11-02,Is College Worth the Debt,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3r9j8h/is_college_worth_the_debt/,"Hello everyone like most I have been following this subreddit for a long time but never had a reason to post until now.

I'm going to lay the question out first then my financial situation then the finances involved with the school, I'm sorry in advance because I know this is going to be a long post but I think the background information is necessary. Also sorry if any formatting or wording doesn't make sense, I tried my best and will try to clarify anything if necessary.

**My Question:** 

Am I absolutely insane for wanting to attend a school that I will go into approximately $64k worth of private loan debt for? How long will the loans affect my financial situation if I am committed to paying them back as fast as I can and make them my #1 priority?

**My situation:** 

I am 21 and have attended 2 colleges so far. One from back home was a community college I was at for 2 years paid for by me mostly out of pocket (only took out one federal subsidized when I absolutely needed it) and the college I transferred to about 8 hours away from home that I hate this is a four year public university, which I paid for with a federal unsubsidized loan and a federal subsidized loan. 

As I stated before I absolutely do not like my current university and want to transfer back to my home state and attend a private (not for profit) 4 year university there for the Winter 2016 quarter.

Currently I live in on campus apartments that I already paid for through December 10th so my current wages are all going towards buying food and gas every month, but I still never have enough money to put anything into savings.

Ultimately I want to graduate with a bachelors degree in Public Relations and find a job in the music industry side of PR. I chose this private college because they push internships with a HUGE music label and have many of their alumni working at the company. This company is my dream job. Also I am set in this career it is definitely what I want to do.

**Personal info that might be relevant:**

I have zero interest of children, ever so that's not an expense I need to worry about. I don't want to own a house as I just don't want the hassle and I would rather find a reputable landlord and rent in the city I'm moving to. Once I transfer I won't need a car or want a car as the city as pretty decent public transport. So those are all expenses I won't have.

**My Finances:**

 I currently make $8.50 an hour which is horrible and it's the lowest paying job I have ever had in my life and only get about 20 hours max a week. I was looking into getting another job but I am leaving the area in a month to go back home so I feel like no one will hire me anyway. 

My parents are paying exactly $0.00 of my college expenses. They make about $60k-75k a year which puts my EFC pretty high in consideration to what they're actually paying so I get basically no financial aid. 

I have applied for over $100,000 worth of scholarships since June and I have received NONE of them!


My current loans are in the following amounts:

Federal Subsidized #1: $1,865

Federal Subsidized #2: $2,250

Federal Unsubsidized: $1,000


My current total cash on hand is:

$241.88

I also have a Discover student card that has a balance of:

$273.61
(not due until December 19th and I have never carried a balance on this card)
So basically I have no money to my name and my car is out of gas too.



The School (costs goes by quarters so its 10 Weeks long &amp; I would do 3 quarters a year):
This is only for **ONE** quarter!

Tuition: $11,8893

Housing: $2,882

Meal Plan: $948

Activity Fee: $25

Public Transport Pass: $92

**Total Cost: $15,840**


Financial Aid awarded to me:

Federal Subsidized Loan: $1,500

Federal Unsubsidized Loan: $667

Grant from the school: $3,000

**Total Awarded to me: $5,167**

Difference between Cost and Award is: **$10,673 per quarter**

Multiply this by 6  quarters to graduate is: **$64,038** I would have total in private loans by the end of my college career plus the federal loans.

Please kick me in the butt if I'm insane for thinking this might work or that it might be worth it if I'm wrong. Thank you so much for your time if you read that whole thing, and thank you even more if you reply to this."
3r9nlf,133,2015-11-02,You[m17-23] don't quit Crazy[f17-23]. Crazy has to quit YOU.,aftonbladder,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3r9nlf/youm1723_dont_quit_crazyf1723_crazy_has_to_quit/,"First of all, there is one simple rule for Dating Crazy:  You don't quit Crazy.  Crazy quits You!    
I dated Crazy (her real name was Lacey, but the last few years I've always refered to ""the crazy ex-girlfriend"" or just ""Crazy"").  She was way way on the wrong side of the Vicky Mendoza Diagonal.  I've seen her deliberately miss spotting another cheerleader doing a fall-back from a high stunt simply because the other cheerleader had been #1 on a ""rank-all-the-cheerleaders-by-who-is-hottest"" poll that went around school.  Crazy was #3.  #1 ended up in the hospital with a sub-cranial bleed.  Crazy waited four years until #2 got married, and then slept with #2's husband while #2 was pregnant and then ""accidentally"" got caught blowing him in the half-painted nursery.  Crazy for #1!    
No denying that Crazy was hot, though.  Otherwise, why would I ever have put up with her?  She was an ""all inputs"" girl, taking it all the way down her throat as often and as enthusiastically as she took it all the way up her ass.  Road head?  Mandatory.  Fucking while staying at her parents house?  Better be prepared for some awkward breakfasts because nobody's going to bring up the subject of who was screaming ""fuck me!"" at 2AM last night even though everybody knows who was screaming ""fuck me!"" at 2AM last night.  Public sex?  Risky sex?  Damn straight.  Three-ways?  ""I'd like you to meet Heather, my friend from French 101.""  Crazy was a ball-sucker extraordinaire.  She could make you cum from it.  I've never met anyone else who could make a man cum from sucking his balls.  I don't think I spent a weekend with Crazy where I didn't cum at least five times- and five would have been a LOW number.  I once calculated how much of my cum Crazy had swallowed in the six years we dated- it was well over a gallon, and there wasn't a day when she didn't tell me she wanted more.    
Two of my favorite stories about Crazy are the time when I came back from a meeting to set up my internship.  We were both juniors.  It was January.  My birthday was in a couple of days.  We'd been apart for a whole week.  For Crazy, this was a ""situation.""  Something had to be done.  Something big.    
When I got to the airport, she was dressed in a trench coat, holding a mylar balloon with ""Happy Birthday, #1 Boyfiend"" on it.  We slogged out into the frigid Nebraska slush to where her car was parked.  Despite the nearly empty lot, it was parked far from the terminal.  We trudged over, balloon and luggage in tow.    
When we got there, Crazy tapped me on the shoulder as I was loading the stuff into the trunk.  I turned around to see her unbutton the trench coat and drop it to the ground.  Underneath, she was bare-ass naked.  I think it was like -5F at the time.  Her nipples could have cut steel.  She squatted down, took my cock out, and gave me a few quick sucks before yelling ""holy fuck! it's cold out here! get in the car!""    
Then instead of getting dressed, she threw her coat in the TRUNK of the car and climbed in the driver's seat.    
The parking lot attendant got a nice long look at Crazy's stiff nipples and smooth-shaven pussy that night.  I'm 100% sure his wife got the fuck of her life that night.    
I came twice during the drive home.  When Crazy decides you need to cum again, you cum again.  She doesn't stop, not even to swallow your first load.  It hurts like hell at first, but watching her gulp down two full loads of cum (sometimes even three) is worth it.  The first load gets worked up into a kind of froth.  You'd think it would act like extra lubricant, but it doesn't.  It sort of makes the inside of her mouth and throat a little sticky.  Doesn't stop her, though.  Post-orgasm torture, some people call it.  Maybe for a minute or two, but after that it's a damn fine way to drive home.    
The rest of that night was standard Crazy.  We fucked.  She took it up the ass, several times.  She started crying about how everybody hates her, how all of her friends are bitches, how I didn't call on Tuesday and she was sure it was become I was out screwing some skank, how if I didn't get it up NOW I'd never get another blowjob from her in my life.  You know, standard Crazy.  It was a valid threat- blowjobs were the only time I had five straight minutes without Crazy sounding, well, Crazy.    
The other time was a little while after Crazy came in #3 in the ""hottest cheerleader"" poll.  We were driving around looking for a gas station we'd heard would sell beer to under-21's if you flashed titty at the register operator.  Crazy flashed like a dozen gas station attendants and got nothing but bug-eyed stares.  So fuck it, we were just going to drive around while Crazy rambled on about how much she hated gas station attentandts and fuck them for not giving her beer.  Best damn tits in Nebraska should get beer just for being the best damn tits in Nebraska (to which I voiced my strongest agreement, in an effort to ensure continued access to the best damn tits in Nebraska).    
Then Crazy yells ""STOP THE FUCKING CAR!""    
I screech on the brakes and look for whatever had been about to kill us.  Zilch.  Not another car in sight.  All I see is a strip club with...    
Oh.  Amateur Night Competition.  At a strip club.  Should be right up Crazy's alley.  And having been right up Crazy's alley, I could tell it would be a hell of a ride.    
So I turned into the parking lot and find a spot.  Crazy was already in the back seat divesting herself of panties and bra.  A few minutes and a couple of waivers of liability later, we're in the strip club doing shots with other ""contestants.""  Turns out the other contestants weren't amateurs.  They were just strippers from other clubs.  Crazy's never been on a stripper pole in her life, so she's getting real nervous as contestant after contestant gyrates and swings like pros.  Which they are.  But Crazy's got one thing they don't have: She's underage and doesn't give a fuck.  That's two things, actually.  Oh, and she's way hotter than any of the ""girls"" who've gone on before.  Which would be three things, but it's pretty dim in there so you can't honestly see how skanky some of them are.    
So Crazy's turn finally comes, and she gets up on stage.  She's supposed to do a two-song set, tittys out on the first set, bare-ass on the second.  No self-touching, no touching by patrons, and a bunch of other rules.  Scoring is by how many $1 bills get thrown on stage.  Crazy yells up to the DJ.  ""Fuck it!"" she says.  ""Turn up the fucking lights, and I don't need any fucking music!"" and then she strips right off.  Bare-ass naked with the house lights full on.  Then she starts fingering herself and rubbing her clit, right in front of God and sixty drunken Nebraskan rednecks.  All hell breaks loose.  Crazy get practically covered with cash.  The house mom storms out about three minutes into this.  Crazy walks out of the club, disqualified but clearly the undisputed winner, butt-naked and clutching handfuls of cash.  I follow, carrying her purse, shoes, and dress.  Fucks given: zero.  Sex that night: fucking insane.  (epilogue to this story: Crazy went back the next night, spit in the house mom's face, and got physically ejected by bouncers while I tried to negotiate a night without police reports.)    
Crazy never changed the entire time I dated her.  Marriage was out of the question.  I was willing to spend six years in mortal terror, but a lifetime?  Not even a consideration.  But it really wasn't my choice.  I tried to break up with Crazy a couple of times.  Never a good idea.  I once made it an entire weekend- and then asked her to take me back because I had no idea how a butcher knife got embedded in the bed next to me.  I never even woke up.  Never told her it was because I was afraid she's slit my throat, either.  I just called back and said ""Baby, I was soooo wrong.  Can you forgive me?""  The next time I tried, she just looked at me and said ""are you stupid or just forgetful?""  I went with stupid.  Worked just fine.    
It all ended one day when Crazy and I got home from Wal-Mart and found that the check-out clerk had failed to credit Crazy $1.45 for a discounted item.  Wal-Mart was a twenty mile drive from our apartment, but fuck you if you think you can short Crazy $1.45 and get away with it.  She screamed about how she was going to rape kill that checkout clerk until her vagina bled into her asshole and she'd poop through her pussy.  And that was some of the milder stuff.    
If you're wondering why I went along with this, it was mostly for safety's sake.  I followed Crazy to these things in the hopes that I could at least contain the damage.  My job was to keep sharp edges and blunt objects out of Crazy's reach and maintain a keen eye on the horizon so we could get out of there before the cops showed up.  This time, I was successful on the first objective but not so much on the second.  Crazy blazed into that Wal-Mart like an avenging angel, rage-bound to do as much psychological damage to that checkout clerk as possible, hopefully make her cry and maybe even drive her to suicide.  It's good to have goals in life.    
Unfortunately, local cops were already there dealing with something else (I have no idea what).  Neither of us noticed them until it was too late.  About the fifth incoherent screamfest and seventeeth death threat, the checkout clerk pushed a panic button and Crazy found herself on the business end of a can of pepper spray.  The list of charges was impressive, as was the sight of Crazy being carried out of the store on the shoulder of a 6'4"" oxen-huge black cop.    
Miraculously, Crazy beat the rap.  Being insanely hot and having a rich daddy go a long ways towards obtaining justice.  The charges were dropped, and the closest she got to punishment was a letter from Wal-Mart telling to stay out of every damn store they had, or would have, in the fucking entire universe.  Not in those exact words, but the implication was clear.    
I never got to see any of that because Crazy dumped me the next day after getting arrested.  It seems that my failure to wade in and fight four very large and very armed cops for her was unacceptable.  Note that I was not dumped for failing to talk her out of driving twenty miles to beat the fuck out some register drone, nor did I get any credit for taking away her ""self defense club"" (a spiked monstrosity that looks like something that Bowser would use to peg his boyfriend while complaining about ""that bitch Princess Peach."")  Nope.  I was either gay or a coward or both because I didn't pimp slap a cop.    
Oh, there was lots of post-breakup sex.  The thing is, Crazy never really quits you- Crazy just shows up at 2AM for drunken anal sex because she knows you're engaged and wants to fuck it up for you.  Which works because you're never going to date anyone half as hot as Crazy, and she knows it.  You're fucked for life because nobody- and I mean NOBODY- does a single sexual act (oral, anal, doggie, missionary, in a chair, up against the wall, etc.) as good as she does.  Most days, you're just happy to not be afraid anymore.  But if Crazy calls, you're like ""uh, Honey, there's something I have to take care of down at the office,"" and fuck you you're cheating on your wife &amp; kids and you KNOW Crazy's got it all on camera in case you ever try to say ""no"" later on.    
Crazy got married a couple of years back.  She broke up cheerleader #1's family and married the guy.  Three kids without a dad and a wife now a single mom just because some assholes in our high school ranked her above Crazy.  It wasn't even her FAULT!  None of the cheerleaders knew it was going on at the time.  But fuck you if you get picked before Crazy.  As far as I've heard, #1's ex and Crazy are still together.  She called me the night of the wedding, sobbing hysterically about how she still loved me, and that I'll always be the love of her life, and that she doesn't want me to ever be out of her life.  It was like being on the other end of the conversation that Sharon Stone has in the movie Casino, only with fewer mobsters.  I hope.  Anyway aside from one other time where she texted me while her new husband was fucking her in the ass (at least that's what she said was happening) and blaming me for ""abandoning her,"" I haven't heard from her since.    
So with luck, Crazy's finally quit me.    
I've been dating a much calmer girl for a while.  Things are going great, although it must kind of suck having someone like you because you're NOT particularly hot or sexy.  Who knew that the lack of fear is an aphrodisiac?    "
3rad8o,27,2015-11-02,21 year old graduating college next month.. I don't have much guidance and am not sure if my current plan / budget is going to work or not.,JettisonAway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3rad8o/21_year_old_graduating_college_next_month_i_dont/,"Hi! I'm a computer science student who will be finishing up my degree and am quickly approaching a bunch of 'adult' milestones that I'm worried about. I have a salaried job lined up from rolling over my current internship that will pay $52.2k / yr starting in January- until then I'm still hourly. 

I'm currently living paycheck to paycheck working two jobs and have literally no savings outside of around $4000 in savings bonds that I haven't touched from gifts from when I was younger. I very well might need to crack into those to sign the lease for the new apartment I'm looking at.

Current and future expenses involve about 70-80k in student loan debt (I don't know the specific number, but it is ugly because the loans are in varying amounts from varying agencies), potentially needing a new car in the next year (I have a 10-year old Cavalier with 130k on the odometer, but I sense impending transmission problems soon), potentially a wedding in the next five years, and your other basic stuff- eventually owning a home, etc. 

My girlfriend currently works in Manhattan making less than I do- she has no debt to anyone other than her family but we're keeping our books mostly separate for now. Kids are 100% not in our future so that's one less thing to consider.

I want to tackle my loan debt as quickly and violently as possible while also building some savings for those other large ticket items. My budget draft for the future is as follows, based on all of my current knowledge:

52,200 / yr = 4350 / mo

tax = 1000? - This is probably an overestimation but I don't know how much to expect. I assume losing a quarter of my paycheck is about right for a business based outside Philly?

rent / utilities = ~750- my girlfriend and I are going to rent out a 1 bedroom in between Trenton and Princeton, and 1500 between the both of us seems reasonable. 

student loans = 1000- I have no idea what any of this looks like, but I'm thinking I can pay my minimum payments on each loan and then throw the rest of this into the highest interest-rate loan?

401k = between 400 and 800-  My employer matches 0.75 of each dollar up to 10% of my paycheck, and I can contribute 20% maximum. I know nothing about this beyond that- I want to at least do 10% and I'd like to do the full 20 but I'm not sure what is smart. 

gas / car insurance = 200 - 400. I pay about 100 in insurance now, but I know my rates are going to go up when we move to Jersey, plus my drive is about 30 miles one-way each day, with occasional trips to Baltimore required from my job. This doesn't really seem negotiable. 

Food / dates- around 300 from me is my guess I think. This is another expense I can split with my GF. 

Quickly approximating the above gives about 3800 / mo.

The remainder is what I have to play with- which isn't much. I'm very frugal otherwise and don't spend much on myself other than the occasional video game or things like Spotify Premium.
Whatever is left will go into a savings account to be used either whenever something breaks or for one of the other expenses I have lined up. 

I guess my question would be if everything up to this point is reasonable.. should I be pouring more money into one section or less from another? I want to eventually do stock investment things but that's definitely not possible until this other debt goes away. I didn't learn much at all from my parents about fiscal management of any kind and don't want to get off on the wrong foot when this whole being an adult thing kicks in. 

TL;DR fresh out of college, any and all advice would be a godsend. "

Last friday after eating pizza hut I tested my blood sugar on my dad's onetouch ultra.  He wanted to test it because I keep peeing a lot at night.  My results an hour after eating were 23.7 mmol.  The next day After sleeping it was 18.8( was hungover from drinking not sure if that affects it) Does this mean I definitely have diabetes? If so would it be type 1 or type 2.  Are these numbers considered severely high? My dad kept being vague about it and said we need to get a doctor's appointment.  I keep having anxiety now so I want to know how worried should I be? Thanks*Also I'm 28 years old if that matters

UPDATE: I saw my family doctor today, he was away and I saw another doctor.  I think she was new, or a med student or intern, I really didn't like her.  She said that blood sugar of 23 was normal, it's only when fasting that matters.  I said on no food in the morning I was 18.8 and she still said she didn't recommend a blood test.  She didn't seem concerned at all and said it was just because I ate pizza.  When I told her my dad was type 1 she suddenly seemed more concerned and only then she agreed I should have a blood test.  I don't know what to think now because you guys and my dad made me feel worried and she acted like there was nothing wrong.  Was she just stupid? I don't know what to think."

Hi, My name is Jake. I am 17 years old, and am looking to enlist in the Navy. I need to enlist, as this is my ticket out of my current situation. I'm thinking the Navy as it best fits what I want to do after I exit the military, which I have been working towards since I started high-school. 


I posted this in order to get some help with the following things:

* Preparing for the ASVAB
* Passing MEPS
* Picking a rate

I've already begun training for MEPS and Boot, I've been practicing duck walking, and calisthenics. I'm not too worried about the ASVAB as I scored an 80 on the practice test in the recruiter's office but I would like to be adequately prepared, as a poor ASVAB score would set me back from some ratings. I've had a sit down heart to heart talk about enlisting with my parents and they gave me their blessing.

Some Info about me:

    Height: 5'10""
    Weight: 176 lbs
    Ethnicity: Latino
    Race: White
    Educational Background: +/- 60 College credit hours, 3.0 GPA, 2 year degree in May 2016
    Major: Maritime Administration, Finance as a backup
    Licenses: Standard Driver's License, Watercraft Operator's Permit, First Aid Cert
    Languages: English, Spanish, Some Turkish
    Hobbies: Kayaking, Programming, Hiking, Racing, Cooking, Lockpicking, Hunting
    Interests: Maritime Law, International Relations, International Affairs, History, Politics
    Former Employment: Deckhand, Dockhand, Service &amp; Parts department in a drydock Marina,
    Internship under a major port authority, Sales, Internship w/ court transcription company
    Drug/Alcohol/Tobacco Usage: No drug usage, minor alcohol consumption, smoked Hookah
    with Turks and Egyptians a time or two
    Police Record: None, not even traffic/moving violations
    Academic Preferences: I'm mediocre at math, great at history and humanities, okay at Econ
    Markings: No Tats, scar near my right eye, few slight scars on my right hand, left arm, &amp; chest 
    from a knife fight. Entirely cosmetic, no function loss from these, the cuts weren't deep.

When I exit the Navy, I plan to attend a Texas A&amp;M campus to pursue Maritime administration and logistics as well as the accompanying merchant marine licenses. The naval experience will help me in this regard, and there's tons of programs and support for veterans on campus. The GI bill will allow me to afford it as I can't afford it any other way. I was offered an internship position with a financial services company, with a stipend, and the promise that they would sponsor me and pay for my Series 7 test, but I'd like to avoid that for now.

My qualifications and Resume for my age are pretty good, but honestly if I can't enlist there isn't much going for me. My family has fallen on some hard times. I've been able to get by in school, by just my intelligence alone. I'm lazy, and rely on others far too much. I'm a pretty charismatic guy who makes deals and favors with people and uses these favors to get things I need done. I've never had to study until now and I lack discipline. I generally sweet talk to get a passing grade or my homework done. And I feel like I have no purpose or direction in life.

-These aren't good qualities, and I'm ashamed to be typing this

There's no point in going to college as a junior with my credit hours if I'm going to flunk out of school and not get course work done. I need to enlist in the Navy, because I know they'll break me down and rebuild me from the ground up. I know I'll learn discipline and responsibility, and accountability, or get court martialed for failing to do so. I got the drive. I have the time to burn. By some miracle of god, I haven't gotten some girl pregnant, gotten addicted to drugs, or gotten arrested or killed like some of my friends. Half my friends are going places I can't follow. The other half are going places I'd rather not end up.

Here's what I need,

I've worked my tail off my entire life, or worked hard to avoid working. I used to weigh 246 pounds prior to this. I worked 40+ hours a week from the beginning of my Sophomore year. I'm committed to self improvement. **I'd like a rating that would help me advance in my interest area**, or at least be enjoyable. I really enjoyed my time as a deckhand, and love operating small watercraft and getting my hands dirty and feet wet. But I've also had the opportunity to ride in Jets and helos, both of which I've loved. I have diving experience, but am not certified. I'm a damn good swimmer. I'm not squeamish as I grew up constantly helping out in the harbor, or on my grandfather's cattle ranch. I'm very laid-back and easy going, almost nothing really bothers me or worries me and I handle stress well. I can practically only function under pressure. I have a tendency to analyze and probe people, like I'll find out everything about them and try to read them like a book. I'm decent at first aid, and was considering becoming an EMT in the future if none of this panned out.

I'd prefer a **contract with a signing bonus**, my car recently had the engine die, and my father insisted on paying for the repairs and engine. After reviewing his finances, he maxed out his credit card doing so. It cost him about $3150, and I'd like to pay him back if I can. **Travel would be nice** as well, I haven't see much outside of the gulf coast, and would like to. I want some adventure, I want something I can tell stories about to my kids if that ever happens.

I'm doing this for my family and myself. By me doing dual credit at the expense of my district I saved my parents plenty of money, and now we need it more than ever. If I can use the GI bill, he can have the money that my family saved for me as well as what was set aside for him, and we have slightly less than enough to send my brother to get a 2 year degree and get most of a bachelor's done. If it came down to it, could I possibly transfer some of my GI bill benefits to my brother if the need arose?

Here are a few questions I have:

* What is the possibility that I could see home before the contract are up?
* How is communication with the outside world?
* If I'm not happy with a rate, what is the chance that I could be retrained or cross trained elsewhere?
* How is pursuing secondary education in the navy during active duty?
* How easy is it to stay in shape while on a ship?
* Is it worth it to stay in the reserves after the completion of the contract?

I've got a girl, and I've been with her a while and she's great and all. Her family offered to help me pay for college, but I'm hesitant at doing this, well, because I'm 17 and a lot of things and petty BS can happen in a few years. I don't like handouts, and if something happened between us, I'd feel like I'd have to pay them back. They've done a lot for me, and I wouldn't like to ditch them outright, but if communication and visitation would be an issue, I know that she'd be better off without me. She'll find someone else easily guaranteed.

I know this is the right decision for me, and I want to be a part of something greater. Thank you all for your time and input. I look forward to serving with y'all.

Sorry for the wall of text.

**Tl;Dr:** I have a decent future, but I need to get my shit together. Military service will help me get my shit together. Help me pick a rating."

3rbv3s,10,2015-11-03,Need advice brahs,HorseDickBrah,zyzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/zyzz/comments/3rbv3s/need_advice_brahs/,"Fuarrrrk

This has been a hectic month to say the least.  Anyways, no sob story here, I just need you sick cunts to point me in the right direction. Get my head straight.

So, I'm 22, and a full time college student studying business.  I just got this job last week at a start up company as a technician.  This job is 40 hours a week, and would be an ideal internship for an engineering or science student... but I'm the one doing it as a business student, for a salary of 2.4k a month.

Since I got this job, I don't have time for ANYTHING.  Besides the weekend, I literally don't have time to breathe.  5 days a week, I wake up early to go to school, then go straight to work.  Then when I come home I have to stay up late and study or do homework.  Repeat.  No time for the gym, no time to socialize, no time for fun during the week.  

Now, its not all terrible in my situation.  For starters, I put myself in a position to network with people who have PhDs, and its a better place to build a resume and connections than where I was at before (retail).  I am the youngest employee there, and everyone seems very qualified for the company, with me being the exception.  However, I am not even sure how valuable these connections I make will even be in the future, considering I am a business student.  The opportunity cost of more studying time/fun is taken by a potential benefit to my future in terms of opened doors through networking at my new job. Also the hours are chipping away at my time at the gym and for school.  Point is, I don't know how valuable the experience of running experiments every day in a research and development lab would be for my designated field in business, and it is taking away my time for fun, the gym, and school.  

However, the job itself is really stress free. I work in a research and development lab, using machines and tools all day.  The droning of the machines in the lab almost puts me to sleep , and its just a really boring fucking job.  I literally get paid to sit at a computer and monitor machines while browsing reddit and watching tv.  There's even a keg in the office and I can have a beer on my breaks.  

A couple weeks ago, I was also very inclined to get a job, because I booked a flight to vegas for new years that I wouldn't be able to afford without some sort of job. So I went around looking, and this seemed like the best option.  This job will give me plenty of cash to blow in Vegas, and even some to start saving with.  I don't know if I got this job because I actually wanted it, or because I need money to party.

But really brahs, I miss the fucking gym so much. Going to school and not working was the shit.  While it sucked being broke, I loved being able to spend 2 hours in the gym every single day, and still had time to do well in school.  

What should I do? Ask to work maybe 4 days a week instead of 5? Quit? Fuaaaaa"

He's an older exchange student from the U.S. (I'm in Asia) taking a masters in public policy and he was so driven and passionate about making a change in the world. Not only was he extremely smart, he was really interesting as well - a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef, former intern for the United Nations etc and it helped immensely that he was SO GOOD LOOKING.

I had a small crush on him but I was too shy and was going through some issues, so the chance passed. The semester was over and we never took the same classes and never spoke again, but we added each other on Facebook, and I met a douchebag that was to be 3 years of emotionally abusive hell (but that's another story).

So anyway, Hot Stuff got married a couple of years after graduation, then promptly divorced in less than a year. Then he went to Africa and did some amazing humanitarian work there. I know because I like to follow him on FB and his journey is super inspiring. This was the awesome, driven guy I know, who wanted to make a difference in the world and was doing all he dreamed off. About 2 years ago, he remarried, to a lovely woman who seemed like a much better match than his first wife, and I would see pictures of them together in Africa, doing humanitarian work together and I was so happy for him.

Then today they announced on FB that they're having a baby and I just felt so *disappointed*. And I feel shitty about feeling disappointed in them. They obviously look very happy and I hope they'll be good parents, but I can't help but think about how overcrowded planet Earth is, and there are so many unwanted and unloved children that would love to be adopted into willing and loving homes, and he and his wife are busy doing humanitarian work in Africa and now they have a baby on the way and a child to raise. I really cannot judge them but this awful part in me is totally judging them when they've been nothing but great people. I'm just being selfish and projecting my own expectations on these two awesome people.

Anyway, I just wanted to get this awful feeling off my chest. Thanks for putting up with me!"

3rct97,2,2015-11-03,Day 48: Observations and Advice,ors_tyrael,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/3rct97/day_48_observations_and_advice/,"Hello all.

I haven't been posting daily any more just to spare time. But I'd like to just share some thoughts on how my life has started changing, in order of what's important to me :)

I'm a pretty avid olympic style weightlifter, but over the years gaming has sapped the energy away from that, mainly interfering with my sleep and mobility (sitting in a chair all night). Also, I haven't been able to lift for almost half a year because I may have a hernia (bothers me too much to do anything) and I've been going back and forth with waiting for an MRI to get approved by my insurance. This may be reason to quit, but never give up. I'm being patient, and finding the root cause of it all. My ankles, hips, everything have been tight all my life, so I'm going to commit to using Original Strength (look it up) to help out. It talks about using the movement patterns we did as babies/kids to regain the mobility, strength, and coordination we built up in order just to stand on two feet, walk, sprint, squat, etc without pain. Another thing I can do and will do is watch weightlifting vids. This helps a lot to influence the subconscious mind, help you visualize doing it yourself, and at the very least will motivate and inspire you to say ""wow that's cool, I want to do it!"" Try it with whatever activity you want to master.

Still working at the grocery store, part time, living with parents. I still applying to jobs in programming or anything else I can find, but the most important thing I'm doing is self education toward the Ruby on Rails language. I'm doing so because I had an interview for an internship earlier this year. The office atmosphere was AWESOME and they also make technology for companies seeking employees and vice versa, but I didn't get it. Instead of sulking, I told myself this past month ""I want to work there"", and I looked up the technologies they used, and have been asking my classmate who works there what he uses (Vim). I also found upcase.com, which is a teaching system created by a technology company to help land a job as a Ruby on Rails developer. Can't get much more specific than that. **Self education is very important** I'm not going to bash on my college degrees, but I think most people undervalue what teaching yourself can do. You may be able to learn faster than the pace a college follows. Plus, in my case, technology updates so fast that colleges can't really keep up because there are politics involved with changing the curriculum. Some guys here want to learn programming and I believe one wants to go to school for it. Is it possible to get a job in programming without a degree? I believe so. Also, does having a degree in a field mean you'll land a job there? Not necessarily. Then again, that's all my 2 cents :) This is emphasized in ""Think and Grow Rich."" Most people won't lift a finger to teach themselves. And when you interview and say ""no one twisted my arm to learn this, I just wanted to,"" it will impress the heck out of them

Back when I started WoW ~2005, I was also becoming a better guitarist. When I finally got my own guitar, some days I would wake up playing. This playing and music writing intensified when I quit WoW. When I got deeper into Dota 2 however, that love started to diminish. I remember earlier this year being at a point where I would play guitar for like 3 minutes before I got bored with it. Since quitting, I'm back to my old ways of finding music and learning it for the sake of learning it. I also have a bass now and that's an extra challenge, making me dig up songs I've learned on guitar and learning them on bass as well. I want to make weekly video game music covers like FamilyJules7x, but I haven't gotten to that yet (I'll keep you guys posted). What I have done is reset my brain by removing gaming to make room for the enjoyment of playing music. It's been a while since I've felt this, and I love it.

Also I make games (aka been working on one game), but on a small level. I have a small team formed from /r/hobbygamedev and it's rewarding and challenging. I plan on using my new Vim skills to help that out as well. The current game is a small side scrolling space shooter type. :)

That's all I can think of aside from the social aspect. My brain is starting to get sharper. I think it's because I'm not vegged out from playing to much, can sleep better, and am pushing myself with learning/a small job. I'm never exhausted from playing all day nor feel guilty around my gf for doing so. The guilt would come from the fact that I love her and want to provide for her, but it's hard to believe if I just sit around and play Dota all day. I've tried to quit before, and she says she doesn't want me to quit, especially just for her. She also wants me to keep in touch with my friends (real life friends I'd play with), but personally, at this point in time in my life it's not worth the time sink of gaming. I still keep in touch with my friends from time to time, and I'm grateful that we're the type that can reconnect after a few minutes even though it's been a month since talking. Will I play with them again some day? Probably, but now is not the time for it, nor do I bring that thought to the forefront of my mind, because it will just make me want to play more. I can see myself playing IF I've set my life up the way I want and can justify doing so, but again, not time for that.

Is my life where I want it to be? No. Some days I dread going into work, glad to leave, and come home frustrated with life and honestly want to cry at times. It's all to easy to just sink back into gaming, but I remind myself that spending too much time on that has contributed to this current situation. I'm not going to be all depressed about life however. Earl Nightengale said that **just the act of pursuing goals makes you successful.** Don't think that reaching a goal will make you happy. Find happiness in the process, because at that point, nothing can stop you. I have been reminding myself of that, and that's what's been helping me along. I find joy in the little things along the way.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. My advice is to find new goals to strive for, and have a team to help you. You guys have been my team for quitting, and my gf is my little cheerleader for life. Only love makes her stay with me, because it sure as heck isn't money, lol. I seriously appreciate your words of kindness and I enjoy giving some advice to other guys starting out.

Stay strong nerds. Talk to you later."
3rcu7p,6,2015-11-03,Burning out fast! Please help me. (Might be long),Yoroyo,Nanny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/3rcu7p/burning_out_fast_please_help_me_might_be_long/,"So, I started this job about a year ago. Two kids, 4.5f and 2m, there was a *very* minimal amount of cleaning to be included (maybe throw in a load of wash, clean up kid plates and pick up toys)... Now not so much... I have no work contract, mega amount of job creep and I want to rip my hair out most days. 

The parents take me as some kind of house cleaner now, they know I hate when messes are left around the house and will pick them up, so they just leave shit everywhere! Dinner plates from the night before on the table in the AFTERNOON when I get there, I clean out their van almost every week because they leave food, clothes, toys, you name it in there. I make beds, too. Not to mention the *hundreds* of toys that the kids have, all scattered throughout the house that I have to find and put back in place. I vacuum, do ALL laundry for kids and parents (at least a load a day if not more), clean up after house guests that come (frequently the grandparents), organize pantries, closets, the entire basement. Before I started working they didn't have counter space in their giant kitchen. They didn't have a functioning walk in closet, they literally **threw** their clothes on the floor, dirty or clean, in the closet. It was disgusting. Now all of these favors that I've done in the past are expectations. They don't even feed their dog. I go to the store and buy him food or he will starve. I go grocery shopping, cook and do all the dishes.
What got me so riled up in the summer was when I requested to bring my laptop so I could do classwork while the kids were napping, which is more important, sorry, my education &gt; job, MB had the audacity to say ""Well only if the house is as clean as it usually is"" I""M SORRY BUT BEFORE I STARTED WORKING YOUR HOUSE WAS NASTY. When MB wants something done she'll annoyingly say it through the kids ""Oh, 4.5f can you and Yoroyo go clean out the cabinet?"" Yeah okay because your kid can really help me fucking do that. So passive-agressive. Also lots of instances of ""M2! You got something in your diaper."" Then does nothing about it, then says it again, louder closer to me until I'm like omfg give me your son you cant even change a fucking diaper!

I go to college from 8am-11am and leave to get the kids from preschool/daycare 11am and work til USUALLY 6pm. My days are just eaten up between all of this, I barely have time to study. I'm just so unbelievably burnt out. MB has enrolled 4.5f in FOUR activities each week (I'm only there M-F) so I need to do all this cleaning in a hour and half time-frame since I still need to make lunch, do naps, get them ready for activity and the duration of the activity. During the summer she had me there constantly for 50+ hours a week which was WAY too much, she was always late getting home and asked me to go in at 7am a lot (I live 30 mins away). No overtime. No TV ever, no unhealthy food ever yet MB let's the kids watch shows with her and eat fast food constantly with her. No me though. Never me.

They also go on vacation for weeks, randomly, without much notice. Some time off is great but I do not get paid for it so there are severe gaps in my pay some months. If I didn't have a very supportive boyfriend I would probably be running on fumes some times. I am paid under the table, but will have to get a 1099 and file so I can get in-state tuition for spring, so the 13hr I thought was great is actually shit now.

They are very tight with their money, even though they are swimming in it, last nanny asked for a dollar raise (from 13 to 14) when 2m was born, she was literally caring for a baby that was less than a month old and they said NO, because 4.5f was 2 and it was easier to care for her (UM NO. 2 ISNT EASY). I honestly don't know if they ever experienced raising children because they are so clueless when they ask me to do crazy things that MB couldn't possibly do by herself. I'm 20 years old, I've never had kids, yet somehow I manage. I am SO burnt out and I just hate this so much. MB and DB always tell me how they wouldnt be able to do anything without me, which I know is fact, so I feel guilty for even freaking out like this but I just can't take it. It is such an emotionally and mentally draining job.

I haven't even gotten to the kids yet. 4.5f has NO listening skills and is a total brat. I told her not to walk away in a parking lot and she just started walking while I was strapping 2m in! It was so dangerous. She literally thinks she is a princess. She screams and whines if I ask her to do anything, she doesn't eat the food I cook because there are so many stimulating toys around she's constantly distracted. I've asked her to help me pick up her toys and she will literally ignore me and continue coloring, I've had to raise my voice and take things away and she STILL doesn't get it. The whining is what gets me crazy. Her brother is now following all of her bad habits. They are constantly at each other, hitting and pushing. They stress me out like crazy. I have to constantly hover them or they'll do something destructive, which makes the above cleaning tasks even more difficult to accomplish.


Ugh Nanny 911 help. I'm thinking of quitting, my dad says an internship is worth more than a few extra dollars now that I'm a junior. I'm starting to agree."
3rcvkw,5,2015-11-03,"Burning out fast! Please help. (Might be long, x-post from /r/Nanny)",Yoroyo,Nannies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nannies/comments/3rcvkw/burning_out_fast_please_help_might_be_long_xpost/,"So, I started this job about a year ago. Two kids, 4.5f and 2m, there was a very minimal amount of cleaning to be included (maybe throw in a load of wash, clean up kid plates and pick up toys)... Now not so much... I have no work contract, mega amount of job creep and I want to rip my hair out most days.

The parents take me as some kind of house cleaner now, they know I hate when messes are left around the house and will pick them up, so they just leave shit everywhere! Dinner plates from the night before on the table in the AFTERNOON when I get there, I clean out their van almost every week because they leave food, clothes, toys, you name it in there. I make beds, too. Not to mention the hundreds of toys that the kids have, all scattered throughout the house that I have to find and put back in place. I vacuum, do ALL laundry for kids and parents (at least a load a day if not more), clean up after house guests that come (frequently the grandparents), organize pantries, closets, the entire basement. Before I started working they didn't have counter space in their giant kitchen. They didn't have a functioning walk in closet, they literally threw their clothes on the floor, dirty or clean, in the closet. It was disgusting. Now all of these favors that I've done in the past are expectations. They don't even feed their dog. I go to the store and buy him food or he will starve. I go grocery shopping, cook and do all the dishes. What got me so riled up in the summer was when I requested to bring my laptop so I could do classwork while the kids were napping, which is more important, sorry, my education &gt; job, MB had the audacity to say ""Well only if the house is as clean as it usually is"" I""M SORRY BUT BEFORE I STARTED WORKING YOUR HOUSE WAS NASTY.

3rdenv,0,2015-11-03,"[FLUFF] I’m a college student, first time dog owner, and absolutely killing it.",HuskyInfantry,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3rdenv/fluff_im_a_college_student_first_time_dog_owner/,"I will start this off by saying that I love this community and I’ve found tons of help and advice here— definitely one of my most visited subs. Also… This is a long post. This is aimed towards college students looking for encouragement to get a puppy, or to give the naysayers a different, more positive viewpoint of college dog owners. 

I find that there seems to be a one-track mind here when it comes to certain topics. In my case, and why I’m posting, is because there is a huge train of negativity when it comes to college students inquiring about adopting a puppy/dog. 

I’ve searched through all the threads, and even when I came here (using a throwaway) asking about the topic, a lot of the replies focuses around: Irresponsibility, lack of time, improper care, cruel, etc. etc.

I do not think it’s a secret here that a majority of you are against a young 20-something year old college student adopting a dog— and it’s understandable. We have busy schedules, we like to go out and be social, we like to sleep in, we’re still learning to be selfless, and we’re just becoming independent. We need internships, jobs, class, homework time, monetary expenses, etc. etc. Where is the time to take care of a pet? Well…

The end of my Junior year, I said fuck it to all of the warnings and naysayers in my family and here on Reddit. My desire for a puppy companion went beyond *Oh, they’re cute. That would be fun*. I needed a buddy to keep me company, and I needed the daily challenge and motivation. 

So naturally, I adopt the easiest and most laid back puppy breed out there— a Siberian Husky. 

At 8 weeks old, she was a purebred born from an active dogsled team in Northern Minnesota. She was the runt of the litter (the last one left, smaller, and brown eyes). My girlfriend and I were in love, and we decided to call her Luna. 

My girlfriend left the next day for ROTC training, so there I was… all alone with this brand new puppy. I was nervous and excited, but mostly thinking *Holy shit, I’m in charge of this things life. I better not fuck this up*.

I immediately bought Luna all the necessities, having a good idea what I needed from reading all the posts here on /r/dogs. School was just ending, so for the first 3 weeks (before my internship started) I had all the time in the world to take care of her. YaYaYa, potty training blew absolute ass and I thought I was going to go crazy— waking up at 3am and 5am to take her out, accidents everywhere in the house, walking up &amp; down 5 flights of stairs in my apartment 15 times a day to let her out and simultaneously attempt to hide her from office management… It was tough. But I was ecstatic and in love with my new puppy. 

My friends loved her, my family was pissed at me but eventually realized they loved Luna too. During the 3 weeks before my internship started everything was going well— she was getting exercise, consistent training, lots of love, the whole nine yards.

Then my job started. And guess what? Luna survived. At 11 weeks old, she was crated for 4 hours a day while I was down the street at my internship (I purposely sought out a part-time internship). A couple times she went potty in the crate, but she didn’t spontaneously explode as soon as the suggested max crate time was surpassed, and she never developed any issues. I would get home, take for a little puppy walk, then play outside with her until she was all tuckered out. 

So the summer schedule is fine. I would bring her to patio bars and have some beers with my girlfriend while drawing crowds of people wanting to pet Luna— and she loved it. Luna loved the attention and became acclimated to people exposure and meeting other dogs immediately. 

I’m in the Army NG as well, so when I leave for training, either my father or girlfriend will watch Luna for the weekend. What about getting up and going on vacations? I take road trips with Luna all the time. 5+ hours in the car is absolutely no problem with her. 

Fast forward to this school year. I’m now a senior living in a house, and was weary about how Luna would affect my studying and homework.

She is currently 7 months old, and does great! I wake up at 7:15AM, take her for a walk/feed her and play for just a little bit, crate her, and head to a 9AM class.. On my busiest day she is crated for 4 hours. Then we go longboarding around campus, to stretch out those Husky legs. We come back, she eats, and then I either play or train her until she loses interest. This is when I do homework, because she will nap for a solid 3 hours. I’m a Strategic Communication major, so luckily my “studying” usually consists of writing papers— I think a STEM major would have a more difficult time studying with a dog. However, even when Luna is pestering me, I have my tricks to keep her busy and entertained (KONG, tennis balls, rawhide, etc). while I turn my back to her and do homework. She’s used to it now. 

I live in a shit college-town house, so I’m never too worried about her destroying anything (which she hasn’t ever done). I let her wander around the house, the worst trouble she gets into is pawing at the trash can.

This is a long post, but I’m just trying to encourage other college students seeking a puppy that it can be done. Sure, she stresses me out often, but she always provides my girlfriend and I immense joy and satisfaction. Teaching her tricks and having her tow me on the longboard is just so  much fun, I can’t imagine my life without her now. For all you college students out there contemplating it— take a good hard look at your schedule, picture dedicating all of your free time to your dog. If that thought doesn’t piss you off, then just go for it. 



**EDIT:** Seems like some of you are bothered by my phrasing of ""success"" when she's still only 7 months old. *SO FAR* it's been a success, and many of the nightmares I expected to encounter never happened. She's been a joy so far, although I am prepared for her attitude to change. I appreciate everyone helping with their kind concerns and advice. 

She's my pup and I'm not giving her up. So instead of telling me about how I made a mistake or how hard my future will be-- give me advice please! You experienced owners are here to help, not belittle.

I think I will take MFE in March and study two more years (some quantitative subject, but not actuarial science). I hope to apply for actuarial internships that first year. 

Would three exams and some sort of technical skills(Excel,SAS,SQL,VBA) enough to get an P&amp;C internship? What else do I need? Are there any ""technical questions"" or so that I have to read ?"

What games do you play?
Been playing CoD since CoD4, became proficient at quick scoping, played with OpTiC way back in those CoD4 days . Fell off quickscoping and played more competitive/pub stomping in later games.
Halo since Halo 3, CS:Source and GO, Play/played mmos.. Mgs5 gta5 . Mobas, Diablo, Starcraft, Jack of all trades I guess ?

Times which we’re most likely going to find you online:
I'm on usually Tuesday afternoon - evening and Most weekends . as of now I work from 4-midnight Monday Wednesday and Friday.. But that will change Come December. PST time zone. 

Location: I'm originally from the cornfields of Indiana but am living in Southern California currently at college and trying to make a living. If you don't know the Midwest. Namely Indiana, the contrast of lifestyle of these places is night and day.. I'm doing everything I can to stay in California

DOB: 03/13/93

Where did you hear about us? Reddit 

Call of Duty Clan Specifics (Only if applying for COD):
Yeah I play other games but am looking to primarily get involved with other skilled players for BO3, a lot of my friends stopped playing or haven't upgraded so in lookin for some solid friends to experience this new season of CoD with.. Even the best of games can suck if you're going through it alone. 
As I stated before I have years of experience on cod both for competitive and casual but in recent years have been lone wolfing it and it sucks.. Really hoping to get in a community and just have fun this time around. 

Are there any game modes you refuse to play? No

What does your schedule look like? Work/School? Stated in previous question regarding times I'd be online. Again, this will change come December as I am finishing up an internship

Are you able to help out during whatever clan war related thing Treyarch will have in BO3? Yes I would do my best to work around my schedule, and as of now weekends are good for me

Do you have experience in MLG, GameBattles, Ranked, or LAN tournaments? Yeah, I played competitive back on mw2 and 3 and  black ops 1 and 2, but dropped off the scene during ghosts.
I'm definitely interested in playing ranked and competitive and as I said, I do have the experience. My availability is stated above and I'll go through the hoops needed to prove myself

Tell us a little about/introduce yourself. Your job, family, hobbies, social security number, Mother’s maiden name, whatever you’d lll

Intern/security. only child.  gaming, lifting, guitar, reading. 726-95-2493, Barrera..

I was getting pretty involved in competitive gaming until 2012 where my life got twist turned upside down and I have to take a minute just sit right there, I'll show you how I became the prince ....
No really, 2012 my world did ""end"" in a sense. Long story short, had a house fire, first last and worst mushroom trip, jail, moved to California, bible college, intern, security ... Just now getting back into gaming. 

I'm hoping I can be involved in bops3 with you all sooner than a two month probation period, (if I'm even considered) but I understand how it goes..  it would be sick to have some solid guys to run with for the launch tho! *puppy dog eyes*

p.S: don't let the gamertag scare you away, I am a Christian but I'm not one to shove my beliefs down anyone's throat I'm not assuming my gamertag is anymore offensive than some others out there. im assuming you guys aren't negative in this regard and are open to freedom, whether of religion, speech, or otherwise. If you hate freedom though just let me know in advance

Not software related, more working knowledge on tax",Ayebro34,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3resyr/us_help_brushing_up_on_tax_knowledge_and/,"- I am going to  be an incoming tax associate next fall. I have worked in public accounting as an intern in the past so I have prior experience working with tax software and preparing returns.

- I graduate this Spring, but I'm scared about how much I really know about tax in general.

- All the stuff I learned from tax class faded away and is gone.

- I know there's becker and the cpa exam review stuff to help me prepare for the tax portion, but will KNOWING BECKER CPA be enough to help me excel when it comes to the tax returns (journal entries, adjusting trial balances so numbers are right, **HOW do know the numbers on the tax return I am preparing are right**)?

- Is there anything out there that can help me become a better tax associate? 

- When I was interning during the summer I didn't know what I was doing really when it came to the numbers behind the tax returns? 

- I knew what I had to correct based on review points from my superiors, but I didn't know the **WHY** behind the corrections. What made these numbers right or wrong.

- How can I develop this working knowledge of understanding tax and the numbers on the tax returns?  I know I will get training on prosystems or gosystems so I'm not worried. I learned how to do that from training and on the job. I Need to know more about tax in general to do the job well

- good resources to relearn and pick up more tax knowledge to help me as incoming tax associate? Is the cpa review stuff the best there is to help me pick up tax again?"
3rf9ar,0,2015-11-03,A few questions from a younger interestee,SebastianMonroe,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/3rf9ar/a_few_questions_from_a_younger_interestee/,"So, to begin with I am 17, just entered my senior year in high school and I have taken an interest in the B.S. IT - Network Administration. I go to Votech for Computer Networking at a local Career and Technology Center, and I could technically say I have my foot in the door of IT, because I do work part-time for the school assisting the Director of IT. I also have a few months of intern experience with the school, which I plan to get more next summer. I was wondering if WGU would be right for me.

I only hear of established IT people going to WGU, is this school appropriate for someone who would be fresh out of high school?

Would this degree help get my foot in the door somewhere?

I see that some places require a 4 year degree, would a Bachelors from WGU count as a 4 year degree since it's accelerated?

Also, would the College Credits from my local Career and Technology Center transfer into WGU?

I'm just trying to figure out if this would benefit me less than going to a normal university for 4 years since I am not established.

A few extra notes: I really like how WGU is setup, it's very cost efficient and you go at it at your own pace, and going to school online would free me up to still work and keep searching for an entry level IT job. And yes, I am working towards an A+ cert now.

3rfg3f,4,2015-11-03,[Career Advice] Is a school major/career change without throwing away my nursing skills possible?,culturenurse,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/3rfg3f/career_advice_is_a_school_majorcareer_change/,"Without getting into the nitty-gritty of it, I'm completely burned out on bedside nursing. It's made me miserable. I'm always anxious, stressed, and I've come to despise people. After only 3 years as an RN I honestly cant see myself working in a hospital for another year. I have little to no job satisfaction aside from my great co-workers, it's left me that bitter...

I've looked into other options for nurses (case management, utilization review, chart auditing), but after 15 or so interviews, no offers. Nothing has really jumped out at me as something I want to do either, with the exception of informatics. I'm presently in the middle of a thorough interview process for a nurse informaticist position with another local hospital system. I passed their IT-programming aptitude exam with ""great results"" and had one interview with them. Still waiting to hear back. 

This is a specialty that I would REALLY love to be a part of. They're planning on training new employees for 6 - 8 weeks in programming and designing the front end of their EMR system for specific departments. The prospect sounds exciting, but I'm extremely worried I wont be able to snag this ""life raft"" of sorts.

I'm also enrolled in an RN to BSN program with a local university. I still have about a year and a half to finish. However, I'm considering starting from square one to get a BS in Information Technology or Computer Science. I figure, what's the point in wasting extra time and money for something I wont use? That same university's IT program has an emphasis in health and automotive settings with an added bonus of a health informatics internship. The downside is it's probably 2 - 3 years to finish. I'm conflicted on what to do. Spend less time to get a degree in something I now hate or more time pursuing something I want to do? 

As a 26 year old with only an AASN degree I feel like I'm running out of time as far as school/career choice goes. I can't help but feel extremely lost and disappointed with the choices I've made. It seems that having a BS in IT in addition to my AASN opens a lot more job possibilities than just a BSN does at this point. I honestly don't know what to do and I'm afraid I'll make things worse. 

If any former or current nurses on this sub-reddit have gone or are going through something similar, any helpful advice will be appreciated."

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

Girlfriend and me awhile ago broke up and truth be told over the summer I had been looking for an engagement ring. I had really thought this girl was the one. Coming out of the summer though it all turned out not so much. I was alright for awhile because in the end this was the best for us both. This week though I found out some more from her about why she broke up with me. Turns out that part of the reason was that she actually found me to be too nice....she said she needed someone she could argue with and complain about. Maybe I'm reading into it too much or wrongly but it really backs up this twisted idea that I have of myself being the Toyota Camry of the dating scene. Everyone says girls just want a guy that is dependable, comfy, and nice...just like a camry which also happens to be extremely boring...just like me. I've been told numerous times I'm not boring but when you have such a hard time making friends it eventually gets to you and you start to believe that.

Beyond that stuff lately I've been pretty freaking self concious about my body. I'm slightly overweight I have no shame in admitting that. I'm 6' and 210 lbs and working everyday diet wise and in the gym. Problem is at work there is a pretty fit dude and the girls just fawn over him. Between that and my insecurities I can't help but feel unattractive. I dress fashionable, put effort into my hair and skin, I'm working on my weight yet I just feel like a giant blob! 

On top of that right now I have quite a bit of stress from a few difficult classes and some major changes at work. The worst part of all of this is that I don't even have it that bad! I got an internship for the summer and a promotion at work but for some reason I can't be happy about that. All I can focus on is the fact I see myself as boring, ugly, and just average at best. I want to be happy but I just can't break outta this stupid loop of insecurity.

Anyway if you made it this far thanks :) its appreciated

3rfxny,0,2015-11-03,LPT REQUEST: contesting a speeding ticket and freaking out!,dji83,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3rfxny/lpt_request_contesting_a_speeding_ticket_and/,"So, I got a speeding ticket. The ticket says I was doing 80 in a 65, but the officer said his radar gun clocked me at 94.
Here's some details: he was at the bottom of a hill, I was in the left lane and along side another car when I was speeding. I saw him when I was at the top of the hill (he was about 500 yards away, maybe a little more). As soon as I saw him I stomped on my breaks and moved over and behind the car I was along side with.
He was younger and very nice. When he said he clocked me at 94, I was like really? and he was like yes. I honestly don't think I was at 94, but I don't know how I can argue with radar.
Side note: I was definitely over the 65 speed limit. I was probably around 85 when at the top of the hill but slowed down as soon as I saw him.
So here is where I stand. I am pleading not guilty because I want to fight it. At least get it reduced hopefully becuase I can't afford it right now. Im a grad student getting my masters in social work and working for free as an intern at a hospice and have no money. I also absolutely cannot afford to get points on my license.
Although I want to fight it, I don't know where to go from here. I've been told to keep trying to push back my date because theyll get frustrated and maybe drop it, that maybe if the cop doesnt show they might dismiss it, etc.
I also read some questions to ask the officer in court that might put doubt into the judge and that might work (that maybe he was too far away for the read to be accurate...heres a link to the types of questions I found: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/beat-ticket-book/chapter11-2.html)
On top of all the financial stress I have about this, I also feel bad! He acted like he was so nice saying i was at 94 but he'll help me out and say it was 80. I'm afraid if I go and argue this and say all this, he'll get super pissy that he tried to help me and reduced my speed and I argue the ticket.
Essentially, when I get to court, what is my best path to get this ticket to go away or at least not get points?
Mehhhh someone help me!
ALSO! Here is the radar gun that was used was a Stalker Dual"
3rfxoi,0,2015-11-03,Best Location for Divemaster internship in SEA,leitluk,scuba,https://www.reddit.com/r/scuba/comments/3rfxoi/best_location_for_divemaster_internship_in_sea/,"Hey guys!

I recently did my Open Water and Advanced Open Water courses on Koh Tao and want to continue with my education to become a Divemaster.

Since I'm on a budget and want to stay in the area, I'm only looking for diveshops in Southeast Asia. I'm also looking for ways to work during and maybe after the certification at the diveshop in exchange for the price/accomodation/food.

I want to start somewhere between January and March 16, so I'll try to keep the seasons in mind.

Koh Tao: I really liked diving there, would probably find some internship opportunity. Only problem is getting all certifications in one location might not be as good for future employers.

Koh Phi Phi: I read it also has a lot of internships, and different dive environments than Koh Tao, but still Thailand.

Gili Islands: I think the weather isn't too good at that time of the year, so maybe go there after the certification.

I'm looking forward to any feedback and stories about your DM!"

3rgmfc,5,2015-11-04,Any suggestions for finding an internship or short term work during my gap year?,tayste5001,Biochemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biochemistry/comments/3rgmfc/any_suggestions_for_finding_an_internship_or/,"I'm currently in the middle of a gap year between undergrad and grad school.

After December I will be free from a current commitment and I would like to try something new (involving science, naturally). Any suggestions on where to look for internships or short term work? I'm very curious what the work environment is like outside of academia, having the opportunity to experience work in a biotech startup sounds really cool. There are a number of places I'm interested in. I am planning on emailing several of them, is that a bad idea? Has anyone been in a similar place?

3rgrwc,3,2015-11-04,Mistakes I've made in my first 2 years of college,BaconNacho,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3rgrwc/mistakes_ive_made_in_my_first_2_years_of_college/,"Sorry for the wall of text!  
  tldr: I fucked up my freshman year and the summer after freshman year and the first semester of my sophomore year and got bad grade. Now even though I almost got my life back put together, the thought of my fucking up keeps coming to my mind. Unwanted thoughts, can't sleep, anxiety felt around my chest.  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a junior in college. This isn't your typical party school. This is a very competitive and prestigious school. I'm not here to brag about the school that I go to. I am here to talk about the stress and the anxiety I get by going to a school where more than 90 percent of the people are smarter than me. Yes, I barely got into this school and everyone here makes me feel so dumb.  
  
Freshman year I partied a lot. I drank every single weekend multiple times. Summer after my freshman year I got into a depression and didn't do well in school and drank a lot and did drugs. First semester of my sophomore year I went even harder and I was smoking weed everyday despite not being depressed anymore. Then when I saw my GPA for that end of semester of 2.1/4.0, I freaked the fuck out. At the same time everyone around me had already gotten internships offers and all had good GPAs.   
  
So I buckled up and started to try really hard. I stopped partying and everything. My career was the main focus, no social life, no nothing, just my career and GPA. It was hard, I kept hearing more about my friends getting internship offers while I was just still taking classes to raise my GPA high enough to get an offer. It was a lot of anxiety. Every single night before bed a thought always came to my mind, ""If only I didn't fuck around freshman and first semester of sophomore year"". I cried out loud alone in my room sometimes. I felt so shitty every time I think about my parents because they paid a lot of money and raised me for 18 years just to fuck up in college. The anxiety was real, I felt it mostly around my chest, it never went away no matter how much I pounded my chest. Every single fucking day thinking about how I fucked up.  
  
Good news, junior year in college and my GPA is finally now raised and spent months looking for internship and I finally got an offer. I quickly accepted it. I felt great. I never felt this great in my life before. I was super happy for a month. I never thought I would worry about my future anymore. Until few days ago. For some reason I keep thinking about if I hadn't fucked up I would be so much farther in my career. If I hadn't fucked up, my GPA would be way higher and gotten multiple internship offers with really really good pay. I just can't stop thinking about my decisions of my past. I mean these god damn sophomores are getting better internship offers than me.  
  
I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people but it keeps happening. Everyone seems like they are all put together and have their shit together(even though it's probably not true) and I am just here as a permanent fuck up.  
  
I hate this school and this survival of the fittest mentality everyone has in this school. This is the school that made a sophomore student(me) realize that he needs to get his mother fucking life together. This is the school that made a sophomore student(me) realize that his focus should be on this career and not getting fucked up all the time.  
  
Fuck this school, now my girlfriend is saying how I am not social enough and I don't know anyone and now I am blaming that on how I fucked up freshman year. (because I stopped being social all together to focus on grades and my career).  
  
Please give me tips to forgive my past self and stop thinking about the past and blaming things in the past. It keeps popping into my mind and I hate myself whenever I think about it."

2. Where would be the best place to apply for internships?

3. My school is requiring a liberal arts minor with my major. There are few minors and wondering if there would be any minor that would help make me stand out.

4. Should I pursue a MPH or MHA or MBA

5. Lastly, am I on the right path at least to making it into the healthcare field?

3rhwyi,2,2015-11-04,Me [23F] with my best friend [24M]. He has a LDR girlfriend [23F] in China and has cut out EVERYONE from his life.,Alastiana,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rhwyi/me_23f_with_my_best_friend_24m_he_has_a_ldr/,"'Richard' has been my best friend for about 5 years now. I know many of you don't believe in strictly platonic male-female relationships, but ours has always been like that. We're both gamers and enjoy the same type of music and films. We bonded over our common interests. We've never kissed, hooked up, he has never had a crush on me as far as I can tell.. we're pretty much related, like cousins or something.

Last Summer Richard did an internship in China, where he met this girl 'Eve'. They fell in love in record time, and decided to continue their relationship long distance. Now, before I go any further, I need to explain that something extremely similar had happened to me a year before. I did a Summer internship in China as well, and I also fell in love with a local. We were in a LDR for about a year, and he has now moved to my country where we're living together. 

Back to my best friend. Since he came back, in September, I've seen him once. This is absolutely not normal for us, since we'd see each other weekly, or at least twice a month. When we met, he told me that he is focusing hard on his master's degree because he wants to go back to China during Christmas break. I understand that, I went to China during Christmas break last year as well! However, the only thing he does except studying/writing his thesis is video-chatting his girlfriend. Since the last time I saw him, he basically went MIA. He won't pick up the phone, he won't reply to texts, he won't reply to Facebook messages, he won't reply to messages on the Chinese social media **I know he uses daily in order to keep in touch with his girlfriend**.  

At first I thought he was ignoring me on purpose. I thought maybe his girlfriend was uncomfortable with him being such close friends with another girl and asked him to cut ties with me or something. However, after talking to many of our mutual friends... no one has heard from him, at all. He is doing this to every single one of his friends, so much that some people have already stopped trying to reach him.

I feel like I, more than anyone in his life, understand where he is at right now. I get it that it's pretty hard to be in a LDR, I know that it requires a lot of time and dedication (especially when there's a language barrier!) and I how it is to date a Chinese person when you're a westerner - they're usually ""more clingy"" as in, what could maybe be considered an excessive amount of daily communication is not weird but actually desirable to them. I also understand the need to focus on his master's so that he can go see her as soon as possible... I went through all of that as well. What I didn't do was shun everyone else in my life! 

I've actually tried to reach the girl on Facebook because she has an account and has added me. I sent her a short message saying that I couldn't reach my friend and asking if everything was alright and if she could please let him know his friends would like to see him! However, since Facebook is banned in China, she doesn't log in frequently. My message still remains unread, and I'm not about to go psycho and spam her with more messages. 

What can I do, reddit? How can I get my friend back? I miss him, and I am also worried about him isolating himself like this. I know what it is like to be deeply in love with someone who's far away from you... Unlike many of our friends, I don't think it's stupid that he's acting like this over a girl he spent less than a month with in person. Nevertheless, I don't think his behavior is healthy at all.

**tl;dr**: My friend is in a LDR with a Chinese girl and has cut everyone in his life in order to focus on his masters. He spends all his free time video-chatting with her, and doesn't even take the time to text back."

Got a curve ball for ya folks. 

**The Background:**

So I'm a recent grad (Designer) from the US and I've been much been working abroad since my graduation in 2014. Spent time in Shanghai doing an internship and have worked the last seven months in Singapore. 

I've been trying to be relatively money conscious... I was barely sustainable in Shanghai (making terrible pay, did homestay to avoid paying rent), and I've been able to save 50% of my Singapore salary for the last 6/7 months. 

Next month I am moving back to China (full time job, Shenzhen, 3 year contract) and I have a couple of questions. Regarding my international accounts. 


I have: 

$1,000 USD in a Citibank account in the US.

$10,000 SGD in an account in Singapore.

$0 RMB in an account in China.

In China will be making roughly $3,500 dollars per month (in RMB of course). 


**The Questions:**

I'm trying to decide if I need to convert my Singapore dollars into American dollars for easy access. Or should I leave the money in the Singapore acct? Should I keep all the money saved in China in my Chinese acct? Or should I slowly start converting the RMB to USD over time to deposit in my American acct? (btw I have little knowledge of how to play the Forex market so even some basic advice on buy and sell rates would be super helpful).

How should I manage my assets, especially with all the fluctuating currencies? I also obviously don't have a 401k or anything in China, so I also need to consider my savings for the future. 

(Also I need a credit card. Ugh. Preferably from US for emergencies?)


**Obligatory Appreciation:**

Thanks people... It's a bit overwhelming for me since I've never had to manage my finances independently before. Plus the stress of country jumping all the time and taxes (just shoot me lol).

Any help/advice/encouragement is super welcome. Naysayers need not reply. Thanks!

3rid5q,168,2015-11-04,"I [f49] have been with with my husband [53] for 20 years, I'm worried he has feelings for his much younger female intern",Tossit7282829,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rid5q/i_f49_have_been_with_with_my_husband_53_for_20/,"Usually I don't get worked up about anything related to my marriage. We've been married 20 years and he's always seemed to be faithful and happy. We were both previously married and cheated on our spouses with each other, however the relationships we were both in were very negative. We have two children who are both grown up and out of the house.


My husband is very spirited and childish. Not to say he's immature, but he's very playful and fun. He acts at most 30 years old and is attractive in the same way George Clooney is attractive (older but sexy). We work in the same building in different departments.


The office has many interns who transfer in and out. One girl has been coming in on and off for three years. The program is semi-paid, provides excellent references and scholarships, so we have a lot of university students come back again and again as they work through their degrees. This girl is beautiful: young, pale skin and dark hair, very exotic looking.


When she first met my husband they clashed severely. I'm very sure she hated him. Then, over the years, the tables began to turn. They came to an understanding. About a year ago they began spending a lot of time together. More time than any partner or intern would ever need to spend time together. It's never outside; only inside the office. It started out slow: a few short discussions here and there led into lengthy hour discussions where they would speak of nothing related to work. They'd share stories and memories and talk about future plans. Banter started between them; I've never heard him laugh so heartily in a long time. They make eyes at each other and share little secretive glances (so I've been told by a friend in their department). In the last two months it's really changed. He seems obsessed with her opinion and having her help him. She'll go into his office to talk (even with the door open; policy rules) and I'll feel like I can't interrupt them even though they're not talking about work. She'll come to him with her problems (breakups, family issues) and he tells her about our daughter and son and family issues. They've cried together a few times; he's broken down and told her things that were bothered him. I once walked in while she was crying and he was comforting her and I had to walk out because it seemed so intimate - like I was intruding.


The other day he broke the cardinal rule. She told him he needed to talk to him later in the day. When she arrived he told her she could shut the door. Breaking every company rule. It was only then that I found out from a friend that they would often go into one of the windowless rooms and shut the door. I don't think they had sex, but as a man of working integrity and absolution he's never broken rules for anyone before.


When they talk, their body language has recently become very flirty as well. She'll preen and flip her hair and nibble her lip and giggle. I'll walk in the room and he'll just glance at me - she won't even make eye contact with me. When he does speak to me he does it in a very generic way as if you'd speak to a child. He also told her the other day (I overheard) something something ""That's why we have such a good friendship."" He was being genuine.


That's what's scares me. Their relationship went from hate to tolerance to a working relationship to now a ""friendship."" Will it escalate more? I'd just like to know if there's any reason I should be worried or if it's a normal relationship between two people and if I am being crazy.
   
**tl;dr**: I'm worried my husband has developed feelings for an intern; am I crazy or is it reasonable


EDIT: I edited out one part that I used as an example, which everyone felt the need to jump on.



UPDATE: Everyone seemed to jump on the fact that I've ""Never talked"" to him about it before. That is not true and I don't know why anyone would have jumped to that conclusion. We have spoken about her, but I did it in very subtle ways (ask him what she was like, how he felt about her). As I said in my post it's only been in the last two months that I have an extreme amount to worry.

I spoke to my friend and took some of the advice from you guys. I also asked him about her. He said, basically, along the lines of: ""She's just an intern to me. The same as any other. I see her intelligence as value to the company, but to me she doesn't mean anything."" He doesn't know that I've heard him call her a friend or tell her the things he's said to her. I don't know. It will take me a while to collect any evidence I may need to approach him with.

I wonder if it's possible he just views her the same and that he doesn't see what his actions will look like to others."

7. 

I stepped out of my vehicle, arriving at a partially secluded side street nestled a few feet away from the stalls of some native street vendors, who were emphatically shouting and carousing the visitors as they passed, inviting them to experience some bayou favors. I breathed deep, taking in the scents of a nearby coffee diner and sweet pastries. New Orleans really was a sensory overload and inviting on a preternatural level.

Hints of oleander and white myrtles wafted in from the shrines that interlocked the varied architecture. Flowers were adorned about the buildings honoring those who had passed, some from recent tragedies, others from another time and place. I caught the distinct hint of lilies, but this was overpowered by the scenes laid out before me. The visuals were timeless as well. Bluebloods scattered sporadically, drunkenly clinging to the sides of buildings, muttering deep musings that may or may not have contained wisdom or enlightened slurred truths. There were no rules, it seemed. I passed by a few houses as I walked, glancing into doorways as I did, quietly, as to not wake the spirits all around me.

Surprisingly, I could see that here, grievances and levity were brethren, born of the same indomitable human spirit. Old ladies honored the dead, in their colorful, yet somber, flowing dresses. Gypsies, salesmen, harlots, and out of towners, young and old, danced with some ancient and tribal urgency, running towards the same light which danced upon the swampy shore. I allowed the embrace of the melancholy and celebration all around to tempt me, which brought a light and cool sensation which seemed to ease my nervousness, even if only for a moment.

Everything is allowed here, all paths permissible. Perhaps, even a bit of forgiveness.

Or, a quiet moment alone at the pond, those fingers curled seductively, dragging you down until your screams become a wet, choking admittance of your own flawed ego, Mr. Writer.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry. My stomach began pleading with me to listen to it, and not that nightmarish possibility.

Across the street from the deli I had eyed upon parking, stood an old book store with a wide awning that had seen better days perched above its inviting door. The shade did nothing to mask the sunlight reflected on the window’s aging glass, catching my attention immediately. After lunch and a drink or two, I’d see what literary treasures I could unearth there. If anything, surely it’d be quiet enough to contemplate the next chapter of my novel.

I pushed through a small crowd of visitors gathering along the wall of an art exhibit, the proprietor’s candor and showmanship corralling them expertly. Some were modern, abstract pieces while others were classical, displaying the highlights and downfalls of his native city. He had seen me walking toward the door of the coffee shop and suggested I try the Toarco Peaberry with a shot on the side. I thanked him for the suggestion and joked it’d be a double. I felt my nerves start to taunt me again and decided it would be a triple as I pushed the door open.

The coffee bar was lively, the baristas doing their best to keep up without losing that New Orleans hospitality and charm. I grabbed a menu from the counter, scanned the room for the most isolated booth, and sat down. I would try this Peaberry concoction the dealer had suggested. My stomach let out a desperate noise, then I quickly decided on a breakfast panini and my much needed drink.

The waitress came over. “I’m Tina, sugah. What will you have today? Sorry it’s a madhouse.”

I placed my order and watched her frantically start towards the table to my right. She gave me a cute smile from over her shoulder and commented that I looked very familiar. I smiled and tried to mask the fact that I hoped she didn’t recognize me. She turned her head, bumping into the table next to me as she did. She caught her balance, but not before the coffee pot tipped, spilling some unto the other guest.


The man at that table had been complaining to what I presumed could’ve been his lover, his voice carrying a defiance that seemed to make the waitress and his companion uneasy. I could see concern set into both of their eyes as he raised his meaty hand, slamming it hard unto the table.

He stood up, grabbing his date brutishly by the arm, her face turning white. Her eyes pleaded with me as she was pulled from her seat and dragged out of the diner. Throwing the door open, he pushed her into the street. There were tears rushing silently down her face. My fingers gripped the table as I watched.

They argued for a minute or so. She wrapped he arms around him, the anger within him calmed, and he hung his head in shame. I sat their transfixed at that scene from the window. Not quite a fairy tale moment, but proof that the energy ebbing through New Orleans was volatile, to be respected, and sometimes Beauty can indeed soothe the Beast.

I had nearly intervened. If my drink had been in my hand when he grabbed her, I probably would have. When my shot finally arrived, I swallowed it immediately, ordering two more. The panini I left half-eaten and while the Peaberry blend of coffee was an interesting mix of juniper, mango and vanilla, one had been sufficient. I pondered for a moment if the girl would eventually be unable to control that creature that hid beneath the surface. The anger that gnawed and clawed, demanding to be heard, misguided and dangerous.

Megan had done that for me countless times over the years. Lulled it into a slumber even I couldn’t wake it from, so deep that when I actually needed it, it lay dormant. Until the day it woke itself in a snarling confusion, refusing to hear the muses any longer.

Like August. 

I ordered another drink, trying to drown that memory. The only thing that it seemed to accomplish was force me to order another, and another.

“Hey, Tina,” I slurred with a smirk. “Got a bottle back there?”



8.

After my first published short story Head Creeps garnered a small following, I had met Megan working as an intern for DarkHouse Publications. Mort had introduced us at a small office party that was celebrating the publishing house’s new horror line recently introduced. The excitement was overwhelming, and my nerves were strangling my enthusiasm. I had been new to the game and increasingly nervous about starting my next story, the small amount of fame I had received carried my insecurities to the surface, as well as my love of the drink. 

I had been cold to that beautifully soft voice of hers at first, but her reassuring smile and her eyes, as blue as the ocean and seemingly just as deep, calmed me as if some black magick had been cast over us both. It helped that she had been a fan of my writing, bolstering my ego just enough to get me to relax. We laughed, we shared. We talked into the dying hours of moonlight for the many days to come.

 After a few weeks, we had started dating. It was a love built on understanding, kindness, reassurance, and perhaps too intrusive in my professional life than I thought I needed. Regardless of that notion, she remained a great assistant in the writing of my next two novels, her knowledge of writing and more importantly, reading, proving invaluable.

But, over the years, my writer’s block had become more dire, my bitterness less alieved so easily. There had been many nights my insecurities threatened ripping our living arrangement apart. Her critiques were more bothersome, her ideas clashing with my own. I began to view her with a wary eye, one of spite instead of adoration. 

Her smile, once a beacon in the darkness that rummaged through my mind, hunting blindly for the next twisted idea, began to wane. I had taken a beautiful woman, so giving and enthusiastic over my endeavors, and began picking her apart as a crow would a corpse. I had nearly forgotten the love that she had willingly entrusted to her favorite writer. I was lost in her eyes not swimming but instead drowning. The drinking had hit its worst, at that point. Still, I pushed on through the next novel and the next by spring that year. They were a mixed bag, I thought, but each one sold more than the prior. Rabid fans and literary critics battled over my work, much to her delight and mine. 

After the release of the last book, Bury the Heart, Megan and I had finally began to feel at ease with each other again. I had slowed my drinking, and though she was unhappy that I had picked up smoking as a replacement, we were finally beginning to heal. It had taken her months of continuous pleading to pull me from that dark abyss, saving my life not just once by giving me courage to continue writing through my doubts, but countless times from my own destructive nature.

We finally had reached a peaceful place, more in love than ever. I owed her more than I could ever repay. We announced that we were going to be married. Interviews, morning talk shows and book signings bled into one another as the spring steamrolled ahead. The final city on the book tour before our planned wedding date and much-needed vacation was New York. 

A horror convention where I would take the stage, answering questions on writing or whatever else the adoring fans would come up with, sounded like a perfect way to end the fiasco my personal life and professional life had become. 

It was there, at the last stop of the Bury the Heart Tour, that Megan Leanne Connelly would always be buried as well.

9.

Tina had brought me the bottle I requested, smiling as she did. I reached for my wallet, attempting to pay, but was stopped by her dainty hand on mine. She leaned in close to my ear, catching me off guard. She laughed at my reaction kindly.

“It’s alright, Mr. King. Consider this a gift for all those nights I’ve spent curled up reading your stories.” She sensed my trepidation, adding that she wouldn’t tell a soul, and giving her condolences for my loss. Thanking her, I hastily made my way to the door.

“Is that old book store closed over there, sweetheart?” I asked, pointing across the street.

“Closed about an hour ago I think. The old lady that runs it is nice and she has quite the collection of books. I think you’d like it. Fair warning in case you do visit, though. She has gotten a little… out there… the last few months. Old age and all that. She used to give card readings on the weekends, really playing up that Romanian heritage. Tourists love that stuff. Thank you again. Stop in anytime if you need an ear.” She winked. “Or more...” She smiled, tossing her blonde curls and making her way to the kitchen.

Lovely as that invitation seemed, I had a previous engagement with that old sky blue lover of mine. I could hear the typewriter whispering to me and felt a tad more inspired than before. It had always been better to write while the words seemed tangible.

I stumbled to the Jeep and headed back to my wooded hideaway, determined. Megan followed me there as well, nestled quietly beside me in the form of a bottle of liquor, equal parts muse and poison, but irresistible all the same. 

Upon arriving, I dared not look at that lake. I could smell that faint hint of lilies in the air, and had no time for such imagined distractions. I started writing with every intention of not succumbing to the drunken hallucinations of the previous night. I wrote in a feverish stupor and the words flowed as easily as before.

I stopped writing a few hours later and began reading it over frantically. My eyes started to get heavy, like the stones tied to the ankles of a witch accused and forced to swim. I struggled a bit, but I sank. Dreaming, I drowned in the final moments Megan and I had shared in New York.


The gun is shaking in my hand as I fire not once but three times. One bullet hammering against the hotel room wall, the second exploding the back of her assailant’s head as a wild ribbon of blood spirals out in some grotesque flower of brain matter and red. The third is a mistake.

I see her eyes wide in fear, screaming my name for help. In my anxiousness I fire that last bullet as his head starts falling to the side from the killing blow. I see her face, I hear her scream. The gurgling comes next and that horrible sound is only matched by the sight of those deep green eyes dimming and rolling back into her head as her skull gives in, the wall behind her staining as red as her hair.

I rush to her side, screaming. I scream. I cry. Nononononnonononono

NO.

I cradle her head in my arms, the neck limp and sliding her face to the left and right like a morbid Slinky as I sob. I cry like a child the tears never stop. I shake I scream she’s dying she’s dying she’s dying

She’s dead. I know this. No pulse no breath. I killed her. I killed her killed her kill kill kill dead dead dead 

I press my lips to hers I press and press lips her lips so red so dead I breathe please breathe please god please breathe

She won’t. She never does. Never will. I know this but I press and press. My lips her lips I breathe but she won’t.
 
Never will.

I dream this a thousand times. She dies. My hands are sticky, bits of the grey mess that was the brain of the woman I love spilling in tiny chunks as I shake her, her eyes rolling open please please just open just once just open please Megan Megan Megan 

I kiss her lips her lips my lips I breathe she doesn’t

SHE NEVER WILL 

Among the bodies and the brains and the blood, I always kiss her. Breathe into her. Gasping for breath, I breathe harder and harder. I breathe and she doesn’t.

But if I keep breathing, keep kissing, keep shaking….

She HAS to eventually.

I cradle her. Her hair is matted with the gore. My fingers continue to entangle and refuse to unclench her fiery mane. My hands are shaking and shaking as I kiss and kiss and kiss her dead red lips and breathe and breathe and breathe….



I sat up straight in bed my hands violently cradling the dead air about me. Drenched in sweat, my pillow damp with tears, I sobbed. The scent of lilies filtered in through the open window, the fragrance itself seeming to choke the few fragments of light inside my darkened bedroom. I laid there weeping into the stained pillows for the rest of the night.

As I slipped into unconsciousness again, I focused on the breathing and welcomed the silent blackness of dreamless sleep. For the first time since New York, the breathing hadn’t been solely my own.




10.

The phone rang late the next afternoon. The sound of each ring echoed through the hall into my room. I sat up and wiped my eyes, crusted with dry sleep and tears. I swung my legs to the floor begrudgingly. I walked into the living room, grabbed the cell phone from the couch and yawned.

“Hello?”

“Byron. It’s Mort. I know I’m calling a bit ahead of schedule, but the publisher requested at least a page or two, maybe a synopsis. They’ve been hounding me for two days. I’m not trying to say that their confidence is low, it’s just…”

“Yeah... I know. I’ll send you something in a few hours. Just let me get some breakfast going and wake up a bit.”

“Thanks, Byron. Did you take my advice and get some of that local flavor?”

“Yes, had a nice little adventure. The city is very inspiring.” I thought of my dream and dead Megan rotting in my arms. “Ended predictably, but got some good writing out of it.”

“Just be careful, don’t pull a reclusive artist thing on us again. None of what happened was your fault. Deep down, beneath that heavy drinking heart, you know that, man.”

“I know, Mort. Give me two hours, I’ll email you shortly.”

I hung up the phone before he could say goodbye. I knew somewhere, even in my head, he was right. Maybe one day, I’d allow myself to accept it. Perhaps, when this damned book was finished I’d move forward finally. I walked to the kitchen, turned on the coffee pot and unexpectedly vomited into the sink.

I could still smell the lilies again, earthy and ancient. I hadn’t gotten sick from the aroma, for I now found it comforting. It had become a part of this place, an extension of my need to heal.

My stomach had gone sour because of the cracked window above the cluttered sink. Smashed into the glass, its wings outstretched as far as their span allowed, was a dead blackbird. Its knowing eyes stared into mine, one of them partially expelled from the fractured skull. The beak of the animal moved one final time, letting out a faint plea of confusion before slipping from view to the ground outside.

I let out one last heave and turned the faucet on, splashing water on my face. I turned and rummaged the fridge for a bite and started brewing the coffee, lecturing myself to eat more or else I’d end up as that damned creepy bird outside, poor bastard.

I sat at the table, coffee and bagel in hand and started delving into the manuscript, deciding which pages to send. Once satisfied, I pulled the laptop from the closet, retyping each word, editing as I went. 
I dialed Mort back.

“The dirty deed’s done, my friend. It’s a gruesome yet erotic scene between a man and his dead wife. Hope they enjoy.” Mort’s answering machine gave no response in return, and given how jarring that subject was to me personally, decided that it was for the best.

I turned my cell phone off and finished eating. Grabbing another cup of coffee, I decided to enjoy the pond and her surroundings, this time, in the supposed safety of daylight.

3riife,0,2015-11-04,I am a 49 year old female. My husband is 53. He has a much younger intern and I am beginning to have suspicions.,Tossit7282829,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3riife/i_am_a_49_year_old_female_my_husband_is_53_he_has/,"Usually I don't get worked up about anything related to my marriage. We've been married 20 years and he's always seemed to be faithful and happy. We were both previously married and cheated on our spouses with each other, however the relationships we were both in were very negative. We have two children who are both grown up and out of the house.


My husband is very spirited and childish. Not to say he's immature, but he's very playful and fun. He acts at most 30 years old and is attractive in the same way George Clooney is attractive (older but sexy). We work in the same building in different departments.


The office has many interns who transfer in and out. One girl has been coming in on and off for three years. The program is semi-paid, provides excellent references and scholarships, so we have a lot of university students come back again and again as they work through their degrees. This girl is beautiful: young, pale skin and dark hair, very exotic looking.


When she first met my husband they clashed severely. I'm very sure she hated him. Then, over the years, the tables began to turn. They came to an understanding. About a year ago they began spending a lot of time together. More time than any partner or intern would ever need to spend time together. It's never outside; only inside the office. It started out slow: a few short discussions here and there led into lengthy hour discussions where they would speak of nothing related to work. They'd share stories and memories and talk about future plans. Banter started between them; I've never heard him laugh so heartily in a long time. They make eyes at each other and share little secretive glances (so I've been told by a friend in their department). In the last two months it's really changed. He seems obsessed with her opinion and having her help him. She'll go into his office to talk (even with the door open; policy rules) and I'll feel like I can't interrupt them even though they're not talking about work. She'll come to him with her problems (breakups, family issues) and he tells her about our daughter and son and family issues. They've cried together a few times; he's broken down and told her things that were bothered him. I once walked in while she was crying and he was comforting her and I had to walk out because it seemed so intimate - like I was intruding.


The other day he broke the cardinal rule. She told him he needed to talk to him later in the day. When she arrived he told her she could shut the door. Breaking every company rule. It was only then that I found out from a friend that they would often go into one of the windowless rooms and shut the door. I don't think they had sex, but as a man of working integrity and absolution he's never broken rules for anyone before.


When they talk, their body language has recently become very flirty as well. She'll preen and flip her hair and nibble her lip and giggle. I'll walk in the room and he'll just glance at me - she won't even make eye contact with me. When he does speak to me he does it in a very generic way as if you'd speak to a child. He also told her the other day (I overheard) something something ""That's why we have such a good friendship."" He was being genuine.

Ok... buckle up for a long one. Sorry about the wall of text, but it's kinda hard to understand our group dynamic without all the back explanations since we live in a non-traditional grad student house. 

I (25M) go to school in Texas for civil engineering, but originally hail from Boston. Last summer in May before I went out of the country for an internship, one of my roommates and best friend (for this post we will call him ""Mike"") (25M) from undergrad asked me if I would be interested in renting a room in a large house they planned on renting out for the year. The deal sounded awesome; very competitive rent for the area; close to school; my own bed &amp; bath; huge south-facing bedroom in a really old house! Anyway, I finish up my internship in the UK and fly back to Texas all ready to move in. The house was as awesome as he had said it would be. I moved in about a day after Mike, and about 2 weeks before the semester started again (The timeline is important here). We spent the next two weeks doing what grad students who have no work for 2 weeks would do: Drinking lots of cheap alcohol, hanging out, BBQing, and going to the university pool. I can honestly say, those two weeks were some of the best times of my life and I will cherish the memories I made with Mike for the rest of my life (Another couple stories for other subs... well maybe some things are better left off the internet, but I digress). So the two weeks end, the semester begins and with it our other three roomates move in during the last weekend before school starts.  (For this post:) Antonio (25M), and Tomas (26M) end up moving in that Saturday, then our last roomate (My GF) Elizabeth (26F) moves in that Sunday. 

The strange things really started happening the second week of school. Tomas had started dating a new girl over the summer (Samantha 25F), I didn't think much of it because Tomas tends to date a girl for awhile, find her ""crazy"" then dump her. I figured this relationship was pretty par for the course-- we would have like one strange Friday or Saturday night post breakup where she would show up in tears, yell at Tomas, then end up crying more and one of us just getting her a cab and one of us sending her home, maybe taking her to dinner or buying a bottle of wine and one of us calming her down explaining we can all be friends then ghosting her. No big deal, Elizabeth, Antonio, Mike and I have known Tomas for almost a decade now and this is just an annual occurrence. That Friday as a house we decided to just have a chill night-- no people over. Mike and I were tired of cleaning up the next day and just wanted to relax. I went and bought a small bottle of scotch and a couple cases of LoneStar for some chill time at home with the roomies. 

As soon as I get back from the liquor store with Mike, we walk into the living room and Samantha and Tomas are there. I flip on the TV to play some XBOX, it was obvious we were intruding on a private conversation but hey, they have a bedroom they can go into and there is only one TV/XBOX and one living room in the whole house. Through our Call of Duty game it becomes obvious Samantha has a yeast infection... again, no big deal but why are you in the living room discussing this in front of EVERYONE ELSE???? About an hour into killing Nazi zombies I hear them discussing riding bikes to a pharmacy to get medicine but then it becomes ""Well how do we get it back home, I can't balance on a bike so well"" so I pipe up ""Why don't you just go to the store already, and just use the product in the bathroom."" All of a sudden Samantha blows up at Tomas and demands he ""put me in my place and get him to stop talking about my vagina!"" I know when not to get on the bad side of a woman, so Mike and I nope the fuck out of there and walk over to a friends house to shoot more electronic zombies and get wasted in peace. 

A couple weeks go by, the yeast infection thing is weird... but I've seen and heard of weirder. All of a sudden it is our first fall break which gives us a 3 day weekend. Mike ends up taking the Friday and Monday off so we can go hard all weekend and relive some of our glory undergraduate days. That Friday afternoon Mike, Antonio, and I are all outside getting a fire ready in the grill to BBQ dinner when Tomas gets home. In the interim the whole Samantha deal had gotten alot rockier and we were all kinda on edge thinking this would be the big breakup weekend and that might ruin a bit of the fun. As a group we were spot on; Tomas is clearly agitated when he finally gets home because he had a shitty week at work so he starts drinking and hard. By about 10PM he is wasted, but somehow walked to the corner store and managed to purchase 6 four Lokos. I was already 3 sheets to the wind, but when Mike makes eye contact with me upon seeing the four lokos we both know it's time to quit drinking because shit's about to go down hardcore. 

About midnight I'm starting to sober up when the front door opens. It's Samantha and a couple of her friends, they had all been at some club, are also obviously very drunk, and this point basically falling apart. I'm not sure how it happened, but Tomas ended up yelling at Samantha for ""looking like a whore and being unable to hold her alcohol"" (nevermind the irony as he slurringly yells at her and her friends). The waterworks start and I look for Mike to help with our backup rescue plan, but he has passed out according to Antonio. I'm like ""Oh shit... I'm out"" and head off to bed. About an hour later I get woken up from my sleep by the sound of shattering glass outside. Eventually I make my way downstairs to see that that Tomas and Samantha are now having a glass fight with the house collection of assorted drinking utensils.. in the front yard. I ask Tomas to go burn one in the backyard with me and calm down as I see Mike start to emerge from the front door. Mike and I get Tomas calmed down, order Dominos and get an Uber to take Samantha home. We sent Antonio and Elizabeth back with Samantha to make sure she got home ok, and Mike and I cracked a beer with Tomas in the back yard. A couple hours later my gf gets home with Antonio; I ask if everything is ok and get a terse face and a response ""As ok as it will ever be."" I figured that the Samantha Tomas thing is over, usually crying drama and we can move onto the next Tomas/GF saga in about a month when he found a new monogamous relationship to get himself into.... Boy was I wrong. 

The next morning I wake up, go downstairs to start cleaning up glass and stuff and low and behold: There's Samantha making breakfast for herself and Tomas. She looks at me says good morning and I grab a trashbag and gloves to try to make our front yard safe again. I'm thinking ""Goddamit, goddamit, goddamit"" because I'm really hungry and neither her nor Tomas cleaned up the mess AND SHE IS HOGGING THE KITCHEN AND DOESN'T EVEN LIVE HERE! I end up getting some McDonalds and get the yard sorta cleaned up. Eventually Antonio wakes up and asks if Elizabeth said anything last night to me. I'm confused at this point and just kinda write it off for awhile, but he keeps pestering me asking if my gf said anything to me. When Elizabeth finally wakes up, she pulls me aside and gives me the heads up-- basically she had gone to the bathroom after getting Elizabeth in bed. When she got out of the bathroom, Antonio and Samantha were going at it on the couch. She said she just kinda went in the kitchen and let it happen because she thought Tomas had dumped Samantha and it wasn't her business. 

I filled Mike in on what happened and together with Elizabeth we agreed to not get involved whatsoever since we all have a lease and have to live together for the rest of the year. All of us thought it was a drunk isolated incident and figured Samantha would be gone in a few days once Tomas woke up and broke up with her for good. Boy were we all wrong! From that weekend on, Samantha virtually moved into our house. She started sleeping over every night, storing her car at our house, cooking all her meals there, and Tomas even made her a key? After a couple weeks of it we confronted him-- she never cleans up, hogs the laundry, blocks cars in, basically all of the shitty things college roomates can do... but again she doesn't even live in our house. What's worse tho was I was pretty sure the Antonio/ Samantha thing was still going on. I heard her voice coming from his room several times when Tomas wasn't home, bed creaking, moaning, the full 9 yards. Mike and I both  casually mentioned what a bad idea the whole arrangement was, but he denied it of course. 

Well this whole thing unsurprisingly came to a head over the Halloween weekend. As a house, we decided to throw a costume party and invite a bunch of people we all mutually knew from college. We invited about 3 dozen people, but probably had 60+ show up at our house. We live on a pretty chill street too, so we even had neighbors comig over and hanging out and drinking with us. Everything was going fine until about midnight. At that point, Samantha, Antonio, and Tomas were all really really drunk, this time though they started taking shots of fireball as a group. Mike and I joined in for the first couple, but Samantha started getting frisky and grabbing people's butts. I knew where this was headed to I wandered off to smoke a cig and talk to other people. I'm not sure what/when/how or what they were thinking, but basically Antonio and Samantha had decided to go around the side of our house where the AC units sit (There is a small wooden fence here and lots of bushes so very secluded). I guess one of the other people at the party saw them go back there and told Tomas but I'm really not sure. Next thing I know I hear a scream and Tomas shouting ""I knew you were a fucking slut. Why don't you just come out naked and let every other guy at this party stick his dick in you as well?"" Mike was the first one to get around the corner to see Samantha's stark naked, clutching her costume around her to cover up with Antonio on the ground lights out with a nice knot growing on his forehead and part of a metal grill poker/ cleaner tool lying next to him. 

One of our guests was actually a doctor (Well a resident... but close enough). He got an Ice pack and ended up carrying Antonio inside and getting him to come around eventually. Tomas and Samantha on the other hand digressed into a shouting match at which point she picked up the grill tool and hit him pretty hard over the top of his head. He started choking her and had to be restrained by Mike, myself and a couple other guys at the party. I ended up getting Elizabeth to take Samantha home with another girl (Mike and I were at least smart enough to recognize our previous mistake). There wasn't much else eventful that night, and by the time we got the drama all sorted out most people had moved on to another party anyways. The thing that really shook my mind tho was I woke up on Sunday... guess who was in the kitchen? You guessed it: Samantha.

Mike and I were already up, so we as nicely as possible told her it was a really bad idea to be back at our house after last night. She insisted she was fine though and that she had made up with Tomas. I'm at this point having serious Deja Vu and wondering if I'm in the matrix or something like that. I've spent the last three days analyzing the whole situation and trying to figure out a way to deescalate and remove her from the house without incurring backlash from Antonio and Tomas.  Any and all advice is welcome at this point. At it stands currently, it is becoming an enormous chore to just chill and enjoy our house. As an adult (granted, a very immature one with immature friends) I'm struggling with how either Samantha or Tomas think it's a good idea to keep seeing eachother. Mike and I even tried talking to him yesterday about how it was a bad idea to keep seeing her since they both were violent towards eachother and have been at this point almost every time they are drinking. 


  
**tl;dr**: Rented house at the beginning of the semester with a couple friends who might have drinking problems. Friend's GF has subsequently moved in, had her own key made, won't leave, and cheats on her BF in OUR HOUSE WHILE HER BF IS THERE.... WITH OUR OTHER ROOMATES?!?!?!"

I will gladly hear your advice.",Umadbro_o,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3rjcsv/began_internship_6_months_ago_my_grandma_died_in/,"So like i said, i began my internship 6 months ago, and while i was in the surgical department, i was the first one to tend to my grandma who had fallen from her bed, and had gotten a 3 cm hematoma in her occiput. She was 90-year old and it's fair to say that i was dreading the time she would deteriorate. 
Spending a month in the hospital, she got far worse. Eventually, she passed away due to septicaemia. 

We lived under the same roof, and even though i knew the possibility of her passing away was quite frankly big, i couldn't properly react to it and still can't. For the past 6 weeks, it's preventing me to work properly. Every time i open my book to read something, there is this voice which keeps telling me: "" What's the point of it all?""

I've lost more than 10 patients since i started and they each hit me hard, but i usually had enough guts to let it go and tend equally to each patient. However, since she passed away, i feel like i'm not doing enough for my patients. My drive has decreased and i haven't been able to ask my seniors for advice on how to handle the situation for fear of being told that i am using my grandma's death as an excuse to not do my best.

I've been thinking of getting transferred to another hospital but distancing myself from the problem might make it worse. 
Also considering psychiatric help. 

Another minor issue is a viva in orthopedics in a week, and i'm not feeling mentally ready enough to take the exam. The knowledge is there, the right state of mind isn't.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and if so, what will help?

I am currently an Economics major. However, it is my junior year and I have found that I do not like Economics at all and that I am able to leverage my writing and editing skills and experience (which I have a lot of and am interested in) in the job market. 

I started an internship as an content editor at a local tech company and am moving over to natural language processing. I am just dipping my toes in the water with content creation via natural language processing (not sure if that is the right terminology), but am really loving it. I would like to get into semantic parsing and other analytical areas of computational linguistics.  

After a lot of research, I am now seriously considering a career in computational linguistics. I have some programming knowledge and am taking intro classes to Python and Linguistics next quarter. 

That said, I only have an OK GPA and will continue with my Economics major. Do you think it is too late to get into computational linguistics? If not, do you think I would be able to get into a master's program despite my major and less-than-stellar GPA? And, what steps should I take to ensure that I get into a master's program and prepare myself for it? Should I start getting in contact with professors in the field at master's programs I am interested or even at my own university(there is only one assistant professor in the field here)? 

Let me know. Big thanks in advanced!

I'm 22. I'm currently unemployed and living at home. I get money from my incredible awesome dad, enough to cover food/hobbies every month - Meaning that yes, I pay for everything except rent.

I'm applying for jobs left and right, looking at houses to rent every now and then. The plan is to move within a few months (job or not) if my SO gets accepted to school. If he doesn't, we're going to move out and i'm going to get (extremely low paying) internship and so on.

Now here's the thing - Nmom brings this up constantly that I don't have a job and that I don't do shit.

Except that I do. I clean the entire house, I walk the dog, I cook dinner, I wash clothes with a smile and no complaints. While applying for jobs and trying to keep sane.

She guilt-trips me, saying i'm the reason she doesn't have any money (? She has 2 jobs, I don't see how thats possible), says i'm not doing enough, not doing it right, every little mistake is brought up as if it ruined her life.

BUT, she only does this when i'm alone. Always been like that, yells at me and makes me feel terrible every chance she has, but the second another person or my SO is here, it's like nothing happened. She has been doing this since I was little.

But today it happened. She brought it up when my SO was next to me. I honestly feel like she robbed me the only safety I have.

It was the usual crap. She told me and SO to write down our wishes for christmas, and I asked her what she wanted for christmas. ""I want my daugther to finally get a job!"" and went on about how I don't do anything, **even thought** I kept saying ""I'm fixing everything, I'm applying for jobs"" whilst trying to keep calm. ""But you're not doing enough!"". I slammed the door and cried with my SO.

I no longer feel safe from her crap. She promised me (infront of my SO and his mom) that she would stop saying N-stuff and let me be. As expected, she brought it up so many times."

I have not worked since August, and prior to that, not full-time since June.  I just got a job as a substitute teacher, which is something I had done during the previous year.  In January, I start an internship program to get my teaching credential, so working as a substitute teacher is, thankfully, only temporary.

As a substitute teacher, it is up to me whether I work on any given day or not.  I can decide the night before or the morning of whether I want to work that day.  Most of the time, it's easy to pick up a job every day if you're not picky.

Yesterday I was given my login information to access the website that allows me to accept teaching assignments.  

I'm so scared.  I feel so much anxiety.  I feel so bad.  I want to escape as much as I can.  I went to sleep at 7 pm last night and didn't get up until 8:30.  I have accomplished nothing remarkable today, just sitting around feeling bad.

I would go to my boyfriend for support, but he would tell me to ""stop being emo"" and stop sitting around feeling bad for myself.

Any opinions into what the hell just happened?,iOSvista,reiki,https://www.reddit.com/r/reiki/comments/3rk6c7/kundalini_awakening_spiritual_change_any_opinions/,"Hey there, thanks for taking a minute to read this. Ill get right down to it...

My path has been quite an exciting one. To get the basic externals out of the way, I am a 23 y/o male working in IT. I have been clean from hard drugs for 3 years and just graduated an IT program and finally landed a good paying job in my field of interest in July at another department in the company I spent 6 months as an intern at (Feb-Jul) 

I recall starting about the end of January, I started having really strange, unexplained bouts of meloncholy. I felt tired, itchy, sore, restless, had abdominal issues, issues related to the nervous system such as extreme lightheadnesses (to the point of sometimes losing vision and coming close to fainting, twice my right hand got stuck in a odd mishapen position where I had to actually ""peel"" my fingers away from each other, I had a terrible time of even speaking. I slurred, stuttered, and felt like I couldn't get my tongue out of the way. I often woke in the morning soaked in sweat, with a racing heart and just absolutely bullshit enraged for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I didn't shit or piss for weeks at a time, had no appetite, couldn't focus at work, and felt all around trapped.

This lasted about 4-5 months total, and was really progressive, the symptoms were constantly changing and evolving, where I would have clusters of one set of systems that would one by one disappear only to be replaced by new ones (total lack of general circadian rhythm to the degree of not even sleeping for a minute some nights. No doctors had any idea what was wrong with me. According to them, everything loooked fine, but they even could see visually (vasculitis in my hands etc) that something wasnt right.

I would say that over the course of 4-5 months, I experienced well over 50-maybe 60 or 70, very real, very overwhelming symptoms that would come and go. The other strange thing, that I never did figure out was the pattern. Mondays would be god awful, Tuesdays would be absolute Hell, unbearable, wednesdays would really suck but not as bad as tuesday, Thursday Id feel like I was getting better, friday I would be cured, saturday was a crapshoot, and by sunday night Id start feeling very odd again. I literally went insane. At one point, I was convinced that I was never going to get better and, recall the overwhelming feeling of losing myself forever. I recall trying to explain this to my father, and telling him that ""I was gone, I wasnt myself, whatever this is has totally ruined me and taken me away from myself."" Thats just one of many frighteningly overwhelming thoughs and conversations. It was legitimate hell...Then it just vanished.

Anyways, these symptoms are gone now, I dont have them anymore, they kind of just vanished about 2 months ago. However, I have had a firey passion for spiritual growth ever since. I dont feel consciously that it is because of this, but I now have an insatiable appetite for learning about geometry, physics, world culture, philosophy, and I have newfound love and intimacy with the sky, stars, and plants. I have a new found spirituality and understanding of the inner workings of my ego and connection with the self, Reiki, crystals, shamanism, chakras etc.

What is going on here? I have always had an interest in this stuff but recently its like I am really starting to understand a lot about myself and about the world. Anyone have any experience that they can share or any insight?

Is this related?"

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3rkncg,27,2015-11-04,I [49/f] have become slightly suspicious of my husband's [53] relationship with his much younger intern,Tossit7282829,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3rkncg/i_49f_have_become_slightly_suspicious_of_my/,"I posted this on 2XChromosomes but wondered why I didn't go to a more general source.






Usually I don't get worked up about anything related to my marriage. We've been married 20 years and he's always seemed to be faithful and happy. We were both previously married and cheated on our spouses with each other, however the relationships we were both in were very negative. We have two children who are both grown up and out of the house.






My husband is very spirited and childish. Not to say he's immature, but he's very playful and fun. He acts at most 30 years old and is attractive in the same way George Clooney is attractive (older but sexy). I mention this because he's gotten attention from younger females before, but has always been open about their actions and quickly put a stop to it. We work in the same building in different departments.






The office has many interns who transfer in and out. One girl has been coming in on and off for three years. The program is semi-paid, provides excellent references and scholarships, so we have a lot of university students come back again and again as they work through their degrees. She wasn't supposed to come back this year, but she wanted to, and my husband offered to pick her up as a mentor again. This girl is beautiful: young, pale skin and dark hair, very exotic looking. She's smart, loved and respected by everyone, and very funny.






When she first met my husband they clashed severely. I'm very sure she hated him. He saw her potential and pushed her (acting like a bit of an ass) which usually intimidates the interns just enough. Instead of ruining the working relationship, over the years, the tables began to turn. They came to an understanding. About a year ago they began spending a lot of time together. More time than any partner or intern would ever need to spend time together. It's never outside; only inside the office. It started out slow: a few short discussions here and there led into lengthy hour discussions where they would speak of nothing related to work. They'd share stories and memories and talk about future plans. Banter started between them; I've never heard him laugh so heartily in a long time. They make eyes at each other and share little secretive glances (so I've been told by a friend in their department). In the last two months it's really changed. He seems obsessed with her opinion and having her help him. She'll go into his office to talk (even with the door open; policy rules) and I'll feel like I can't interrupt them even though they're not talking about work. She'll come to him with her problems (breakups, family issues) and he tells her about our daughter and son and family issues. They've cried together a few times; he's broken down and told her things that were bothered him. I once walked in while she was crying and he was comforting her and I had to walk out because it seemed so intimate - like I was intruding. He also asks her advice about work and talks about coworkers and the other interns with her.






The other day he broke the cardinal rule. She told him he needed to talk to him later in the day. When she arrived he told her she could shut the door. Breaking every company rule. It was only then that I found out from the same friend that last year they would often go into one of the windowless rooms and shut the door. I don't think they had sex, but as a man of working integrity and absolution he's never broken rules for anyone before.






When they talk, I'm big on watching gestures and movements, their body language has recently (in the last two months) become very flirty as well. She'll preen and flip her hair and nibble her lip and giggle.  During their private discussions I'll walk in the room and he'll just glance at me and maybe speak - she won't always even make direct eye contact with me. When he does speak to me he does it in a very generic way as if you'd speak to an acquaintance. During meetings had started (in the last month) to constantly make eye contact with her, as if checking for her approval of to gauge her thoughts. He also told her the other day (I overheard) something something ""That's why we have such a good friendship."" He was being genuine. He also says things like, ""I'm glad you come to talk to me"" or ""I really enjoy talking to you.""






That's what's scares me. Their relationship went from hate to tolerance to a working relationship to now a ""friendship."" Will it escalate more? I'd just like to know if there's any reason I should be worried or if it's a normal relationship between two people and if I am being crazy.






I haven't said anything because there's nothing wrong with our marriage. People comment that we seem happy. This girl is also not a flirt or a tease. The only people who think of anything suspicious are myself and my one coworker/friend. She'll also be out of his mentor-ship (but still in the building) after February 2016.






TL;DR: Is my husband's young intern a problem for our relationship?


EDIT: I edited out two parts which had nothing to do with the end story, but people seemed unreasonably attached to.




UPDATE: Everyone seemed to jump on the fact that I've ""Never talked"" to him about it before. That is not true and I don't know why anyone would have jumped to that conclusion. We have spoken about her, but I did it in very subtle ways (ask him what she was like, how he felt about her). As I said in my post it's only been in the last two months that I have an extreme amount to worry.

I spoke to my friend and took some of the advice from you guys. I also asked him about her. He said, basically, along the lines of: ""She's just an intern to me. The same as any other. I see her intelligence as value to the company, but to me she doesn't mean anything."" He doesn't know that I've heard him call her a friend or tell her the things he's said to her. I don't know. It will take me a while to collect any evidence I may need to approach him with.

I wonder if it's possible he just views her the same and that he doesn't see what his actions will look like to others."

Little bit of basic background - I'm a virgin, I have no romantic relationship experience, but I know that I'm not socially inept. It's more that if I don't have to go out, I don't, and thus I haven't been around girls a ton outside of class and work. Because of all of this, I'm stuck in a situation where I downplay my romantic feelings (lonely virgin, no experience, you're overreacting, etc.).

I was in a 3 person editing group with this girl during the semester. We worked on Fridays together and had pretty good discussions and chats together. Most of it was normal, friendly talk. I made sure never to cross any type of line because she has a boyfriend, but I was more extroverted and friendlier (asking questions about her, what she's up to, etc.) than I typically am because I like her.

I was thinking last night about how certain people seem drawn to each other in weird ways. People who sit in the back meet people who are at least a little like them by virtue of also sitting in the back, etc. With this girl, I got that same sort of hint in small ways - the type of shit you generally tend to overplay when you have a crush on someone. But even still, we kept running into each other, and just gelled. 

She seems open with me, and I'm fairly open with her too. I'll ask what she did this weekend, she'll seems very receptive to talk and glad i ask questions. I'll listen and ask more about her. She brought up a quote to me one day off the cuff, without any kind of prompt - prompting one of those ""deeper"" conversations. I don't want to write a novel, but the basic point is we seem to talk about stuff regularly that's a little more (but not a LOT more) than ""just friends"" stuff. She's pretty open with me, and vice versa. That said, I try to mirror what she does rather than do anything to escalate, because I know the boundaries. She has a boyfriend. 

After our 10 weeks of editing ended, she saw me in the halls and stopped to talk to me, saying she didn't want our friendship to end just because we finished our projects. I had made a joke on the final day of working together that we'd just be ""hallway buddies"" now, but she wanted to stay friends. All things considered, I felt we gelled a lot during our time working together and she's very sweet. I was drawn to her.

Anyways, today I ran into her three times by chance. There was an event with a guy I'm interning for next semester, and her organization happened to be running it. I saw her in the halls before the event, then talked to her at the event. It was pretty basic stuff, and expected because I knew she was running this event. 

She had invited me and about 20 others to the event - but here's the funny thing. Later on I went to class, and left to use the restroom. On the way back, I saw her pop up as I turned the corner back to class. We talked for about 25 minutes non stop, even though I had to go to class and she was leaving school.  I was generally asking specific questions about her halloween, her weekend, etc. given what she'd mentioned from last week. At one point she asked how I knew one of the speakers i talked to after the event. I had told her during our time working together I got an internship with him, but I guess she forgot. I told her I was interning for him next semester. 

The point of that little excerpt is to say 2 things: 1) maybe she doesn't remember our talks like I do (which is fine), and 2) she seemed to invite me among her closest friends on the invitation list - I thought she just invited me because my internship guy was at the event, but I guess not.

Anyways, more on the hallway conversation. Last week she told me she was going to the farm with her boyfriend, and she wanted a specific costume for halloween. So I asked if she got the costume and how the farm was and what she did. We joked around and she showed me some videos and clips from the farm the past weekend. Then we talked about my family a little bit, and she talked about hers.

I had to go back to class since it was letting out in 5 minutes, but the time seemed to fly by while we were talking. No awkward silences, just a free flowing conversation. 

I don't really know why I'm posting. I can't and won't do anything about this, but I guess I'm pointing to a broader question/issue, and one I don't know how to phrase well without putting it bluntly - does this basic overview give any of you an impression that she sees me as anything more than just a friend?

3rmdb4,21,2015-11-05,The Day I Saw Myself Bald,baldredditthrowaway2,bald,https://www.reddit.com/r/bald/comments/3rmdb4/the_day_i_saw_myself_bald/,"19 and bald.   Nine-teen. Bald.    It was the 3rd of May, 2015.   I had gone to the barber to have my hair cut from its medium-long length to a number-six buzzcut, in an attempt to hide my bald spot. Until this point I had managed to conceal it well, as hair thickeners, gels, and other products had joined my daily routine until the forty minutes I spent on my hair per morning left it looking full enough to fool almost anyone.  My friends and family never noticed.  They later said they assumed any thin parts of hair they saw were quirks of my natural hairline- who would guess a 19 year old was going bald so fast?  

But the buzzcut didn't hide the balding- in fact as the barber held a mirror behind my head, I saw for the first time how bad my situation had become.   He must have seen me sigh, for he (bald himself) said ""it shouldn't happen this young"" and offered to shave it, an offer I took him up on.  

The first time I saw myself bald in that mirror, I thought nothing.  I thanked the barber, handed him his money with the tip I had already set aside, and walked outside.  I walked home and went through the motions without thinking.  I even stopped and bought some fried chicken on the way home, and ate it hungrily on the way.  

I walked in my front door, up the stairs to my apartment, and stopped opposite the big mirror in the hallway.  I looked at myself, stared really, for at least five or ten minutes.   Then I walked into my apartment, locked the door and cried.  I cried for the youth I would never have.  I cried for every time someone would mention how much better I looked with hair.  I cried for every time I was referred to solely as 'the bald guy'.  I cried for every time a beautiful girl my age would see me as a bald friend, instead of a potential partner.  I cried and cried and cried, more than I ever have in my life, and then I went to bed at 12.05pm and slept until the next morning.  

When I woke up the next morning, I felt what can only be described as an immense wave of relief wash over me.  It was like I had been given a fresh start in life.  Immediately I began studying for university like I had never done before.  I didn't go to class anymore (there are no attendance requirements at my Uni), but I learnt the entire course.   When I went in for exams I sat down, did the work, and left.  I aced every one of them.  That afternoon, I booked an introduction session at the local gym.  I now go four times a week.  In six months, I have built more muscle than almost everyone I know.   I feel proud of myself.   That evening, I applied to three internships for next Summer.  I got interviews for all of them, and offers from two.  

I've been talking as well.  Networking events for future jobs, I go up to people, introduce myself, shake their hand and make small talk.  I may be the bald guy, but I'm also the confident one.   I take charge in group events on what are called 'superdays' (basically interview days with some group tasks in finance).  I don't take shit.  

I haven't been as successful with girls.  Truth be told, I never really was before, but I'll be honest with you gentlemen- being bald from 18-25 isn't the best thing to happen to your sex lives.  I don't think I'll be getting laid anytime soon, at least not to anyone conventionally attractive.  I hear it is equally bad for gay men, too.   But I have accepted that.  I've accepted I may have to wait another five years to become attractive to women.  

And in that time, I will exercise like hell.  I will train my running, swimming and sprinting so that those muscles are put to some use and I have things to reach for.  I will study hard, and I will network harder to make sure I can build a successful and fulfilling career.  I will develop my interests.  And I will never forget how fortunate I am to have been born in a developed country, to a middle-class family who love me, to not have to worry about where my next meal will come from, to be safe and mostly healthy.   

Chaps.  We may be bald.  And yeah, that kind of sucks.  But we have only one option- to keep on living, and do the best we can.    "
3rmth5,11,2015-11-05,Why is the writing so terrible on NCIS these days?,BradleyBuyer,NCIS,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCIS/comments/3rmth5/why_is_the_writing_so_terrible_on_ncis_these_days/,"My god, watching this last season has just been *painful* and the writing is just so... sophomoric.

Problems I have with recent seasons:

* They no longer concentrate on good, well written *crime investigations* but on poorly written cast relationships that we don't care about (maybe because they're so poorly written - and acted) and Tony getting Poison Ivy or a splinter.

* They're force-feeding us Bishop's 'troubled' relationship with the only person we could care less about than her: *Jake*.  This is also the exact same thing they tried with Ziva and it didn't work then either - but at least we cared about Ziva (who was a great cast member until they neutered her into a boring seat warmer), so we went along with it.

* They're also force-feeding us a comradery between Bishop and McGee.  Again, no chemistry between these two weak characters and it's painful to watch them poorly attempt to be 'playful', weaker attempt at bonding, and sharing their paper-thin relationships.

* Tony has become an oaf, not just a damn good investigator with a sense of humor, but a fool.  And he's become marginalized more and more as time goes on.  Rather than keeping him the true talent he is, they're lowering him to the level of McGee and milk-toast Bishop with equally mindless and pointless dialog.

* Like the last episode with the embarrassing 'Sherlocks', we constantly get 'one-off' stories that bare expanding, but we never see again - just for a plot point on another forgettable episode from writers with short attention span syndrome.

* Stop with the totally improbably McGee/Delilah Fielding relationship.  These two have about as much chemistry as two cans of tuna.  The only relationship the show has ever been able to pull off was/is Tony and Dr. Jeanne Benoit.  There is real *chemistry* between these two very good actors and it makes all the other ham-handed attempts at cast relationships just embarrassing.

* And stop with the elderly 'cougars' making goo-goo eyes and licking their lips at Gibbs.  It's just creepy.

I could go on about the terrible writing on this show recently, but this touches on most of the points.  I've watched NCIS since the beginning, so I am talking about the last few terrible seasons compared to the past 12 - which have been top notch until recently. 

I wonder if all the past writers quit and they hired a bunch of interns or what.  I long for a good actual crime investigation that doesn't spiral into mindless prattle about poorly written relationships and forgettable, throw-away plot devices we (or the writers is seems) care nothing about.

3rmv8o,1,2015-11-05,[26/f] My boyfriend [28/m] doesn't support me and looks at exes on fb,IzaQWE,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3rmv8o/26f_my_boyfriend_28m_doesnt_support_me_and_looks/,"We have been together for 1,5 years, last few months I have been on internship abroad (it's for one year) I always wanted to go, but we try to see each other every 2-3 weeks.
My boyfriend is quite reserved when it comes to talking about past or work, he has always been like that, because he didn't trust people, his first girlfriend (they were together 5 years) left him for his best friend, then he was dating other girls (nothing serious, not even kisses etc.), but they were always after money or just having fun while he was looking for a serious girlfriend. They also betrayed their boyfriends in the past, one e.g. is dating much older guy now and spends his money. I also have bad experiences, so it was a long process to gain each other's trust, unfortunately he still can't fully open up to me. 
I had never thought why he once in a while said what's happening to these girls he dated (he did that when we were complaining on people's behaviour nowadays), anyway it was always negative.

&amp;nbsp;

Last time he visited me, he took a picture of me, so I went to see it and saw his ""ex"" profile on fb in the background. It hurt, but I didn't say anything. Then he left his fb logged in on my computer and I scrolled through activity log... And he has been visiting profiles of these girls many times a day! (and somewhere between my profile once, I don't care, but just to have some stats) Ok, I get it - sometimes curiosity is strong, but couple times a day, even when he's with me??

&amp;nbsp;

To make it worse, he had a lot of problems to support me with going on this internship, I was hearing all the time ""you're egoist, you will betray me, but of course, you should go, I'm happy for you"" and I can't talk about my work at all, he's allergic to it. After a few months it's a lot better when he saw I'm not partying here etc., but for a while I was depressed, because I was happy of the opportunity and thought I was doing sth wrong by being happy, so I killed this feelings. I have my own life, interests, hobbies, I don't need him to fill the emptiness, but I really cared about his support.
He also has some secret job after his normal job, which I also found through browser's history and it's not a big deal for me to know... And whenever he starts talking about that he says that I don't need to know or maybe he will tell me one day or it's a secret, blah blah.

&amp;nbsp;

I put everything together and just couldn't stand it anymore and told him about looking at exes instead of focusing on current relationship to solve these support problems, but he said I act like a typical woman, making problem out of nothing and he doesn't care about anybody else. But really - they don't post anything on fb, some of them aren't even his friends, it's just visiting profiles many times a day - why?
Besides that everything's ok, he cares about me, I know his family (even his mother said that work is a big part of our life and it's not nice what he was saying to me in front of her) and friends, he makes some future plans with me, but I don't see a future with communication like that. 
&amp;nbsp;
How can I talk with him to change anything? I tried, but then he says he's always been like that and we can talk about anything, but not about work. And it's also when I say one sentence about some funny story with my colleagues, not even work related - ""you always talk about work"". That's totally not true. I noticed that when recently I started to complain a little about being stressed or having problems with boss (on purpose), he continued that. He is also stressed at his work and wants to change it, but if I say anything positive - no, I talk about work all the time. 
And then also these girls he used to date... Does he regret not being with them or what?
Is there any chance we can fix this or he's just immature and will be like that forever? :/"

Being in Canada, and getting very lucky with my university internships, I only have about 10k in student debt which I don't have to start repaying until March (with Prime+1% interest, I believe).

I have no other debt but live in a high cost-of-living area and all my expenses are just under $3k/month. I save the remaining $1k.

I got a signing bonus, which came to about $7k after tax, and started working a month ago, so my savings are up to $8k now. 

So in two months I'll have enough money to obliterate my debt with $0 left over. If I wait until March, I'll have one month's expenses saved in addition. 

Should I drain my emergency fund to pay off my debt? Or should I hang on to $9k (3 months' expenses) and Throw $4k at the debt, then pay it off $1k/month?"

All in hopes that I would bring myself out of depression. It was just false hope. I never got excited about the internship even though it has to do with what I've always wanted to be when I grow up. I just feel like I don't deserve it. 
The job is just terrible. I bus tables and I'm never fast enough and my boss hates me but isn't firing me because she feels bad for me I guess. I also feel like I don't deserve that job.
School feels like a waste of my time even though I know it's not. I just feel like a mindless zombie when I go to school. I just go on the bus and sit down for 20 mins and then I walk into the school and just sit down for each class and walk to the next. It seems pointless, yet it is the cause of overwhelming amounts of stress and it just makes all of my problems worse.
The clubs are a moment of brief slight happiness and then I just sink down again. 
I go home and I sit in my room alone. I'm all alone. I hate that. I just feel so goddamn lonely. 
I wish I could be effortlessly happy like a toddler or something.

I found http://jconversion.org/, when I was considering to convert to the faith. I read the testimonials and thought it was a legit program. My life/schedule was in flux, so I didn't have a stable schedule to attend regular classes, so online seemed like a good idea.

I thought this was a good rabbi, bad website. He seemed like he just needed a web savy intern. When I started taking the course I noticed he used a couple different names/versions of the site. But I continued, and spent a better part of a year doing the course. I had faith that this was a legit course, I was doing readings, turning in quizes/short answers. Even exchanging emails and pleasantries between myself and Rabbi Joseph Ginsburg (one of his many different alias)  

Fast forward to today, when I find out my total conversion online was illegitimate. I wanted to post this here, as I'm sure I won't be the last one to be dubbed by this ""Rabbi"" who isn't allowed to convert people. Buyer beware.

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3rpc7j,5,2015-11-05,How possible is it to get a job without an internship?,riceisamazing,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/3rpc7j/how_possible_is_it_to_get_a_job_without_an/,"Currently, I am a senior with statistics and math majors and a minor in actuarial sciences.  I already passed Exam P and FM and have a 3.5 GPA.  However, I couldn't get an internship during my junior year and right now I am stressed.  During the fall semester, some recruiters came and asked for resumes.  I sent them mine, but couldn't land an interview.  So now I am thinking that I am not going to get a job before I graduate.  I already started applying to online posts for entry-level jobs, but I am worried that  still won't work.  So my question is how likely is it for me to get a job even without an internship?  Are my stats even that good for an about-to-be graduate finding an entry-level job?  My parents have told me that a lot of people usually do better than me when they graduate, and it is really big that I didn't get an internship so my chances are a lot lower now.  In addition, are there any other ways for me to find jobs because right now I am stuck?"
3rpkpr,6,2015-11-05,I'm failing at my career,Peteybilt,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/3rpkpr/im_failing_at_my_career/,"I have been a diesel mechanic for the past 5 months of my work life and things are not going well. I did not grow up as a gear head like most around me.  I didn’t become interested in mechanics until I started college. I started out in school knowing nothing at all. The first two years of school I was too scared to get a job at a shop because I was so worried about ruining someone’s car and being too slow to learn. So I stayed within my comfort zone at my minimum wage job for another 2 years after I finished school. Last year, I was 23 years old and really stressed that I was still earning minimum wage. I was constantly trying to decide what I wanted to do for a career. I finally decided to build up the courage and go for mechanics again. I told myself that I could do it. In the diesel program I tried my very hardest and attacked my studies fiercely. I was at the top of my class and my professor was very impressed with my performance. After 9 months I got an internship at a fast paced shop. I was nervous as hell and it took me forever to do even simple tasks. The more experienced techs had to practically hold my hand through a lot of jobs that I haven’t done before. It seemed that everything would go wrong with every job, even with the simplest jobs. I did however get fast after doing brake jobs four times. I only got up to speed because an old-timer showed me valuable tricks in performing a brake job. I was fired after a month of working there. My boss explained that they didn’t have time to train me to drive the trucks (I didn’t know how to drive a stick and my attempts at it were bad). He also said to get more hands-on experience and to come back in the future when I had more experience. I knew he liked me, but I was just too slow. I feel that the only reason I lasted a month there was my work ethic and good attitude. 

A few weeks later I applied and got an interview with a great company. I aced the interview and got the job. It was the opportunity of a lifetime and I got paid more there than any other job I’ve had. Things started out well. I took an entry level test on my second day. I was told I got the highest score out of anyone that has applied there in a long time. I had the same issues that I had at the other shop though. I was still slow with even simple tasks and following directions was difficult for me. After a month of working there, my boss had a talk with me. He said that my coworkers complained that I was slow with even simple tasks. I told him it was because I was nervous about messing something up. While that was true, it was also true that I was even slow when I wasn’t worried. Sometimes I was just being too meticulous or complications would arise for everything I worked on. There were few jobs that I did quickly. He said not to worry and that I’d be alright. Right after that I started doing unsafe things. The day after the talk, I lifted up a bus not even paying attention to the location of the lift points and the bus nearly fell off the lift. This was all happening in front of my boss and branch manager. Panic and yelling from others in the shop ensued. As that happened everything in my mind became a blur. I didn’t know what decision to make next and before I could get to the lift another tech was bringing it down. Upper management was angry and I had another talk. The next week I had stuck my hand near a running drive belt in front of a tech and the tech told my boss. Again, I had another talking to. Along with all of this, the other techs had to hold my hand with tasks, even some that I’ve done before. I had trouble following and understanding directions from coworkers. I even had difficulty understanding repairs with written instructions. There were times when I would ask questions and people would look at me like I was dumb as a rock. Two weeks ago, I stripped bolts on a compressor and had to have new ones ordered. Two days ago my boss had another talk with me. He was clearly upset this time. In summary, this is what he said: 
“The guys have been having some real issues with you. They are angry with your performance. They like you but they say you don’t listen and don’t follow directions. They have buses to fix. They don’t have time to hold your hand 24/7. They don’t have time to go behind you and fix the things you’ve screwed up. You need to relax. You’re so rigid and scared. You can’t be scared to touch these buses. You’re a really smart guy. I’ve seen the grades you make in school.  You have the book smarts, but it seems as if your common sense is not there. It’s like you’re the smartest guy in class but you’re flunking the test because you’re freaking out. I know you have the knowledge. You just need to find a way to apply the knowledge in your head and use it hands-on. You’ve been in school way too long to not know anything.” 

I’ve struggled with following instructions before. I was diagnosed with ADD as a kid and I used to have trouble following directions for my assignments. I also think I work poorly under pressure. I think I’ve even struggled with easy dead end jobs before. My position as a security guard was easy but I screwed up a lot. My boss would give me instructions and they would get twisted around and fogged up in my head. When someone got hurt on the property and things were in a rush, I would forget to obtain information from the paramedics and victim. It seems like even with simple things I am incompetent. Everyone tells me that I am struggling because I am new to the field, but I think there’s a limit. Nobody should have to hold my hand this much. There was another mechanic in the shop that was new to the field, but he didn’t have to have his hand held and he was faster than me. I tried my hardest, I worked as hard as I could, I spent thousands on tools to get faster, I read from outside sources, but it was all still too far from enough. Maybe I’m not mechanically inclined like I thought I was? Maybe I’m incapable of working in stressful environments. Maybe I’m just incompetent outside of books and socializing. I really think there’s something wrong with me and I really need to overcome it.

An hour after that last conversation I idiotically snapped a bolt with an impact. He had yet another talk with me. The last two days I was working with a lead tech I had not worked with before. He complained to my boss that I was not following directions and was still screwing things up. Today I was called into his office and was fired. He told me he really liked me and hated to fire me, but he had no choice. He said that I would be rehired by the company in the future if I decided to come back with more experience. He said that I should spend a few years in a basic maintenance shop before moving on to this caliber of mechanics. He advised that I go into the next place of work with a clear head and to be calm in order to succeed. 

Now I’m unemployed and looking for a job yet again. I was so proud to have that job. I was excited that I wasn’t a 24 year old working a minimum wage job anymore. My friends and family were all very proud of me and now I’m fired. I don’t want anyone to know because I’m ashamed of my failures. I’m really not sure what my next step should be. Should I give up being a mechanic? Maybe me being a mechanic is unrealistic?	If I were to get a job at another shop, perhaps all of the same stuff will happen. Maybe I’m just too unsafe to be working in a shop. Maybe I should get a temporary job that is unrelated to mechanics for the time being and figure out another career path that I’d perform well in. 

I also wonder if I chose mechanics for the right reasons. I chose it because there are diesel mechanic jobs all around the world and I had the background knowledge from auto mechanic classes. It was an attractive path for me to take because I didn’t want to start completely over from scratch with a new career choice. I didn’t want to be stuck in debt from getting master’s degree either. I didn’t want a four year degree to end at age 27 or 28. I didn’t want to spend all my 20’s and early 30’s broke. I enjoy mechanics when I do things correctly, but those times seldom happen. I also enjoy the tools and learning new things. Mechanics wasn’t my top choice for a career though. I’ve always wanted a job that would allow me to see the world and travel frequently. I really don’t know what my options are for careers like that. I feel like I’m not living life by staying in my home state. I just feel like time is running out for me. Most people I know are getting married and having kids, all being supported by a comfortable career. I just want to live a good life and I want to find myself. I want to have a career in something that I’m actually good at, whether that turns out to be mechanics or something else. It seems that all the things I’m very passionate about or good at are unrealistic for a career or they are very unrewarding careers.
 
I apologize to anyone reading this. I know I’m jumping around through different subjects in the later part of this post, but these are the things that are concerning me. I hope this post doesn’t come off as a pity party. I’m trying to remain positive in spite of my struggles and I hope to find a solution. Anyone willing to share their experiences or advice would be so appreciated that I will not be able to put it in words.

3rpn4t,1,2015-11-05,Unsupportive girlfriend while I'm failing school,GreekTemple,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3rpn4t/unsupportive_girlfriend_while_im_failing_school/,"I've had a new girlfriend for the past 4 months, and until recently, I thought she was the most amazing person. We met over the summer and hit it off immediately. For the first month, we thought we wouldn't last because she had to move out of my city but we decided to give long-distance a try, even though I was hesitant. She's not all that far away so we can see each other most weekends. Beautiful, smart and generally affectionate are all characteristic of her but she's been saying some things that I am only just noticing, and getting annoyed by. She's selfish. Anytime she has a problem, she will always overtake a conversation, even if I have some problem too. She notices it sometimes and apologizes, saying she wants to be better but then she'll just overtake a conversation again. I didn't mind it much at first but lately I've been pretty down. I can get depressed at times and I'm in one of those periods. Coupled with the fact that I am probably going to fail a class, for the first time, in my senior year of college...basically I'm not well right now. I've told her that I'm in a rut and we talked about it a little bit. But then she stops talking to me for most of the day and when we do talk again, it's about her. She's not very good with communication. 

Most things are always about her. She's not enjoying her job right now so I've pulled strings at my internship, which she is not even taking full advantage of even though she asked me to help her out! We're seeing each other again this weekend and I want to casually bring all of this up to her but I don't know how. I think my unsettled mind is making this a bigger deal than it needs to be but I somewhat need that cathartic release. Besides studying my ass off, there isn't too much I can do regarding school, but I want to retain some amount of control over other problems in my life. Beside's her emotional selfishness, I think she's the best girl I've ever dated so I want to try to make it work with her but if it's going to work, I need her to help me as much as I try to help her.

3rpnyx,2,2015-11-05,Has anyone moved from Business Development to more of an inbound role? Advice needed.,alouette93,AskMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/3rpnyx/has_anyone_moved_from_business_development_to/,"I really need help figuring out my career path. I just graduated  and managed to land an entry level business development role at a B2B software company just before school ended. I'm obviously really lucky that this happened and the company is great and has invested so much in me and my training but...

I'm honestly really, really miserable. I'll try not to make this too whiny, but I'm really not the personality type that this requires. My job is about 90% cold emails and cold calls and it's been really rough. I've always been anxious about phone calls. While I've mostly gotten over that, calling potentially irritated people to try and pitch a meeting is just downright terrifying for me and my life is kind of awful right now because of it. I took the job because I was a desperate Sociology major convinced that I would never find employment and because I really wanted to go into marketing.

From the knowledge I've gained at my job, my interactions with others in the company, and the research I've been doing I've been able to confirm that I want to do some sort of marketing, but not... this. 

I have been working on the Inbound Marketing certification from Hubspot and during every lesson I keep thinking ""now this is what I wish I was doing!"" I really enjoy writing and have done two social media internships, so the idea of a job where I do social media/content creation is really appealing.

I want to move out of my current job as soon as possible, but I've only been there for five months and am worried I'll be unhireable if I don't stick around for longer. But on the other hand, I'm worried about staying too long because I keep running into people on LinkedIn who started out as business development and have done nothing else for decades. That is just about my worst nightmare, so I'm hoping someone out there is a former business development person who didn't do that and can offer advice. My questions are:

1. About how long do I need to stay at my current job before employers won't instantly dismiss me?

2. What sorts of positions should I look for? I'm perfectly willing to do another entry level position. 

3. I'd like to get some more background knowledge- as you can probably tell from this post I didn't major in marketing and thus am lacking a fair amount of the basics most likely. What are some good books/resources to help me?

4. What sorts of certifications should I look into? In addition to the Hubspot one I am considering the Google AdWords certification and possibly the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Social Specialist certification (although that one is pricey). 

Thanks and sorry for being so wordy. I just want to figure out how to get a job that doesn't make me miserable."

I want to know what you all did throughout your academic life and career to reach your current position. 

What was your bachelor's degree in? What are some ""must take"" courses during undergraduate years? Did you have any research experience prior to graduate school? If so, what kind of research? Any other skills you have that you developed that you can apply to your work (computer programs, coding/programming, using a telescope, etc.)? Internships? 

My school doesn't have a planetary program so I'm in Geosciences. Do you think this program will provide me with the fundamentals of geology needed to study other planets? I can provide the curriculum if necessary.

What should I look for in a potential graduate program? What's something I can do as an undergraduate to improve my chances of being admitted to a great program? Should I get a master's in a certain discipline of geology, then pursue a Ph.D. in planetary geology, or is that a waste of time? 

After completing your studies, how did you start off in the field? How do you come up with research topics? 

Thanks in advance for your input! I'm looking forward to your responses "

I've been dating my boyfriend Ted since I was 12, and we had sex about 2 and 1/2 months ago. Haven't done it since because there wasn't time.

I've been feeling super sick ever since and I told my favorite teacher about how I had been puking and then feeling fine. She actually suggested I buy a pregnancy test. 

My mom is a very strict Catholic, and she knows that. My mom is anti abortion and anti sex before marriage. My teacher actually got the test for me, and it was positive. I couldn't believe so my friend brought me two more. They were all positive.

My boyfriend is amazing. I know he would support me. But, he has such a bright future and I can't be the one to screw it up for him. His parents are atheists and very accepting.

I could raise a baby. But, I have such high hopes for my future. I want to be a pathologist. In freshman year I took AP anatomy. I have an internship set up. I would make a good parent, but j don't know if I'm ready.

I have no idea how to tell my mom. She'll be so angry. She won't let me get an abortion or give the baby up for adoption. My boyfriends mom could take me, but I don't know if she legally can. I live in Maryland.

I haven't told anyone. I need help. I don't know what to do and my mind is going a million miles a minute. My dad is dead so he can't help me. Please just help me figure out my options and what would be best.

TLDR: got pregnant. No one knows. I don't want to ruin my and my boyfriends future. If my mom finds out, I'm raising the baby. What do I do? Who should I tell? I need advice. My mind is racing and I can't think straight.

3rq3rq,19,2015-11-05,She cheated on me...,okburner1,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/3rq3rq/she_cheated_on_me/,"I met a girl on OKCupid in September last year. We hit it off pretty quickly and began a relationship in November (on her birthday actually). I was so happy with her. She came down to meet my family over Christmas Break, and I thought things were great. We both loved each other, or so I thought (she said ""I love you"" first even). 

In March, our sex life had a downturn. I would ask her what was wrong, but she would just get upset, cry, and say, ""I don't know."" I still loved her very much and thought we would eventually figure out what was wrong. I wanted to talk about our problems and find a solution that made us both happy. I loved her so much; I couldn't imagine she was lying to me.

This continued until May. As far as I knew, we both stil loved each other. She certainly made me believe she loved me. Our sex life wasn't what I wanted it to be, but I loved her. I was willing to wait and try to solve the issue. In hindsight, I should've seen the red flags.

I moved out of state for a couple months for an internship. It wasn't permanent, and we both knew that. I was coming back, and we would pick up right where we left off. While I was gone, I flew back for to go to a wedding with her. She came out to visit me on my birthday. She lost her wallet the night before she was supposed to fly out. I figured out how she could get on the plane without her license (she had a valid passport, which obviously is enough) and paid for her bags to come out. I paid for everything while she was visiting.

Finally, the internship was done, and I was so excited to get back to her. I missed her so much. I enjoyed my internship and could handle being away from her, but I was so excited to get back to her. When I got back, everything got back to normal. Our sex life was still the same, but I didn't care. I missed her more than anything, and I was so happy just to hold her again. One night, we were at her house watching TV. She got a text. She didn't have the number saved in her phone, so there wasn't a name. I don't read her texts, but she opened it right in front of me, so I saw it. I can't remember what it said exactly, but it was something to the effect of ""Would you like to go out again sometime?""

I didn't know what to think. I did everything I could to convince myself it was nothing, that I was imagining things. I finally couldn't take it anymore and looked up her OKCupid profile. It was VERY active. It said she was single. All the info on it was up-to-date. I was devastated. I confronted her about it.

It turns out she had been seeing other people. She said she had been having doubts about us since March (something she had never told me, something I never realized). She said she was dating other people to explore her options and see what she wanted. I couldn't believe it. One of the first things she said when I confronted her about this was ""when I tell you I love you, I don't want you to doubt it.""

After I confronted her about this, I spent a few days away from her. I was hurt, but I was definitely still in love with her. In hindsight, I should've ended right there, but I was a fool. I eventually reached out to her again and told her I still wanted to be with her. I wasn't perfect and needed second chances, so I gave her a second chance. We didn't even make it another week.

She came over to my place one night. I made us dinner. She fell asleep on the couch. I went to bed without her. She eventually got in the bed to me, which woke me up. Her phone was right there in her back pocket. I'm still not proud of what I did, but I went through her phone.

The first thing I did was try to find the texts to the guy she was texting when I first got suspicious. He had invited her stay over after one of their dates, but she declined. That was relieving, but I wanted to know more. A few weeks earlier, one of her friends came over to her house while I was there to talk to her about some personal problems. She wanted me to go to her room so they could have some privacy (it turns out she had brought dates around this friend and was trying to hide me from him, so he didn't realize she had a bf). I did as she asked because I thought it was a reasonable request. She came to bed awhile later in her underwear, which I scared me a little, but I dismissed my fears. I read her texts with this friend and found where they were talking about a guy she went out with that she went out with that she liked, but who didn't feel the same way about her.

I went to find the texts with this person and found what would end our relationship. ""I wish you wouldn't have had sex with me if you didn't want something more with me."" I was blown away. This went against everything I thought I knew about this girl. I thought she was loyal. I thought she loved me.

I woke her up immediately and confronted her. She admitted to it, and I made her sleep on the couch. The next morning I talked to her, and she told me about the doubts she had been having since March. She said she just wasn't sexually attracted to me anymore. She said if a relationship was a 100 piece puzzle, I was 99 pieces. I ended things immediately.

This all happened two months ago, just as we were reaching 10 months together. In a few days, it would've been a year together. I just can't believe all this happened. I did everything I could to make her happy. She is a recovering anorexic, and I did everything I could to support her. I cooked her meals, because cooking was triggering to her. I went with her to support groups and reunions at her treatment center.

I've been so miserable lately. I don't know where else to turn. I loved this girl, and I feel like I just got tossed aside like I didn't matter. I would've understood if things weren't working out, and she wanted to break up in March. If she had talked to me about how she was feeling, I would've understood. But she didn't do that. She kept me on her hook because of all the things I did for her. She let me believe that she really loved me, but it was all a lie.

I want to be over her so badly, but I'm not. I still miss her so much. She cheated on me with THREE other guys and already has yet another new guy. She moved past me so quickly. I feel like the biggest loser. I want her to answer for what she's done, but she never will. This new guy will never know, and she'll get away with it. Meanwhile, I'm all alone and miserable.

I just don't know what to do."

I'm almost 23. I graduated with a bachelor's in Biology. Back then the plan was go to PA school. But in my heart I knew I was only going for a clinician type job because of what others wanted for me. 


Essentially I've been forcing this path down my throat and have no clue about my other options. 


I finally got over this tunnel vision I had for something I really didn't want and decided to look into new things. Figured health care is so vast and there has to be a place for me. 

BACKSTORY OVER

I've looked into MHA and the program sounds as if I can be a good fit for it. But the more I look it up the more confused I get. 

What types of internship opportunities am I looking for? 

What type of job do I want? There seems to be so many options and I don't know what the best ones are. 

I hate to say it but once I'm in grad school I'll be screwed in soo much more debt so I really need to try to make the most of it and go on a path with the biggest payoff. 

If anyone has any advice on maybe their own experience or how I can go about finding more solid information I am extremely grateful. Thank you.

3rqt64,12,2015-11-06,Feeling extreme guilt of quitting the SAHM thing...,anotherguiltymom,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/3rqt64/feeling_extreme_guilt_of_quitting_the_sahm_thing/,"Hi, new here. Need to hear opinions besides my mother's who is making me feel awful about this situation.
So, I've been a SAHM mother for 6 years now, I have a 5 yo, 3 yo and 1.5 yo. I actually have 8 years without working because I didn't have a green card when we first moved here. Anyway, going back to work was never in my radar... I thought because of my employment gap, that I would never find a decent paying job that would justify childcare expenses. But a month ago I saw by chance an ad from a tech company that is looking to hire more women through a special program. So I entered the contest and was very surprised to make it to the second round and now I found out I've been selected.  Apparently I would be taking software dev classes full time for a year combined with an internship and then I would very likely be hired full time if all goes well...
Part of me wants to scream in excitement and I just can't imagine what it would feel like to actually have a life of my own again. 
But then I remember my kiddos. Will they miss me terribly and be miserable? My 3 yo will probably be mad at me, he is so sensitive but will always act mad when he is sad. And my 1.5 yo is so little to be away from me the whole day, isn't she? 
I already have a lady I trust with my life who I could hire as a full time nanny... so I'm not concerned about their safety and physical well-being. But I have extreme guilt about doing this (I have 3 days to give my final decision). I would be paid 45k for the training period and 95k when hired... which I know is beyond awesome, but we don't really need need the money, my husband makes double that and we live comfortably. Sure, it would be nice to pay the mortgage early or take extravagant vacations, or save more towards college... but honestly we could also just pay the mortgage in time, take modest vacations and save just enough for college if I stay home. If I did this it would be a personal, selfish? decision. And yet I long for it so much.
I honestly love my kids, and I love spending time with them. But I SUCK as a SAHM. I hate doing housework, I'll confess I have a weekly cleaning service :S and I probably let them watch too much tv. I honestly think this lady (who often babysits them and they love each other) would do a better job at it. But I'm their mom and they need me? or so my mother keeps telling me. 
OMG I'm so torn. Some perspective, please?

3rqwfe,3,2015-11-06,I (M/22) need help writing a letter to my brother (M/18)...,fatherbrotherson,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rqwfe/i_m22_need_help_writing_a_letter_to_my_brother_m18/,"I want to write a letter to my younger brother, and I need help. Sorry for the incoming text, but it's a long story.


Backstory:
I'm the middle kid of three, my parents stayed together ""for the kids."" My dad is a sociopath. We are all secretive, self interested people; on top of that, we're bad communicators and we treat criticism terribly. My sister and I were never extremely close, but we got along well. I never got along with my brother. I was smarter than my brother and sister honestly (please don't attribute this to a /r/Iamverysmart post based on this one statement.) My family always knew that I was going to be the one to float away when I got old enough. 


My dad spent a lot of time working, my mom stayed at home after we got a little older. My sister and I spent our early years with babysitters, our family was more financially stretched than my brother would ever know. We didn't grow up right socially, we became secretive because of a shame based household. I spent a lot of time cultivating friendships outside of the house. I was a shit head to my brother when I was little. I bullied him,  I always mentioned that I was better than him. I chose my friends over him often; I didn't want to be his friend and it probably devastated him. He never developed any social skills, he couldn't ignore the domestic problems and carry on with his own life. He needed someone to look up to, and I wasn't there.


I started college, my sister moved out and had a kid. My brother was left alone with my parents and without started smoking weed, which became a problem with our parents. He didn't achieve academically, fell in with the wrong crowd, went to different schools, and everything else that comes with that lifestlyle. He was fed a culture of machismo, that loving someone is ""gay,"" to always be the man. 

I was involved in an incident where I had my brother visit me for a while when I switched apartments and I drove him all the way back home after he locked me out for hours after a long day of work during the summer. His drug problem got worse, he started snorting meth low-key. I had been smoking weed also since high school graduation, but I never let it interfere with my academic success, which my brother knew about but no one else did, adding to his resentment (Yes, I felt like a huge hypocrite.)


I felt awful about it, I wasn't able to reconcile with him until half a year later, and even after that we didn't talk much.

Fast forward a year and a half. I came back home this past summer for the first time in three years, and I noticed things were bad to say the least. 

Side note:
My dad, my brother, and I have anger problems, a lot of hate towards everything within ourselves. It's been one of the greatest challenges of my life to control what I feel is a base part of myself, but I feel like it's something I have managed to cope with my time away from home, not fully; but it's a progress thing. I have had four more years of life experience to grow as a human, and my brother hasn't.

He has a lot of resentment towards me built up, because I didn't treat him right when we were kids, because of our parents, because of life, etc. A huge part is that to this day my siblings think that I am the favorite, something I myself resent, because I feel that I shouldn't be chastised for trying to maintain healthy relationships with everyone while we all get older. I don't like being called favorite just because I am trying to do the right thing by going to school and trying to make something of myself. I would argue the opposite, everyone in the family figured that I would be fine.


This summer came to a head when my dad had to call the cops on my brother twice in a day because he came at me. His anger and drug use got the best of him. He screamed at me at the top of his lungs with such hate, I saw such ugliness in him; The second time I hadgoaded him into it, because I had a plan.

I could file a temporary restraining order against my brother, my mom wouldn't have any reason to stay at the house with my dad, and she could start fresh at a place we were secretly setting up for her. My brother would stay with my sister after he got out, and everyone would be seperate. I thought that the sacrifice of the relationship with my brother was worth splitting everyone up. Regarldless, I felt awful after everything went through.

I went back to school in the fall, and my brothers drug usage got worse. My mom tried to get him into a rehab center that my dad forcefully took him out of right before he turned 18. After, he moved back in with my dad. My dad got diagnosed with diabetes, and honestly; my pops health is declining quickly. My dad can't take care of these family situations, and if he could, he is adamant that he won't kick my brother out of the house.His philosophy is reactive instead of proactive, wait until something big happens.


How do I feel about my brother?


I can't support his choices, I don't have respect for people that can't change themselves, that can't move past things. I don't like when he plays victim, I think that my sister and I had it harder than he did; it's something I can't comprehend. But I realize that a childhood is most of his life, and it had a huge impact on who he is.

I am going back in January for an internship. I want to patch things up, not even fully, just a foothold that I can work with. Us being bad communicators, I want to write him a letter.

I want to apologize for the summer, for him to know that it was the only way I thought we could fix things. I want him to know I'm sorry, that I love him, that I'm a shithead, but I'm not who I was from when we were kids, and that his lifestlyle is hurting the family. I want him to see that he shouldn't want this lifestlyle for himself, that it's okay for people to care about him/be cared for.

I don't know how to effectively get that across, to be critical, apologetic, and loving at the same time. I need some help reddit, any advice/insight would be graciously accepted. I realize that I will probably receive a lot of criticism for my previous rationale/actions. And I can only say that I hope anyone that reads this can put themselves in my situation.

3rrsjj,5,2015-11-06,[Budgeting] Review of my finances,Baggotry,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3rrsjj/budgeting_review_of_my_finances/,"Hey /r/personalfinance,

So I graduated college in May, took a well paying 3-month internship right after, and in August started my first real job. My parents paid for all of my college (*unbeknownst to me, I thought I was paying for the last two years*), and revealed at the end that they had put all of my money from my two years at Kroger during high school and two years as a grader during college into my current Nationwide banking money market account. Along with some contributions from them, I've got about double the amount of a 6-month emergency fund in it. I've also got a few grand in my checking/savings account with a local credit union, and a few other small investments they set up for me that I don't know the exact amount of off hand (*just finished moving out and am working to get finances nailed down*).

Here's my monthly budget: https://paste.ee/p/p1PSZ#

It includes what I spend month to month along with money I'm setting aside for various savings. I have my monthly spending cash a little higher than I expect to in the future for now as I am still buying furnishings for my apartment like toaster oven, chairs, etc. 

My parents bought me my 2008 Hyundai Sonata a few years ago and it's 100% paid off as they just bought it straight up. I'm also able to stay on their health plan for another year or two so I don't have to budget monthly expenses for that.

Anyways, does everything look okay? Am I saving enough? Should I do something with my emergency fund other than having it sit in a Money Market account? Currently I have my pay DD'd into my MM fund and then I use it to send money to my checking account to pay off my CC and then I pay my rent and utilities directly from the MM.

Thanks."
3rs0pe,2,2015-11-06,I am just a “Cap” looking to partner with another “Cap.”,boyphilipose,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/3rs0pe/i_am_just_a_cap_looking_to_partner_with_another/,"Elon,

I am writing today because I want to work with you. I don’t worship you or idolize you or anything like that. I am not “trolling” you, as some kid falsely posted online. In fact, I wasn’t really aware what was happening. Someone sent me a message, that people were talking bad about me. I thought ok, I would look at it later. I was more focused on trying to raise money for my company. Only when I got home a few days later, then I fully realized what was going on. I was upset by being portrayed online as a negative person. I am not.

I am just a “Cap” looking to partner with another “Cap.” That’s it, plain and simple. You are a “Cap” by the way, short for Capitalist. You said before, “How hard it is to run 2 companies.” In fact, you complained about it here and there for years. I can see now though you are complaining less, which is good but still. I don’t want you to complain anymore. I am here to help.

I had to ask you at the Tesla Shareholder’s meeting because I didn’t know any other way. I apologize for that. I have been trying to reach you now for 2 years, ever since 2012 shareholder meeting. I wanted to tell you that I could come on board and help you build the company. I have applied thru normal HR channels, for positions, but nothing positive as a result. I don’t have a perfect resume or experience. Even though I went to college for many years, that didn’t result in anything great; only average positions at best. I have been trying for many years to get promoted or get ahead somehow, but nothing. No real opportunities. I have been turned down several times just because of lack of BS Degree, even though I have 120 credits since 2005.
I hate when people assume stuff about me and spread lies. This has been going on most of my adult life.

It would have been a normal request of asking you for a work position. But right before, I talked to Jeff Evanson of Investor Relations. I told him the extra question I was going to ask you and he said, “This is not the place for that.” I told Jeff, “How much of a genius I was.” Jeff responded something like, “Elon has good people around him.” After some more words, that was it. I thought, how many “Caps” does Elon have around him? At that point I became frustrated. I thought when do things get better for me? I am trying to do good things for others. The shareholders thought I was taking up their time, they didn’t realize I am here to give them time.

My 2nd question was supposed to be, “I would like to speak to you for a few minutes afterwards on how I can help Tesla. You would benefit personally and Tesla would as a whole.” But since I was frustrated, an emotional plea came out. And I am sorry for that. I had to say something. You said, “There is no Vice Chairman position.” Well, you know, we can always create one.

I felt disappointed, but got over it and went to lunch afterwards. I had a good meal and time with members of the Tesla Motors Club. There is a cool picture online. I am on the left. During lunch, it felt a little awkward. I told people that I was genius like Steve Jobs. I am no better than anyone. I am just beyond most people. I know you can relate.

I respect Jeff Evanson and what he has done in IR. He has grown as a person, since meeting him 2 years ago. He is doing a great job. But he didn’t realize how much I was at the bottom.

To be honest, I am actually a high level person on the inside; even though I look like a low level person on the outside. If you speak to me for five minutes on the phone, you can see that. If you meet with me for 15 minutes, you can see how much of very rich mind I am. You would be proud to know me. One skill you have is that can you assess people quickly, so can I.

Recently, people have painted me online as some “nut job” or something, far from it. I am actually pretty brilliant and I am hoping one day, someone realizes that. Maybe you will.

I want to give you a little history about myself. And then talk more about Tesla and what I can bring to the company. So allow me to do that.

I actually started on the Internet, back in Fall of 1995. I was a student at Temple University. About the same year as you, I believe, made a webpage. It was cool. I thought about making something like Yahoo.com. In fact I did, and had the site on Temple’s webserver. It got a good number of hits, like 60 a day. I was really interested in the website, not really interested in school. I remember picking up a copy of Bill Gates book, “The Road Ahead”. I read a few pages and thought, “If he can drop out of school and build a business, Why can‘t I?” Well I quickly put the book down and ran off to CIS Class. Later, I got into some web design but more trading stocks.

Over the years, I wanted to drop out of college many times, but everyone told me to stay in school. So I did. I focused on school mostly rather than my work. My big mistake, but I did what I was “told to do.” I don’t listen to people who “play it safe” anymore. I have done that my whole life and have gone nowhere.
When I look back on it today, that was potentially a $10 Million business that I could have sold and started my entrepreneurial drive. It was the late 1990s and the Internet was hot. I missed out on the Internet revolution simply because of poor advice from others.

Forward to 2004, the year I started on my self-education. School education has not really taken me anywhere. This is where my real “education and enlightenment” began. I read over 20 books that year: money, investing, business, etc…I also learned that people may learn differently than others and that not everyone will pass certain subjects as easily as others.

That year is also when I became a “genius.” I pursued music ventures that year in my company. For years now, I continued to learn. Many times I tried to find good work, but it was never available to me. Late 2008, I started to work in an Internet company as a Customer Sales Rep. The work was fine. Later, there was an opening to become a supervisor. I applied, but was turned down. The reason? The other candidate had a degree.

I experienced this many times in other companies being turned down on a regular basis. I remember studying success and asking myself, “What would make me most happy?” I turned back to investing, something I started in college in 1997, but only started to really learn about in 2004.

Since 2004, I have been investing in stocks, making some money along the way. I left my storage company job in 2012, where I was employed in customer service. Again, I always tried to move up in the company. I told my boss how much I learned on my own, but was turned down again for a possible promotion. When you are labeled as an average worker, you stay one I guess.

I am nothing but average. Not only has my mind expanded since 2004, I also have learned more by entrepreneurial experiences. As much as I would like to work at a higher position, I would be given an entry-level position, at best. People always told me I am not qualified. And that always bothered me. They didn’t realize who they were speaking to. I admit I was more in a low financial position, so it was difficult to try more entrepreneurial activities. I had made mistakes, but we learn from them and move on.

I just recently had a financial setback. Trading stocks is stupid and eventually leads to losses. I was better off managing stocks. But that wasn’t taking me anywhere, either. It is funny I actually grossed more from the stock market, than I have with my college education.

I actually had 1000 shares of Tesla at $24. But I listened to others, especially that JP fellow; when I should have listened to you more (my fellow Cap). Today, I admit I have 100 shares. I learned more now it is about long-term partnering, rather than short-term trading.

I always told myself, I can always do “investment management” if the job ever came. But hasn’t. I asked myself about “picking stocks”, but something would be missing in my life.

Fast forward to today, 2014. I realize now so much how the world works. I have a much better understanding about money and business. My mind is clearer than ever. I am a capitalist. I am here to build and create in big ways. I have more street smarts now than book smarts.

In my own company, I wanted to solve a “major problem” in our society. If people knew what problem I was trying to solve, they would be giving me a “hug” right now, instead of trying to “hang me” out to dry. I care a lot about society and the world. I do appreciate some of the support I received, but much more criticism. People think that “1 minute video” is all me. That don’t realize how much of a whole person I am. They would be surprised on who they are talking about.

Some have criticized my “College Truth 2” videos. They have useful information. So what if I act a little goofy in them. I believe Richard Branson said, “You want to take your work seriously, but you don’t have to take yourself seriously.” How many people act serious, but yet don’t do serious things?

Now some realize that I am not some “nut.” To my critics out there, “No one on this planet could ever bring me down with their words. I am too strong on the inside. Your words may hurt, but I will still be standing.”

What I started doing for my company is “stealth recruiting.” The problem with a normal interview is that people are on their “best behavior” not their “actual behavior.” You want to see people in their normal space and then evaluate accordingly. Eventually I am going to need team members for my company. So I started going around to retail stores and started to look for people. I would interact with them, see who they are, see what they are about, ask questions, etc... In the future, to the ones I like, I would offer them a Round 1 interview. Many are college grads and I know they would like to do something better; even if it is just an internship for now.

I am doing something in the “product design” field. One reason I wanted to work at Tesla is because the design process is the same. Tesla designed a “sophisticated product” and brought it to market. I intend to do the same for Royalus Design; though it would be a much “simpler product” that I would bring to market but sell in high volume. Either way the process is the same. I get to learn “production methods” and you have a “true cap” in front of you ready to help build and create. There is a huge revolution coming and I plan to be part of that. I missed the last one.

There is also “future vehicle development” that I am interested in. I am studying “flight dynamics”, so the “Model S” or future Tesla cars or planes can be flight ready. That is where the future of transport is going and we want Tesla to be ready for it.
I want to share a story with you. While in CA that week, I went to raise money for my company. I saw a person exiting a “Model S.” Ok great I will park by and say Hi. I asked this person, “How do you like the car?” The person told me that this car was a rental and his was in the shop. Apparently his Tesla suffered a major failure. Wow! That is odd I thought. I looked at the Model S rental car concerned, “Why is this happening?” This is unacceptable. It has been 2 years the car has been in production, since 2012. Something like that got my attention and it bothered me. We talked some more. He then gave me his card and I left. He was running a startup.

Also that week, I went to the SolarCity annual meeting. That was a short but useful meeting of good information. So much, it made me want to buy more shares; though I am short on cash at the moment. A gentleman was ready to fund me some cash, when I told him I was working on something big. That felt good when someone was willing to take a chance on you.

What I bring to Tesla is very simple. I am a “cap genius.” I am a person who has very high aptitude and ability. I want to use that at your company. I am a right-brain genius by the way; a philosopher and entrepreneur. I am someone who brings a different perspective to the table. I am a thinker. I think most of the day. I also have great vision. I have much integrity, intelligence, and energy. I know you can relate to that.

“When you can see the future, you go for it. You don’t waste time with people who can’t.” You know about that Musk.

Being a leader is bringing out the best in everyone to achieve a common purpose. I believe I can do that well. I would like to be “given the chance” to do that at Tesla. Where I am at today is probably where you were 10 years ago. So you can understand where I am coming from. I can learn fast and become a great contributor.

Society will get better when more “societal capitalists” come online. I am one of them. Me being “offline” does not help society at all. Help me come online Musk. Help me come online.

I know there have been times you hired someone, who you thought was going to be “great” and they turned out to be “not so great.” I ask you do the reverse here and hire someone who looks “not so great” that can turn out to be “great.” This is “2nd look” I am asking for Elon.

If you haven’t done so already, please look over my resume and book. I gave a copy to Deepak Ahuja after the shareholder meeting. Deepak was considerate enough to speak to me for a moment.

The position, I would come in now as, would be “Consultant to CEO.” I would be your extra eyes and ears while overseeing various projects and duties (like public speaking, presentations, talking to investors, media events, etc...). I could probably free up a third of your time. You would have a very rich and advanced mind looking after the company. I would report to you directly.

I believe you stated you spend 2 days at Tesla. How would you like to spend 1 day at Tesla? or 0 days? Bring me on board and in time that could happen. I know you wouldn’t just hand over your company to just anyone. I wouldn’t either. But I am not just anyone.

My last question to you Elon, is this? Warren Buffet has Charlie Munger as his partner. Larry Page has his Sergey Brin. Who does Elon Musk have?
You could have Roy Philipose, as your partner.

There is an “equal” in front of you today Elon Musk and you would want to “embrace” that and not dismiss it like others have.

I want to thank you Elon, for your time and consideration. Please contact me either way.

Yours, Roy “Cap” Philipose Philosopher/Entrepreneur from Philadelphia

It still keeps crossing my mind.  I'm using the rubber band to help,  which is kind of helping.  

But it's almost every day I'm thinking I just wanna do it see how it feels.  I know I'm depressed and having anxiety issues and busy.  But because I've never cut I have no idea why I suddenly want to.  

I've self harmed in the past via hitting my head,  but these thoughts almost feel like it's taking over?  If anyone can clue me in as to why I have this urge all of a sudden that would help I think. 

I'm trying my best to stay away from sharp things.  I told my SO and a friend and will contact them if I'm really close to doing it (it helps to be held accountable by other people so far) 

But really it's stressing me out,  I'm waiting on a therapist to work this out as well.   I know I'm not suicidal,  I'm just really tired and balled up with anxiety and overworked (working 12 days in a row for internship and work).  I'm also sad and gahhh idk..."
3rslxo,4,2015-11-06,My job does not train people well.,EveryUNIsTaken,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3rslxo/my_job_does_not_train_people_well/,"I would in animal care. I am one of the four people working in the ENTIRE facility during my shift, and it has literally thousands of animals. 

That's all I'm going to say about where I work. 


I graduated from college in December with a short internship and field school under my belt. I was hired at my current job in April.

I started training for my actual job in July.

They needed someone in this position ASAP. So I was pushed through ""training"" after ""training,"" week after week. Everything that wasn't supposed to be taught or you weren't supposed to have permission to do until you've worked there 6 months, I did before I had been there 5 months.

These ""training"" classes were usually a 30 min to hour long powerpoint of what to do in ___ situation. Then we were set free.


Well, yesterday I was asked to do something that I had never physically done before. I honestly do not even remember being ""trained"" on it. 

I told my supervisor, manager, and lead this. 

They said to do it anyway. My lead gave me instructions about what to do.

I followed my leads instructions. 

Well, long story short, my lead didn't give me the FULL instructions. Everything ended up being perfectly fine, but it COULD have been bad. 

Today I get an email saying that I did do this training almost four months ago. 

Ok.

Clearly, I forgot. 

But the company I work for accuses you first and asks questions later. And I forgot really isn't that great of an excuse, but it's true. I have no memory of this ""training."" But quite honestly, I was pushed through so fast with the promise that someone would be there to help me when the time comes that I didn't worry too much about it. 

On top of that, it was four months ago. 

And it was NEVER touched upon again.


To give an example, it would be kind of like giving an inexperienced person step by step instructions of how to do sutures on a small cut, never talking about it again, and then four months later leaving you alone to do it on a live being. Then, when you get nervous and ask for a second opinion about your sutures, then say, ""Well, you were trained. You should be able to do it no problem. Why can't you do it?""

(This is not what happened to me, but the principal is the same.)


And this has happened time and time again. I was ""trained"" to do this 4, 5, or even 6 months ago (out of the 7 I've been here), was never followed up on it or given a hands on experience with a guide, and then one day at random told to do it. Then, even when I tell them that I don't have the training (or in this case, apparently don't remember it), they tell me to do it anyway! What. The. Hell.

I'm thrown into a new situation and told to figure it out with LIVE beings around me. It's ASKING for something bad to happen, in my opinion. So far, I've been able to make it through. Things didn't always go 100% the way they should have, but everyone was alright in the end. I figure it out one way or another. It's really in my head thinking, ""Let's try this and cross our fingers.""

It is giving me the worst anxiety. I'm afraid to open my email a lot of the time because I'm constantly afraid that I've done something wrong. Every time I'm asked to go to a ""meeting"" with no details for what it's about, I panic. What have I done? I sit there and rack my brain of everything I did recently, second guessing my every decision.

And I care immensely about these animals. I would never want to hurt them or miss something out of my own ignorance.

And if I asked to be ""trained"" AGAIN in something that I'm not 100% clear on, it's ""Why didn't you get it the first time?"" and you're seen as incompetent. This is not just me this happens to. 

I do not want to quit. I'd have to move back in with my parents if I did. It would be only seven months on my resume. But this company is ridiculous in more ways than one. There's always an exception to every rule, the rules are constantly changing and no one can keep up, communication is terrible, they're cutting our hours next year, they never stay true to their word about most everything, always accusing people before listening to them, they don't fix problems until they get fined for it (then it's the lowest staffs fault for not doing anything about it and they find people to fire, even though that staff brought it to their attention MULTIPLE times and they chose to ignore it), and I could really just rant forever about how little management really does and then stabs you in the back about it later. 

It is completely mismanaged. 

I'm looking for a new job. 

I just don't feel like this is what work is supposed to be like. 

Yes, I've had a job before. There were times of stress, but not complete panic every day. And I'm not the only one who complains about this. I am not the only one looking for a new job. We just aren't meant for this role. And I think that's ok. It doesn't mean I've failed completely, I think."
3rsty8,152,2015-11-06,Family Harassed Me After Mother's Death,reinearianne,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3rsty8/family_harassed_me_after_mothers_death/,"I’m not going to forget the day of my mother’s funeral.

My mother died on June 18, 2010. She was forty-nine years old. The official cause of death was determined to be complications of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. She had been in a wheelchair for years due to a spinal injury that was further complicated by a botched spinal surgery. Her health deteriorated rapidly when she became wheelchair bound.

Mom was also a hard woman to work with. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during my parent’s divorce mom was known to lash out at those closest to her. Her entire family, including myself, was estranged from her in her final years.

I had just returned home after a six month long internship at Our Lady of the Rock Monastery in Washington State. I had just bought a car two days before so I could surprise my mom with a visit that weekend. I was eating a bowl of chocolate ice-cream and enjoying a glass of rum when my phone rang.

I didn’t get a knock at the door from a sheriff’s officer when mom died. I had posted my resume online earlier the day she died. The district attorney’s office did a name search for me online and miraculously found the document with my phone number. My world stopped as the coroner tried to explain to me that my mother was gone.

In the following days I quickly learned that a death will bring out the worst in a family.

As I cleaned my mom’s apartment I tried to carefully go through her books and papers. I was trying to figure out who she was and what she had been up to while I had been away at my internship. I found her bible, with pages dog-eared, and decided to have a Catholic mass as I believed she was in the process of coming back to the church.

At the time I was about to start the confirmation process at my church, St. Agnes.

Meanwhile, her half-sister and my brother were haphazardly throwing bags and boxes of her belongings into the apartment complex dumpster. Her half-sister didn’t want a funeral for my mother. She felt a backyard BBQ with family would suffice as a memorial. I didn’t go along with my family’s wishes to keep mom’s final farewell a hushed up event.

I wanted my mother’s funeral to be at my church, St. Agnes, in San Francisco. It was a beautiful church full of close friends at the time. It would be a simple affair with a few flowers, mom’s urn (she had instructed me to cremate her remains during an estate planning session), and a few pictures.

Her half-sister informed me no one in the family would attend. No one wanted to deal with the traffic in San Francisco. So I compromised. I booked a church, St. John Vianney, down the street from my aunt’s home in San Jose.

In the days before the funeral my family stopped talking to me. I had vented to my other aunt, my uncle’s ex-wife, about the fallout and drama from mom’s death. She tried to talk to my mom’s half-sister which threw gasoline on the fire. Next thing I knew I had all of my aunts, uncle, and grandmother telling me what a horrible person I was for discussing “family business” with an ex-member of the family. All of our communications were via text after this as no one would answer their phones for me for any reason.

I tried to place an obituary in the San Jose Mercury News with the date and time of the funeral. It took me several days to get through to a live person at the paper instead of their online form. I was shocked when I found out my aunt had already run an obituary inviting her high school friends to the backyard BBQ she had wanted for mom.

I was homeless, couch surfing after returning from the monastery, so I couldn’t afford to run another obituary and also pay for the priest’s time. I sucked it up.

The morning of the funeral? I was awakened at 8am by a hang-up call. Then another. And another. My family began crank calling me every few minutes then hanging up the phone when I answered. These crank calls went on well into the morning.

Finally, after 10am, my aunts started texting me. They accused me of giving them the wrong time for the funeral. My own mother’s funeral. I had scheduled the funeral for 1pm in the afternoon. I had told my family this. But according to a “friend” of theirs they said the church was booked for 10am.

They accused me of being a monster for trying to punk them about the time for my own mother’s funeral.

At the time I pled with them to have some common sense. Looking back I shouldn’t have. I should have blocked all of their numbers and never bothered with them again. But I wanted my mom’s family at her final farewell.

In the end it was an empty funeral. At 1pm in the afternoon I read the dog-eared passages during the mass. My former foster mom was there to support me. So were my two godsons. It was a small affair with just myself, the priest, my adopted family, and the urn with some flowers.

After the funeral the church allowed me to play my mom’s favorite rock and roll CD on their PA system. Mom had wanted a rock and roll funeral and I’m glad I was able to pull it off. Even with all of the drama."

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

So as the title suggests, I interviewed for EYs FSO Audit practice for my first round interview and I received an invitation for an office interview in two weeks. However, after learning more about the FSO Technology Advisory Program (TAP), I'm more interested in their work/services and I firmly believe that I would be a good fit in that group. I have a strong resume, had worked with an EY Advisory team at my past internship, and relevant work experience. 


I'd appreciate if anyone could shed light on: 
Has anyone had any experience with changing service lines for final round interviews? How did you approach the recruiter? 

Although I don't think it matters at this stage of the process, I was referred by an Advisory partner and the recruiter was very proactive in making sure I applied to the firm. Would it be appropriate to reach out to the partner and see if he could recommend me for the Advisory group? 


Any advice or suggestions is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Thanks for taking the time to read. This is not a troll post.

I am 20 years old and will be graduating from my college in 1 year, I will (hopefully) be graduating with a degree in Business Management.

Here is my overall financial situation...

Transportation: Personal vehicle paid off

Education Debt: None, College was paid through Family's 529 plan

Retirement: Roth IRA ~$40,000, it is paid through my Family's company, I am listed as an employee for tax reasons. It will be maxed out every year for the unforeseeable future.

UTMA: $140,000, upon graduation from College it will be funded to $250,000

Trusts: Recently gifted through my family (unexpectedly) $850,000.  I have chosen my trustees and it is being set up.

I have a job set up after college through my internship.  My reason for posting here is because this amount of money is overwhelming.

At what age should my younger siblings learn about our Family's wealth? 

Should I buy a house out-right after college? Or should I get a mortgage and pay it off month by month? 

How do I make this money grow over time and ensure that I don't irresponsibly blow it off over the course of say ~10 years.  I am naturally frugal but am worried that this wealth could disappear over my life time.  

Should I take the trust (which is invested), and take out say ~$30,000 a year to supplement my salary after college? Or should I let it sit and take out larger sums later in life?

Thank you."
3runcb,20,2015-11-06,Kind of feeling stuck.,kwhali,auckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/3runcb/kind_of_feeling_stuck/,"So quick background, I completed NCEA level 1, almost level 2(off by 2 credits in english/maths I think, I was in the first generation/year of when NCEA was introduced). I was in Year 13 doing level 3 and repeating english/maths for level 2 to pass that again, mid year I had to drop out as working to pay rent/living expenses due to situation. Studied at Natcoll, stuck through it but failed, went to Media Design School, and got expelled(It was clear I was going to fail, the reason had something to do with coming in a few minutes too late if I remember right, better stats for them?), I worked for about 5-6 years then went back to the same course at Media Design School, passed that with a bit of a struggle, decided to advance my studies and get the graduate(following year after graduating this became a degree). Kept working at the old job wasn't able to find work related to my studies even with my qualifications. Which near the end of I was diagnosed with ADD(ADHD-PI) at age of 26, the medication made a huge difference for me taking much of the struggle away, I performed a lot better at work(I'd often lose jobs for not doing as well as expected).

I later experienced anxiety attacks and fell into severe depression which lead to unemployment. I tried to avoid WINZ by using what little savings I had to get by, but a year later that was empty, I had tried to start a career in software testing, WINZ placed me in a course that they funded the $2k, this was an industry where jobs were in demand apparently, the course was poor and I was made fun of for being 'wrong', but I had been in touch with professionals in the community and was apparently right. I stopped participating in the end due to the unprofessionalism and what appeared to be cheap labor with no guidance and of questionable nature. I self taught myself online and when sitting the exam passed 32/40(26/40 passing mark) for the certification. There were no efforts to assist in employment despite this, I think WINZ was wasting their money. Few months of job hunting I took up another course that offered free transitional training for programming and that was mostly a good experience, the idea was you'd start paying a weekly fee til 5k was paid once you got a job in the industry through their help, this didn't pan out though.

From then on I decided education providers are just costing me debt(about 50k in debt now), the qualifications aren't helping me at all, any applications would turn me down for lack of experience even entry roles that list no experience needed, this seems more of a blanket reason. I took up self study for web development through the past year and it's been rather intensive, I've done programming as a hobby ever since 2004, but without the qualifications HR usually rejects me saying I don't take the industry seriously by not getting a degree in compsci. Or that I lack direction/focus since I was studying graphic design, then trying software testing, and now trying to get into programming. I had a year of experience for a corporation but it was under the table and not in a language anyone hires for anymore. I've met compsci students or graduates(that weren't yet employed) and felt I'm as capable if not more at times, I rarely ever got a chance to show my knowledge/ability, even with a law firm that was taking graduates and I progressed through their interview process. Another enterprise company I interviewed through for 3 months, passing each stage to the final 5 candidates, I was not offered the junior role in the end due to experience, but offered an intern, the company was about 6 hours a day in transit there and back but I was willing to take it, however I didn't feel the intern role was clarified with what I'd be doing well enough so I asked some more questions(it sounded a bit beyond what would be expected of a typical intern role), they later changed their mind and the internship didn't go ahead.

I really do enjoy programming and think I can do well at it, but the only chance I've had was when I was exploited and that ended up costing me money rather than making me any, as well as being heavily stressful on me(possibly triggering the anxiety attacks). I'm not sure if it's burn out, but I seem to have a pattern of being able to apply myself and then for days/weeks/months I feel like I'm pressing against a wall and can't manage to be productive at all, I'm not sure if it's the current situation/environment or something else....employers won't accept long durations of that though, add in the possibility of anxiety attacks and occasional downsides of ADD and it makes me feel kind of helpless. I've had a few people suggest that I have slight asperger's traits but getting diagnosed can be expensive, ADD was about $500 or so of seeing several specialists, I don't want another label or an excuse, I'm trying to be hardworking and want to get off WINZ support if it were viable($200ish a week to get by). I don't do too well in jobs that are heavily social focused, yet I don't appear to be fast enough for more hands on jobs. Programming though, I don't really have enough experiences to know how well I fair, but with the little work I have done, I've impressed quite a few people and even know programmers who believe I'm good and sometimes come to me for advice with programming questions/problems. I can't afford to study anything, so this would seem the best career route, it's just that it can be quite mentally taxing and I really don't want to go through that experience of being exploited again(lot of work/responsibility, minimal pay). I've applied for many jobs, but just not having any luck. I think I can overcome this through more study and demonstrating these skills, it's just a considerable amount more of time/effort to achieve and it's only a maybe, I feel weight/pressure from that.

I've lived on less than 20k a year for the past decade, I'm nearing 30. I've never been on a holiday/vacation where you go travelling or anything like that, I don't mind that much, but it'd be nice to get out of the rut and make a future for myself, it feels pretty bleak atm. My qualifications/achievements might indicate to an employer of a typical job(no qualifications, fast food, stocking, pick pack, office) that I'm overqualified and would not be worth investing in, even if they did take me and I kept quiet about anxiety/semi-aspie/ADD/depression they'd probably fire me for someone more capable if I'm unable to perform well like the many times in the past. I'm pretty sure it's a different story with IT/programming but they almost always see me in a negative way it seems due to history and lack of related qualifications. I've noticed that my regular appointments with WINZ have stopped, perhaps it's the time of the year or my case manager is just giving me a break, I really did put in the effort job seeking and the 3 month interview one looked so promising(they didn't mind the lack of qualifications).

Kudos to you if you read this all, is there still hope for me? Anyone else been in this situation or able to relate? Perhaps you know something that could help that I've not yet become aware of? I'd really like something to work out for once, I must be doing something wrong."

I'm fine with playing either the older or the younger partner in any of the following prompts. I'm also up to hearing your ideas or new prompts concerning this kink. I'd also love to hear any feedback about these or any of my prompts. Here is my profile: https://redd.it/3r1a5g which has everything you could want to know about me and multiple prompts. I'll be on until 2am Central and will also respond to pms about this prompt as long as this is up.

• **Lessons Learned in the Congo**

*(FF, Agegap, Sweaty Sex)*

My parents waved goodbye as I saw them for the last time that summer as I walked through security. I was fortunate to go on a summer long internship program to the jungles of the Congo in order to observe and learn from our evolutionary cousins, the chimpanzee.

Even more exciting, I was going to be apart of a group working with world-renown primatologist, Rachel Whitehall. To say that I'm a fan of hers is a little of an understatement. Dr. Whitehall has been my idol, since a poster of her was on my wall at 14. Confident, Intelligent, *Sexy*, she was everything I hoped to become. As I sat in my small cramped seat in coach flying non-stop to Kinshasa I had no idea of what I was about to learn. I had no idea of the amazing relationship I was about to have, exploring with a woman no man, no woman, not even the earth could ever keep still.

• **Ms. Parker That Can't Be You**

*(Age Gap, Student-Teacher, Secrecy)*

It was Thursday Night at *Rumors* a small bar in pretty much the middle of nowhere. A small bar that was over 100 miles away from Ms. Parker's day job as a teacher in a local high school. Here she could dress up with the firm intention of inviting one of these lovely ladies over to the motel across the street. Here she could drink and relax and maybe find another lesbian stuck in small, rural Mississippi. Here was not where she wanted to find little Katherine Wood, one of her students.

Ms. Parker tried to ignore her, after all she was seated at the end of the dimly lit bar. She hoped the newly 18 year old would get carded and kicked out of here, however the bartender would never kick out such a cute and young looking stud. Ms. Parker then was forced to hope that Katherine wouldn't walk over to this end of the bar, wouldn't say hi, wouldn't recognize her. Yet, her hopes were dashed when in Katherine's characteristic deep voice articulated the following words, ""Ms. Parker is that you?""

• **Nadezhda's Education** 

*(First Time, Multiple Kinks, Slight Reluctance, Preferably Age Gap, Exhibition, 1960s)*

 Nadezhda's lip was trembling in the cold of the Siberian wastland at Camp 215. However, it was also trembling out of nerves. The past two years had been leading up to this ever since she volunteered to join the KGB after serving in the Red Army. Since then her training has required her to do horrible things, from killing a fellow comrade to torturing political prisoners in the gulags. But now her final training regimen would begin. She must learn how to be a proper woman, one capable of using her feminine wiles to seduce any man, any woman. That is what Nadezhda will be learning today and for the rest of the month, inside that small barracks room is the place where every Directorate Agent spends the last month of their training. A month spent engaging in various sex acts until they learn to perform them correctly, a month where they are pushed to be able to please all sorts of people, and a month where every sex act they perform is filmed and then critique by a committee of experts (I know my one exception to the exhibition rule). Nadezhda calmed herself down and then the young 20 year old opened the door, the snow falling into the foyer as she removed her large winter coat.

• **Lessons in Companionship**

*(Firefly, First Time, FF, age gap, I would prefer that at least one of us is Chinese in this rp)*

*""On Sihnon, we started training at twelve, years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned.""* It's been years since I started at the academy. Learning the arts of being a companion. At the top of my class I was ready for the next level of lessons, receiving them privately from my mentor. As with all other companions I was given the pleasure of choosing my partner, which I why I chose you. Your simply the best at your field, the prettiest flower in all of Sihnon and my favorite teacher at the academy. I had always been sort of a teacher's pet and we had developed a close relationship over my teenage years here. Now I was ready to spend even more years by your side and learning about our great and noble profession as I walk into the entry way to your quarters.

• **A More Adult Prom Night** 

*(First time, MFF (you’ll play as the married couple), slight ageplay (I’ll be 18))*

I was always the perfect girlfriend. John was so lucky to have me. At least that what the two of you always used to say to me. However, that doesn’t bring me much joy when I’m sitting here on your couch, John having sexted another girl behind my back. It was only 2 weeks before prom too. I cry in my school clothes as both of you come and comfort me. You are so sweet and kind, both of you telling me how much of an idiot he was and how much you love me….how much you want me.

• **Time-Traveler's Wife**

*(First Time, Age Gap (one of us 18, the other in their 40s)*

You come out of nowhere into my room late one night. Standing there a complete stranger to me, you tell me your name and you're my spouse. I want to panic and scream but something about your presence calms me, you seem familiar, safe even. After some time talking with each other, you telling me about my future self, I begin to see what I must see in you in the future. That night you take me for the first time (for me anyways) and as you disappear back into the time stream I count down the days until you'll return again. 

*(We can also reverse this scene where the time traveler arrives in their future to find their adult wife ready to greet them.)*"
3ruqos,6,2015-11-06,Question about careers and supporting one's family in islam.,severdine,islam,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/3ruqos/question_about_careers_and_supporting_ones_family/,"Okay so we all know that when muslims get married one of the top five requirements is a good job, more specifically a doctor or engineer. Now this is understandable because supporting one's family is a serious requirement in Islam so does that mean following one's passion is frowned upon? For example I'll use yours truly. I have a passionate interest in city planning/architecture. Now don't get me wrong, Urban planning is an extremely well paid field, especially where I live (we have jahanam level traffic and huge infrastructure) however it's a competitive field. What I mean by that is that it's a skills oriented profession so they look at your portfolio to see the work you've done to hire you, just like architects, who have to present all the projects they've done. So not only is urban planning competitive but it's also a gamble. You need to start early and make the right moves to move up the ladder to the prestigious urban planner/architect club. I'm still a senior in high school so I followed /r/urbanplanning's advice and started reading, learning GIS, and even got an internship at my local county's planning office (start next month!) Now my concern is somehow not getting where I want to be and end up not being able to support my future family. So what should I do guys, take this risky path or do IT like everyone else?"
3rvfks,0,2015-11-07,Replace the code which powers the wiki with MediaWiki + Markdown extension,blueredscreen,ideasfortheadmins,https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/3rvfks/replace_the_code_which_powers_the_wiki_with/,"The software which powers *Wikipedia* and millions of other wiki sites is called [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), for those who don't know. 

I suggest that the same software be used for Reddit's wiki too, replacing the current code, which was coded by a summer intern.

Since MediaWiki uses what is known as ""wikitext"" and not Markdown, and since wikitext has *millions* of features and is very hard to learn, you could then install [this](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AlternateSyntaxParser) MediaWiki extension, and add [this](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown) Markdown implementation in php to it. (MediaWiki is built using php, so that's why) Then, you're done. That's it. Well, unless you're going to modify the MediaWiki installation that you're going to use, but if not, then you're basically done.

3rvl3e,4,2015-11-07,Introduction to Linux and VMs?,feb289,linux,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3rvl3e/introduction_to_linux_and_vms/,"Hi /r/linux ! I recently finished my internship and now have more time for learning! During my internship I was able to learn a lot things and my friend the sysad, kept telling me to learn linux and vms. I have seen those things work and they are amazing! But sadly the exposure was not enough for me to learn how to use those things. Here I am asking you guys on how to get started with this. I had some experience handling UNIX like system (mac) but I dont think it does justice on what linux is like. I have tried elementary OS on my aging laptop and it was not a pleasant experience. So now, having a good desktop PC I am able to try linux with open arms and mind. 


Also there are so many linux distros to choose from so I dont know which to choose for this or probably have not searched enough but I am gearing towards Archlinux. If you have any resource or suggestion it would be a big help. Thank you so much for reading this :) "

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3rx0iq,9,2015-11-07,How to stop blaming yourself for everything?,HelloIAmNoodle,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3rx0iq/how_to_stop_blaming_yourself_for_everything/,"First time actually posting and not commenting. So, uh, here we go.

Recently my SO has helped me pinpoint what I think may be the source of all of my deep self-loathing that I haven't been able to shake since going NC with my Nmom 3.5 years ago.

I literally blame myself for every single thing that goes wrong in my life. Because I was raised to genuinely believe everything bad that happens to me is my own fault. And I do believe that. After all, the common denominator to all my problems is me.

Person is treating my like shit? My fault.
Should've been nicer/more outgoing/more friendly/more helpful. I deserve this treatment.

Horse has rainrot on her butt? My fault.
Should be around more to make sure she keeps her whole body under the shelter in her field. Shouldn't have switched to pasture board to save money so I can afford her. 

Person got my order wrong at a restaurant/bar/coffee shop? My fault. 
I wasn't clear enough or loud enough. I deserve the incorrect item.

Person feels bad about their project after I present mine? My fault. 
I was too arrogant, I should've been more considerate, I should've presented last, I shouldn't have tried so hard on this project.

Roommate accidentally breaks my mug? My fault.
Should've kept a closer eye on it or warned him that it isn't dishwasher/microwave safe.

Ngrandmother says I look chunky and need to lose weight? My fault.
I haven't been eating perfectly lately bc I've been stressed with being a full time student with 2 jobs and an internship, and I gained 3lbs. I'm disgusting. 

SO is stressed with school? My fault.
Should be more available for him and better at de-stressing him. Shouldn't be so emotionally unstable.

I never realized I was doing this until recently when I sort of said it out loud once in front of the SO, and he was like ""woah no hold up.""

How do you stop blaming yourself for everything? I feel like I constantly need to prove I'm ""good enough"" and even the tiniest little mistake, I mentally beat myself up the way mom did. 

I also only just recently learned it's not normal for a mother to hit her daughter in the face when she's having a panic attack or upset. I thought it was normal, that I deserved it, because no well-behaved child would ever through a temper-tantrum like that, and it was my fault for not being more in control of myself. I even THANKED mom when she hit me because she would say, ""See? Sometimes you just need someone to shake you out of your own worries!"" And I believed that. I mean, it would scare me into complete silence and stillness, so she wasn't wrong, it would stop the panic attacks...

Anyway, sorry, I'm rambling. Any advice? I don't want to hate myself and blame myself for everything but I'm having a hard time rationally convincing myself that I'm not to blame for everything."
3rx343,31,2015-11-07,"My (22F) family criticizes every single thing I do, since I started college (3 yrs ago). What do I do?",Uhl-zak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rx343/my_22f_family_criticizes_every_single_thing_i_do/,"I am a college student that is only a few months away from graduating my Bachelor’s program, after which I want to continue my studies in a Master’s program. During my studies I was very lucky to have (had) the opportunities to work in my field of study to earn money and work experience. In fact, I have even had an internship in a very big and famous company that operates world-wide. At the same time I am living in an apartment in my college town and in a very happy 3-year relationship with my amazing boyfriend (26) and we have two super cuddly kitty cats.

Now, that sounds pretty good, right? Except, that for my family everything I do is absolutely horrible.
According to them my field of study is complete bullshit, my jobs pay “barely minimum wage”, my apartment is a shithole and don’t even get me started on my boyfriend. Every member of the family has their own plate of issues, which all boil down to those.
The worst offender here is my oldest brother (39). Every time I see him we end up in this pointless discussion about my boyfriend’s job (my BF dropped out of college but has a good job in his field), my field of study or my job opportunities. Every time he will tell me to move back to my home town/region because “that’s where the jobs are”. Even though that is simply not true. I currently live in a huge urban/metro-area, whereas their town has an extremely high rate of unemployment.
Even though I know I shouldn’t, I end up justifying myself and my choices in front of him. These meetings often leave me fuming, angry and extremely upset.

The last incident was also one of the worst. In the week leading up to my birthday (in August) I wanted my family to come visit me for once, instead of having to take an annoying trip to their city, like I usually do. It ended with my brothers constantly pissing on my suggestions, even when I suggested meeting up half-way. In the end I did go to my hometown, but that was only to visit my mother.

On the day of my birthday I decided that I would spontaneously reserve a table at a restaurant and invite my brothers after all. My “younger” brother (33) ended up not being able to come, but my older brother did. At the restaurant we ended up having the same annoying discussion AGAIN! My brother was seriously berating me about my studies and job opportunities. When he started going on about my moving back, his wife (32) started to speak up for me as well. She studied something similar to what I did and agreed that I have better opportunities where I am currently living. Then he even used her as an example for how my job would be useless and I’d just be unemployed after graduation.
That’s when I have had enough. I angrily, but firmly told him what I think of his opinion, how it makes me resent my visits to my home-town and how it leaves me angry and upset when I talk to him.

He ignored it.

The rest of the dinner went in silence and in the end everyone kept continuing as if nothing happened. I was bathing in adrenaline when I said that and I was shivering afterwards, that’s how angry and upset I was. But no reaction, comment or anything.

This week I got a job that I really, really wanted. Everything about it is perfect, except for the pay, which is a bit worse than what I earned at my last job. However, I really expect to get loads of experience and learning opportunities, which make up for it. When I called my mother to tell her about it, she also just went on about how the pay is apparently awful, the hours too high and that I shouldn’t be working in the first place.

What the fuck.

It feels like I cannot share my accomplishments, or what is important to me, with anyone in my family. They either belittle it, don’t care or I get berated for it. In comparison, when I tell my boyfriend, friends or acquaintances they are super happy and excited with me.

The above incident happened at the end of August and it has been on my mind ever since. It’s like it consumes me. I just have to think about it all the time and all day long, which makes me feel like shit.
This doesn’t even start on the continuous but smaller scale of criticism I have been enduring for my whole life.

Right now I am at a point in my life, where I just don’t want to deal with any of this shit anymore and I am seriously considering avoiding my family at all costs. Yet it also feels really bad. After all they are my family and they are people that are very important to me.

What do I do? It feels like talking to them doesn’t even yield any results, because I am apparently not heard. Or they just do not respect me/take me seriously at all.

Tl;dr: Family is overly criticizing and logical arguments or firm statements don’t get through to them. I have to think about it all the time and it makes me feel horrible. What could I do?"
3rylwb,2,2015-11-07,"Since my doctor(s) aren't really helping me, maybe some of you can offer some med advice/experiences",egginbasket,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3rylwb/since_my_doctors_arent_really_helping_me_maybe/,"Like the title says, I'm having issues with psychiatrists right now. They're both at my university health center, and I'm now a senior in college.

So, I've been seeing Dr. M since the fall of my freshman year. He was the one that diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, and a few months later, panic disorder. He prescribed 40mg Prozac and 1 mg klonopin for the panic attacks. He eventually advised me to take the klonopin before bed in order to help me sleep. 
In the spring of sophomore year, I had a breakdown. In the declining weeks leading up to it, he upped my Prozac to 80mg.

I took a semester off, where a pdoc in my hometown switched me to 200mg Zoloft. I had a good therapist there too.

Back at school, things didn't really change, but I was handling things pretty well. Cut to my senior year. I have a 20 hr/week internship that's really important for my future, and I'm taking 2 extra credits to make up for my missed semester. I also have my senior thesis. I'm so stressed, all the time. I literally don't have time for therapy; my days are packed with work and class. I tried going but ended up having to reschedule my second appt twice before giving up.

So Dr. M had a medical issue that put him out for a few months, so I saw Dr. J. Being new, she wanted to go over my symptoms, etc. and she seemed kinda surprised/troubles by how rough it's been (with anxiety, not really depression.) At my latest appointment, she prescribed 100mg of trazodone for sleep, and kind of told Dr. M off for advising me to take klonopin nightly, because I was building a tolerance (this feels very true.)

I'm not sure about trazodone. I sleep okay, I suppose, but the anxiety is as present as ever. I end up taking a klonopin every morning anyway, and I've been really foggy. 

Wow, thanks if you've read this whole thing. But what do you guys think? Should I drop Dr. M? Was he not good? Should I keep all these meds? "
3rymlo,0,2015-11-07,"I'm a young, naive student who has run into some money. Help me to invest/save it wisely.",wlingram,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3rymlo/im_a_young_naive_student_who_has_run_into_some/,"Hello.  I'm an accounting student and this semester I've started a tutoring company in my college town.  To be brief, we match students with qualified tutors as a middleman.  My company has been managing ~15 tutors (as well as tutoring some students myself) since we began 2 months ago.  



Presently, we have grossed 10k and have earned 45-50% profit, so roughly $5000 in income.  I'm very busy trying to graduate in May, as well as working an Accounting internship locally -- so these numbers are from a very rocky start.  Because of this, I've kept my eyes open for a business partner.  I found one and will be going through the process this week of formally bringing him into the company at 25% ownership.  I negotiated to $30000 for 25% ownership.  I'm convinced its a fair deal at such an early stage in the company.  I welcome your feedback on my valuation, but it's already relatively finalized. My main reason for coming to /personalfinance is for advice on what to do with the money.  



My partner's investment is not necessarily needed. We already have an abundance of cash.  I haven't been paying myself since we started, and will continue working unpaid until I graduate.  I've also been investing some of my own personal funds.  Therefore, we have around $7000 in the bank, and of course, more on the way as we continue to grow rapidly.  I'm confident I can easily cover any costs of expansion or other unforeseen expenses/ emergencies.



Because of this, I want to take the $30k (or a portion of it) and invest it over a short term period of 3-5 years.  It may not hurt to hold on to $5000 of it and invest $25000, but like I mentioned - cash is not presently needed, and our operation is extremely low cost so cash will likely not be needed in the future either. One large expense we are facing are the legal costs related to our partnership agreement, but I am thinking that through some University connections I can get one on the cheap. 



Consequently, I figure the best move would be to put my partner's investment away in a safe place where it can grow a decent return. This also means in the unlikely event the business fails, my partner will be able to recoup, giving me and my partner some peace of mind. So safety is important but I am willing to accept some risk for higher return.  



5 years is a good period of time because I figure me and this partner will be working together for at least that long. Maybe, in 5 years I'll be in a position where I can let the investment continue growing returns -- who knows.  I guess I just like the idea of my investment locked away for 5 years. 



The hope is that we can build the tutoring business up and either expand to other colleges. Or we grow it, sell it and cash out.  In either event, my intuition is telling me that me and him will continue building/growing businesses together.



I hope this description is comprehensive enough for my situation.  I have been looking into vanguard funds as their expenses are low and their funds seem to be safe.  I still am admittedly clueless.  It's an exciting moment in my ""career"" (I'm 22).  



I will inevitably keep pursuing entrepreneurship.  I guess I could take the $30k and put it towards retirement or buying a home, etc.  However wrong it may be, I'm more passionate about taking the risk on a new business model after we can exit the current operation.



Thank you all so much.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  This subreddit is always extremely informative. 


Quick Edit:  The partner will be actively participating in the operation.  He is not only contributing cash.  And he comes from a strong recommendation and he has been working with the company for 2 months.  He quickly proved himself and we work together very well.  I've received a lot of flack for my impulsiveness but being an entrepreneur is about intuition -- and I trust mine.

I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Need some advice with how I can get it to work.",Quinn___,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ryob1/17_almost_18_yo_here_really_want_to_get_car/,"So, I life in a pretty affluent area, which also happens to be extremely difficult to get around in without a car. Sure, there are buses that go to *some places*, but they run over an hour inbetween and don't go anywhere except some malls and the hospital.

Anyway in our household we have a 2006 Sienna and a 2006 Camry LE. I've been driving for quite a while in the camry (every day for the past year) and I'd really like to get my licence. I have an internship I go to every week, as well as work and leisure activities here and there.

Anyway, my parents do not make much money at all. My dad is blind now and he can't work anymore, and my mom works for some religious non-profit even though she could be making much more elsewhere. The only thing stopping me from driving right now is the insurance cost. They are confident it will be at least $200 a month for me to be able to drive.

Somehow this seems really high to me, when my parents both have extremely low insurance rates (they're old and have never been in any type of accident) and we're driving a relatively cheap car. 

I've been nagging them to get a quote for a long time but they wont. I think they would just rather me not drive at all. I know it's a lot, but I'd only be driving until next fall, because I'll be going of to college and wont need to drive.

Is it possible to only insure me while I'm at home? what are ways to lower the insurance rate? does $200 a month sound about right?"

I wanted to dedicate about a day or two really playing around with React next week. I currently have experience (at various comfort levels) around with JS libraries and frameworks like 'vanilla' Node, Express, Backbone, Angular, MongoDB/Mongoose, etc.

With that being said, what would be a really great project for me to tackle if I could dedicate a solid 15-20 hours? I've only really briefly worked with React in an internship and it piqued my interest, but it's been so long that I really want to 'learn it the right way' - figured it'd be worth revisiting given my increased knowledge in JS backend technologies.

Would love any ideas or tips you all have! Thanks!"

First of all, I'll be lucky to get accepted to grad school or have an offer by December (See Stats below). Second, I am not sure which of my options are the best without having a better understanding of the job market in US. I have a few questions for you redditors, but any advice will be greatly appreciated as this subreddit has helped me out in unimaginable ways.

**""Stats"":**
 
 * I have a 2.6 GPA because I took on the entire ChemE curriculum at my school as a Chemistry major. Did a lot in a very short amount of time and wasn't able to meet a criteria to completely switch over, so I will be graduating with a Chemistry diploma (with engineering minor).
 * GRE was 311 (161 Q/150 V, 5/6 in writing)
 * Applying to smaller schools that I won't put me in too much debt and for whom I have met every criteria listed on their website. Their rankings aren't that great, but hey, their acceptance rate is in my favor.
 * Have two research jobs on resume, one was a summer internship
 * ~$5000 in savings 
 * Considering taking the FE exam and applying for certificate
 * Want to do PhD right after Master's, hopefully from a better school
 * Really don't want to move back in with my parents

**Questions:**
 
 * From the offers I have gotten earlier this year, it looks like I will be landing a job that pays $33K-40K/yr. Should I keep looking or take any job at this point?
 * Is it worth taking the FE exam and then applying for better jobs?
 * Should I take an offer and defer acceptance to grad school? If so, for how long?
 * Should I try to get a job in school come spring instead?
 * If I accept a job offer now, and somehow get accepted to grad school for spring, how long is it appropriate to defer my acceptance? Or should I look for jobs that are contracted till August?

Answers to any of these would be awesome. I think I have covered most of my concerns with the numerous but uncertain options. For now, I am assuming any possible future employer is not funding my Master's. However, let me know if I am not seeing/considering another route from the PF perspective.

Because for example level 50s skull on level 3s and kill them for absolutely nothing &amp; it doesn't effect the level 50s at all because they hardly risk anything themselves. That means there is also no incentive for the higher level players to hunt down and waste time on level 50s because they don't get anything for it.

This puts the newer players behind and intern neglects your player base. Obviously there is always going to be higher levels killing noobier players but right now it's happening more than ever because there is literally no difference between being skulled &amp; unskulled other than the safe zones.

Ideas:

- Killing skulled players not only reduces their exp by 50% but it also gives you a share of their exp towards your own

- Unskulled players automatically protect an item

- Some kind of locator to easily hunt down skulled players (obviously not like a direct map but something that would tell players a general area skulled players are)

- Skulled players can only protect 1 combat skill instead of 2

Me and my let's say girlfriend are / where in a relationship for 5 years. We used to see each other everyday and surprisingly we didn't get bored with one-another. Things were always perfect until she took an internship. Made a few new guy friends (she says she doesn't get along with girls well). Some of those guys like her. She told me all the single spicy details... but for some reason my gut tells me not to trust her. I get mad because she went out with those guys 3 - 4 times a week... and went all berserk (we argued every single day). (This is where I f***d up)

When the internship ended... we started seeing each other again (and she only meets with those guys once every 2 weeks or so), but things weren't the same. Up to the point where she told me ""I think I don't love you anymore"". I told her we should take a break and that we shouldn't speak for a week see how this goes see if our feelings get cleared up. 

And so we did.. I went on a personal discovery trip, out of town for 5 days. Day 6... I accidentally met her in a bar, she was with a friend. Her friend left... my friend left too... and we started talking, kissing, hugging and she even told me she loves me and that she's sure of it.

Day 7.. she told me we should see other people.. I told her I don't want too.. she told me she needs another shitty relationship to see that we are perfect for each other. She was crying while saying this...

Day 8 - 20: We still hang out everyday, kissing, hugging, seeing old friends... But we are not together. I asked her as a joke if we should be fuck friends... and she said yes... (what?)

Day 21: After a long speech. I convinced her to get back together. (I just told her: Just give me a chance so you can see that you have nothing to lose.. if this doesn't work I will go with your plan) But she told me not to change the status on Facebook, nor should I tell me friends we are back together. This hurt me a little and I don't know how to feel about it. Also she refuses to talk about us... and she told me she's like 50% 50% - staying with me... going to another guy...

I'm in 2nd year in a good Canadian mathematics program (Waterloo). I plan on majoring in statistics. My grades are pretty good (mid-high 80s) which I think might be sufficient for some good MSc programs but ideally I'd like to obtain a PhD to do independent research and teach. I have read that pure mathematics majors are favoured over stats majors for PhD programs but my interests truly lie in statistics and I can't bring myself to switch to PMath. However, I can technically take any of their courses.

I plan on taking Applied Real Analysis which contains the following topics: ""Topology of Euclidean spaces, continuity, norms, completeness. Contraction mapping principle. Fourier series. Various applications, for example, to ordinary differential equations, optimization and numerical approximation"". Is that enough or should I take the full Real Analysis course (it is arguably the hardest course in the entire department, so I've heard). 

What other courses would help my chances? I can take Rings/Fields, Group Theory, Intro differential equations, Calc 4, combinatorics, optimization, computational mathematics, stochastic processes, and others (but not all).

I have a stats/data science internship coming up that is research-heavy.

And as for my programming skills, I will probably get a CS minor. I've worked as a software engineer before.

What do you think I can do to optimize my chances of getting into top PhD programs like U of T or maybe some U.S. schools?

Thank you!"

My question is specifically for sites for locating an internship. I've become increasingly frustrated with sites (SimplyHired.com I'm looking at you) that state they will send you accurate ""job alerts"" for the criteria you enter and then inundate you with alerts for everything from engineering to zoology.

Are there sites you all have had luck with? Or is better to try and make contacts/start conversations via linkedin? 

Are there some companies within the I/O community that are known for always having I/O internships? 

For reference, I'm a first year in an I.O M.A. program looking for an internship for summer 2016. Thanks!

As I said to a poster VelvetRose I look up homeless Irish girl when I'm drunk and/or bored and discovered the post six months ago today. It's archived so I can't reply, so I'll try do it here if people still hold any interest and I get if you don't. Is there a way of tagging Redditors in this thing? I'm not sure how to do it.


I am real. I'm fairly sure anyways. Sonja didn't know much about my situation at the time other than I wasn't going to have a home and when viewers found out it was 8 months later. I had a roof over my head in a shelter, but I was classed as homeless. So I was a lot luckier than most. It was for a brief period and I now have my own place so things worked out.

When you lived in Sonja's house for two months, what was the most Sonja-esque thing you witnessed that wasn't mentioned on the show?
That's a toughie. Sonja has put herself out there since she's part of the show so the truth is out there so to speak. The intern thing is really legitimately real - while mentioned on the show, it's not very clear. What you guys see on TV is us haplessly standing around doing silly jobs. Which yes, we did from time to time. We were made aware of this before we signed on. But we also do our jobs, she is sent interns via FIT, LIM and is familiar with the paperwork procedure, performance reports, etc. And we do  gain experience when we are doing our thing, for me it was social media strategy and her site. And you do get credit, although I was not there on work experience from uni, she wanted me earlier.

Did you ever witness her and Harry Dubin awkwardly flirt with each other or make insincere proposals as they did on the show?

They have a long friendship. It felt very natural when I was in company with them. Actually I first met Harry in my bedroom in Sonja's house. There was a couch in there so that probably caused the mistake. The banter and the friendship felt very real and the flirtation too. 

How much time did you spend inside Sonja's house? Does it smell more like Chanel perfume or rotting wood?

Chanel... then again I did grab a bottle of Coco Mademoiselle in duty free on the way to NY. I don't get the 'Sonja's house is dirty' thing at all. Everyone cleans up after themselves, Sonja included. I was only there 5 weeks but I was very homesick... I'd only lost my father 5 months before and it was hard. She totally understood and was really supportive. I still work for her today, that makes 2 1/2 years!

Does Pickles hate Sonja? 

Not at all. I don't think she hates anyone! She's one of the nicest people I have ever met. We just get days where we would be worn out. Even if we weren't on camera but there was filming.

How often did Sonja cook in a toaster oven?

I didn't see her using it while I was there. But we were doing about 5 million things at the time. I know she does use it though.

Candy_Darling 
 What exactly does she do for Sonja Tremont Morgan Beaverhausen, Esq? I love when she said she ""went on the piss"" with Sonja and Harry in NYC. She sounds sweet.

LMAO and thank you! First of all, I love your name. I've been obsessed with Candy since I was a teenager. I worked on social media strategy which is basically using analytics to increase the audience. But to stress, they were her words in the Tweets, posts and replies. I'm doing that job a while and I never write my thoughts for an individual, it's different if it's a business. I would have made suggestions, alerting her to potential material, creating useful visuals and mainly giving her followers what they wanted from following her.

Brainkissed
I just really want to know if Sonja or any of the housewives know about and frequent this sub.

I don't think she goes on Reddit or that it's monitored. I can't say for the other housewives. We had free wifi in the house. I had wifi when I was in the shelter because I still had a billpay contract with my phone network.

Does this mean her toaster oven is around the corner!

It's not happening. Her focus is on her fashion line now, which is not part of my role."

This is the first ""serious"" relationship for both of us, and I think it might be why we're so attached to each other.


We're from different backgrounds and cultures (He's German, I'm English of Indian origin), and I fear the relationship isn't going to be beneficial in the long term. We're from two close countries and both speak English, but not all his friends do, especially since he is from a small town. I've already met his family and friends and he has met mine, but it's very awkward because he has to translate almost everything his parents and friends say, since my German is limited (and they speak fast). 


He's a very sweet person who cares about me, but he's also younger and has much less life experience. I've always had jobs in uni and am working part-time as an intern in my Master's now, but he's never really had a job, and has less responsibility. For instance, he gets very sad when we don't Skype often enough, and it seems difficult for him to understand that I have coursework to do and jobs that can be very demanding. And I can't always sit him down and talk it over. 


I also feel he is just not as much a motivated person as I am. I know what I want to do in the future, and am working hard towards that goal. He's still in his Bachelor's and doesn't work too hard at his studies , he just wants to get his degree and be done with it (He recently started seeing a psychologist to see if he has depression and that is causing his lack of motivation).


I usually go to see him in Germany during the holidays now because I live in a shared flat and he lives with his parents in a quite spacious house (also, yay Ryanair!). Right now, I'm stressed about going to see him over Christmas break because I have exams after the break, and he doesn't, and it's not easy to work next to someone who's playing games all the time or wanting to go to parties at weekends (I don't enjoy drinking). 


Overall, the things we want to do are too different. I want to learn new things and be productive, he just wants to relax and have fun. We take turns conceding, but it would be much nicer if we could find some things we enjoy doing together. We've found a few things we could do together, but they're very limited.


I think one of the reasons we're so different is because of our families too - my parents both have advanced degrees, his parents just finished high school. They're nice people, but there's not much we can talk about, especially with the language barrier. His family is also not very well-off , and it's another reason we can do fewer things together like travelling over the holidays, and I think, why he is not motivated because he feels powerless (Ironically, I study International Development with a focus on poverty). 

I really care about him and would like this to work, and we've both mad a lot of effort to adapt to each other, but I also know people don't change easily, and a person's environment isn't something that can change. And if we broke up, we wouldn't be able to ""stay friends"", thanks to geography. 

**tl;dr**: Great caring boyfriend, yadi yadi yah, but family/environment/personality differences. Don't know what to do because I really care about him. "

For reasons that are not relevant to discuss I had to leave my job about april and ended up in a shitty company (even shittier than the one I left) where I did my internship for one month and it was so bad that they didn't even pay the people in time so I left. I thought it was going to be easy to find a new job in the field I am settling at and I got a few interviews but nothing really good. Now it's almost the end of the year, I have to pay a fee in the university that's not covered by the student loan and I don't even have the money for that. 

I never had so much trouble to get a job like now and it really is stressful. I don't tell anybody so I don't worry them unnecessarily and make them talk about something it's not on me to fix besides applying to jobs every day (often people talk a lot and make me feel more stressed than I should and that's helped me feel normal until this point). I've been living on my savings for months but next month I believe I won't have any money. So this week is crucial for me, I've been applying to less skilled jobs but still not many news.

I feel I'm a failure, I need help but I'm pushing to be alive.

I'm reviewing a new disposable cigalike, the NJOY Daily, after a week of hands-on time with it.

**TL;DR:** 

Surprisingly not bad, but not perfect either. Seems good for flipping smokers who aren't ready for non-cigalike devices.

**Preface**

My vaping history: Quit smoking in 2011 with the help of no-name 7-11 cigalikes, quit vaping after 3 months because aforementioned cigalikes were an expensive pain in the ass and I didn't know fancier vapes were a thing, then a few years later cravings kicked my ass during a particularly stressful period at work, and I started vaping again thanks to this subreddit cluing me in to the existence of better setups. 

I've gone through the whole typical beginner equipment cycle (cigalikes, eGo type setups, iStick 20 with Mini Nautilus/Subtank Nano, and now I use an eGo One with CLR coils that I rebuild myself) over the course of the past year-plus-change.

**The NJoy Daily**

I got my hands on a couple Dailies, having bought one out of skeptical curiosity for my wife, and the other one was thrown in for free. I also bought a few extra afterwards for the sake of review accuracy (don't you hate it when people review something after the first few uses and never get to the ""and then it shit the bed and exploded the next day"" issues?)

Anyway, NJOY has been marketing the Daily rather aggressively since before its retail debut in September 2015, and I had this urge to put their claims to the test. These claims are:

* Look and feel: Feels more like a real cigarette, without looking like one.
* Vaping experience: Hits more like a real cigarette.
* Longevity: Lasts for 300 puffs and is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes.

**Look and Feel**

The Daily doesn't even try to pretend to look like a cigarette. It's dark blue, with a squishy feeling mouth end, and the tip lights up white. It feels very light, much lighter than the heavy cigalikes I started with in 2011. You can actually hold it in your teeth and not feel like you're gnawing on a metal clicker pen. It doesn't look completely cheap/chintzy, looks a bit classier than a Blu disposable, and won't be mistaken for the real thing.

I'm ambivalent on the look/feel--there are times when I'd want a small device that's obviously *not* a cigarette, but there are also times when it's better to blend in.

**Vaping Experience**

The first drag I took felt almost exactly like taking a drag off an actual cigarette, which took me by surprise. To test this further, I handed it to my wife, who still smokes. She was very pleasantly surprised and then promptly claimed it as her own.

Throat hit and feel were practically spot-on. It feels noticeably ""drier"" and warmer than my usual vape, and the vapor clouds are about on par with an analog. The Rich Tobacco feels a bit more like an actual cigarette than the Menthol does.

Flavor is somewhat underwhelming. The Rich Tobacco is a bit sweet and more like a pipe tobacco, but is noticeably muted. The Menthol has a strange sort of berry-ish note that I wasn't expecting, but you can feel the menthol.

These things pack 45 mg/mL of nicotine, and you feel it almost immediately. You also feel ""done"" rather quickly--normally, with my eGo One, I can puff away on it for 20 minutes without getting nic'd out, but with the Daily, I'm done within 5-10 minutes.

Hilariously, I also frequently caught myself absentmindedly flicking/tapping it like the real thing.

Short form, it feels and hits like a real cigarette, but falls short in the flavor department.

**Longevity**

Normally, whenever a cigalike claims that it's equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes, I usually bust out laughing because I've never gotten anywhere near that kind of performance out of cigalikes in the past.

The ""300 puffs"" type of marketing statement is also probably based on the work of an unpaid intern with a small squeeze bulb and a click counter. Hardly anyone I know smokes or vapes like a small squeeze bulb, so puff count is a metric that I usually dismiss as irrelevant.

The more practical metric I'd use instead, when judging whether or not a cigalike is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes, starts with how long that pack would last me if I were still smoking. When I quit, I was smoking about a pack per day. So, in order to meet that threshold for me, a Daily would need to last an entire day from morning to bedtime, assuming I maintained a typical schedule of stepping outside roughly every other hour or so for 5-10 minutes.

For the sake of science, I've gone through 6 of them over the past week, and am still working on number seven. So far, they all have consistently lasted about 24 hours before giving up the ghost, give or take an hour or two.

Mind you, I'm not chain vaping the things, just using them in the same manner that I used to smoke--stepping outside every hour or hour and a half for 5 to 10 minutes during the 16-ish hours that I'm awake. The drags I took were about 2-4 seconds long, with about the same amount of suction that I used as a smoker, and I took one to three drags per minute.

If I tried to chain-vape a Daily, I doubt they'd last more than 3 hours (and I'd either have the mother of all nic buzzes or be puking my guts out).

They deliver. I'm impressed. They're a step up from the other disposables I've tried.

**Price**

MSRP for a Daily is $5.99. For me, given my week-long pack-a-day simulation for this review, that puts the Daily on par with buying a pack a day. So, it's not cheap, but if you smoke a pack or less a day, it's competitive with buying cigarettes, yet still more expensive over the medium to long term than going straight to something like a basic eGo setup with decent clearomizers.

From a practical standpoint, the cigalikes I've tried before had a much worse bang-for-the-buck factor, costing anywhere from 1.5x to over twice what you'd spend on cigarettes and failing to come anywhere close to the stated longevity. 

The Daily seems to be an okay middle ground as far as disposables go--not too expensive relative to a pack of cigarettes, and noticeably more reliable and consistent than the junky stuff.

**Verdict**

Smokers trying to quit through vaping tend to run into a number of pain points in the critical earliest days. At this point, they're usually trying to replace smoking with something that feels *like* smoking, and they're transitioning through not just a nicotine addiction, but also the physical/psychological aspect of the habit. 

So, what they generally want is something that gives them the same feeling as smoking *without* being a gigantic pain in the ass or requiring a level of acclimatization that exceeds their threshold of frustration.

I think this is a good device for flipping smokers, especially those who choke on larger setups. My wife, for example, has tried several different devices and they all seem to make her cough or simply don't satisfy when dialed down. This device, she actually likes.

I'm keeping a few as a backup for my eGo One and for situations where I don't want to use my more expensive device.

Are there campus resources where they help with practicing technical interviews like a mock technical interview?
3s309m,1,2015-11-08,Stomach pressure/gas buildup/bloating since June--advice appreciated,cinnamonbun_19,medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/3s309m/stomach_pressuregas_buildupbloating_since/,"For background information I'm a 21 yo Caucasian female with pretty much no medical history except for a heart murmur. 

So, this all started back in early June. Thankfully it's not as bad as it was back then but I'll describe what I went through anyway. After moving across the country for a summer internship, I started noticing a lot of stomach discomfort and nausea. As time progressed it got worse and worse. Essentially, I would wake up in the morning, eat some breakfast, and then suffer some SERIOUS nausea on my way to work (an hour long commute by bus). I would spend the entire bus ride terrified I was going to throw up. I carried plastic bags in my purse in case it ever happened, but it never did. On top of this, I was having serious diarrhea to the point where I was also terrified of having to go to the bathroom on my bus ride to work, and pretty much every day as soon as I got to work I made a beeline to the restroom. And on top of that, I had serious pressure in my stomach all the time that I couldn't release for the life of me. A new hobby of mine became just pressing down hard on my stomach.

This continued for awhile to the point where it was unbearable and I spent a great amount of time in distress. I had to miss a bunch of days of work. I don't have health insurance, so it took a long time for me to convince myself to go to the doctor but it got to the point where I absolutely had to. After an appointment at a clinic, the doctor was convinced I might have an ulcer. I took a stool sample and the bacteria for an ulcer didn't show up, so he ruled that out. His next idea was that I either had IBS or a food intolerance and suggested I try cutting out gluten. He also prescribed me probiotics and Omeprizole. Omeprizole definitely helped, but it was short lived. The diarrhea and nausea stopped but the bloating and feeling of pressure was still very intense. 

At my two week followup, he told me to try and cut out dairy instead. I was literally flying back to my hometown the same night of the followup appointment, but when I got home, I worked pretty meticulously to cut out any and all dairy from my diet. I realized I ate a bunch of things like greek yogurt and whatnot everyday so I was convinced that was it. Nope, the pressure still continued. It feels like there's so much gas trapped inside of me that I just cannot pass for the life of me. I had also stopped taking Omeprizole at this point and the diarrhea seemed to stop on its own except for a few random occasions that could've been possibly caused by something else.

In September, I moved to China. Hence, I was really nervous all summer about my stomach issues because I didn't want to move here with them unsolved. But once I got here it all seemed to stop. I felt fine for several weeks, and I thought maybe it really was dairy (dairy is hard to come by here so it's completely out of my diet). Or maybe it was all anxiety just about coming here. But after a few weeks, the pressure started happening again. I've learned to live with it but on some days it is still extremely discomforting and I have trouble sleeping because of it. There have only been maybe 2-3 occassions of the stomach issue/nausea relapse since I got here. The last time it had happened, the only thing out of the ordinary was that I had drunk coffee the day before--but being weary of dairy, I got a soy milk latte. Now, my friends speculate maybe it's a caffeine or soy allergy. However, that would explain the nausea/diarrhea, but NOT the constant pressure I feel every day because I hardly ever drink coffee or caffeinated products. Basically, gas-x is my new best friend. If anyone has any insight they can offer, I'd really appreciate it. This has been going on for months and I can't take it anymore.

I do have health insurance in China but there's the little issue of the communication barrier/I went to the doctor here for something else and it was a complete joke how little they looked into me before just prescribing antibiotics, so I'm weary about going to them for this. Thanks in advance guys."

3s3rhu,4,2015-11-09,"Hurting, sad, and stressed.",sadpretty,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3s3rhu/hurting_sad_and_stressed/,"I've been depressed a few times before for long periods and have gotten to the point of being suicidal. I can start feelings the symptoms of depression coming back and creeping into my life. I feel so fucking blah, it makes me tear up. I feel like life is meaningless. 

I'm a 22 year old recent graduate with what seems like no job prospects right now. There's not really much going on in my city for my career interests, so I have no idea what to do. I feel like I'm suck in life. I was let go from an internship 2 weeks ago, and feel like I am beating myself up over it even though I know it was for the best. 

I feel like a burden to my friends and SO, who I talk to about how shitty I feel but I don't want to hurt him and be sad all the time. I force myself to stay busy and clean my apartment and work out but I don't think it's enough. I feel so alone, like I'm lost in life. I want to start my own business (since I can't find a job) but have no motivation or idea on how to do so. I want to travel and get out of this rut but I fear being called lazy for going to travel rather than hopping into a 9-5 job right away after graduation. I don't know what's going to make me happy anymore.

I used to see a therapist and saw her for about 2 years and eventually stopped when I felt better and was leaving for a long trip. She said she would contact me to check up on me but never did. I don't want to see her again and I just feel embarrassed that these shitty sad feelings are back. I've been hospitalized before for suicidal thoughts and I don't want to get to that point again. Sometimes when I am alone I just burst into tears thinking about the overwhelming feeling I have about my life. I can't sleep till very late at night and wake up late, which means I barely get sun but it's been so hard to fix my sleep.

I just feel lost, depressed, and at a loss at my life."

Hi I'm an enfp, now perhaps an I not an E.
I've struggled with depression for sooo long, since I was in high school, I stay for long periods of times normal, sometimes years, but I find that I always relapse, I really really never want to call it chronic because it just kills my hope, but I'm afraid that's true.
I'm now in my last semester in college ""hopefully""
I'm a clinical laboratory science student, my major is only 4 years and a half plus one year of hospital internship, however, this semester I completed 6 years without even the internship year, I took a semester off few years ago, I took it at the end of the semester which really bugged many people I know, anyway I have only one course left that I'm studying right now, I passed all the others last semester, I was so happy and excited last semester then booom I failed in one subject!
I've always been lazy it's a serious problem of mine, but right now, I can't study, I just can't, It's not that I can't understand or anything, it's just I can't start studying!
not only studying, even personal hygiene is a chore to me!
I used to be so interested in maaaany things, like skincare, hair, make up, reading, many other things that now I don't care about.
I only watch anime or tv shows, but I can't focus I always fast rewind because I just missed some parts, then I sleep, I try to stay with my family and friends but I can't
I'm feeling like a burden to people so I try to stay in my room all the time, I don't want to ruin the mood of anyone I try to act normal but I just feel so fake, I hear my laugh and it's so weird I don't know if it's like that to only my ears or that everyone hear it like that too, I'm having weird thoughts that the people I love are better off without me, and that I should prepare them so I try not to be nice and to hurt them sometimes, then I do the opposite, it's like I'm pushing them away and then pulling them back again ""excuse my english"" , this has been going for weeks now, I started to relapse ""I really don't like this word it feels hopeless"" at the end of summer vacation.
I don't know if I'm really depressed right now or is it just because I'm late again for graduating, if I'm depressed really or just because of the ""one"" subject failure.
My professors always tell me that I'm smart and that they're disappointed with my marks, but I never get high marks, in college at least, in high school I got a very high scores and stuff, but in college it's rare, that's why I took a semester off I wanted to think things over, I wanted to switch my major, but then I didn't, many times I ask myself, do I really love my major? or do I lie to myself or force myself to believe it?!
Do I really love it that's why I didn't switch or just because I was afraid and weak?
sometimes I love it!!! sometimes why am I even in this major?!
It's not that I can't understand, I can't bring myself to study ""I'm talking about all the past years in college"", then I study in the last few hours  before exam, impressively I mostly pass with c or c+ which ""ironically"" I congratulate myself for because I didn't study like normal  people, but I failed in like three subjects before this one, so in total I failed in four subjects till now, my problem right now is not that I can't study till the last few hours before the exam, I can't study at all!
I was just wondering about this problem of mine a few days ago, then yesterday I looked it up and i found out that enfps usually have problems with schools and colleges, I was really shocked with this piece of info, two links:
http://education.penelopetrunk.com/2013/05/16/is-your-smart-kid-destined-to-fail/
http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/ENFP#School
I was really really shocked!
and then I was thinking hmmm if my problems in college are related to my personality then what about my depression?
then I looked it up today but didn't find many links, most of them were repeated, but from what I understood enfps are prone to depression more?
I was shocked and dismayed these two days, I feel hopeless, if it's really related to my personality then will I ever be normal? 
I always thought that my depression is because of some bad personal traits, laziness and procrastinating mainly plus I have a temper ""I don't think temper is common for enfps, my whole family is the same so probably environmental"" and really sensitive, I always thought that if I try to at least ""treat"" the first three of them, I'll be fine, but after finding out about these two problems ""troubles at school + depression"" I'm really really scared and I feel hopeless.
is it true? at least the thing about depression?
I am sorry for the extremely long post, but I don't even want to talk about this with my best friends I only have you guys at the moment.
I don't want to flush six years of suffering down the toilet but I'm just so tired, I can't even read the material.
there are so many questions in this post, sorry, but please answer me.
This is my first time posting here, I just signed up to talk to you.
So I don't know if this post is against the rules because it's too long, I hope it won't be deleted.
sorry for any typos now it's 10 am and I didn't sleep yet."

background: best friends of 4ish years, been through plenty together. she lives about an hour away, but we would talk almost every day about everything and anything. 

at the beginning of the year she started to get distant, said she was busy with work and internships and uni, and i understood that as she will reply but take time to. i kept asking to catch up, hang out, but i got every excuse under the sun. it came to a few months and i finally cracked and asked what the hell is going on because i had always put her number one but as of lately i was number 150 on her list. 

she has a solid friend group, two other best friends, and her and her boyfriend have gotten super close over the last year. so she asked for ""space"" (my least fave word). 

i gave her what i thought was space, apparently it wasn't enough, i cracked around my birthday again, and she said things wouldn't go back to how they were and she still needed time to work her head out... i finally took this as ""it was over"". 

now, i have no other friends. i have a boyfriend, but that was it. i've lost plenty of people in my life, but none have hurt like this. i can see she is happy, loving life with her two best friends and her boyfriend and all her other friends, and doesn't seem to even care or miss me at all.... 

so ladies, how do you get over a friend breakup? and how do i make friends?"

I loved maths back when I was very young, as I remember saying I wanted a career in accounting but never really followed through. 

I've looked around google for what an accountant does, but I figured I get a few more opinions before I make any major decisions. 

To the accountants out there: 

1. What are key traits that are required for doing your job? 

2. Do you need to obtain a professional qualification after graduating before officially working? I've heard there were these tests that help in furthering your career. (I ask this because I remember reading that law graduates/health graduates require 1-2 years of ""supervised"" practice before they are considered professionally qualified - basically interns) 

3. Would you need a passion in maths/business or just working with numbers in general to enjoy your job, and do you usually sit in a office for 8 hours a day on the computer crunching numbers?

4. What should I expect if I start a career in accounting? 

I still know little to nothing about Accounting, so if anyone could shed some light on the situation, that would be greatly appreciated!

3s4gvj,3,2015-11-09,Transfer students: How is CSU CI?,prefuse07,csuci,https://www.reddit.com/r/csuci/comments/3s4gvj/transfer_students_how_is_csu_ci/,"Prospective transfer here, just applied for Fall 2016, in particular for CS...

&amp;nbsp;

What drew me to Channel Islands was mostly the fact that it's a small school, the CS program seems pretty good too from what I've read, and lines up with all of the classes I've taken thus far, so there is no problem there. I already know Java and have been learning C++ as well as messing with Unix, so I think I'm good to go on that aspect...

&amp;nbsp;

**Some background info:**


I recently spent some time at a CC on the east coast which was similar in size as CI and I really enjoyed my time there, more than at the junior colleges i've attended here in California (which are **extremely overcrowded**, and at some feel like you're in another country *cough* china *cough*)... Needless to say, I got tired of shoveling snow and flying back here to be with family, so I ended up coming back to CA, and because I graduated HS in CA (originally from CA in case you're wondering) I get in-state tuition under AB-540...

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I just have a few questions:

&amp;nbsp;

**The people:**


I've read that many of the students at CI are introverts (or just shy?). How true, or better yet, how big of a deal is this? I mean, are most of the students introverts, will it feel like a CC (and in essence HS) since it appears to be a commuter school? Is it difficult to make friends? (as I've read on different sites including this one). Are there lots of clubs?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm **very** non-traditional (will be 28 when I transfer, have tons of work experience) -- with that being said, I also felt that this school would be a good fit for me as I read that something around 75% of students at CI are transfers. I don't imagine I'll be feeling too out of place given my age?

&amp;nbsp;

**Also this is very random, but I might as well throw it in there:**

How ""ghetto"" is Channel Islands? I mean, are there any ""ghetto"" kids at CI? -- Don't get offended, I'm just curious to get a feel for the campus since I can't visit prior to attendance (I am in the bay area). I've read that Ventura county has had issues with gang stuff, does any of that ""spill over"" into Camarillo and CI?

&amp;nbsp;

**Job prospects/internships:**

From reading the other post on here that has a similar title, but less details, it seems that given Ventura Co. and SB's ""local tech companies"" it shouldn't be hard to land internships per-se, but I want to know from actual CSUCI students -- How hard has it been to find internships and/or employment post-graduation? Are your friends happily employed?

&amp;nbsp;

I've done some research using the CSUCI linkedin and etc, seems like most people end up in the LA area (not a problem), with some even at google and amazon (which is awesome) -- just curious on employment stats... 

&amp;nbsp;

**Closing comments:**

I'm not looking for a party school (and I know this isn't one), but i'm also not trying to be somewhere that has the same vibe as a CC. And besides gaining a degree from CI, i'd at least like to walk away with a few friends come graduation time. I will be taking on some debt to pay for school and living expenses (since I'm not local), so i'd like the decision to have been worth it in the end (and I know this is subjective).

&amp;nbsp;

On another note, the other school I'm looking at is UCSC. (if it matters)"

My best friend has a long history of being caught up in abusive relationships but over time has been in less severe situations. Two boyfriends ago, she was thrown into a wall and had to leave her home because her (predictably) psycho ex ran off with a knife and promised to come back and kill her. The prior one wasn't a whole lot better than that. After that incident, she got her life back together and re-evaluated what got her into that situation - there were a lot of things that had been put up with that frankly (not to victim blame because ultimately *he* was responsible for how he acted) should not have been - and she moved on and ended up in a much better place emotionally, mentally and in every other way. I have been happy to support her along the way, building her up and encouraging her therapy sessions, self-love and reflection and all that jazz. She and I have been through many things together over the years and I'd consider her like my sister. She's a good girl who tries way too hard and gives way too much and frankly, gets taken advantage of by the wrong people. 

So, moving on to the latest boyfriend. I never liked the guy. From the first week, he left a bad taste in my mouth with some racial comments he made once and something about him, though I couldn't ever say what exactly, made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. But, he seemed respectful otherwise, so I wanted to be fair. From what she told me, he worked on his education and was striving for a better career. He took good care of himself and seemed ambitious. He was always courteous, well-mannered and overall just a pleasure to be around when I would spend time with them. Things seemed to be going really great for both of them, and I was very happy for her, especially considering what had happened in the past. 

I had been going through my own emotionally abusive situation and ended up breaking out of it and letting her know. Had been on and off with that nonsense for most of my time with her. She had been aware of what was going on. A day later, she drops a bomb on me: she left this guy, and kicked him out of their home. What?! I had zero idea that anything was even mildly wrong between the two of them, so I was shocked. She spilled everything on me at once: they fought all of the time, he'd scream at her, verbally abuse her, and slap her around. The final straw was him hitting her with her textbooks. She told him to gather his shit and get the fuck out, told the landlord, changed the locks, told her neighbor whom they both know and told her parents. I was floored. But also very proud of her for doing the right thing and kicking him out and going NC. I praised her and we got together to talk and reflect and for me to offer her more support. 

Now, they were living together for a while. At least a year. She had only recently started going back to school but hadn't picked up much in the way of socialization. We'd both moved away from the city we went to college together in, where the rest of our friends still reside. I work full time, she does not work, but takes a lot of fitness classes. So it has been hard to spend much time with her. Still, we try to build each other up and encourage one another every day even if it's just through a few texts here and there. I have bounced back from my situation quickly and am happily dating and moving forward. I cannot say the same for her, but then, our situations were different. 

We're driving somewhere together the other night and she tells me she heard through the grapevine that her ex was having trouble paying a bill. You see, it turns out, he wasn't doing so well for himself as she had made it out to be. Same as the guy before him. She lives off of parental money and he was enjoying his share of the pie, if you will. So she goes ahead and anonymously pays this bill for him, but considering what the bill is, he HAS to know it's her who paid it. Then she tells me she sent him a text message and asked him if he wanted to go see a movie with her soon. What. The. Fuck. I asked her why she would reach out to him and she couldn't give me an answer. My advice to her was that she needs to continue moving forward and stop worrying about him. He has family and friends to look out for him, and while it's sweet of her to care, she needs to focus on herself because the one person who deserves the time and the money the most right now is *her* because she's kicking butt at school and at yoga and at landing a great internship. That she needs to make this arrangement truly NC just like I did with my ex - and that means making sure mutual contacts understand we can't be talking about this person and that she has no way to reach out to him. She nodded and said she agreed and that was that. Right?

Of course not.

She texts me yesterday and says he called her while she was getting her nails done with a friend, and that her friend saw his name on the phone screen and flipped out. I asked her, ""Well, what are you doing talking to someone who put hands on you?"" and she said, ""My nails turned out really cute!"" I said, ""I didn't ask you about your nails."" And she just continued to deflect the conversation. At this point, I'm starting to get angry. I can only try to help her so much before I feel like she just doesn't give two shits about my advice and all of this work on confidence, self love and everything else it takes to break the cycle of abuse. I would try to push for therapy again, but she has a terrible on-off relationship with that and I'm not sure how reliably it will work out for her, as it hasn't been a 100% effective thing in the past. Even worse is, she's becoming increasingly clingy and I'm seeing some codependent behavior. I am in the middle of uprooting my own life, starting a new job and moving to a new city so I really can't be smothered right now, but I also don't want to shove her back into the arms of someone who has hurt her. I don't want to tell either of her parents if I can help it because then she'll probably hate me for life, although they'd ensure he'd never come anywhere near her again (dad is involved in ex's extracurricular activity at a high rank, if that makes sense). I'm at a loss as to how I can handle this with grace, Reddit. Please help.

**tl;dr
Best friend has a history of being in abusive relationships, left her last abusive ex and went NC... temporarily. She is now back in contact with him through her own attempts and has been deflecting me from talking about why she feels the need to do this. I have no idea how to handle it all and I'm getting really frustrated.**"

3s4twj,12,2015-11-09,A day in my psychotic episode. (Long ass text alert).,Pelusi,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/3s4twj/a_day_in_my_psychotic_episode_long_ass_text_alert/,"Ok. This is it, awake again. Damn. We’re gonna have to open our eyes at some point, how long can we do this for? Was  there anything today…? Class, I think. We had class, nobody expects me to be there, though. I haven’t been there in a long  time, they must have forgotten I even exist. Ok so, what’s next? I guess I should eat… Too much trouble, though. Shower? Too much trouble. So what IS next? Fuck, ok, this is how I make myself get overwhelmed, this is why we can never leave  bed, I let my thoughts cripple us. How about opening our eyes? That should be an easy start. Great, sounds good. Alright,  let’s open them. We are going to see the same thing as every morning, and if we get the thought that we hate it and we  wish we were somewhere else, we are NOT gonna hold on to that, ok? Ok. 

One, two, three. Eyes open. Ok, we see the ceiling, the walls, the shelves, the lamps, the books. Here are my hands, and my body. What time is it?! It feels like the afternoon. It’s 7pm. Nicely done, Celia. We’ve been working on resetting our sleep schedule for about three weeks, have we made any progress? Of course not, I am the same piece of shit as always, after all.  SHHHHHH!! No. You are not a piece of shit. You are just having a hard time. I actually feel relieved, now I don’t need to  feel bad for not going to class, it’s over, what’s left of the day I can just chill. Can I, though? We know I can’t. Bah,  whatever, we can smoke and read shit on the internet. We don’t need anybody, do we? We don’t… But I miss being with  people…I miss enjoying their presence. Why can I not enjoy anything now?? WHY? Ok, that’s anger, there it is. I am angry  at myself. I don’t need that, not now. Let’s…let’s go to the bathroom, let’s try to look decent, and then we’ll leave, we can  see Mike or Becca. They kind of understand what’s going on, so their presence is not so overwhelming. 

I feel my stomach. What did I eat last night? Did I eat? When was the last time I ate? Why does it want to throw up? I hate  throwing up. I think that’s why, they are doing it. They know I hate throwing up, and if I do, then I’ll feel weak and I’ll find  another reason to stay home. Let’s hold it in. They don’t have control over us. Let’s eat a little, too, maybe some bread and  milk, and take our meds.

*No, you are not crazy, meds will hurt you. They want you to think you are crazy and to take this poison that will only numb  you. You are never going back to normal. You aren’t normal. We won’t go just because you take a pill. We’ll always be  here.* Shut up. Stop. that. shit!! We are not engaging with them, we can’t give in. Not again. We are not throwing up, and we are taking our meds. At least so that we can hear ourselves think. I wonder if they are also the ones making me think of 
myself  as ‘we’. Or if it is a defense mechanism. I am out of clue. I used to think I know about myself… but I don’t know  anything  anymore. Everything I try feels like I am completely out of my mind… so I might as well try to deal with it  somehow… how  the fuck am I supposed to live normally with this constant noise in my head??

Ok, enough. Shit, it’s been one hour ever since we woke up, and I’m still wandering around the apartment like a zombie.  We gotta get out. Ok, bread, milk, pills, bathroom, pee, hair, face. Dress up, we don’t even care what we wear anymore or if  we look cute or not. Just throw some pants and a shirt on. We made it. Considering how hard everything has been the last  couple months… this is an improvement. Great, see? Nice words. That’s what we have to do, be nice to Celia! 

*We are nice. We are the only ones that are nice, and you know it. If you get out, you are exposing yourself to all those  enemies, all they wanna do is hurt you. Stay in. Stay here. Go back to bed and STAY.* No, shut up, we are going out. You’ll be gone in half an hour, when the meds kick in. Fuck you, you faggots. I don’t like you. 

I can feel them trying to fight back, but I am doing a good job at shutting them down and they are getting weaker. Sweet,  second score of the day. We might actually be getting better. Right?

Ok, grab your stuff and let’s get out. Then I feel it. That light vibration inside both my ears, like there is a little fly in there.  Fuck, why, why now? Because I’m going out, that’s why. They don’t want me to leave and they can’t talk to me anymore, so  now they’re gonna punish me, and I’m gonna see some terrifying shit. Ok, we can handle it, can’t we? Yes. We’ll just do what we’ve practiced. We’ll be fine, and then we’ll get to Becca’s. What if she isn’t home? Ok, let’s give her a call before opening the door. We need her today, we can’t trust ourselves, and we know it. At least I know that. 

I have to give a big effort to hear Becca, but I manage it. She’s home, we’ll blaze. She can tell something’s off with my  shaky voice and my ton, but she doesn’t ask, because she knows what’s going on. She knows it’s one of the dark days. But  she knows I can handle it, at least until I get there. That I can do. Let’s do it, actually, it’s been almost two hours… I open  the door, and there he is. At the bottom of the first four steps, right before the window, the first (hopefully also the last) hallucination is already waiting for me. An obscure, dark man, with a scary face, grinning at me. Oh. Bitch. Fuck. Do I yell at  him? No, people will come and then I’ll get more scared and act even crazier and crawl on the floor and cry. Besides, we  know there is no need to talk. He can hear my thoughts. 

Get off my way, bitch. You pathetic, disgusting cunt. You are so pathetic you are not even real. He grins even worse. Now he  has what he wanted, he has my reaction and that makes him stronger. Why did I even acknowledge him? I’m so stupid. *If I’m not real, why are you talking to me? Why don’t you go downstairs, are you scared of getting close?*

He’s right, I am scared. But I am not scared of him. My fear is way worse, deeper than that. I wish I was afraid of external  things, but I am afraid of my mind, my stupid crazy head, that has control over me and can decide when I’m gonna have  the worst time. Or can it?

Ok, we’ve done this before. Let’s break everything into pieces and objectify it. Nice, I remembered that! And I didn’t talk  back to him. It actually is funny, I think, that he’s been waiting there all this time, while I try to decide what to do. And so I  start. We see the floor, the walls, the steps going down, and feel the cold air coming from the hallway. We see this male   figure, it has eyes, mouth, nose, and clothes. We can’t see its hands. It’s standing in front of us, and its mouth is making an  expression, but this expression doesn’t mean anything, unless I decide to perceive it as something with meaning. So I  decide not too, and his grin becomes a curvy line, pointing to his eyes. 

He realizes this. He knows what I’m doing, so he lifts his white, creepy looking hand, and points at me with his finger.  Movement will distract me, for sure. But I remember, it’s just movement. Whatever it means, it’s ok. We don’t care, let’s   walk towards him. What if he touches you? That’s ok. If I feel a hand on me, it’s ok. It doesn’t mean anything. There is  nothing behind it, stop looking for meanings behind everything. Take a step, now another. We start going downstairs,  without taking our eyes away from the hallucination, almost making fun of him. We walked by him and keep going down,  and when we look back, he’s gone. Nice!! Dude, I made it. That’s fucking great.

The vibration in my ears is gone, too. So now I feel safe enough to walk all the way to the train, I only have to deal with real  life and my depression, hallucinations are gone for now.

It takes me 3 minutes to get to the station, and I hop on the train, line U2, heading south. It’s seven stops to Becca’s  place. I sit down and relax as much as I can. I don’t need to think in terms of ‘we’ anymore, not for now. I look around me.  The atmosphere in the train is depressing, as usual. And that’s something most people agree with, that’s not me, nor is it  my madness. Immigrants looking terribly tired and out of place, Germans looking totally uninteresting, kids talking and  playing, but oddly quietly. German kids are so quiet. Isn’t it depressing, for fuck’s sake? First station. Hohenzollernplatz.  People get on and off, the train continues. The other four stops go quickly, and we are already in the main station.  Hauptbahnhof. The train gets empty slowly, and then it continues. Next stop, a bunch of people get on. Too many people, I  don’t like it, but whatever, it’s two more stops and I’ll be there.

Silence continues, and then it gets so, so quiet, it’s worrisome. It’s not normal. I look around, trying to figure out whether I  can’t hear, or Germans are just getting hardcore with their stupid Ruhe. It’s me, I can’t hear shit. I can’t hear the loud  noise of the train running on the rails. Shit, that’s not good. I am cold and sweaty when the vibration starts and everything  gets blurry around me. Almost dark, but not too much, if it did, then I could not see the first couple shadows and I would  not be so scared. More and more people start turning into black, shapeless shadows, until I’m left alone surrounded by  them.

Fuck this. Seriously, fuck it! Not again, I thought it was over for today! Then I remember, if I engage, they’ll get stronger,  and grow. This is one of the worst hallucinations, and I hate it so much. It only happened a couple times before, but we know how horrible it is. If I engage, I’m lost, plus there are actual people around me, I’ll act crazy and scare them again,  they might call the cops on me again, and then an ambulance will take me back to the hospital, when they see my pupils  huge because of the fear and think I’m either on drugs, or psychotic as fuck.

So I do my best to look down and ignore the shadows. I feel some of them moving as the next stop approaches. I had  forgotten I’m on the train and we are moving, it’s only two more stops!!! I gain hope back, I can do it. Some of the shadows  get off and I remember they are people, probably going back home to their boring lives. For the first time, I feel happy  thinking about their boring, meaningless lives. I see people, actual people, at the station, but they turn into shadows as  soon as they step on the train. God damn it. I look at my leg to make sure I’m not also turning into grey matter. I’m not,  and the next stop is approaching, but fear has me glued to my seat. It’s too scary to walk by some many of them!   However, I know if I stay I’ll get further away from my stop, and we’ll stay with the shadows, and they’ll swallow us. I can’t  hear any of them talk, like last time. Alright, ten seconds to our stop, RUN!

I somehow get to the door, open it and step back into reality. There is light and people, and sounds around me. Phew. Now  we gotta walk to Becca’s, it should take no longer than 2 minutes. 

We make it there safe. Just our thoughts crippling, feeling bad about myself, but no voices, no visions, no shadows. Becca  opens the door and I feel the warmth coming from inside of the apartment. Finally something familiar and something that  feels nice. As nice as something can feel when I am so fucking depressed to wake up at 7pm.

We talk for a little, and then we blaze. I know smoking doesn’t help at all, some people think that it makes my problem  worse. But to be perfectly honest, it’s one of the few things I crave and like. And fuck it, I’m crazy and my life sucks  anyway, I might as well get high.
 
However, I know that being depressed, even getting high feels bad. The thoughts of guilt and paranoia arrive after fifteen  minutes blazing, and I know, although I’m not going to hallucinate while being at Becca’s, I am gonna stay inside my head.  That I still haven’t learned to prevent, probably I can’t, who knows?

Shit. Why is Becca talking so much? And why is she talking so much about herself? She always does the same. She wants  attention, she wants everybody to tell her how good she is, she doesn’t care about me, she knows that I have a problem,  but she doesn’t realize how much I need her now. She hurts me, doing this. I should get away from her, at least until I get  better. Otherwise she’ll keep hurting me and I’ll have to do something about it. She is so happy, she thinks so highly of  herself, why? Why can she feel good with herself, and I can’t?

Stop. We are doing it again. Not the voices, but the paranoid thoughts. I’m turning myself against my best friend! She  probably didn’t realize something is wrong, because I work so hard on not letting people notice.

I better go. I can’t stay here. I’m afraid I might hurt her, if this continues, if I can’t handle my head anymore. 

I make it home ok. No visions, no voices. I feel relieved when I get there, but then I realize, I’m lonely again. I don’t know  what to do, how to distract myself. And then I start getting the dark thoughts, once again. I have no value, nothing is worth  living for. What is my life, anyway? I haven’t done anything exciting, ever. And I can’t even think of anything exciting I  could do. That’s it. I can’t feel excitement, or joy, or happiness, or sadness, or anything! I just feel nothing, for nothing, for  nobody!

It’s too overwhelming. The room starts spinning and I fall on my knees, I hear all the voices at the same time, saying all  sorts of horrible things, I can’t get them to stop this time, they are too intense, and I feel dizzy. I need to stop it.  Something must be done, this constant agony is worse than being dead. And then it hits me.

I actually can be dead, if I want to. It’s one of the few choices I can still make. I am a crazy fuck, and I have enough pills to  put myself to sleep, without suffering, without making a mess, without putting somebody on the spot when they find my  dead body.

I rethink it, and I see it so clearly: there is no reason to stay alive. Absolutely no reason. So I crawl to the bathroom (I still   can’t walk), grab the antipsychotics, the ones that help insomnia and my hallucinations: Quetiapine. They’ve helped me so  much, and they are gonna help me one last time. It’s funny, because they are the only ones that never let me down. They  always gave me what I expected they would. I swallow them all, without hesitation. Surely a dose hard enough to end my life. I feel it almost instantly, I feel myself drifting backwards, my eyes slowly close and then there is pitch black, and I   cannot see or feel anything. I am gone. But something goes wrong. I start feeling pain on my cheeks, and I hear something,  I think it’s somebody screaming. I try to open my eyes, but I’m too numbed for that. Then I recognize the voice. It’s my  roommate. Fuck, bitch. He got home before I was totally gone, and now he’s gonna ‘save’ me. God damn it! Just let me go,   please. I try to mumble, again, without success. He drags me to the living room and calls an ambulance. Half an hour later,  I’m in the hospital and they are getting the pills out of my stomach. Most of them, anyway. I can’t fight it, there is nothing  I can do about it, and I start crying. I feel embarrassed and frustrated and disappointed that I failed at killing myself. Is  there  anything more humiliating than that?

I sleep a lot and have the weirdest dreams. When I wake up, I am completely naked and some lady is struggling to make  me sit straight while she washes me with a sponge. She asks for help, and this intern kid comes in, he’s about 16 and he is  completely shocked. I look at him in the eye, I can’t say anything, I can barely stand on my feet and my knees keep going  down. I realize he knows everything, that I’m here cause I tried to kill myself (two or three days ago? I don’t know). He  helps the lady, holding me by my shoulders. It’s so weird, to feel so weak and to have to strangers wash my naked body.  Plus, the lady is a bitch, I think. I feel like she is judging me for what I’ve done. The kid, on the other hand… he seems to  be feeling compassion and respect for me. He is pretty strong, and he moves me around carefully and softly. When they’re  done, they dress me into one of those horrible hospital robes, and they put me back in bed. The lady tells the kid to leave  the room, I think she is gonna feed me, but I finally manage to open my mouth and say I want him to stay, and I want her  to go. And for some reason, for once, what I want to happen, happens. The kid stays and feeds me in silence. He is very  patient, I must be gross, food gets out of my mouth constantly and I struggle to swallow and to chew. He cleans my face  every time with a napkin. I feel the tears, coming to my eyes. He must be my sister’s age, and he is taking care of me. I  start crying and I feel the need to apologize to him, for some reason. And so I do, and he says it’s ok, and cleans my tears.  He says it’s ok a couple times, and he strokes me until I fall asleep again. When I am almost asleep, he whispers something  to me: ‘people should learn from you’.

What does he mean? I guess I do struggle a lot, and I do keep it cool most of the time. I guess nobody can take that away 
from me, even if I almost killed myself. I wake again, and I think there are things I could be doing, and they are exciting: I 
could be helping people like me. If I stay strong and get better, then I could use my experience and understand them and 
help them get out of the fucking hole we all are in. That’s what I’m gonna do. When I get out of here, I’ll find out what I 
have to do to become a social worker. The voices can go fuck themselves, now I have a goal to focus on.

This summer I'll be interning in San Francisco as a software engineer at a pretty well known company. I'll be working on Market Street (very close to where the 101 crosses Market Street). Any recommendations on what area to try and find housing in? I'll probably live with one or two fellow interns to save money, but I don't know San Francisco at all so not quite sure where I should be looking.

Biggest priorities would be cost and proximity to where I'll be working, though I'd also prefer to not live in a cockroach invested prison. Additionally, would love to be close to the ""fun"" areas of the city with a good nightlife/bars.

Additionally, if there are any good resources/sites for San Francisco housing that would be awesome as well. Thanks"

We met online dating. Crazy coincidence, we worked at the same place together 15 years ago; me the intern, he the new cameraman on which I developed a crush. I thought he still worked at the news station because many times when we talked on the phone, he was 'in the field.' Then we meet for the first time at Starbucks. I'm in line and I him say behind me, 'hi beautiful' and I turn to see him in his cop uniform. I'm stunned because I'd just smoked a bowl before going. We enjoyed each others company and determined we were fuckable.

Anyways, we have much in common, both of us transplants from Texas. We go to matinee movies and have lunch. Because we live 25 miles apart, we meet in hotels for incredibly hot sex. He played football for Texas A&amp;M. He's a beefy dude.

We're totally on the down low, choosing to eat in out of the way restaurants. I have friends with gang bangers in their families and I'm sure he has racist cop friends. 

We kept up our friend with benefits relations for a year and a half until the incident in Ferguson, Mo. We met weeks afterwards but he couldn't look me in the eye, like because I'm black I must despise all cops. As long as I saw him in civilian clothes, I was cool, but a couple of times, when he was dressed in his uniform meeting me for coffee, my hackles raised a little before I remembered this is the guy who pulled over on the highway to save a kitten. But with each new police brutality case, our conversations became more awkward. I finally texted him saying we had to cool it because I had to concentrate on family issues and he texted back saying he understood and that the door was always open. Call him anytime.

We knew our relationship would never end in marriage but we did fantasize about buying a Texas ranch in our retirement years where we could sit on the porch, drink beer, and shot cans off a stump all day. Sigh. A year later and I still miss Ross."

I was just offered an internship in your city and I have some questions about where I should live. I'm sure you get these questions a lot but I haven't found much about owning a dog.  I *think* the job is in midtown, but I'm not completely sure. My best guess for a location now is Brookhaven or Sandy Springs? I don't know what other information you all need to make a suggestion so here ya go:

* I will have two high energy dogs with me (Australian shepherd and border collie), so the area needs to have a place that I can get them exercise. 
* I will not have a car for the first 2 -4 weeks that I am there, so maybe MARTA will be helpful?
* I will need a short term lease (~3 months)
* They are paying an $850 a month living stipend, so my budget is around there with some wiggle room for a good opportunity.
* I will be traveling back to Lexington KY most weekends when I get a car so if there are any good places on the northern end they are preferred.

-	I have $22,500 in federal student loans. My Stafford Loan grace period ends 11/10/15 but I don’t have to make my first payment until 1/09/2016. My Perkins Loan grace period ends in March. 
-	I have a check for $4,500 coming in the next 4 weeks for property I reclaimed form the state (relatives gifted me stock when I was born, parents forgot about the account, it got transferred to the state then liquidated after the account was dormant)

&amp;nbsp;

The loans are broken out as follows:

-	Stafford Unsubsidized Loan: $2,000 @ 6.8% w/ $546 in interest
-	Stafford Unsubsidized Loan: $2,000 @ 3.86% w/ $156 in interest
-	Stafford Subsidized Loan: $3,500 @ 3.4% w/ $0.00 in interest
-	Stafford Subsidized Loan: $4,500 @ 3.4% w/ $76.00 in interest
-	Stafford Subsidized Loan: $5,500 @ 3.86% w/ $106 in interest
-	Federal Perkins Loan: $5,000 @ 5% w/ $0.00 in interest
-	(all interest rates are fixed)

&amp;nbsp;

I’m really fortunate in that my parents are letting me live at home for free for the next few months. So no rent, food, or utilities costs. I’ve picked up some seasonal employment while searching/applying for jobs relating to my major. Should be working about 25-30 hours a week @ $11.50/hr (before taxes). I’m doing some odd jobs for family @ $15/hour (cash) and should pick up another 5-10 hours doing that for the next month.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t currently have an emergency fund in place, so I was thinking my order of operations is to first knock out my credit card debt in the next few weeks, then start putting money into an emergency fund and tackling my Stafford loans. But here’s where I need some help. 

&amp;nbsp;

-	Which loans should I tackle first? Any advice on types of repayment plans? The Unsubsidized 6.8% loan is hitting hard with the $546 in interest, so I’m thinking of trying to pay that down  as much as I can while paying minimum amounts on the other loans
-	Should I pay off a huge chunk of my student loans with the $4,500 I’m getting back from the state? Or reinvest it as savings elsewhere?
- I'm doing all of this with the hope that I'll have a job in my field (Marketing) by late January/early February. I'm hoping to move out at that point (to major US city), so I'm trying to take advantage of my minimal living expenses while I can. I'll need to save up money for first months rent (looking to sublet from a friend), cause I doubt I'll get any sort of relocation/signing bonus from the types of companies I'm applying to. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm definitely fortunate with my living situation and the fact that I have a seemingly manageable amount of student debt, but I want to take the steps to stop being an idiot with my money (and get out of my parents basement). Any and all advice or helpful links would be much appreciated.  Thanks so much. "
3s6l4y,1,2015-11-09,Black Purse,Bamabelle97,CreativeTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreativeTales/comments/3s6l4y/black_purse/,"Monica Stafford was dressed in black—a dress, a coat, and thick black furs to ward off the winter air. 
 

She was on a mission.



It was a miserable day, the air frigid and unfeeling, the sky a petulant gray. The chill was getting to her. She would have to stop and take refuge somewhere warm soon.



The cold air was like water. It lapped at her, soaking into her clothes, tearing at her exposed skin, splintering inside her and sucking on her bones. 



But still, her black stilettos clicked on, a staccato rhythm against the cracked gray pavement, keeping time with the large, expensive looking black purse she swung back and forth idly as she walked. 



Richard would be arriving soon.



She used to love him. It wasn’t always this endless spiral of screams echoing down the hall—a struggle of unpaid bills and alcohol. Love used to be so amusing, so charming, so heady and intoxicating. But this January would be thirteen years. Thirteen years married to Richard.



How ironic, she thought wryly. Richard himself had always been the superstitious one, crowing about all that thirteen nonsense. For once in his life, he was right. 



The nagging scent of deception started with a whisper, and became a shout. Monica was a fair woman; she knew she wasn't the most beautiful girl, and always told herself he would come back. Whores never won, she told herself. The plain yet dependable, lovable wives always won.



Truthfully, what Monica did pride herself on was her housework. She was meticulous about it all, and loved nothing more than a neat, clean house, complete with clean dishes in the cupboard and laundry tumbling warmly in the dryer. Everything had a place. The plates were three finger lengths to the left inside of the cupboard, and the glasses all had to be turned to rest on their rims, three finger lengths way from the plates. Dirty shirts were pretreated, washed, dried, then ironed and starched before being hung on the second rack in the closet, collared shirts first. The bed had to be made, water wiped up from the sink, and each light switch in each room was flicked three times. Each door knob had to be turned three times, and each window sill had to be dusted three times. Monica suffered a severe case of OCD, and because of it her house sparkled. It was a modest little place, with a bedroom, a small kitchen, a living room and a garage, but Monica adored it. A more important feature: a few little orange bottles of pills sitting on the bedside table. The list was long—the aforementioned OCD, coupled with depression, anxiety, paranoia—but the medication made her feel bogged down. Almost like a balloon with a fishing weight tied to the string.
 


She worked much faster, cleaned better, thought neater without the bitter little pills.



It had been a Thursday, and she was sorting her husband’s shirts, looking for elusive stains hidden in the stiff white linens. Richard was messy and this was something she did very carefully. 



This was the whisper: Lipstick on his shirt. A classic cliché. A plump lip print. Just the right half, but still quite obviously a lip print. Candy apple red lips on her husband’s white shirt. She thought back, wondering when she had kissed his collar.



If she had ever kissed his collar. 



Monica had become conscious, with a sudden plummeting pit in her stomach, that she owned no candy apple red lipstick. Candy apple red lipstick was for *those* women. And there was nothing about soft, loyal, pretty Monica that was like them. She bit her tongue. Richard surely was not so stupid as to…cheat on her, was he, to have an affair? Richard could be messy, unfeeling, crass, awkward, and he was fond of his beer, but he was not unfaithful. 



Or so she thought. 



Then it had escalated, thickened. He was home much less often. He was always working late or in a meeting or perhaps at dinner with a coworker- anywhere but at home with his wife. He was less tender, less loving. He never kissed her anymore, much less anything else. When she inquired about his decreased affection, he merely said he was mentally exhausted from work or had too much to do around the house. Sometimes, when he moved quickly and stirred the air, she wondered if she was imagining the light waft of an unfamiliar floral perfume coming off his coat.



Whispers became shouts when he called her on a sleepy Friday afternoon. “Monica, I’ll need you to drop by the keys to our apartment in Boston. I’m taking a few of my men up there for some beer and cards, a guy’s weekend. Things have been tough at the office. Could you do that?”



Monica was suspicious, but didn’t say a word. She was mild and meek, saying that yes, of course she would.



After she finished crying in the bedroom, glanced guiltily at the pills, ignored them, and fixed her makeup, she called Aaron, an acquaintance of theirs. He worked in the same office as Richard, and would surely be invited on the fishing trip.  


 “Hello, Aaron Reynolds. This is Mrs. Stafford.” Monica tried to sound soft spoken as usual.

 “Hello—Monica, right? What can I do you for?” She remembered her reasons for calling him in the middle of a work day, and fell silent, before bursting into an explanation.


“Richard mentioned the fishing trip up to Boston. I wanted you to do me a favor and turn him down. Everything is fine, I just miss him. Do you think you could convince him to stay home?”



The words tumbled out, and she felt ill. There was no noise on the other end of the line except the echoes of her breathing. Her romance with Richard was calm, unruffled, and never the topic of office gossip—she wondered if Aaron even remembered who she was, what she looked like. If she could trust him. 


“Monica, I’m very, uh, sorry…I think something is wrong.”


She didn’t speak. Tell me I’m wrong, Aaron. Tell me you want to go. Tell me you’re leaving tonight.


“Richard told me he was taking you up there this weekend. But I knew better even before you called. I’m really sorry.” Aaron sounded abashed. “This is a bona fide bomb to drop on somebody, especially from me.”

 “Say it, Aaron.” Monica didn’t recognize the whisper of her own voice. She sounded strangled.
 

“Her name is Josie.” Click.


Aaron didn’t answer his phone again, not the second, third, or fourth time she called. His receptionist didn’t ask for a message the fifth, sixth, or seventh.



After the eighth, her number was unceremoniously blocked. 



The next month was a flash. A flash of private investigators, stolen passwords, cameras, printed emails. There was a morbid little beast inside of her that needed to be fed. She needed the details of it all; every meeting, every single phone call, every email. The nasty occurrences turned her stomach and soured her towards her husband. There were almost too many awful features- several times, she had read a vulgar email and shuddered, bursting outside for some fresh air to calm her roiling stomach. 



It was uncomfortable for Monica to remember, hiding it all from Richard. Monica was naturally painstakingly addicted to detail and honesty, but delighted in the sore thrill of such a secret. 




She would make him pay for this perfidy.
And so, on this freezing Friday afternoon in Boston, she was walking down a busy street towards a crowded coffee shop, clutching a letter in her gloved fingers. 


**“Dear Josie.
Looking forward to our meeting in Boston. Let’s meet at Best Brew, three o’clock. I’m buying! I have been missing you. Please wear that beautiful hair down and that black dress. You look stunning that way. We have an entire three days to ourselves this time, before I have to return to Vanilla. She has nothing on you. Don’t worry—only a little time until you have me all to yourself. Love you.
 Anxiously waiting, Richard.”



Josie, indeed. It had taken quite some time to find ‘Josie', but time and money heal all things. Her name was Josephine Woodsen.Truth be told, she was striking—long red hair, clear blue eyes, perfect, sparkling white teeth. She was fair and exquisite, —she had graduated two years ago, and was an intern in the office suite two doors down on the floor where Richard worked. She made a decent salary, had no children, and was pleasant enough. 



But Monica hated her. 



Hated her for being more beautiful than she. Hated her for stealing her husband. Hated her for her hair and her lips and the fact that she knew Richard had a wife and slept with him anyway.



The ‘Vanilla’ comment had not been lost on Monica. 



He drove her to do this. She did not want to hurt him, but she detested that woman. And because he was coupled with that, he was guilty. She felt such a strong bitterness that she knew she wouldn’t miss him.



And after all, a quick, clean break heals the fastest. That is how it would be—quick and clean.



Monica faced the warm, cheerful windows of the Best Brew Café, and checked her wristwatch primly. An icy wind swirled around her, leeching away the last of her warmth, just in time. 
 2:57 pm.
 She steeled herself, fingered the cool metal of the revolver inside of her purse, and strode resolutely inside."

I did pretty well as a 1L: top 10%, wrote on to a journal (not law review) and had a decent summer internship at a small firm in a small market that I have no intentions of going back to. 

Struck out big time at OCI. I want to do transactional work, but don't have the experience or accolades employers at OCIs are interested in.  My school's career services office is pretty much shit. They have a few litigation based internships and some public interest jobs that I'm not interested in. 

I feel like I'm way behind the curve. Fall semester is almost over and I have no idea what I'm doing. My grades are decent, but I have no real network in law due to my lack of experience in the area I'm interested in and lack of family/friends/etc. The majority of my friends already have offers and are set to go, while I'm still hopelessly stressed over it. 

To make matters worse, I will very likely be moving out of state after 3L to a market I am unfamiliar with. Does anyone have some advice to offer? I realize others out there are worse off than I am, I'm just having a hard time coping with the difficulties of finding an internship/real job after school. "

I am currently a junior chemical engineering student here in the US. I am interested in applying for some form of internship in Mexico for this upcoming winter and/or summer. 
 
I spoke to a professor of mine who worked in Mexico about my interests and she told me she would contact a few of her friends and let me know if they had anything available for me.

I also wanted to apply to places myself, but I don't know how to go about this. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough, but websites I've visited don't have an application process or job listings for branches located outside of the US.

I'm considering sending emails and making calls, but I'm not sure if that is the right way to go about it.

3s7cjb,2,2015-11-09,My [22 M] Most Recent Failed Relationship with My Ex [24 F],sympathy_throwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3s7cjb/my_22_m_most_recent_failed_relationship_with_my/,"Hi, /r/relationships. I guess to be blunt, I'm just looking for sympathy. Just graduated this past May from college, and as a result, a lot of my closest buds have moved away or aren't really available to talk about this with as we all learn to adult. And even then, most are pretty inexperienced when it comes to dating, so it's hard to really have a sustained talk with them. So I guess I just need an outlet to talk about a breakup experience I just went through (over and over).

To put things in context, I dated my ex starting the middle of my sophomore year of college. Before I entered college, I had made a decision to only date someone if I thought she was someone I could marry, and as a result, she was the first I dated in college. Hopefully that speaks volumes about what I thought of her. She was a senior, but had another year left since she had changed majors during her college career. And in all honestly, things were great for that first year. I loved her and she loved me, and there was no doubt about it in my mind or my heart. I was an in-state student and she was from far out-of-state, but that wasn’t of any consequence.

But comes the end of her final year in school (so the end of my junior year) and she starts panicking over her future and the onset of reality. She had in a sense been forced to study her current major due to some family issues and complications, leading towards a career path that she had no motivation for. She had no idea what she could do to get out of that imminent future, and that then led her to question our future as a couple, as she was set to move back to her home state upon graduating. We had already had a minor rough patch that previous summer as we came to realize she was a very out-of-sight, out-of-mind person. And so with long distance looming, coupled with an unforeseeable professional future, she started treating me like garbage. This person I had cared for and still cared for began lashing out and being unresponsive to her closest confidant (me). 

But I understood. And I gave her space. And I tried being her listening ear and comforting voice when she would let me. I brought up the issues, and she apologized and promised to try harder, but they were empty. Finally, with finals past us and the future as hazy as ever, I went to dinner with her and asked what she saw in the future with us. This was the girl I had wanted to marry, and despite it all, I still held onto those aspirations. I craved some sort of confirmation and validation that it wasn’t just a dream, but a legitimate possibility in our future. But her response was less than stellar.

It was one of uncertainty and spite, constituting to a basic statement of ""I don't even know whether I want to be with you."" And that was it. I ended it there, stating that I didn't deserve to be in a one sided relationship despite my desire to be 100% committed to her. That I had supported her, been optimistic, asked for love and consideration, and still been met with cold shoulders and little consideration.

We went back to my place so she could grab her stuff before she left, and that’s when she broke down, reflected and apologized. And through that haze of pain, regret, sadness, and lost futures, we stuck with the decision because we both felt it to be the best for me.
And so off we went. She went back home to study for grad school exams and I went off to my internship. But that pain was so heavy and fresh, that we kept talking to each other on terms that we didn't know how to redefine. How do you go from being someone's other half to just their friend? The lines had been crossed so long ago, that it was impossible to reset. And eventually, 3-4 months down the line, she asked for another chance by trying a long-distance relationship after reflecting on herself and growing up a bit. Despite my initial rejections, I jumped on it because I still loved her and held hope.

But here comes the wrench. She had an international trip planned to visit family she hadn't seen that fall (so my senior year). And so off she went to what I thought would be a month. But while there, she ran into some people and made connections that allowed for her to start a career in business, a beacon out from the hated career path she seemed destined to follow. And so I encouraged her to take it, thinking that she'd be back in a year and we could try this again. But again, the whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind thing came to play, in an even harsher context since she was now 6000+ miles away. There were times where she wouldn't contact me for days, where I wouldn't be able to hear her voice for weeks on end with the time difference and her inability to prioritize something unseen. And so, again fed up, I ended it after she missed a promised Skype date we had after not having seen her face or heard her voice for 2 months. It was something I’d planned a week in advance, something she’d promised to do, and there was no follow up at all. And my morale and self-worth was deflated again.

Yet, four months into my post-college career, she contacts me. She’d just recently started dating someone in the country she was currently in, and dating him had brought memories and comparisons of me, to the point she reached out again, probing. And here I was, busy with work life, but still recovering in terms of a love life. Like I iterated before, I date with the mindset of marriage. I didn’t want to be damaged goods to anyone (why would I want to do that to anyone?), so I held off and tried to recover on my own. I was vulnerable and still rearing from the second round of rejection, and she contacts me.

I was annoyed. It took her to start dating someone to see what she missed out with me? But I listened as I still cared for her, and she spoke about marriage and a future together once she got back to the states. And I fell hook line and sinker again after hearing those words. So we decided to have her think about it for a month to understand what it means to commit to a relationship. I was willing to try again, but I wasn’t going to be hung up in a “what if” situation for the next 8+ months over a relationship that had such a past as ours. We talked as much as we could given the international and working life constraints, and she showed effort. I had hope again, and was optimistic of a future where she could be back in the states within the next year. And internally, we both knew this was the last chance for either of us to get this right. But fast forward to a week before the deadline. 

Work gets busy, and she has less time to talk. Replies are less frequent, there are less feelings of joy coming from her, and things just fizzle. The final talk happens, and what I hear from her is again that she can’t commit. That she can’t see herself being committed to me and in this situation for the next 8+ months. Out-of-sight, out-of-mind. And I was frustrated. She apologizes, but I can’t accept it. Why contact me, why ask me for this, why bring my hopes up again when you haven’t changed? Do you understand that this is our last chance together? I’m trying to get closure, trying to understand why she would do this again, but she cuts me off and hangs up. But I find solace soon enough, as I knew that this was the right decision. I sent a message to her, saying that I was sorry for my reaction, that this was likely the right decision, and that I hope we can be friends again one day. But what I didn’t expect after this talk was to be staring at an Instagram photo two days later of herself together with the guy she had started dating when she again contacted me.

I’m going to be okay. I understand what an idiot I was, and how toxic she was to me. I know I have things to look forward to and that I’m still young at 22.

But it still hurts all the same.

**tl;dr**: Just got out of an on-again, off-again relationship. I'm an idiot and in pain, so just looking to share and get some sympathy."

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I broke up with my boyfriend (we'll call him R) of 2.5 years this past April. He was my everything. He was my first serious boyfriend, my best friend, my lover, everything. We knew each other for about 2 years before we started dating - during this time, I had a massive crush on him, but he wasn't really interested in me, so I tried to find someone else to like.

 I had a pretty nasty break up in the summer of 2012, and R was the one who helped me get through this. We became very close during this time, but, things were still platonic between us. I confessed my feelings to him on his birthday, and surprisingly, he felt the same way. We started dating shortly after this.

This past year, he moved to the other side of the country for an internship. He was working in a mine located in Fort McMurray -he'd work for 10 days, and then he'd get 10 days off. Obviously, long distance is really tough. We have definitely had our problems throughout the time we were together, but I am someone who is always willing to compromise. Long distance exacerbated the problems we thought that we had solved. I won't really get into that because it's not important. 

I knew that when he moved out to Calgary (we're from Toronto), we wouldn't be able to see each other very often. In the past, we could only see each other on weekends, so it's not like we were going from seeing each other every day to not at all. Anyway, he had promised me that he'd come visit me at least once during his year long internship. We had made plans for either him to visit me, or for me to visit him during my reading week in February 2015. We discussed this in October 2014. Unfortunately, there was an event he wanted to go to that was related to his internship during my reading week, meaning we were unable to see each other. Because of this, he told me that the next rotation he was off, he'd come visit me. Instead of that happening, he ended up taking a trip to Miami...needless to say, I was pretty hurt by his decision since he had promised me he'd visit me. 

Things got really difficult after this. He hinted at breaking up several times, but I really believed in my ability to compromise and make things work. In the end, I couldn't make it work and we broke up.

Of course, break ups are really tough. I think the thing that probably hurt me the most was his indifference towards me. It didn't seem to faze him at all. He was never really someone to express emotion, but I could usually tell when he was upset about something. I feel extremely resentful that he felt NOTHING. I resent the fact that I invested so much time and effort into someone who hardly ever reciprocated. It felt like it was always me giving and giving and giving, receiving almost nothing in return. He told me that I wasn't ""good enough for him."" I don't think I have any romantic feelings for him anymore...but, I think I'm having a really hard time getting over the fact that he was so indifferent.

First, does anyone know of any companies hiring interns right now? I've seen a bunch of postings for the summer, but I'm looking for something in the spring or even earlier if they're available. I've been sending out my resume like crazy but I was wondering if anyone had a good list of potential companies. Also...would startups be hiring interns? If not, would it be weird to be like ""Hey, I'm looking for experience, would you want a free worker?"" 

Also, networking. Does anyone have advice on this? I've been looking up meetups but I'm wondering if there's anything else I could do to find people in the industry to connect with. 

Anyways, thanks guys. I could use any great wisdom y'all have."
3s8dtc,3,2015-11-09,"First job pay raise, awkward position",frustratedtw11,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3s8dtc/first_job_pay_raise_awkward_position/,"I need advice on where to take my young career.

I am 22 years old, and just graduated from college. I've been working for the same company for just over 2 years, 1.5 as an intern and 7 months in my current role.

When I transitioned from an intern to my current role I expected that I would continue on a similar role. I was essentially an underpaid analyst, and I had 4 job offers within the same company by the time I graduated. Since I didn't expect my role to change I asked for what I thought to be a fair wage (55k), but on day one my role and my manager changed (from what was stated in my contract).

Today I manage over $20M in assets, my boss is brand new to the company (joined at the same time I became full time), and I keep getting pulled into new projects. I fully understand that the experience I am getting is invaluable, and I do like the company I work for. But while salary is not a motivator, I feel grossely underpaid.

I am about to start searching for another job, I think I can do a lot better as far as money goes and I would love to work for a younger company. I want to ask my boss for a 25k increase, given my responsibilities and my performance this year, but even then this past feel months have taken a toll on me emotionally.

My boss is happy with me, but rarely provides feedback and gives me tons of autonomy. The position was created specifically for me, and although I have the exact same responsibilities as everyone else in my department, I am 15+ years younger than the second youngest member of my department.

I hate the position I am in. I don't feel like I am doing a good job yet at the same time I feel like I am over worked (10-12 hours a day on average + 50% travel),  but my boss is happy with my performance and I keep getting pulled into new projects. I feel like I've been given a fantastic opportunity but the pay and company culture are atrocious (love the people at my department, but hate the old-school processes at the company).

Should I be looking for other opportunities? I'm feeling extremely depressed, I have struggled to put in the long hours, and I think I could do better."
3s8mq4,1,2015-11-10,I need advice on How to enjoy the game again.,The-RagingGinger,blackops3,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3s8mq4/i_need_advice_on_how_to_enjoy_the_game_again/,"So I'm in my freshman year at Uni, and growing up I loved playing COD and video games in general. Until a couple years ago. 

I'm clinically depressed (long story: not relevant) and I just have a really hard time enjoying the game, unless I'm doing good. If I'm going negative in a match it makes me feel like my blood is boiling and like a failure to a certain degree. 

I used to play with friends on my 360 and ps4, but with money from my summer internship I built me a badass gaming pc, and I guess that the only way I used to be able to ignore my anger at me doing bad was because I was at least having fun screwing around with my friends.

Any tips on how to enjoy playing again? Has anyone else gone through this type of thing or is it just me?

Tl;Dr 
I used to enjoy playing but now any time I'm doing bad in the game i get really angry at myself (not at others or vocally) and I question why I play at all)."
3s8nhr,5,2015-11-10,Feeling surprisingly sad tonight.,Always_hopeful,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/3s8nhr/feeling_surprisingly_sad_tonight/,"I guess a bit of background first:
I had my daughter a few months after I turned 18. I took a semester of college but didn't go back the second semester because I was unsure of what I wanted to do plus being a single mom is expensive and tough. It wasn't really worth the effort at the time without an idea of what I wanted to do.

About a year and a half ago I decided to get off my butt and finally go back to college (I'm 27 now). I've had my major picked for a while now and was finally in a situation stable enough to give it a go for reals this time. I completed my first year and this fall I started on my second year. 

This semester I'm taking an intro class to learn more specifics about my major: what I'll be doing, steps to take to finish college, steps I'll need to take to get a job, so on and so forth. It's a bit of an unusual/unknown major so this has been super informative and helpful.

Today in class we learned more about internships: How much they cost, what requirements you need to get an internship, what's expected of you once you have said internship, etc.. Basically, I'll be somewhere in the US that's not my hometown for three months. I'll have to totally relocate for that brief period and leave my family behind. Oh. Also I just plain won't be allowed to have a job. 

I'll have to admit, this all sounds kind of awesome. I mean, it's going to be a lot of work, but internship plus the class that goes with it seems like less than full time work, full time school, and full time mom. I've had my daughter my entire adult life. It'll be kind of cool to see what life as an adult without dependents is like. My husband is super amazing and supportive so he already knows that when the time comes, he'll be in charge without me for a while. I have full faith that they'll do just fine without me.

Here's where the sad part comes in. My daughter is already 8, almost 9. The age gap between her and my next child gets larger by the day. Hubby and I have already decided we absolutely don't want to have a kid immediately so we can have a month long honeymoon in Europe next fall, but if we don't have a baby now we'd have to wait until after my internship to get pregnant, and even then we would probably want to wait until I get an actual job because even though it's not supposed to matter, oftentimes people don't like hiring pregnant women or new moms. 

That would mean starting over with a new baby as my daughter enters her teen years. We would be starting over. From scratch. That idea is a bit daunting for me: going from being close to an empty-nester only to start over from the beginning and tack on another 18 years before I can even start to look at being child free. As I said earlier, I've had my daughter my entire adult life. As much as I love having her and have loved raising her, I don't know if I want to do it again. At least not so far down the line.

Basically, it hit me today in class that I have to decide right now if I want to pursue this career or have more children. The choice was obvious to me: pursue the career. The more I learn about it the more I love it and the more I want to do it. I'm sad we have to go through all of these classes because I just want to jump right in! 

That being said, even with the obvious choice and the excitement for the career path, I felt a crushing blow to my chest to consciously make that decision. I started crying in class and was mostly able to contain it until I had to talk to the professor after class and I started full-on crying. 

She offered me other solutions but they all basically elongated my college career, added mountains to my already too large pile of student debt, and would mean not being able to get a job in my field until after my getting my masters degree (due to changing requirements in my field). I don't want to do any of that. 

It's now or never with both kids and career and I chose career. Sure. Things may change down the road and who knows, maybe nature will take away our choice (although my IUD has been doing its job incredibly well for quite a while now and I'm not ditching it any time soon!), maybe we will change our minds, although I don't really see that happening as I was already on the fence about having more kids anyway. 

Tl;dr- As it stands right now, I'm a one and done, and I'm ok with that. Mostly."

Undergraduate Instititions: Florida Atlantic University, then University of Central Florida , community colleges here and there
Cumulative Undergraduate: 3.25
Cumulative Undergraduate Science: 3.18
Post Bach GPA: 4.0 (Only for one class… I retook Orgo I and earned an ‘A’)
BCP: 41 hours, 2.86 GPA.

Yes. That’s right. I have earned my fair share of 'C's in prerequisite classes. The number of ‘B’s outnumber ‘A’s in the rest of that mix. I’ve included this statistic because I want to make a note of two things. One is the importance of an upward trend. My ‘C’s were all during a rough time in my life and I rebounded after that year and came back with better grades. The other point is that some of you are like me in the sense that you came in from high school with 40-something credits. I’m not saying this to brag. I’m pointing out that I came into college with most of my “basic sciences” done and jumped right into more difficult classes. I didn’t even take physics I and II thanks to AP/IB tests. So this number may be artificially low due to the credits included without grades. Most of the classes I received grades for were upperlevel classes.Maybe admissions noted that... maybe they didn't. I'll never know.
 
GRE: Q 554 (56%), V 558 (78%), Writing 5.5 (98%)
 
Employment:
590 hours in computer repair (I started off computer science and this was one of two jobs I worked freshman year. The other was food service)
480 hours Microbiology QA Intern
810 hours Lab intern (not research)
2,160 hours Emergency Department Scribe (GREAT experience, highly recommend)
150 hours (but add to this 40 hours a week since early May) ED Scribe Trainer
 
HCE:
48 hours Medical Missions Trip to Costa Rica
36 hours (plus 15 hours a week since May) volunteer Phlebotomist in a local free clinic
220 hours as an unlicensed Medical Assistant in a local clinic
(Also see ED Scribe)

Research: 70 hours
Shadowing:
440 hours Podiatry
40 hours Internal Medicine
 
Volunteer:
500 hours fundraising for a local charity and organizing events for them
52 hours of doing crafts with terminally ill children
20 hours for Missions Trip (I broke the same trip down into different components. Did NOT double dip. Split up the hours if you want to list them in multiple areas, DON’T double them.)
48 hours at Camp Boggy Creek (Also, if you live in Florida, HIGHLY recommend! If you live in other locations, google “Serious Fun Camps”. They’re fun and a great way to get meaningful hours)
 
References: 1 PA, 1 MD, 1 Employer (These were excellent reviews. Make sure these people KNOW you. I believe these were my saving graces as they likely backed up the things I said about myself in my essay and supplementals.)

Schools Applied To: You can bet with my grades, I cast quite a wide net. I applied to most schools in Florida. Then Stony Brook, Albany, Touro in California, and Baylor.
 
Interviews: South University Tampa, Stony Brook (As of 11/2/15)
 
Rejections: South University Tampa, Albany, Touro.
 
Acceptances: Stony Brook, My NUMBER ONE Choice!!!
 
Pending: All others, plan to withdraw
 
This is my second attempt. Let me just say something here.
 
I have two ‘W’ on my transcript. I retook neither, though I planned to essentially retake all prerequisite courses if I was not accepted this cycle.
 
I know. That’s a pretty rough track record. Why would any school accept that? I wouldn’t accept that.
The answer, I think, is that I made up for it. I didn’t look back, didn't make excuses, and I put everything I had into recovering from my grades in the past and improved on future grades. I had a reason for my poor performance and I made it known as a learning experience and proved that I learned from it. Don't use me as an example of ""it's alright if I get a bunch of 'C's.."" because it is DEFINITELY better to have 'A's. Slacking on school makes it harder on yourself, and I wish I was able to do better in the beginning.
 
I volunteered and worked a lot to prove myself. Some days I worked days and nights to show that I was passionate about my goals, especially after being rejected from all schools my first try. I really put the pedal to the metal this year, if you know what I mean. And I found wonderful people who I knew would write wonderful things about me in my references.
 
Low GPA people, you can do it! But you absolutely need to put in the work. A LOT of work. Show the admissions committees that you are a person that is unique and more than just numbers on a page (especially if those numbers are mediocre). Let your application build a consistent story of who you are, and when you interview don't be afraid to let your excitement show through.
 
Getting into this school is a dream come true for me. It was my best-case scenario and I used the idea of maybe being accepted to Stony Brook as my motivation. And it worked! If people like me can make it, then so can you! Good luck to everyone.

This is a 2nd career for me, and I did not have an impressive application because of my Undergrad GPA, but my Prereq GPA was 3.5ish  and my post bacc GPA was 3.7ish which included pretty much all the prereq's.  It took me 2 years to take all the prereq's and get experience as an EMT, but it was well worth the work and wait, I now have a new career as a PA on the horizon.  Plan well, work hard, and be willing to make sacrifices if you want to be a PA.  I quit a good job and good salary to take a very low paying job as an EMT just to get experience for my application, and spend almost 2 years taking night classes and working during the day just to meet the minimum requirement of programs so I would be considered.  I love my wife for supporting me through this endeavor.  Make it happen if this is what you want.

Comments: This was my first year applying, and although I was a competitive applicant, I really hindered myself in that I did not have experience in participating in a high-level professional interview. My first post-interview rejection was 100% due to my lack of confidence and demeanor. However, I was fortunate enough to have multiple interviews to hone my presentations and confidence. This paid off in the end, as I was accepted to the final two schools where I interviewed.
 
Also, to current applicants, my only advice to you would be to thoroughly research the mission statements of each school to which you apply. I would suggest reviewing faculty profiles as well, to see if the areas in which they practice match up with your intended area(s) of specialization. There were a few schools at which I interviewed (whom I will not name) that I felt were misleading in the mission statements on the school websites when compared to the interests and goals discussed by faculty at interview.

As a 2nd year applicant I posted this because I want people with lower GPAs to still have hope. Last year I applied VERY late (like November late) and wasn't even given a chance. This year, I went back and took some extra science classes, continued to gain HCE, and started volunteering. I also believe that my LORs and PS were VERY strong, which definitely helped compensate for my low science GPA. YOU CAN DO IT! Don't give up, and remember why you started this thing in the first place!

3s8ter,6,2015-11-10,[QUESTION] Advice for a college senior graduating next semester and moving to LA,reed1088,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/3s8ter/question_advice_for_a_college_senior_graduating/,"Hey guys,

I'm currently a senior in college, majoring in film production, with one more semester left at my school. However, I'm kind of going through a dilemma right now about my plans for next year. I want to move out to Los Angeles next summer after I graduate because I have aspirations to write. I know that it's rare for people coming straight out of college to get writing gigs (freelance, writer for hire, etc.) so ideally I would love to get my foot in the door by interning somewhere or just working a day job, or both if need be. The only problem is, I feel like I'm going to LA blind. 

Internship summer applications for many production companies and studios aren't open yet but I've sent my resume to a couple already and followed up with them and they've told me they saved it in the system. I plan to follow up with these companies plus call the rest of the ones on my list as it gets closer to the Spring/Summer. So to say the least, as of now I don't have anything ""locked in"" for next year. However, that's not the only tricky thing I'm trying to work through. This past summer I interned for a major television show, and I feel I made a pretty good impression, but it was in the post department. I got to connect with a couple of the producers very well and the post team: all of whom believe that's the field I'd like to go into. I really loved every second of the internship but the truth is, my passions aren't in post-production: I actually love writing and I know that's what I truly want to do for career. I have several screenplays written in a few different genres (dramatic TV pilots, feature films, horror, comedies, etc.) a couple I've even directed because I just love doing it. As of now I'm writing another dramatic feature. I've kept in contact with the people I worked with during my internship because they're amazing people, but I don't know if I should tell them I plan on moving to LA to pursue a career in writing and not post. 

Lastly, my school offers a program for the summer that gives students who are still enrolled or graduating an opportunity to go to LA, intern at a company, and supplies you with housing. Here's the catch: it's $6,000 (not including airfare and traveling around LA) and you have to find your own internship. Finding the internship isn't the thing that concerns me, it's just the cost. I can't afford to pay that much money at the moment, but would it be worth taking out yet another loan for this? I'm aware that most internships are unpaid, which I'm completely fine with, but I'd like to work a weekend job or something to help me pay off loans and etc. and the program won't let me do that. I have about $3k saved up from working various summer jobs, etc and my parents are not helping me pay for anything once I move out like loans, etc (which is also fine). I do own a car but it's not in any condition to drive to California so I might need a new one by next year..  I guess the real question is: should I do the program and take out a loan, or should I just move out there myself and save some money? And if I move, should I rent a car and just fly there, slash, do I need a car in LA? I've been to LA a couple times and really liked it but I got around via the metro system. I'm just not sure if an intern would need a car for a production company because I always hear they do. Also if I do move out there, how should I go about finding a place to stay? 

I don't know if this helps, but my experience includes being a PA for a film award event in LA this year, which created a couple connections for me out there so I'm not completely alone, and working different ""below-the-line"" jobs for several student productions. I'm really hungry for this industry, I guess I just need some guidance.  Oh and I forgot to add, ideally I would love to go on the ""studio path"" for writing- so would it be best to try to get an entry level job at a studio or at an independent production company? I saw the ScreenCraft article and loved it, but how does a student essentially begin their career in writing?"
3s8vnj,2,2015-11-10,Trying to plan life post college (Budgeting),glowstatic,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3s8vnj/trying_to_plan_life_post_college_budgeting/,"Hi all,

This is my first time posting here, so please be gentle. I do lurk from time to time though, and there's always solid advice so I was hoping you all could help me out.


I'm graduating in the spring and totally fucking clueless about what to expect/how to adult. I'm hoping to stay in the bay area, and trying to figure out if I can swing it. I also just got my financial aid restructured and will be graduating with about $12k in debt, which feels a lot less daunting than the original anticipation of 20k. (woo hoo!) 

I'm here because I've looked for a personalized budget calculator/expense calculator and haven't really found what I'm looking for. I'm trying to get a realistic sense of how much things cost, and whether or not I can stay here given the most likely scenario (I find a job that pays next to nothing.) 


I'm also notoriously bad with money. I go out a lot, buy dumb shit, and generally live a lifestyle that I can't really afford. I'm trying to reign that in, but know it will take time to correct my bad habits. That said, I'm trying to be realistic about the fact that my entertainment budget will likely be higher than I should reasonably budget for. 

**Err.... Numbers?**

**Income:**
I honestly have no idea. I haven't even started looking, but I'm fairly qualified and hopeful that my internship might turn into a full time thing when I graduate. I'm a liberal arts major who works in media, and I'm planning on applying for junior editorial things. Obviously this is all contingent on me finding a job, but let's just assume entry level position and shit pay, because that's basically where the market is. Worst comes to worst, I am a really bomb server and could probably make pretty decent money waiting tables/bartending. Friends who recently graduated seem to be making about 20-33k annually in similar fields. I'm averaging and hoping for 25k. 

Savings:
I also have about $1000 in savings, which isn't good for much other than a rainy day cushion.

**Mandatory spending**

**Rent:**
I'm trying to live in Oakland, CA where rent is between $900-1200 a month (with roommates, yikes). Electric at my old apartment was about $60-100 a month, so hopefully that'll be about $30 a month (shared). No idea about water, never had to pay for it in an apartment here.

**Transportation:**
I'll likely be commuting to san francisco 5 days a week. (via bart which is stupidly expensive) My mom is planning on giving me her car (2009 toyota prius) but I honestly don't know if I need it or can afford to maintain it. I'm fine with not having a car. 

**Insurance:**
I'm also planning on remaining on my parents health insurance for the next 2 years. (till 26 woohooooo) Renters insurance is a thing, but I believe it's cheap, no? 


**Debt/Goals**
Student Debt:  :'(
$11000 in unsubsidized loans 
and $1500 in subsidized loans
Ideally, I would like to make payments of $200 a month, but I 
realise this is unlikely in the beginning.

I don't have any credit card debt though! Woo hooo. 

**Discretionary Spending**
Media:
My phone bill is roughly $80 a month, I pay for prime student and I'm on the family's netflix account, so I just need internet which I think is around $40-60 for this area. 

Food:
I'm pretty good at grocery shopping for myself and can probably get away with spending $50ish a week on groceries. I keep a pretty scant pantry, and will likely spend more than that on meals out/coffee/ect. Currently, I about $100 a week eating out/socialising. Also, if I'm eligible for EBT I will be applying for that. 

Other Spending: I probably spend about $100 a month on misc stupid shit.

So here's my question r/personalfinance. Can I do it? What am I leaving out? Will I ever pay off my student loans? I have no fucking clue what I'm doing and any help would be kindly appreciated. Thank you! "

&amp;nbsp;

###**Summary**

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

*A voice spoke suddenly, echoing toward her from the darkness: “Blow out your candles, Princess.”*

&amp;nbsp;

*Sweet Tooth* is a suspenseful and taboo tale about a woman, who - with the help of an eccentric younger man - finally overcomes her life-long ‘sweet tooth’. Expect a surreal, playful story about a unique Dom/Sub relationship, told in thirteen gloriously messy chapters. *Sweet Tooth* is intended for readers looking for a long-burn with an explosive climax.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

###**Author's Introduction**

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Before we start, a quick word; just between you and me, dear Reader. If you intend to read *Sweet Tooth*, then this will be the first step of a long journey which we’ll be taking together; so lets stop now, briefly, and talk.

&amp;nbsp;

I do hope you enjoy this bizarre little tale as much as I’ve enjoyed writing it; though, to be honest, I’d understand if you didn’t. *Sweet Tooth* is a story that caters to a very specific appetite: one with insatiable cravings for sugar rushes and orgasms. The state of mind I was in while writing this story felt not unlike that of a child, who compulsively shovels handful after handful of candy into their mouth, despite knowing it won’t make them feel very good.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

###**Chapter One:** *No Choice*

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha sat at her desk, anxiously chewing on a lollipop-stick and scanning the office beyond her cubicle for near-by co-workers. She spotted Simon - the intern - brewing coffee in the break room, and Meghan - her boss’s latest bombshell of a secretary - who’s head was currently bent over the photo-copier, trying to unjam what looked like a particularly nasty tangle of shredded paper. *No one would notice if I did it, right now,* Samantha thought to herself, feeling her heart beat against the inner-wall of her chest. *Right now… I could…*

&amp;nbsp;

Still clenching the plastic lollipop-stick between her teeth, Samantha glanced back down at her phone, which sat on-top of her lap, like a bridge between her round thighs. The text message she’d received a minute ago still lingered on the screen, stubbornly, as if to give her no option but to submit: **“Change of plans. Meet at my place. 2 PM. No later.”** Then another text, directly below that one: **“You’ll have to leave work early, no choice.”**

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha reached into the drawer of her desk and pulled out a fresh lollipop. This one was strawberry flavoured. She tore the wrapping off, discarded it in the bin, then tossed the sucker into her mouth. Samantha gnawed on the lollipop, watching for any sign of her boss. Moments passed, but she didn’t see him. *Right now,* Samantha decided. *Go right now…*

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

###**Chapter Two:** *Without a Trace*

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Meghan looked up from the photo-copier briefly as Samantha strolled past, but she didn’t seem to register her co-worker’s early departure. *Phew,* Samantha thought. She continued toward the door labeled 'stairs' at the end of the corridor, suddenly feeling very self-aware of how little her body-type suited stealthy scenarios such as this.

Simon waved to her through the break room’s window as she passed, with a grin which seemed decidedly out of place to Samantha. One phrase repeated in her head, like a paranoid drum, synchronizing itself to the tremendous throb of Samantha’s heart-beat: *He caught me. He caught me. He caught me.* Then: *He knows. He knows. He knows.*

&amp;nbsp;

But a moment later, Simon lowered his eyes back down to the coffee brewing in-front of him, wearing that same oddly toothy grin. Samantha realized he hadn’t actually acknowledged anything out of the ordinary. Interns are just naturally creepy people, she thought to herself, closing the distance between her and the staircase at a brisk pace.

&amp;nbsp;

Before exiting through the door to the staircase, Samantha chanced a quick glance over her shoulder. Meghan was still occupied by the photo-copier, cursing at it under her breath. Simon appeared to have spilt coffee onto his tie and was currently trying to soak it out with a napkin. Lets hope no know notices I’m gone, she thought, before disappearing without a trace…

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

###**Chapter Three:** *The Benefits of Discipline*

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

Samantha began to make her way down the six flights of stairs that led to the parking-lot, feeling an embarrassingly spontaneous sweat break-out on her forehead. She’d never voluntarily taken the stairs before - either up or down - but right now, during her *Great Escape*, it seemed the most prudent thing to do. It was the only way to guarantee that Samantha wouldn’t accidentally bump into her boss, Mr. Creighton.

&amp;nbsp;

As Samantha descended, the beads of perspiration on her forehead became denser. If she hurried, she supposed she’d be able to stop at her apartment first, for a quick shower to freshen-up and a change of clothes, before…

&amp;nbsp;

*…before…*

&amp;nbsp;

*Before what?,* she thought, feeling a quivering sense of giddiness. *What does he have in store for me?*

&amp;nbsp;

It was Samantha’s birthday today and she had asked her Master, Jasper, for something very specific: *a surprise*. She supposed for most girls the word “surprise” would carry certain romantic connotations: dinners prepared in secret, names spelt across the sky, a trail of roses leading to a warm bath. But Samantha wasn’t most girls; and more to the point, Jasper wasn’t most men.

&amp;nbsp;

He was 24 - making him younger than her by over a decade, a fact Samantha was never able to stop reminding herself of - and a man of considerable wealth, both inherited and independently-gained. Though they never spoke about the subject of his career, it was clear to Samantha that Jasper worked in finance, in some manner.

&amp;nbsp;

On many occasions - including the day Samantha first met Jasper at the dog-park - he had expressed to her that he possessed neither the desire, time or nature necessary for a conventional relationship; he’d been very clear about that. And indeed, the dynamic they’d shared over the past two months had been a unique one: concentrated intensity, without subtly, without compromise. She’d come to learn that the highly demanding way in which Jasper went about things was, truly, all he could ever be capable of; and, in short time, she’d became dependant on the structure which his dominating personality provided her.
Discipline, Jasper had taught her, when applied right, could be mutually pleasurable - and he had been telling the truth, she now believed.

&amp;nbsp;

There were other benefits that came along with Jasper’s discipline; besides mere pleasure, of course. In the month since she’d met Jasper, Samantha had lost close to twenty pounds. This morning, before leaving her apartment to come to work, her scale had read: **260 lbs // 118 kg**. Two-hundred and sixty pounds was still a very large number for a woman of her short stature, but it had only been a month so far, and already, the difference she felt was immense. And her drive for self-improvement hadn’t waned yet, miraculously; this was thanks to the creative rewards and incentives Jasper provided her, and also, to the strict and unwavering hand with which he punished her.

&amp;nbsp;

3 supposedly 115 ug tabs under the tongue. Immediately following the dosing I was told by a friend that there would be “no drugs allowed” at the party that night, due to certain individuals who were to be there. This did not set a good scene. 


***T: 1.0h***

Riding in the car the night sky was dimming but no visuals were to be had, until I tried to type a text message and notice the letters of the keys bouncing ever so slightly. 


***T: 1.5 h***


We had arrived at my apartment for the pre-party warm up. I immediately began to feel quite elated and found many interactions with a good friend of mine quite hilarious. He’s a strange fellow, but at that time I really wasn’t sure if he wasn’t acting normal. It turns out he was just being weird. While talking to him I began to notice patterns appear on the consistent white brick wall of the hall. Staring down the hallway the end door appeared to bounce from far to close slightly, and in my peripherals the walls were awash with patterns of lines and circles and swirls, all set in dull off-green and other bleak colors. No rainbows here. The patterns would compound and fill more brick whitespace the more I stared. As I suggested to my friend that the walls looked like those of a prison I swear the pattern adjusted to look like bars.


***T: 2.0 h***


At the party, as I watched my friend J’s face flush from healthy to sickly green and emaciated and my stomach ached to high heaven I really thought things were going downhill. I noticed my buddy M was wearing a vest and, completely forgetting the purpose of the party, I assumed it must be his birthday (why else would he dress like that, I recall thinking). Feeling like everyone was staring at me and with patterns and swirls of dull color sinking in I decided to leave. In the cool outside air there were no visuals, just feelings and stomach pain. 


***T: 3.0 h***


Walking in the freezing cold I entered Dairy Queen, immediately noticing that the blacks of peoples’ eyes were warping and spilling into the colored area, as if an ink bubble punctured by a needle. I found, in something I’ve never been able to replicate, that if I focused on a certain part of the room I was quite literally able to isolate the sounds from there, as the background noises seemed to fade away. I continued to feel more and more ill. 




***T: 3.5 h***


Having left the DQ I went to Wendy’s, having no idea why I could ever want more food. I started, writing on the back of a menu sheet, obsessively writing about what I had noticed from the experience, namely, in what is surely totally subjective and thus not really worth writing about (I now realize). I wrote of things like “pattern-compounding focus”, as I called it, as I noticed the longer I stared at a point the more intense the patterns became, and how they were more interns the closer they were to my peripherals. I noted one instance of what I called “expectation reversal”, where I walked into cigarette smoke and felt as if it were needles of freezing ice on my skin.


***T: 4.5 h***


I had walked home by this point, obsessing every step of the way over why, when outside and in the cool air, walking with a purpose, I couldn’t get visuals, but when indoors and under certain circumstances, they were all over the place. While at times patterns wouldn’t appear even indoors, the melting black of the eye was always there, as wells as a pattern of flushing and filling of peoples’ faces, chubby to near skeletal, though not so dramatic.


***T: 6.0 h***


Up until this point I had been lying on the floor. I was beginning to feel quite strange. Visuals would come and go but I found one leg feeling tired, the other restless, one side of my palate dry, the other moist (feeling), and one arm itchy and the other not. Wanting visuals back I popped 3 more tabs, hoping to get 1 hour of overlapping 6 tabs.


***T: 8.0h***


With no more visuals but the strange feelings and morphing eyes still at it, I decided to scrape up 120 or so mg of Ketamine I had left from my last use. Instead of making a line, I made a pile, and shot it so awfully into my one nostril that it was instantly clogged. Guh-ross. 




**THE KITTYFLIP**


***T: 8.1 h***


One of the party-goers who had been back for a time, J, wanted to drink more so I accompanied him to another room of our dorm. I was already feeling intensely strange, and after a few moments of talking, **it** happened:


3 guys were in the room, J, Ja, and K. I was seated in a chair and those three were at my 2, 10, and 1 o’clock respectively, with Ja and K standing. I stood up. I awkwardly (in that messed up ketamine fashion) extended my hand, which was still holding the baggie in it, to my far left and looked at K, making the baggie far into my peripherals. K’s pjs looked like a spacesuit (I later learned simply because they are pure white bottoms and a tight-fitting pure black top – yeah, cause that’s a space suit), and that thought instantly made the baggie in my far peripherals into a window. Outside was the blackness of space and distant stars. I saw spaceships pass in my peripherals as K looked more and more like an astronaut and in that moment, just a few seconds, I was on a spaceship. No questions about why or how or when. I was there, and I was normal. The window returned to being a bag.


The next moment was the most significant of any drug experience I have ever had. Time froze. Literally froze. Sure, in reality I just was “lagging” on the last image I saw, but as things slowed I heard this booming sound of leaves crunching but slowed, or tin-foil/paper ripping but much deeper. I turned my head as I heard myself say “I am going to spend the rest of my life trying to feel like this” and for each small motion of turning, like clicking through a 180 degree view at 30 degree intervals, the frozen image was “updated” if you will, like a stop motion movie, and instantly, intensely, the room was patterned. And for each notch of 30 degrees or so, the pattern changed, the floor changed from tile to a warped cobblestone-looking mess to solid sheets of color as each clicking movement was met by crunching leaves and K, J, and Ja flipping manically between positions. As I stared amazed at the cobbled ground the patterns simply faded and the last frozen pose of my friends resumed into their normal movements as they stared at me.



***Rest of the Night***



I returned to my room, still amazed by how the LSD visuals were non-existent when I was outside, but more so at what I had just seen. For a moment I was in a constantly changing room with the feeling of having time at my fingertips. It was over, I felt miserable, and closing my eyes the ketamine made me feel like I was floating in an abyss, like a womb. I immediately wanted my mother, and for the rest of the night rolled around, inhaled water to remove the horrid taste of ketamine, and couldn’t even read reddit or Quora faster than one word at a time as each word in my peripheral seemed to be written in Cyrillic or Burmese. Eventually I fell asleep, against unrelenting closed-eye visuals.



***Next Two Days***


Absolute depression and misery. But the memories of that amazing night make the, retrospectively (at the time I wanted to die), pain worth it. It was the most intense hallucinogenic moment of my life. I wonder if I will ever top it.





Any opinions, similar stories? I’d love to hear.

But here's the thing;
I can't update the device to FortiOS 5.2.3 without a license. It is currently running on 4.0 (It really needs an update haha..)
We can't buy the license yet because we didn't buy the device yet.
Now I've tried downloading it from the official website and that's not possible.
After hours of googling a solution and browsing forums i'm still without a solution.

Could anyone help me out?

Thanks in advance!

3s9wgd,1,2015-11-10,Just called out on a recent job opportunity,malikanon,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3s9wgd/just_called_out_on_a_recent_job_opportunity/,"So just a few hours ago, I just called out on an internship opportunity and I kind of feel like a loser right now.

I was contacted for interest in a paid graphic design internship for a small business a week ago and I said I was interested so I went to an interview. I honestly felt uncomfortable and I honestly just said I would like to work only because I needed the money. I am currently going through money problems, while suffering depression and going to school and having two other jobs at the same time, along with dealing with other situations (I broke up with my ex of more than 2 years 2 months ago).

Today, I was supposed to come in for the first day but I just felt really depressed this week and again, I felt uncomfortable at the work environment. I did graphic design for a while but it is not something I really want to do for ""work purposes"" or as a career path. I just happen to be good at it and do it more as a hobby. I am flattered that they got my information from probably my old clients and wanted me to work there but I felt that I will probably be more miserable due to the added stress and that maybe my work will not be as good as they expect due to how I will be feeling on some days.

So now I feel like a loser, going back and forth about what I did. I have already done it but I am not the type of person that does that when it comes to jobs/work. 

It just sucks that when I need a week of ""being alone,"" I just can not because of work and school responsibilities and it is not like I can take a day off or something. I feel stuck in a really hard place now."

I've never seen so much carnage. At least the remaining living tiger cubs in my house got to eat well, too.

So, anyway, if you want some relatively fresh intern meat, stop by!  I'll be... cleaning. All week.

My first internship was on the Upper West Side at a highly rated, A-list, five star raved about; now closed, restaurant. Some of the things I experienced while working there still bother me to this day; this event especially. 

Now my rule of thumb when working with fruits, vegetables and the like are to wash them; because well, you never know what may have been traveling with them. Strangely enough during all my time doing prep work I never saw a single raw food touch water unless it was being cooked in it, I suppose that was a red flag right there in hindsight. 

One day in particular after having been there for a while, I remember having to help bring over a couple of boxes of strawberries to the prep area; I was told they were to be cut up for the summer parfait dessert they had going on at the time and to take care with them as they were special fancy imported strawberries or something of the like; so instincts kicking in, I started to take a box over to the sink to wash them only to be stopped and told to just start cutting them and that washing wasn't needed. I thought nothing of it and figured perhaps that it was already taken care of, but boy was I wrong. 

To give a bit of insight as to where I'm going with this; I have a terrible fear of bugs and if there's so much as a tiny bit of slight movement near me that shouldn't be my senses kick in and I'm overly aware of it, and as I started to cut the strawberries and put more onto the cutting board I noticed tiny little black specks which at first I thought were perhaps seeds, start to move.

I froze up; I was lucky they were small and couldn't fly otherwise I would have run screaming out of that place. I ended up staring at the cutting board watching the little bugs climb over it and everything else. I finally forced myself to put the strawberries I had prepped already on the side; wash off the cutting board and started again hoping it was just a fluke.

I took a handful of strawberries, plopped them down taking a good hard look at them only to see it was absolutely not the case; the whole shipment was infested with ""Visitors"", which was stomach churning for me especially since I had already cut up quite a few of them which I figured would need to be thrown away and since they were imported I figured I would get in trouble for not saying anything about it. 
The one who told me to take care of the strawberries came by to bring a few more boxes over and asked how things were going, I explained to him about the bugs I was seeing and apologized for the mistake I had made. I asked him if I should throw everything I had cut up away and said I would start washing the rest of the shipment right away given the situation and he stared at me; dead serious, and told me that no, it was okay, no washing was necessary, that it was protein...

I wanted to leave right then and there; just say screw it, but sadly my grades were on the line and this man held them in his hands. So there I was squashing bugs with my wipe rag so there was no chance they could crawl on me; freaking out and screaming quietly inside my head as I cut up and placed strawberries in bowls that would be later used completely raw in an expensive parfait dessert. In the end a whole lot of people ended up getting some extra protein in their diet; completely oblivious, I had some interested experiences I would never want to go through again; this just been one of a few, and then I warned everyone I knew to stay far away from that restaurant.

Now undocumented wife had appendix surgery and we need hospital financial assistance. Should we still buy a car with our savings? They plan to look at bank statements.,throwawayofcourse0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3san43/us_please_help_married_2_months_ago_employer/,"Sorry for the wall of text. We are in a complicated situation. 

**Background**

My wife came to the US  from overseas as a kid with her family and then overstayed her legal visa because her evil aunt held the passports and used the family as slaves. We met in college and just got married in September. Because of this subreddit, I have been working hard on staying out of debt and saving for retirement. I just graduated in December and have no student debt. As a working student with unpaid internships, my tax returns only show about $8000 for 2014.

My wife cannot legally work. We were waiting on her birth certificate to do all the immigration paperwork after our marriage. Just got that and are finishing the paperwork. Still have about $2000 of planned expenses there. 

**My Current Finances**

I have $15k in a Roth IRA

$7850 in our main credit union checking account

$2000 cash at home from rent collected (planning to use for my wife's paperwork

$13 in another CU that I havent touched in a while

$22 in a Schwab checking account

$69 in a discover checking account

$3810 CC debt (1,800 is revolving monthly expenses on cash back rewards cards paid in full every month. 2k from wedding on card that has intro 0% for 12 more months, paying $50/mo for now on that one)

I make ~1300/paycheck after taxes, next one is Nov 20. (I was 1099 to start, but have been W2 since June so my YTD on record looks like much less than my $40k salary)

Extra income from renting sound system or DJing or recovering motorcycle/scooter seats and is infrequent and not a lot. 

Money after regular expenses goes toward emergency fund/retirement

We recently bought a duplex with 5% down (from selling my motorcycles) and rent out the upstairs to pay most of our mortgage. We collect $950, and pay $1200/mo (total due is really 1050, but we pay a little extra to principal each month to get out of PMI faster. This was a recent purchase and will only add maybe 12k to my assets when you count the home value minus principal owed. It is close to my work so I can ride a bicycle but now winter is coming so I want a car to commute and to take my wife around town and on road trips to see out-of-state family.

**Our Car Goal**

We just bought a $760 car that turned out to be a lemon. The guy who sold it to me cleared the codes first so after buying it I now cannot pass emissions to get it registered unless I dump another 1000 in the car to get it fixed. Lemon laws here do not help us because it was a used car.

My wife and I have been planning to get a certain volvo that was only made 2008-2013. There are very few in my area and most are $15k or more. She loves the look and safety as we plan to have kids soon. I want to make her happy and have been looking nationwide to get a car like that in our budget and is safe and reliable. We have been cutting expenses in all other categories so that we can afford it. Best price I can find is a handful of different cars for $7000-7500 each (well below blue book value) plus 500-1000 to fly out and drive it back or pay to have it transported to us. I have saved up just to be able to get this used car without needing a loan. I know there are good cars to be had for $2000-5000, but this is our 'dream' car and will be solid for years to come, has low miles, and does not depreciate like many other cars. We don't want to just buy any other car and spend money to register and pay taxes if we hope to get this Volvo in less than a year.

**Medical Situation**

I tried to apply on the health insurance marketplace in September to get us medical insurance, but they needed proof of legal status for my wife which we don't have. Since we were still 25, I didn't continue that process because I was still covered under my parents insurance. Now we are faced with unexpected medical bills just 3 weeks before we could get covered by my work insurance.

We are lucky we caught it super early and she is recovering well. When she showed signs of appendicitis, I considered a long drive to Canada because of our lack of insurance but that wasnt an option because I know she would not be allowed back in the US at the boarder.

This just happened 2 days ago and I don't know how much it will be total. I know I will be getting bills from the hospital, radiologist, anesthesiologist, and doctor/surgeon. If I am lucky, these will be around $8-12K total, if unlucky, I have read that the cost could be $30-50K. I will be writing a letter of hardship to all parties and applying for hospital charity to reduce my out of pocket. 

When I visited the hospital they say that they will be looking at bank statements. I know that most Americans who do not have health insurance do not have the savings that I do. I fear that if they see 7-8 grand in my credit union that they will not give me much of a break. If I spend it on a car they might still consider that excessive assets. 

**Options**

Below are the options that I thought of so far.

A) Don't buy the car. Show the hospital all my assets and explain our situation and hope for the best.

B) Buy the car. Show the hospital that I have almost $0 and explain that we need the car to be able to get to work etc.

C) Show only the other bank accounts that have almost no money and no activity. Not list our main checking account and hope they don't find out about it. (anyone with experience from a hospital finance department know if this would work?)

Looking for advice so we can move forward and not have to push the reset button on our finances. We want to have kids soon and continue contributing towards retirement accounts. 

**Frugal Lifestyle**

Used GoodRX to get the best prices on her prescriptions once we got out of the hospital. We only stayed post-op as long as we needed to try and reduce the costs there. I use Mint to track finances and we are trying to use YNAB to better hold ourselves to a budget. We only buy clothes at the thrift store, pay only $45/mo for both of our smartphone plans combines. We cut cable and just have a borrowed netflix account. Renters pay for most of the utilities. Our biggest expenses have been car repairs/insurance/gas on old vehicles and going out to eat, which we will not be doing for the near future to try and stay in our budget, and our wedding, which was relatively cheap.

I don't want to bore you with the details (feel free to ask about anything though) but the current trajectory in my life seems like it is just going to keep getting worse before it starts to get better. The current/recent issue has been job/family related, which has been an issue for a while now but now it is really starting to get worse. Right after high school (I'm 23) I went to art school for dropped out second quarter because even though I like doing art, it would not be a good fit for me career-wise, which my parents (especially my mom) were not too excited about because I did not have an exact plan about what I was going to do after. I went to community college (actually I attend two at the same time for a couple semesters) and transferred to a pretty prestigious university and graduated last year with a degree in Linguistics and Japanese. After graduation I lived in Japan for 3 months with a couple host families to get a feel of Japan before deciding on moving there for work/school and when I got back in January I started looking for work here.

I found my first job pretty quickly and started working for a logistics company to save enough money to move back to Japan, but after a couple weeks I really started to dislike the work and hated getting up every morning. After about a month and a half I quit and was able to get a job with another (rival) logistics company that had less demanding hours, which I thought would be a better fit. The hours were better than my first job, but from the very beginning I was not interested in it at all and the daily tasks were completely different than what I thought they would be. One thing that I liked about the first job was that I would be able to use Japanese a lot of the time and pretty much everyone else in the office was Japanese, but at the second job 70% of the time was English, 25% was Spanish (which I understand as well), and the remaining 5% (at most) was Japanese. At both jobs, there were a couple days I called in sick because I did not want to get up and spend another day there, and ultimately quit the second job after a month and a half too.

The agency found me another job, a sales job that mainly operated online and needed someone to help with the packaging and photo stuff like taking photographs of the products and basic photoshop stuff, which I enjoy doing. I started working there and I was fine with the work there, but after two weeks, the agency called me and said that the main office (in Japan) said that they didn't need my services anymore so they let me go. I went with other agencies and besides one job that I was not hired for, they did not offer anything that I was interested in and started looking for positions on my own.

I found a listing on craigslist for a part-time position for a company that helps organize and arrange internships and training programs for Japanese to train in the US. I got the job, which included do some research about companies and schools here and in Japan, writing a blog in Japanese and English, filling out Visa and other forms, and translating documents and letters, all of which is like the kind of work that I'm interested in doing and is the longest job I've had (4 months). Because the work is based on students and workers coming from Japan to work/train, when it is a down season for applicants and during the end of the year, there is less work and a couple weeks ago I was told because there is not going to be much work, they would not need my assistance anymore.

My main motivation for working as soon as I got back from Japan was to save enough money to start working in Japan teaching English, but even that keeps getting pushed back. Each job I had paid less than the previous job, the last one being part-time working 2 or 3 days a week for minimum wage (which my mom was furious for doing), I have not been able to save much money and in fact have been using the money I saved from my first job for just basic stuff like gas and food. Because I have not been making as much money (though my mom doesn't know about not working at the part-time place anymore or using my savings) my mom keeps pressuring me to find another job, ANY job, that pays more. It's almost every day that she keeps telling me about other people's kids and how they're doing or how I could and should be doing better jobs, which I remind her (which she was very well aware of) that I was miserable at the other places and just like art school, if I am not interested in it and I start getting miserable and depressed and suicidal, I will not stay with it for long. 

Aside from financial reasons, my going to Japan keeps getting delayed. I was planning on going to Japan a couple months ago, but the companies that I applied to did not hire me, and even though I currently in various stages in the hiring process with multiple companies/programs, it seems like it won't be until spring of next year that I will be able to leave. I applied to a program through one of the agencies mentioned before and had my final interview about two months ago, and even though at the end of the interview they said they would have their decision in about two weeks, I heard back from them only yesterday. The second week after the interview as the week many businesses have off so I was not surprised that they did not contact me and later I spoke with the agency and they mentioned that they would speak with the company, and the company said that they are still making their decision and will let me know in about two weeks. Two weeks come and go without any word from them and eventually (Sunday night-Monday morning) they emailed me saying that they decided to go with someone(s) else. Another company that I applied to over a month ago emailed me a couple weeks after the interview that they would be in my area in the middle of December and would like to meet with me in person, so I would still have to wait over another month before there is any progress with them, and in the mean time I am speaking with other companies/programs that won't allow me to leave until March/April (or even July) of next year. 

I really hate living here, especially at home, and I hate the prospect of having to work another job that makes me miserable everyday and makes me suicidal again. Ever since high school my relationship with my mom has deteriorated and both of us are anxious for me to leave, but it is getting harder and harder for me to leave and I can't imagine having to stay several more months having to deal with her everyday, especially when she finds out that I am no longer working. When I got the email on Monday that I was not hired I started getting really depressed because that was one of two semi-quick options for leaving and I would have to wait another month before I hear anything about the other job, and if that one doesn't work out I won't be able to leave until spring or summer of next year. During high school and the past few years when I was super depressed, I would just lay down in bed and imagine not being around anymore and having to deal with this stuff. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal in that I want to kill myself, but I've definitely imagined getting a disease or something that despite being curable, I refuse treatment and die that way. I don't know what to do anymore. I cannot go back to doing jobs like I did before and I can't stand being at home anymore, but I don't know which is worse, especially since there are a lot of other home problems besides the financial, if I work at a job I hate and get home to even more drama that is just going to compound my depression (along with other issues that I am dealing with). Even though I feel relieved at the thought of no longer living and not having these problems anymore, I don't like that I am relieved by it and want to stop going through this every couple months.

tl;dr: (sorry I didn't think that it would be this long)

I quit my first two jobs in three months because I was miserable there and was let go from the last two. I'm trying to save to go to Japan to work but because of decreasing wages with each job and the last one being only part-time, I have not saved much. My home life is miserable because of this (and other reasons) and hate living here. Financial reasons aside, my Japan prospects are getting fewer and the ones that are left won't allow me to leave for at least 6 months, which I can't stand living here for that long. Sometimes I wake up and wish that I had a disease that would allow me to die without having to kill myself."
3sbjv4,1,2015-11-10,Struggling to find a paraprofessional job,Rice_Dream_Girl,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/3sbjv4/struggling_to_find_a_paraprofessional_job/,"Hi! I hope this is the right place to ask this question. I have been having a lot of trouble the past couple months trying to find a paraprofessional job and wanted some help figuring out why that might be.

I graduated in May with a BA in English from a well-regarded public university. Had a non-education-related internship for a couple months over the summer, and have been looking for parapro since then. I do not have a certification and don't want to commit to getting one without some classroom experience to decide whether I like it and what level I might want to teach. I have a little bit of experience volunteering in an elementary afterschool program a couple years ago, and for the past year+ I have been volunteering to tutor a second (now third) grade ELL student weekly at home. I love doing it and think my experience would be most relevant in a parapro job.

But despite having applied to 50-100 jobs, I have only been contacted for one interview (which I thought went well despite being a very rudimentary 15-minute interview) and didn't get the job.

For a while I was applying to lots of jobs in my county (it's a huge school system), and I was frustrated because it was so impersonal (checking boxes next to vacancies on the AppliTrack system). After a while, I decided I wanted to relocate and started applying to smaller counties a few hours from where I live now (I also started including SpEd positions after learning more about it). Still, no luck.

Am I missing something? Do schools prefer to hire people who are already local? Are they concerned I won't want to stay in the position long-term?

Sorry this has been so long-winded! I really appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this and maybe offer some thoughts. I am happy to persevere with the search, I just wish I knew why this is so difficult. How do people who are *not* willing to relocate *ever* find jobs? Thanks so much for any help y'all can offer!"
3sbrpe,8,2015-11-10,Me [25F] with my ?? [33M] of a few months. Honest opinions wanted - am I in the wrong here?,MaybeTooDramatic,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sbrpe/me_25f_with_my_33m_of_a_few_months_honest/,"For some relevant background: I am an American graduate student who lived in Ukraine for the last few years. Now I study in France. I love Ukraine and am trying to find a job there for summer (EDIT: I have an offer for a summer internship already), and after graduation next year. 

I got to know 'Alex' as a friend last year when I was still living in Ukraine; he was going through a rough divorce and custody battle at the time, so although I sensed we liked each other, a relationship never happened. A month ago, I visited Ukraine to catch up with old friends - and after a few long fb chats, just about life and other topics we are both interested in, Alex told me I could stay in his guest house to save money on a hotel. I took him up on this offer, which I thought was really sweet of him.

I spent a week in Ukraine, and we ended up hanging out every day and night, going on mini trips together, generally sharing our entire life stories with each other. I haven't felt this way about a guy in a long time, and he seemed to feel the same way about me, even saying the 'L' word one night when we were drinking (I know it seems fast - keep in mind we knew each other as casual friends before). Anyway, we were intimate, everything seemed great. 


The night before I flew back to France, we discussed our future - if long distance is something we could see ourselves doing. We both agreed that we saw this as something special, and although it would be difficult, we would give long distance our best shot. It's worth noting that neither of us has ever been in a long distance relationship. I told him I am really busy with school; I do not expect a lot, but I do enjoy getting random, sweet texts (think, good morning, good night, basically anything to show he is thinking of me). I would like to Skype a couple of times a week too, and visit whenever schedules worked out. He agreed with these expectations and promised he would surprise me with sweet texts and calls.



Lo and behold, in the few weeks that I have been back in France, I have been initiating probably 90% of the time. We do talk on FB almost every day, and skype a couple of times a week, but it is always at my insistence. The ironic thing is, I am in a very demanding graduate program, I have a job, a social life, I work out, have hobbies etc - whereas he is unemployed, not in school, and seems to have limitless time on his hands (as evidenced by his sharing articles on FB many times a day). For the record, I have worked my entire life and also, thanks to my family, I have never struggled financially, so to me, paying for trips to Ukraine and paying for Alex and me to have a nice dinner somewhere is not a big deal - in fact, I never even thought about these things until writing out this situation here. Sometimes I think he feels insecure because our interactions might defy traditional gender roles (still pretty normal in Ukraine today). Sometimes I think he is stressed out from the aftermath of his divorce and custody battle, which I witnessed a bit of, very stressful! And sometimes, I think he might just not care about me as much as I care about him. 


Now this is my question. Am I correct in assuming he doesn't care? Keep in mind I initiate almost all of our interactions, whether casual FB conversations or calls. I have discussed this with him before, and he promised to change a couple of weeks ago and initiate more - it has not happened. For example, the other night I got on FB and saw he was online; I asked him how his day was. He told me he had been out drinking with friends, then out of the blue told me he loves me. But remember, I had started this conversation! So if I believe his words, he thinks of me, but just doesn't say anything? It's definitely not a matter of him being busy, but maybe it is something else.


Anyway, I am planning to go to Ukraine this weekend to see him. He told me he is really excited to see me again and spend time with me, even planned a few things we could do together. BUT, he also told me he might not be able to stay up until my plane lands (it's late at night, but still......) and I should just take a cab from the airport and knock on his door till he wakes up to let me in. Even worse, he asked me if I had set up any networking meetings (knowing that I already have a summer job lined up there), and he encouraged me to spend some time with my other friends there. This might seem nice, but the more I think about it, it bothers me that we only have 3 days together and he does not seem to want to see me most of the time. it is almost like he is uncomfortable with having me visit Ukraine with the sole purpose of seeing him.


Yesterday he promised me that he would call me today. He was on FB sharing articles literally all day, I did not initiate contact, lo and behold it's past 1am in Ukraine, he has signed off, and not a peep from him. I couldn't take it anymore and wrote him a long message on FB, which he has not read yet. I basically said everything I have said here, and told him I am having second thoughts about visiting Ukraine this weekend, because I am just not convinced that he feels the same way about me as I do about him. I do not want a one-sided relationship at all, and I have told him so many times what my expectations are and what kinds of communication I need to be happy (Like I said, nothing insane, just a text a day/every other day so I know he is thinking of me, and a couple Skype calls a week). So what else can I do? Should I go this weekend?


(BTW, not much of a language barrier between us. He is Ukrainian but lived most of his life in the USA, and I was born and raised in the USA but I speak Ukrainian. The culture barrier on the other hand might be more than I realize....)


**tl;dr**: Brand-new long distance relationship (American in Europe + Ukrainian). Distance can be closed in less than a year if we want it. I am initiating contact most of the time, even though I clearly laid out my expectations for communication and he agreed. Does this sound like his personal issues, should I be more understanding, or is he just not that into me? Moreover, should I visit this weekend as planned?"

I'm a freshman computer science major at American University in Washington DC. The college has a very small but decent-enough computer science program. I hope to become a digital nomad within a few years of my graduation after 2019, and need some advice with the direction I should go in to be able to live this way. I want to be able to make money with upwork and other freelance work resources. So my questions are:

1) what computer programming languages should I focus on in order to be able to find jobs?
2) is it necessary or a big help, or neither of these to have internship or full-time job experience before taking the plunge?
3) is this realistic? do people who have a few years of experience manage to regularly get jobs and gigs on upwork and similar sites to support themselves?"

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3scnrt,2,2015-11-10,I don't think I ever actually met him.,neofriend,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/3scnrt/i_dont_think_i_ever_actually_met_him/,"When we met a little over a year ago, I was blown away. You were the smartest person I'd ever met. You were from California, where I'd never been. You had just finished a summer of solo backpacking in Europe, and you fed me with tales of adventure, bravery, and spontaneity. I was hooked.

We started dating. You'd been unhappy for a while. You broke it to me that you were transferring, you didn't like our school anymore, you're going back to California. Oh, okay. We agreed not to do a LDR, so the clock was already ticking. Falling in love with a time limit... it was dumb, we were young, that's what spontaneous romantic adventurers do.

Oh? Except, you weren't adventuring anymore. You kept us inside. My friends and I had a falling out, and you encouraged our distance. So I was friendless and only had you. I begged you to let us go out sometime, not necessarily to a party, but just to do something adventurous. No. That's all dumb, you said. California had much more to offer. You drank in pubs in Europe, nothing here compares. Look, that's cool and all, but I've never been to California, and I've never backpacked through Europe. Let's have our own experiences. But you wouldn't let me.

You smothered me. I was made to be needy, having no friends, and though you told me that I was too needy, I bet you liked it. Your foul mood brushed off on me. Where was this fun guy you told me about? I've never met him.

I visited you this summer. I just wanted to explore. I've never been to California. You stifled me for half a year, can't I expect the adventuring now? You told me to be more grateful while I was there. There was some adventuring, but only when you wanted, otherwise I was asking too much. Your friends were jerks to me when you told me they were so much better than the people I had left behind in school. You said we'd party and chill with them? We never did. You broke all the expectations that you fed me and made me depend on. I was needy and horrible according to you and that was when you had it set in your mind to break up with me.

Back to school. One semester left, you've finally made up your mind to leave. You dump me. Here I am, a month later. I made some friends, but you and I still never had fun together. You smothered me, telling me no, that your experiences were better, then you never shared with me. Then you called me needy.

I don't understand. Maybe if I had friends I wouldn't have needed him the way I did. If he didn't keep me from going out while telling me he's had way more fun in the past, maybe then I wouldn't have been so desperate for him to share those experiences. Now he's probably going to Europe again, according to a friend (and I know I shouldn't get updates on what he's doing - I'm stopping now), for an internship. He's probably going to have a blast. He'll be that fun adventurous guy again, the one I never got to meet. He never gave me a chance. I'm broken.

TL;DR but please read my post: Ex made himself out to be a big adventurer when we met, controlled me by keeping me from going out, saying that he's had more fun in other places. Never takes me out when we get to those places, calls me needy (because I hadn't gone out in half a year - I needed some life in me!). Dumps me, probably is going to start having fun again after being depressed while with me. I feel like he never gave me a chance."
3sd07x,8,2015-11-10,"I got offered an internship in Stockholm, and I have a few questions",billsmoney,stockholm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockholm/comments/3sd07x/i_got_offered_an_internship_in_stockholm_and_i/,"Hi, I'm a 21-year-old from California, and I was recently offered a summer internship in Google's Stockholm office. They are giving me a lump-sum for relocation and housing, and of course a salary, but I'm expected to find housing on my own.

A few Reddit threads have recommended Blocket, but since I don't speak Swedish, the site isn't very easy for me to navigate. I've been able to do a bit of research on my own, so here is vaguely what I'm looking for:

- Safe neighborhood.
- 3 month long sublet in the summer, starting in roughly mid to late May.
- I don't need my own apartment, but I definitely want my own private room.
- Access to kitchen would be ideal, but Google will be feeding all my meals during the week.
- Easy commute to Google Stockholm (Kungsbron 2, 111 22 Stockholm, Sweden). Ideally within walking distance, but definitely &lt; 20 minutes.
- Spending around 4000-7000 kr/mo, but I'd be willing to pay a bit more for close proximity to work.

What is the best way to look for summer housing? My Google recruiter suggested that I find student housing in universities in Stockholm, but I'm not sure how I would go about doing that. It looks like the Stockholm School of Economics is pretty close by, so if I could figure out how to sublet student housing from someone there that would be cool.

Housing is probably my main concern, but I have a few other questions:

- How much does eating out cost generally?
- How good is the public transit in Stockholm? I was interning in NYC last summer, which has great public transit infrastructure.
- What are some fun weekend trips I can take out of Stockholm?
- How much will my income get taxed by Sweden? I'll have 14,000 kr for lump-sum relocation, and 24,400 kr/mo in salary. Since I'll only be an intern, I assume I'll be in a lower tax bracket, but I'm not really sure.
- Will I be able to find good Asian food in Stockholm?
- I think I should be able to get by with only being fluent in English at work, but should I pick up some Swedish to understand street signs and whatnot?"
3sdrz7,0,2015-11-11,May have created UFC rewards,Riderslider27,ufc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufc/comments/3sdrz7/may_have_created_ufc_rewards/,"Let me preface my story by saying feel free to bash this because it's a crazy long shot. 

I'm a hardcore mma fan and haven't failed to purchase a UFC ppv since 2004 and I try to consume everything and anything I can and throw around my money at will. Fast forward to March 20th 2014. I remember this day because it was my 3yr wedding anniversary and I was at my local grocery store here in Albuquerque called Smiths buying some wine. I get to the counter and the lady
asks if I have my smiths rewards card. I give it to her and a lightbulb goes off that for all the money I give the UFC every year I could at least get a free ppv or a t-shirt every so often. I rush home and tell my wife and she says ""write them and see what they say"". So like an idiot instead of emailing I went on the UFC website to the customer service section and sent a message to every single department in the drop down box asking if they had ever considered a rewards based program for their loyal customers to redeem for free PPV's or merchandise yadda yadda yadda
And patiently wait for a reply from someone telling me that's a good idea but the answer is no or that something is in the works but thanks for the idea etc. I wait and wait for weeks for a response and nothing so I forget about it and chuck it up as a stupid idea. Fast forward like 5-6mo and the UFC announces they're starting a rewards program. My jaw dropped in shock. Chances are since this idea was so simple it was already in place and someone just didn't feel like wasting their time writing me back. A part of me though feels like some intern or employee could have read my customer service message and ran into someone's office with a brilliant idea.  I don't go around saying I created UFC rewards I just feel like it's possible but my brother in law thinks I'm delusional. I wish I had proof but I'm the dumbass who sent it through UFC customer service where there is no archive instead of my personal email. Don't know why I decided to write this diatribe tonight after a full year of rewards being out. Just a long time lurker and it bothered me by bro inlaw never said yeah it's possible man and instead called me delusional. Guess I just wanted to hear what Reddit had to say. So bash away Reddit bash away lol

http://www.kulturemedia.org/entriesdetails.php?iid=186

**Basic summary:** Two moronic Asians mismanage genetically modified dinosaurs that terrorize a novelty theme park just like Jurassic Park 1, 2, and 3. It's up to squatmaster general, Chris Patt to save the day with the [corniest PR stunt in history](http://theawesomedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Dino0.jpg).

**Kulture Media reviews the movie, The Internship: Asian man gets training to be a disrespected stereotype**

http://www.kulturemedia.org/entriesdetails.php?iid=187

**Basic summary:** In what may end up being Hollywood's masterclass in applying prescriptive stereotypes to the workplace, The Internship pins a whole range of negative stereotypes onto silverscreen punching bag, Yo Yo - yes, Yo Yo. It's a ""clever"" name like Mr. ""Wang"". The two white guys save the day with their ""creativity"" and ""leadership"" skillz. And, in the process beat out Asian tech geniuses, who exist to perpetuate stereotypes.

3se4ag,2,2015-11-11,"Terrified, Angry, Scared, and Drunk About CS (Or Lack Of) Jobs",throw_awa_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3se4ag/terrified_angry_scared_and_drunk_about_cs_or_lack/,"Throw away account. 

I am about to graduate from a CS school with &gt; 3.7 GPA. However, I have not been able to secure a job or an internship in my past 4 years. I have worked on 4 projects, one of which could potentially become my job if it gets VC funding before I graduate. I also own a patent and know 3 programming languages very fluently.

Ok enough of the technical shit. What I'm scared about is that I haven't been able to get very many interviews. I only got 1 or 2 throughout my time at school and I have always been rejected. Yes, I have practiced for these interviews, sometimes to the point of having a mental breakdown where I lie around for an hour doing nothing but crying and laughing maniacally (my last one I went through 200 practice interview questions all on my own).

This is similar in my normal school life. To maintain my GPA, I have studied for all my classes to the point where my mental health is absolute shit and my physical health is starting to show signs of stress. My breathing is irregular sporadically and sometimes my chest tightens so much it is hard to breathe. I have vomited during 4 or 5 final exams (fortunately, I left for the bathroom in time). 

And yet, despite my sacrifice, I am still unable to secure my future. I have been studying and throwing away my social life just to be able to get a good GPA and resume. But with no result. 

I am scared that no matter what I do, I will never be good enough, no matter how much I try or how much of my actual life I give. I am angry that whatever works for 99% of people out there will not work for me. They say that all I have to do is practice and yet, no matter how insane I drive myself, I am unable to achieve. I am frustrated that all my attempts to get a single interview have been in vain. I am scared that I will have wasted all my young life all for naught. And to cope, I've regularly taken to drinking about 1 time a week.

I am absolutely terrified and if it wasn't for the booze keeping me somewhat numb right now, I'm afraid I might even take my own life. But somehow, when I reach for it, I just keep thinking to myself ""Give it until graduation. Give it until graduation.""

I dont know how many other people feel like this but I just feel so hopeless right now. I'm really really scared."

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she?

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent...

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Would there be any benefit to choosing one of these over the other one as far as career advancement opportunities go?  Do people generally get promoted to staff accountant positions from either job?

Would love some advice.,mjsb03,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/3sfcxz/personal_dream_opportunity_bit_of_a_peculiar/,"I'm a senior in college studying marketing, who wants to get into the world of design.


Long story short, my graphic design career began last summer when I managed to basically hustle my way into a graphic design internship role with a huge, internationally recognized company.  I was able to cover up my inexperience by learning quickly on the job, really enjoyed having to learn at such a fast pace, and I improved greatly over the course of a few months of work. 


Unfortunately, however, this company requires that all projects remain confidential until commercial release, so as an intern, I can't add any of the projects I contributed to in my portfolio.


Now, a graphic design internship position has opened up for a company I've dreamed of working for.  As my experience with this initial company was my FIRST experience as a graphic designer and I don't have access to the work I was involved with, I don't have a portfolio.  I would do anything to get the internship with this next company (who, naturally, has explicitly asked for a portfolio).


Looking for advice - Do I take a genuine approach, send my resume, (with likely impressive graphic design internship on it) and explain that I've only been involved in graphic design for a short period of time, and due to the circumstances, I don't yet have a portfolio, BUT I want this job more than anything etc. etc.   ??


OR is there another (better) way I should approach this?

I hate my fucking job, I really want to quit and work as something else if it wasn't for money issues. I'm tired of people saying I should be so grateful that I even have a job after finishing college. ""most people still work blue class jobs, blah blah blah"". I busted my ass in college, working 2-3 jobs a year at times and working over 20hours + while taking the max amount of classes allowed. 

I ended up with a HR who sweet talked me and verbally promised me all these great things if I accepted the offer. Being the naïve stupid person I was, I accepted it. Now I'm stuck in a position where I can get out. The salary sucks, the benefits sucks, but honestly, I was willing to put up with that as long as I got GOOD EXPERIENCE. And what kind of experience am I getting now? SHIT. SHIT that you wouldn't even wish for your worst and most hated enemy. I'm so mad this has happened, I've been here for less than 1 year. I feel like I have learn NOTHING and all I will have on my resume is the time length but not the fucking experience. 

I hate that I have no one to talk to about this. All my friends are making like 60k+ a year with amazing benefits and bonuses and other incentives, great smart coworkers, etc etc etc. My company doesn't offer ANY OF THAT. They THINK they understand the shit I'm going through. They talk like they want new jobs, but they don't understand I NEED A new job. I feel like I'm on the path career suicide and I can't get out. 

I've tried applying to new jobs but its fucking hard when youre in the technical field but you don't have technical experience and your resume shows that you've only been working at the company for less than a year. 

I feel like I've never achieve the goals I want to achieve. I'll never be able to become competitive so then I can apply for B-School (business school) all because I accepted this dumb job. Some days I really think being a waitress or sales person would be better but those jobs can't really support my student loans and other life payments. I hate my life. I just really want to get out of this shitty company. my manager treated me like an intern, making me fetch his breakfast and fucking coffee. Never allows me on new projects. Always assigning on the shit projects that are DEAD ENDS. No one gives a fuck about.

EDIT: Turns out I want to rant some more

I feel like this job is turning me into a bitter hateful person that I don't want to be. I find myself so hateful and toxic these days. Want to get out of this vicious cycle so bad, I don't know if I need to take a leap and just quit and start over somewhere new. "
3sg9gd,1,2015-11-11,Broke up with boyfriend; could I have made it less painful?,throwawa---___y,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3sg9gd/broke_up_with_boyfriend_could_i_have_made_it_less/,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

Some time ago, I broke up with my boyfriend (I'm a girl). This might be long, so bear with me.

We started dating 6 months ago. It came on quite suddenly. I'm not even sure why I started dating him - I hadn't liked him before.

Anyway. Things progressed. We did the regular stuff that most people in relationships did. Things were a little awkward with the fact that his parents didn't want him to get a girlfriend, and because of this we kept things hidden. We couldn't really go on dates. This honestly kinda infuriated me. Then summer rolled around. He landed an internship at some company, so he would be away for 9-5 on weekdays, and weekends were off-limits anyway. We spent the entire summer chatting on the internet for hours each day. Playing games that honestly, I didn't really care for most of the time - I wasn't a games person. We saw each other a total of two or three times over two months. How could I have allowed myself to spend time like this? It was sad that two people completely capable of meeting up didn't. It was stupid. It didn't bring me joy. It didn't bring him joy either. People kept telling me that I deserved better than to sit and take his ""I'm sorry but let's keep this going"". I didn't listen and ended up feeling terrible about myself and the situation. I wish and hope that I could have done something to fix it. I hate that I didn't, but in retrospect, I wonder what I could have done? Break up right away? I just feel terrible that I couldn't or didn't make the right choice to spare myself the pain. 
 
Halfway through summer, things got bad. I started having problems with how he was doing this or that. I tried to tell him. Things generally went haywire. He would say that I'm scaring him when I talk about breakups, hypothetically. I had a nagging feeling that something was seriously wrong and that if I could, I should get out of the situation. I felt so oppressed, though, because I knew I couldn't end it over the internet - that wasn't right. So I kept it bottled. I hated this summer so much and I just felt like I couldn't get it out. I think this hate persisted all to September, when school started. By then, I was honestly done with the ordeal. I just couldn't take it anymore. The feeling of claustrophobia grew, that I had to get out. I felt terrible. I still feel terrible. Then, I had no idea what to do except to break up.

I almost broke up with him the first day of school. I had rationalized a reason of some sort, and I tried to go through with it. I ended up not doing it, giving him a ""chance"", so to speak. I did end up telling him all my reasons for wanting to break up, which he refuted as if we were in a debate.

We did break up at the end of September. I hoped that he'd respect things like ""no contact"" that I'd established shortly after ending it, but that didn't really happen. He still wanted to stay together. After the breakup ensued a 1.5 month-long ""friends"" period, where we weren't really friends but we continued hanging out because I found it too damn hard to just break it off completely. A few days ago, I stopped talking to him entirely. It was really difficult and I feel like I did the right thing, but I feel like it's going to cost me. He's always begged me to give him another chance, that we'd be good together, and that I'd regret this. I kinda do, but on the other hand, I'm pretty damned mad at him for making the summer unbearable, and I feel ashamed that I didn't have the courage or something else needed to make this situation better from the start.

TL;DR: Broke up with BF. Regrets about not doing it sooner/differently, in order to spare me some pain."
3sgegg,2,2015-11-11,LPT Request: How to deal with living with your family for months after graduating? This is an unusual circumstance.,buddboy,LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3sgegg/lpt_request_how_to_deal_with_living_with_your/,"My situation isn't horrible, but unusual, and it is chipping away at my happiness and creating resentment towards my loved ones.

Background: I completed my college coursework spring 2015.  I should have had an internship secured for last summer, but something happened. 

Half way through my last school year, my parents got divorced.(I planned on getting a job near home after college, live with my parents to save money and pay back loans) But after the divorce I didn't understand what my living situation would be, or if I had a home to go back to, and so I never secured an internship for the summer (summer 2015).  I ended up moving back in with them anyway as I made no other plans, and had no real job.

They are currently both dating other people, but *still live with each other* and me as well (only child). Strange but it sort of works. I would have rather been working at an internship, but I was relieved the divorce wasn't as painful or dramatic as I feared, and so wasn't unhappy.

My grandma lives across the street (dads side). She has Alzheimer's and is extremely paranoid. She is constantly convinced people come into her house and is always having me changing the locks (and then breaking in when she looses the keys). She hides things so they won't get stolen but then forgets where they are and calls me for the scavenger hunt, the whole time blaming someone else for ""breaking in and moving things around"". She has accused family members of stealing and called the police on them.

 She is also still technically the owner of a considerable amount of family assets, but is no longer capable of running of them. She is running the family business to the ground and legally there is nothing anyone can do yet. She has always trusted me and I am constantly helping her with yard work, chores and errands.

The problem is my gma against all odds got legitimately robbed last week. She answered the door, 2 men came in, one with a knife, took her wallet and left. You can imagine her paranoia has reached a new level. At any moment, even if its 2 am, she can call me claiming she is scared and wants me to come over. At first I was happy to be able to help her feel better. But its been a week and today she was asking me ""which days I can sleep over next week"". It was supposed to be 1 night, then 2, then 3, now I realize she wants it to be permanent. I can't do this forever. 

Then there is my mom who is starting to behave strangely. She is starting to realize how limited her dating pool is despite her looks for her age and seems to be growing more and more attached to me, the only man in her life. The most benign, short conversations eventually turn into a conversation about my dad which by now is just beating a dead horse. I feel bad, but at a certain point I just don't care, and don't know much longer I can pretend to. She'll have entire conversations with herself with me just nodding along. I could be in my room writing a resume, and shell come in, look at the window, see something that reminds her of a problem she has with my father, and rant outloud for several minutes. I want to be the type of son that is there for her, but I can't fake it or take it anymore, all I can think is ""I get it, he's no good for you, you already got divorced 8 months ago, why are we still talking about this."" It is really getting to me because my dad used to be my hero but she has reduced him.

Then there is my dad. Who does more for his family than any man in the world, but is so horribly unorganized it is like he is constantly bailing out a sinking ship. He has so many little businesses and family things to take care of he is 24/7 running around like a chicken with his head cut off. Any moment he can come in or call me to meet him somewhere to help with some job. This is fine but today he came to my room and said ""I just found you owed $31,000 more in loans than we thought because I forgot about this fed loan"". ( My dad paid for half my college, I paid for the rest through loans which he organized, turns out he isn't so organized and I have to pay a massive amount more than I thought ,plus it gathered a lot of interest from being ignored.). This extra dept means I'll have to live home even *longer* to save even more money.

I love my family but can no longer be at their constant beck and call. I need organization and independence, I need to be the master of my own universe but I just can't if I'm living here and I don't have the heart or the right to really say no.

How I can I live with them but still have a separate life? Or is my unhappiness self made and they are simply the scapegoats?

TL;DR

I am 24 but won't feel like a man until I move out, and I can't, possibly for another year. I am not the kind of person to point fingers, but can't ignore the resentment growing in me towards the people around me. I have a huge desire to be independent, but am 24/7 at my families beck and call. My dad for his businesses. My grandma for her feeling of security, and my mom for someone to talk ~~to~~ at. I want to help these people, but since I don't agree with the way they handle their own problems, many of which are imaginary or self made, it is getting harder and harder digging them out of the same holes again and again. How I can I live with them but still have a separate life?"

The IT Team said they really loved getting to meet you and getting to learn more about you! 
 
Unfortunately it is bad timing for their team right now.  We just hired another Systems Engineer and will have to train him and bring him up to speed starting next week.  They don’t feel like it would be good timing to also have an intern joining the team at the same time. 
 
The whole team agreed that they would love to entertain the idea of bringing you on as an Intern next summer. 
 
Please keep us in mind when we get closer to that time and we will be back in touch with each other then!
 
Good luck with the rest of your semester!"

The smell has gotten him. His feet are on the window and he's standing straight out from us, twenty stories up, like a peg on the side of the building, like an insect, like gravity works perpendicular just for him. He walks across the window with his Oxford shoes squeaking on the glass until he reaches the cubicle where we keep the coffee maker, where he looks down into the building - down for him, which is sideways for us - and he crouches and punches the window until it turns red and dappled from his blood and bits of the bones in his knuckles, and when at last the glass breaks he crawls in and stands up on the floor like the rest of us, like gravity has come in with him, and he puts the knife down on the water cooler.

He's wearing the same suit he had on when he started work this morning, but his hair is disheveled. His tie is loose. He takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and wraps it around his bleeding hand and looks at one of our new interns.

""You think I could make myself a cup of coffee?"" he asks.

""Sure thing, Bob.""

This is Bob from Accounting, and he's having a bad day

--

I first met Bob three years ago when he came in for his last hiring interview at Taterlumps Inc. His shoes were polished, and his beige shirt was pressed, and his hair was over-assaulted in that classic I-have-an-interview look that puts the whole world on the side of a struggling addict, but it was his obnoxiously red tie that made me like him. They hadn't beaten Bob. And he wasn't really here yet, even when Tina, the HR coordinator, waved me over to introduce him.

""Jake, this is Bob Winsall,"" she said. ""He'll be a part of your group.""

""Winsall?"" I asked.

""We'll get to that, but - ""

He touched her with his soft fat hands, like a bloated mannequin taking her by the elbow.

""It's okay,"" he said. ""Yes, Winsall. So, you've heard of my brother?""

""That's gotta suck,"" I said.

He laughed, but Tina told me I would have to talk about what I said in group - but she didn't understand. It's not every day you make a real friend. It's not every day that another person looks at you and thinks maybe you're okay and there might still be something great in you, even after what happened at Volstadt. But that's what I saw in Bob. And I thought he saw the same in me.

--

JOHNNY WINSALL NOW YOUNGEST IN HALL OF FAME

It was Carlos who brought the paper to Bob's first group meeting, and he held it up with his hair slicked back and his smile like a dead turtle's, and he put it on Bob's chair like we were all going to think it was funny. But I took it to the trash-can and threw it away.

""Thank you, Jake,"" said Tina.

""*Thank you, Jake*,"" said Carlos. ""*You're my most favorite. What a guy, that Jake. I bet he eats - *""

The door slammed and Carlos jumped up out of his plastic chair and fell backwards and the chair exploded. And he got up and walked away and lit a cigarette in the corner, where we heard him mumbling to himself while Bob came in - Rex used to say that Carlos was at Volstadt when it happened, and as much as I hated them both I had to believe it.

""Bob, will you bring over another chair with you?"" asked Tina.

The fluorescent lights flickered out. It was evening in November and the dark was at the windows early, but even in the twilight I could see the finesse in Bob's movements, with his fat arms like misshapen squashes somehow bending, as he drew a Krispy Kreme doughnut from its box in one hand and picked up a chair with the other. And there were glow-in-the-dark stars on the walls and the ceiling that illuminated him when he reached our circle. He put the chair down. 

""It's okay,"" he said. ""I'm not my brother.""

He put out his hand. And Tanya - in her leather jacket and high black boots, and with the streaks of purple in her hair glowing like the stars on the wall - she shook Bob's hand and smiled, and the lights in the company's day-care room all came back on again.

--

We had to use the day-care room for our group, because Rex and Carlos exploded a $500 projector when Tina asked them about Volstadt upstairs. And everybody called us the ""pillow-powers"" now, because we couldn't even get a license for emergency-use, which even some civilians had. We had to keep it all inside and only dream about it. And Tina took that pretty hard because she thought it was her fault, as a coordinator, but I told her privately that the day-care room was a good ""energy spot"" and I started bringing Krispy Kremes so that she would believe it - like I wasn't giving up on her or something.

""Who'd like to get us started tonight?"" she asked that first day that Bob was at the group.

But Carlos came back and sat down and Rex crossed his arms and Tanya looked at the floor and Bob ate a Krispy Kreme and I just shrugged.

""Nobody?"" asked Tina.

""Did you see your brother was in the paper?"" Carlos said.

""Leave him alone,"" I said.

But Bob nodded and his lower jaw went out - he paused for a moment - and then he mashed the doughnut into his mouth, and he pulled a cold gray knife out of his suit-jacket and everybody jumped backwards and pressed far away from him against the windows or the walls. And Tina kept blinking her long mascara-blacked eyelashes, like she couldn't see, or wouldn't see. And Tanya grabbed her and Rex with her knuckles turning white while she twisted her hands in their shirts. But Bob just set the knife on the floor.

""I don't know how I got it, Tina,"" he said. ""I don't know when I even picked it up. I'm sorry. Please take it from me.""

He held up his arms and backed away and turned around on the nursery room carpet, bowing away from us, like some huge flabby monk in a business-suit praying. And Tina crept forward and picked up the knife and she locked it in her briefcase. 

""It's okay, Bob,"" she said quietly. ""Thank you for trying - ""

""What a weirdo,"" said Carlos. ""No wonder his brother put him in - ""

I don't know if I saw it then - or if I just wanted to see it, or if I just saw the end of it because it happened too fast - but the lights flickered and Bob tore Carlos in half, the legs now in Bob's right hand and the torso now in his left and the blood spitting out like a starburst all over his chest, which was no longer flabby but swollen, so that all Bob's upper body looked like something monstrous from a Greek myth. And Bob was screaming at the ceiling, and there was a flash of light from Tanya and she and Tina and Rex were gone, and I was the only one left in the room with him, the brother of the Hero of Volstadt, and somehow I knew it was my fault. And Bob went tearing out into the night with the windows all shattering behind him.

--

Tina called me up to the 31st floor of Taterlumps Inc. the next day, up to her supervisor's office, and she invited me in and offered me a coffee but her face was pale and there were bags under her eyes. She leaned against the wall while Mr Keeper, her supervisor, pushed a cream and sugar to me across his desk when I sat down.

""Black is fine,"" I said.

""Is it?"" he asked.

Tina looked over and nodded, and Mr Keeper crossed his hands and puffed so that his silver mustache twitched. There was a picture of Volstadt on the wall behind him, before it happened, and I didn't know if that was beautiful or weird, especially because he was in HR. But there wasn't any coldness in his eyes. He looked like Tina, just somebody in over his head and trying not to get swept away with the world changing so fast, and he didn't talk sideways when I asked about Tanya.

""Without a license, she shouldn't have,"" he said. ""But she had to. She helped. We've put a word in for her, too, and I can't make promises but I think she'll be out soon. It's Bob, of course, that they're worried about. Tina said you were the only one left in the room with him?""

""I was there.""

""Any reason he didn't go for you, too?""

""I hadn't done anything.""

Mr Keeper looked at me with his hard gray eyes, and I wondered if he was one of us - if that's why he had the picture - and maybe his position in HR was a kind of retirement. But he must have been 80 years old and none of us ever made it that far. And, besides, when he withdrew a suitcase from under his chair and set it on his desk and placed his bare palm on its scanner, the locks opened.

""Tina told me what you can do,"" he said.

""It could be useful, I guess,"" I told him.

""Do you recognize the knife?""

He opened the case.

""The one from last night?"" I asked.

""Yep.""

I leaned forward to look and the sun outside in the blue sky gleamed off the long gray blade in the case. It was a normal kitchen knife. A Katsishi, just like the one I used to cut vegetables at home. It even had a chip down at the right angle at the bottom of the metal like I had done to mine when I dropped it the week before - and it had the rust stains on the tip.

""Jesus!"" I jumped up. ""That's not mine!""

My chair went clattering behind me, and I was up to run, but the Navies in their namesake uniforms were already in the room and they had me by the arms.

""They're not going to hurt you, Jake!"" Tina shouted.

I saw a look of pain in her eyes and then the black bag was over my head and the Navies were carrying me out with the sound of their boots like bad drumming on the tile floor.

--

Blue is a calming color. It's trustworthy and knowable like a wide soft ocean or a clear sky. So, when the Navies took the bag off my head, it was in a room of all blue, about ten paces square, and they looked at me with their expressionless faces and their dark blue uniforms, and everything about them said, ""Just be cool,"" but also - like a wide ocean or the sky - ""we are dangerous, too."" And the door opened and in walked the great man, the Hero of Volstadt, Johnny Winsall, in his classic gray suit and vest with the American flag tie, and I almost couldn't breathe.

""We know you didn't give him the knife,"" Johnny Winsall raised an open hand, ""and I'm sorry about the room, too, but it's a protocol I shouldn't interfere with. I'm actually here to ask for your help. I hope you'll hear me out.""

""Of course, sir,"" I said. ""I'll do anything I can.""

He nodded and the Navies left us.

""How much did you know about us before you came here, Jake?"" he asked.

""I knew enough, sir. But that was before Volstadt.""

""And you had family, too. But most people don't. They hear about a woman picking a car up off her baby and they shrug, or they say it's adrenaline. Can you imagine what would have happened if my brother - in the state he was in - got out past the bounds last night?""

""I don't think he would have hurt anybody.""

Johnny Winsall glanced at me and there was that sharp deep pang in the center of me that said he was one of us - he had it so powerful in him that I fell backwards and sat again on the soft doctor's chair the Navies had put me on.

""You watched him rip man in half,"" said Johnny Winsall, ""and you don't think he would have hurt anybody?""

""Carlos was pretty unlikeable.""

Johnny Winsall laughed - it was like a roar that shook the whole room and shook his whole body, too, in his gray suit, with the bulk and muscle of him like Bob had been the night before except Johnny was more like a god than a monster. He wiped his eyes and clapped me on the shoulder, and I felt the pang in the center of me again, and I couldn't even look in his face, the Hero of Volstadt, but I just stared at the stripes on his American flag tie.

""That may be,"" he said, ""but I think it's clear my brother isn't ready for a group. We'll drop him down into accounting and we'll keep him in a blue room under the Taterlumps building for now. But I'd like you to be his mentor.""

""Me?""

""Bob's compulsive. He got that knife from your house, which should frighten you, but it also means he likes you. And he didn't go for you in the nursery room, which means he respects you, too. Maybe you can help him. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find out how much it will it cost to replace all the windows in the building with bullet-proof glass - that would have helped last night.""

He walked out. And ever since then, I've been meeting Bob Winsall once a week down in his blue room to play cards and talk and bring him back up to our version of real-life here at Taterlumps Inc. And here he is now, on the 20th floor, with his hand all bloodied and a hole punched through the window behind him. And we're all just standing here, looking. And I wonder how he got out. I'm full of mixed feelings. Because, on the one hand, I wrote a report last week that said Bob was ready for a group again, so I was clearly wrong. But on the other hand, I've always wondered, in my shallow way, who would really win between Bob vs military-grade bullet-proof glass that was eight inches thick - my money was always on Bob."

College senior here; engineering major. I have two incredible offers for starting work next summer. I'll outline some specifics of each. Currently, I have done zero negotiation for either; I'm hoping for some advice on how to negotiate so I can start paying off these student loans.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Offer #1: Detroit
-----------------------

Salary is 60k in an area with quite low cost of living; I'd love to work here, but feel I'll be limited by the long term opportunities of the industry. I had an internship with this company and know they will move this number up; their HR lead has reached out to me and said they are willing to negotiate. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Offer #2: Chicago
---------------------

Total pay should be around 75k in an area with much higher cost of living (estimates say as much as 33% higher). This is the choice I prefer in terms of company culture and long term opportunities. I do not know their stance on negotiations. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would be happy with either opportunity, but am leaning towards the Chicago position. 

My biggest question is do I try to negotiate? If so, how?

I don't feel either of these are a lowball offer, but I don't want to accept without discussing if I could be setting myself up in a better position. 

Thank you!"
3sh5ug,1,2015-11-11,Questions for using a marinade?,Latratus,steak,https://www.reddit.com/r/steak/comments/3sh5ug/questions_for_using_a_marinade/,"Hi, looking to treat my boyfriend since he's finished with a sprint on a tough college cs project, and also he got accepted to an internship. Yes, I know that usually steaks don't need more than some nice salt and pepper and maybe some aromatics, but I've done that many times and would like to try my hand at a marinade.

I'm a student so trying not to break the bank, but what kind of cuts should I use a marinade on? I know that sometimes you can make a cut of meat too mushy if you for example use an acidic marinade on something like a nice filet. Usually I prefer cooking a ribeye, would that be okay to use a marinade on?

Also I'm guessing to get a nice sear I should pat the steak dry when I take it out of the marinade and before cooking just like normal?

Thanks!"

I needed the two internships to graduate with my undergrad in Spring 2015.  I am now in graduate school working towards my MPA and taking Becker in the summer.

Since I was not able to come on for full-time employment, I was not offered a job right away.  I received nothing but great reviews and compliments from everyone that I interacted with in the company and they told me to keep in touch during the year.  I have kept in touch with a couple of associates and managers during the school year and I was going to begin asking about full-time employment in Fall of 2016.  

I was going to email one of the partners that I had a good relationship with and he is sort of the ""intern coordinator"" as well.  If there is any advice that you can give me to not sound like a complete jackass or dance around the topic, it would be greatly appreciated.

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3shqbm/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3shu1g,3,2015-11-11,I'm not sure if I'm just a whiney teenager or I am having a genuinely difficult experience. I just know I'm not happy.,mynewthrowawayyay,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3shu1g/im_not_sure_if_im_just_a_whiney_teenager_or_i_am/,"Alright, so I was in the middle of typing when my computer restarted, so let me know if this is confusing. Firstly, I hope my age does not deter anyone from taking this seriously. I'm in high school. My dad died at the end of middle school, a period that saw a bunch of wonderful bullying (nothing physical). I live with my mother and stepfather. We're financially sound, but not rich by most standards. I've had a terrible relationship with my mother since the fourth grade, when my father was diagnosed with testicular cancer that spread or something. I don't know how that works. I go to a public high school, but I'm in one of those bullshit specialty centers. Because of this stupid center, I must complete a 65-hour unpaid internship and a 35-hour service project on top of my college applications. I see a therapist every now and then, and have struggled with (I guess minor) depression and anxiety. The depression started up sophomore year. The past five months have been some of the most stressful I've ever experienced. I have been working on college applications and this service project (which we call a Culmination Project). I hate this fucking project. It requires me to gather sponsors, money, supplies, volunteers, participants, and a bunch of other bullshit. Additionally, I don't even care about it. My mother hounds me constantly. The project and applications are all we ever talk about. I am excited neither for college nor this project. She constantly tells me I'm lazy and care about nothing. I do have trouble caring about things. That's probably related to the depression. I don't play sports. I don't have a lot of hobbies. I'm tired all the time. It's fucking constant. All I want to do is sleep. My life just feels non-stop. Additionally, my project is related to my father, so my mother can take me on guilt trips for not caring if she wants. Fuck high school. (If you haven't noticed, I'm not sure where I'm going with this, and I feel guilty about all the other posters who have serious problems.) I really fucking hate being a teenager. All the responsibilities, none of the money, freedom, or respect. I'm tired of being treated like shit because I'm not older. I'm still a fucking human with feelings. It's not my fault all these fucking hormones amplify my feelings x100. I guess my overall point here is that I am really disappointed with what being a teenager turned out to be. ""Best years of your life."" Fuck, I sure hope not. This blows. Is this really as good as it gets? And what the fuck do I do about all this stress? I don't know what the fuck I want to go to college for. I don't have any interest in any reasonable profession. I just want a fucking stable income and a job I can tolerate so that I can go home at the end of the day and not have to deal with my mother or my homework. I want to experience the good parts of life. Not whatever this is. I want the past four years back. High school can go fuck itself. I'm sure someone will tell me I could have it worse. Don't worry. I get that. But couldn't most people? I just want to know what to do to fix my own life. I don't know if I should say anything else. I'm afraid I'm just going to get called whiney. I should be going to bed, too. All I want is a normal teenage life. If any of them are normal. I wish I could skip the next seven months. Fuck this project, fuck the specialty center (hope they don't see this), fuck fake high school friends, fuck internships, fuck my mother's treatment of me. But to whoever got this far, thank you. That's really kind of you. Good night/morning/afternoon to all of you. Have a great day. And for those of you who are adults living on your own, do something in your own home today to appreciate how awesome it is to be in charge of at least a part of your own life. Swear really loudly or piss with the door open or something. Or you know what, take a nap. Because no one can tell you to wake up. Because fuck them. You're an adult. You do what you want. And reply if you want. I could use it."

I am currently a community college student. I haven't paid anything so far and have no loans(thanks to scholarships), but starting next year I will indeed be transferring to a 4-year an inevitable getting around 14-20K in debt each year, depending on scholarships. 

My main concern is I will not have a degree that is worthwhile(philosophy or Political Science) and will more or less be forced into Law School, and while I do have family in a prestigious firm but that $300,000 of debt, is quite discouraging. There is also no guarantee that I would get a job, or even internship at this relative's law firm.

The main crux of why I've lost hope is my GPA is a meagre 3.5. blasted down by accounting class, and 2 W's from my brief experiments with calculus. Those will haunt me forever.

However, I noticed that my college has an electrician apprenticeship with the local union.This would guarantee an in-demand job with decent pay, without the 340,000 of debt.

What is the opinion r/personalfinance? Thank you guys for your help!"
3si1fx,4,2015-11-11,Me [23 M] I have trouble getting more dates with a girl.,Uberman2321,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3si1fx/me_23_m_i_have_trouble_getting_more_dates_with_a/,"Hello! My name is Nick! I'm 108 pounds, 5'7'', mixed asian white, college senior looking for an abroad internship, I work in high-fashion retail, I like to cosplay, and play video games.

I've been dating around for a while after my first relationship (of 8 months) ended (ended 6 months ago). I've just gotten over the fear of talking to girls but now I have developed a new fear of loneliness (which is, girls not sticking around with me for long). For a couple of months I've talked to dozens of girls but I have trouble getting a first or second date and so on. 


I've had multiple one night stands, but honestly, I'm looking for something more. I've considered and have tried to stop looking and let the magic happen naturally; and when it does, it doesn't last for long. 


Okay, here are some brief experiences using made-up names:


Nikki: [26 F]: Super pretty asian. She works at a CVS Pharmacy and is currently studying for the Pcat. Masters in Biotech Engineering (Obviously smart). 

Met her at a supermarket that was closing down. I simply straight-up asked her out on a date; however, I stuttered a few times and asked if ""I could have a second chance at my pick-up line."" She thought it was cute and gave me her number. We set a date, had ice-cream, and agreed to see a horror movie where I jumped a few times like a little girl (I don't like horror movies). We kissed a few times. Then we agreed to hang out again when suddenly her shifts at CVS got filled. She was working over time and told me she ""will be busy until november"". I haven't heard from her in a while... (Stopped texting)


Stacey: [28 F] Vietnamese. Doesn't look her age and is SUPER funny. Typically stays busy. 

Went on a coffee date once. Had a fun conversation about politics and the economy. I have no idea how that became FUN, but who cares? We were both laughing. She's very busy with homework so we haven't had a chance to hang out. (We still text. But I leave her alone when she says she's doing homework.)


Jasmine [22 F] Latina. Sexy. 

We danced once. I was cosplaying as Battle Bunny Talon (it's from a video game if you guys don't know) basically, I was a playboy bunny (Custom bustier, sheer 40s leggings, ears, heels, tie, the works, and I didn't give a fuck). We danced and kissed right after. She asked if we could hang out later I said sure and gave her my number which she texted RIGHT after she left the party. 

I try to ask her out but things come up. I've been told she likes me but wants to go out as friends for now (I've been friend zoned basically, We still text each other here and there.) 


Jennifer [25 F] I've never seen a 10/10 before. 

Same party me and Jasmine were at. When Jasmine left and this chick asked me to dance with her. We did. Blah blah blah. We spent the night at her place. It was a wonderful night. Still wondering how I got two girls in a playboy bunny suit. 

Haven't heard from her since that night. Sad... 


Danielle [21 F] Had the cutest personality. 

Went to Disneyland on our first date. I paid for her ticket, the parking, the food (Yeah... don't do that if you aren't seeing them again). She decided to wear... clothes. A worn out white ""mega milk"" (Yeah I know the doujin meme) shirt with red stains and a very... short skirt. Liked to show deep public displays of affection. Ugh... didn't like roller coasters either... She asked if I could stay the night. It was pretty late so I stayed. We're friends but I will not ask her out ever again after that interesting date. (Friends)


Sofia [27 F]. A demigoddess, nerdy, works in corporate. 


I'll keep this one short. She's in a polyamorous relationship with two men. Currently, she is my friend with benefits. Every time we spend the night together it would go on until dawn. We have sometimes set timers in order to get enough sleep for work. Honest to god, her boyfriends are okay with me hanging out and spending the night with her on some weekends. God she's awesome. 


End thoughts:

Maybe I just gotta keep going. Keep moving on with my life and continue to explore. It's just that, it's hard for me since I'm new at this and it's very confusing. Maybe I'm just being needy and I'm trying to get attention. I'm honestly feeling lonely here. Any advice? 


**tl;dr**: No idea what the hell I'm doing. I'm currently sleeping around and dating around. Should I keep exploring? What's your opinion?

3sj6en,1,2015-11-12,$15k Daily Driver,Airforce32123,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/3sj6en/15k_daily_driver/,"I'm a 20 year old college student who has never owned a car. I recently accepted an internship at a nearby automotive plant and need something to get me there and back every day for 5 months. I'm looking at about 60 miles daily, probably 70% of that on the highway. Beyond that I don't really do much, so as soon as the internship ends I imagine I won't put many miles on it until I start working again.

So I've been doing as much reading and research into car options as I can. My budget is $15k cash, no need to finance, so I'm pretty lucky financially and have a lot of good options I think. My parents, as many do I'm sure, are pushing for something reliable. They suggest a Tacoma, which is something I've told them I wouldn't mind to own, pros being reliability and utility.  But of course I'm more interested in something a little more exciting, with either a little more style or performance. I'm also interested in doing my own repairs and maintenance. I have a good bit of experience helping family and friends fix their cars and really enjoy it.

In short:

* Number of doors doesn't matter, don't do a lot or have a lot of friends so room for cargo/passengers isn't a priority.
* Price range is up to $15k. I also have $5k set aside for repairs and will be making enough that I can easily afford more for repairs and maintenance.
* Would prefer a manual.
* Used for commuting for the spring semester then occasional errands afterwards.
* Could go with parents and get Tacoma, or look something a bit more fun.
* Don't really want a convertible, doesn't interest me.
* I'm not saying it has to be huge, but I'm 6'3"" so I don't want my knees in my face.

I'm open to all suggestions, thanks for the help!

Edit: To be a little more clear, I wanted help weighing the value of a reliable truck versus the enjoyment I'd get out of a sportier car. "
3sj6rf,0,2015-11-12,Awesome Arc,Trex_MD,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/3sj6rf/awesome_arc/,"tl:dr:  Wanted to have some fun thinking about how the movies could continue.  New Irongirl character.  Caps dead, Caps alive, Cap gets to dance with Peggy.

So I've been trying to predict how the movies are going to go, its a fun pastime of mine, and like the rest of you, this kind of stuff is like cat nip to me.  So here are some predictions, and I'd love to see what you all think.

Picking up from where the MCU currently is.....

Civil War sees 2 ""teams"" of hero's fighting over the registration act.  Cap is against it because it violates civil liberties, and Ironman is pro, because of the mess he himself has made.  For this movie I wont go into any great detail, however, I would like to see at least a few scenes where members of Team Ironman come up against Cap, and refuse to fight him out of respect(per the comics).  This movie MUST end with Cap dying, after which Stark goes into hiding, blaming himself for Steve's death.

Dr. Strange, probably a great movie, but this is more to establish a mystical universe that will be needed in future films.  Hulk is typically weak against magic, and for this story, I'd like that to be in place for post Infinity War plans.

Guardians 2, we see the guardians trying to figure out what the deal with the Gem/Ronan was? more Stone/Thaos scene setting while we find out more on Starlord's Dad and his place in the universe.

Spiderman, Awesome, but relatively unimportant in my arc.  Potentially ""Iron Spider"" to give us something we havent seen in a spiderman movie, but this might be overkill.  It'd be nice to see Danny Rand or other ""new"" avengers in the background potentially.  One item of note will be the introduction of a new friend.  While working at Stark industries (he is a scholarship winner and then intern with Stark Industries), he meets an incredibly intelligent girl who has secrets.  No reveals on her, but she's snooping into Stark Tech in a strange way.

Thor Ragnarok, Thor Dies, and the warriors, along with Loki break into hell to get him out.  In the process Odin finally dies for real, Loki's deception is revealed.  Hulk has been recruited because of the Legends Thor has told his warrior friends, and this introduces him to the cosmic realm.  Odin doenst only die, but azgard is mostly destroyed.

***Ironman 4, now this is a brain child I've been working on.  In Ironman's absence, his technology spreads majorly, Hammer builds all kinds of advanced weapons based off of Stark's blue prints, and terrorists are getting armed to the teeth in ways that government armies arent even able to compete with.  Open on a Battle, baddies rolling through the town with repulsors and lazer beams pew pew pew.  The town, then parts of the country then parts of the world start falling to these groups.  Pepper is trying to hold the company together, and overwhelmed by the hole that Tony left her in.  During one attack on a defenseless village in south america,  a new Ironman suit no one has ever seen drops out of the sky and takes out the baddies.  Before leaving, the new IM destroys all of the advanced weapons.  More events like this start happening and Pepper is freaking out, trying to reach Tony.  We eventually find out that The Mandarin wasnt Trevor, but a scary, dark, evil man, and the ten rings are behind the new wave of terror.  Finally, Pepper is able to get Stark Employees to hack into the com system of the new suit, and hear a woman's voice inside.  We get an ""explanation scene"", where the new Ironman, comes to Stark industries to talk with Pepper.  The girl in the suit, is Peter Parkers friend from the previous spiderman movie.  She felt an obligation to balance the world back out after Tony disappeared, and created her own suit. the rest of the movie is blah blah blah ten rings topple baddies.

Black Panther, set the stage for the new avengers.  Panther becomes part of the leaders of the new group due to his intelligence, and we end with him trying to target a few new people as potential teammates, Ironfist, Nova, Antman, etc.

Infinity War 1. Thanos shows up and attacks the new avengers.  But without Hulk, Thor, Cap or Ironman, they struggle.  Thanos gets all the gems together and sets himself up as the ruler of earth and the universe.

Antman 2, a rebelion building in the shadow of a dystopian Thanos rule.  a few team members come together, using Antman as their chief stealthy guy.

Captain Marvel, on the cosmic side, captain marvel runs into Hulk, still left in outer space since Ragnarok.  the two of them help defeat some threat, and by the end of the movie they are targeting earth, to come back and help liberate it.  post credits scene of Starlord.

***Ironman 5, She is still cleaning up the legacy of Tony, but now its Thanos' minions using some of his technology.  She has a stealth suit for most of this.  Several times, when she shows up to take out a patrol of Thanos' soldiers, strange tech things happen with their weapons, or security cameras happen to go out JUST in time for her to stay undetected.  She starts tracking a hacker, and at one point, after she is knocked unconscious, the suit keeps fighting, controlled by the hacker.  After the hacker takes out the baddies using her suit, she is flown to an abandoned warehouse, and into a secret door that just happens to have charging ports and repair bots for the suit.  She wakes up for a second to see a blurry image of someone standing over her, but the hacker injects her with a sedative and she passes out.  She awakes in a dark room, obviously having been treated for her wounds by bots of some sort, and hooked up to monitors.  the hacker is sitting in the corner, and she instantly starts asking questions, who are you, where am I, what is going on?  and we hear Robert Downey Junior's voice.  Tony has been in hiding, but ever since he found out about her, he's been rethinking his retreat.  He thanks her for having cleaned up his mess, but insists he does the rest.  Of course he is much older now and unable, but he is still a stubborn guy.  Finally she convinces him to be her Jarvis, help her, be in her ear when she's working to take the baddies down and together they take out a MAJOR weapons factory/idk and give the world a new chance against Thanos finally.  Tony feels like in the long arc of his life, he's made lots of mistakes, and after Cap died, he quit trying to correct them.  Irongirl has reminded him that he always has to keep trying.  Post credit scene, one of the monitors in the med-lab shows to sets of genetic markers, Tony is standing there looking at them, and they're 98% the same(idk the science here, but its clear, she is related to Tony).

Infinity War 2: Starts with Starlord and the guardians nearing earth, Captain Marvel and Hulk along for the ride.  They show up and blast their way through some major thanos drones.  They are trying to set up a plan of attack, when stealth Irongirl pops out of nowhere and says ""come with me"" blah blah.  They are led to the remnants of man kind, kept safe by the remaining heroes.  Somehow (havent figured this out yet) Starlord gets a Gem, and uses it to bring Thor back, and at the top of a crescendo of light and anticipation, Captain America.  He organizes the team, helps plan the attack on Thanos, and with the help of the original Team, the new Team manages to take down Thanos. In the aftermath of the battle, Starlord, weilding the Infinity Gaultlet, restores earth.  Implied in the final scenes, is that Starlord will be taking the gauntlet through the universe to balance the galaxy back out, IE fix azgard and any other planets Thanos has crushed.  Tony, walking now on a Cane, walks out to see Cap, and there is a touching moment between the two.  Tony leans over and whispers something to Starlord, and he smiles, the gauntlet glows and After blinding light, Cap finds himself at a USO show in the 1940s.  Standing in front of him is Peggy, and the movie ends on a silhouette of them finally getting their dance.  

(potentially work in a way to have Starlord go back as an adult, and hold his mom in her final moments).

I'm going to try my best to make this as brief as possible and only go to the essential points of the story. Ask some questions if you got more details.

Okay. So for the last couple of months, I have already done the academic requirements for my bachelor's degree, but there was still one thing I haven't done : the research paper. It's worth quite a bit of credits and is mandatory to have the certificate.

So, I sort of ""let go"". I was never a brilliant student, just average and did what he could to get by. Anyways, I've only got the research paper left and didn't have to do any classes anymore. By this time, I was already receiving a lot of pressure from my family to ""find a job"", since there are quite a few people out there who have both jobs and education. They see me as a useless scrub because I'm ""only a student"". Not that they're wrong...

So yeah, I've applied to an internship and got very lucky to obtain one. So that's what I did for the last six months, focused my energy on that and ended up having an amazing experience on all levels (personally, emotionally, professionally, etc.). But the thing is, since it's a full-time internship, I didn't spend a single second on my research paper.

That's not what the family thinks though. They've been putting me so much pressure, that I just decided to lie to them and got them to thinking all along that I'm ""working on it"". Now, the thing is, I still have until summer for this as a final due date, it's quite a bit of time. But for some reason, my family wants me to end it so I get my degree HERE AND NOW. And... well, one can only lie for so long. My mother has decided that she wants to help me fasten up the process by helping me do it person to person.

... which is problematic, because I have basically nothing to show for it. Basically, my lies are getting back to me. I'm not gonna make excuses, I shouldn't have, so in a way I do deserve this. But yeah, there are some redeeming qualities to this, in that I'm not entirely hopeless: I have a lot of time to succeed this until summer, I have done an internship in the mean time which is no slouch, I don't have any extra classes to get in the way of me doing this research paper)

I'm a mess right now and it seems that I might have to go and fix the mess I've made for myself, but any advice and/or kind words would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - University bachelor student. Did all courses except for research paper. Has ""put it off"" for months because of procrastination and internship (internship is a good thing, procrastination not so much). Has been lying to family that I've been doing it all along. Parents puts enormous pressure to finish ASAP and insists on helping. Has NOTHING to show them. "

Whoever racks up the most points by the end of Jan. wins 25 grand (I'm currently in 2nd)

So, one of my current missions is to partner with a blog and have them promote a ""private"" fantasy sports bracket. The bracket will be 64 people, and it will be FREE. We are giving away 400$ to the winner, and 100$ to second place and 25$ to 3rd and 4th. All I need from you is to agree to partner with us on this and we will give you a code for your readers to enter and they will be placed into this bracket. Its very simple and easy, and helping me could potentially lead to me winning the competition, which means I will walk out of college debt free!

A little back story -- I am a 22 year old male in his senior year of college. In June my girlfriend of nearly two years and I broke up. She has since started dating a former close friend of mine, who happens to also be in the major I am in and in all of my classes. Since he was a close friend, I frequently sat with him and our other friends in classes. However, now I dont as him and I are not on the best of terms (His fault, not mine. I have not said anything to him or instigated any of this animosity). Thus, I pretty much sit alone in all of my classes.... and that is where this story begins.

On the first day of classes, I was sitting alone on the top row at a two person table. The seat to my left was, obviously, empty. A girl came in right before class started and asked if she could sit there. I obliged and since we set up the seating chart on that day, she became my permanent seat partner. For a while, we never spoke outside of ""Hello"" and general pleasentries. As time went on, we began to speak more and more but it was never anything longer than a few exchanges. I think the first time we had a real conversation was the first class after Labor Day, as we both spoke about what we did over the weekend. At some point in September, while we were still just having small conversations, she added me on Facebook. Since then, she has liked a few of my pictures and statuses but that is the extend of our interaction on Facebook. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago, out of the blue her and I had a break through conversation. Since then, we have spoken every day before class for 10 to 15 minutes along with during class whenever we get a chance. She laughs at nearly everything I say, funny or not. She is always smiling and looking at me in the eyes. Today in class we had to split up for a group project and I caught her glancing my way about four our five times in the span of about an hour. Also before we parted ways today, we were talking about how warm the room was. I happened to be wearing a normal Patagonia pullover fleece, absolutely nothing speical. I made the comment ""I picked the wrong day to wear this."" She responded, ""I like it though, it looks good!"" with a smile. 

We do not text, as I do not have her phone number. I have never messaged her on Facebook, as I have been crushing on her but never had any reason to message her - or have the courage to do so. These past couple of weeks have made me think that I potentially have a chance though. Unfortunatley I have self-esteem issues, so unless I know 110% that I have a chance than I will be too afraid to ask. Thus, I need some encouragement to do so and to hear the opinions of Reddit that I am not just misreading the signs. 

Lastly, I want to explain my goals -- Obviously, my end goal is a relationship. We are both in our early twenties and about to graduate from college. We both need to start thinking about the future. I could honestly see myself with this girl as she is beautiful, has an amazing personality, and has the work ethic to achieve anything she wants in life. Also, I have a company Christmas party in January (Long story, but it was pushed back) that my internship company is putting on. Ruth Chris is catering the event, we are all staying at an expensive hotel, and all the alcohol is free -- I need a date to this event. I thought about inviting her to this and asking if she'd like to go on a few dates before then to see how things work out. 

Sorry if I rambled on a bit. I am nervous about the situation and also trying to type quickly, as I have a three page paper I need to work on haha. 

Anyways, thank you all for reading! I look forward to any advice you all have to offer. 

**tl;dr**: Met a girl. We didn't speak for a while. Couple of weeks ago, we had a break through conversation and now talk all the time (in class, not over text/Facebook). She is giving me positive signs and I have a crush on her. My self-esteem issues are causing me to not ask her out. I need some encouragement! "
3sl4st,0,2015-11-12,I'm [21/F] and need advice about what to do about my relationship with my [30/F] girlfriend..,Manduhh01,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3sl4st/im_21f_and_need_advice_about_what_to_do_about_my/,"I'm 21, i'm in my senior year of college, I work part time, I'm starting an internship soon, and I'm active and run in 5ks trying to work my way up to half marathons.

I have been single for over 2 years until my friend introduced me to her friend Karen (my current gf). When me and Karen met, we hit it off and became really close really fast. We starting dating. However, we kind of jumped into things and didn't take our time.

I do really care about her and she is a sweet heart and a very loyal, loving girl. But now, I'm starting to have doubt's.

She already hinted at wanting to live together and possibly marry me in the future. She absolutely loves me. And I care about her. But there are somethings that bother me.

She has a drinking problem. Before she met me, she would drink every night. I told her she needed to stop, and she only drinks on weekends now. But it's only been 3 weeks of her not drinking during the week and she already made a comment about wanting to possibly drink 1 day during the week. I have a family member who is an alcoholic and I can't have a future with her if she let's drinking control her.

Also, she is 30. She doesn't have her driver's license, a car, or a job. This really bothers me. She made really bad choices in her 20's which led her to this current situation. She keeps saying she wants to get a car and her license and do something with herself but hasn't really made any big efforts yet. 

I was talking to the mutual friend and voiced my concerns and told her how I might need to take a break from the gf for a little, and the friend flipped out saying how I promised I wouldn't hurt Karen, the girl had her heart broken a million times before, I can't just leave her, etc. Karen also has very bad anxiety and she's very emotional now that she's not drinking as much and my friend is worried she'd do something stupid. And I'm also concerned if I break up with Karen she will drink herself to death or hurt herself in some way.

Yesterday I told Karen I needed a little space and time to myself. But I'm wondering what to do about the relationship?"

['Moondust', Chapter One: 'Magnificent Desolation'](http://cfy.im/758/)

.

.

I’m a sucker for the right kind of eyes, and she had a pair as pure as the moon.

I suppose that’s where it all went wrong. 

For both of us.

Three AM passed. The numbers blinked on the bedside clock like a warning beacon bobbing on dark water. The red light scattered through a bitter haze— the dying embers of cigarette smoke mixed with the steam of our body heat— and it struggled to illuminate the far corners of the hotel suite. The windows beside the bed lay open to the winter night beyond. Outside the gaudy, vulgar lights of Istanbul simmered in the distance, burning like a hot magnesium flame over the chilly Bosporus strait.

I wasn’t looking at the city. The soupy hot chaos of the old town didn’t interest me. Instead I looked at the moon, watching it hover like a cold star over the city, framed dead-center in the bedroom window. My eyes scanned every feature— every lonely crater, highland and mare— and for a time I let the grand nothingness of that cold, empty orb seep into my sense, like pendulum dangling on a hypnotist’s string.

It was only after several minutes— when our bodies no longer burned with that certain passionate flame— that she looked to me, her delicately-painted face as expressionless as that rock in the sky.

“It’s colder than hell in here,” she said.

“Hell’s supposed to be hot, isn’t it?” I smirk, my eyes wandering to that little yellow ribbon knotted in her raven locks. It glistened under the moon like a ray of sunlight over an oil slick. “Unless you read your Dante, I guess...”

When she gave me a puzzled look I shook my head, waving her off.

“Never mind.” I forced myself to sit up, grunting with the effort, and then I dangled my limbs off the side of the bed. My scrawny left foot found the smooth wood floor, then that awkward little stub where my right leg used to be found the harness to my C-leg. I strapped it in and slowly got to my feet, wincing as my stub settled over the sleek titanium prosthetic.

“Where are you going?” She spoke with all the urgency of a drive-through employee asking if I ‘wanted fries with that’.

I motioned over to the balcony, gesturing at the open window as I hobbled to it.

“Forget it,” she muttered. “Cold is fine.”

I shrugged and leaned on the balcony railing, getting a better look at the moon.

“Beautiful view, tonight,” I said.

“Hideous,” she disagreed, her voice still empty and cold. “Vulgar—”

“Not the city—”

“The full of the moon,” she said.

I looked back at her. She was now sitting up, her face turned toward the window. The moonlight hit her frosted eyes in an odd way, making them glow like a cat’s.

“It’s an empty thing. A cold thing,” she explained.

My lips scrunched with rueful agreement.

“Well, you got me there,” I muttered, rubbing the back of my head. “ Of course to some people that’s part of the appeal, isn’t it?”

“‘Appeal’?”

“Sure.” I crossed my arms and cocked my head back at the night sky. “It’s ‘striking’, you know? All that vast and empty space, stretching out forever on a cold and lonely horizon. When something’s that empty, well , it kinda makes it seem like it’s chock full of something, to certain people.”

The blank stare I got back wasn’t surprising. Point of fact I would’ve given myself the same look if I were facing a mirror.

“I’m not explaining it very well,” I chuckled, awkwardly tilting the metal ‘foot’ of my C-leg from side to side. “There was this astronaut from one of the Apollo missions— it might have been Armstrong, or Aldrin— and he had a couple of nice words to describe the moon, and all that emptiness stretching out around him.” I shook my head. “Wish I could remember it, now. It was a very catchy little phrase.”

“A kind word or two of appreciation doesn’t change the nature of a thing.”

My smile fell. I had to think about that one for a moment.

“That, uh, would depend on who’s doing the ‘appreciating’, wouldn’t it?” I sat down in a leather chair beside the window, gingerly crossing my artificial leg over my knee. I pointed at her face. “For example: I’d say those pretty peepers of yours remind me of the moon.”

She looked down at the bedspread, her face noncommittal. I held my hands up.

“Uh, I’m not trying to be ‘weird’, here,” I explained. I pointed to a wad of bills on the mahogany dresser near the bed. “And, uh, no rush, but it’s all on the nightstand, there, whenever you want it. Feel free to count it—”

“You say my eyes are like the moon?” She didn’t take her eyes off the bedspread, instead curling her legs up under the sheets, like a child might do.

I shrugged, nodding.

“Empty, and cold?” She asked.

I coughed politely, managing a small smile.

“In the nicest sense of the words. Like I said: I can’t remember how that astronaut put it—”

She looked up at me, and for the first time I saw a hint of emotion stirring in those pale blue eyes. It didn’t look like a very happy one.

“What 'hell' is cold?” She whispered.

“Huh?”

“‘Dante’, you said...”

“Oh,” I leaned back in my chair, strumming my fingers on the metal leg, desperately trying to think back to junior high. “Uh, in his book hell was made of circles, full of very elaborate punishments, tailored to each sinner. The center was a barren plain—tundra frozen solid— and the worst of the worst ended up there, trapped in the ice.”

She considered this with a tilted head, absently staring down at my artificial appendage.

“What happened to your leg?” She asked.

I scoffed.

“Awfully rude of you to ask, isn’t it?”

“Cold of me, don’t you mean?”

The thin corners of her immaculately-painted lips twisted up in a nascent smile. I couldn’t help but return it.

“What, this ol’ thing?” I again strummed the leg with my fingers. “Not much of a story, there. Occupational injury. Well, kind of.”

“Your occupation?”

I motioned with my head at the table across the room, drawing her attention to the camera sitting on its side.

“Photographer?” She blinked.

“Not quite. Reporter.” I reached across the table beside me and picked up a decanter of whiskey and a glass. I didn’t even know what I was doing until mid-pour; I didn’t even realize I was ‘thirsty’ at the moment.

Who am I to argue with my muscles, though?

“I’m retired,” I explained, belting back a nip of the liquor.

“I see...” she tilted her head in the opposite direction, looking a little like a parakeet.

I smiled at her confusion.

“You don’t see how I can afford the honeymoon suite in a hotel like the *Ayın Doğuşu*, do you? Not to mention what it cost me to... um...” I trailed off, absently moving one hand in the air while I pretended to take another nip of booze.

She was nice enough to fill in the blanks.

“...to afford yourself the pleasure of my company?”

I raised my eyebrows over my glass, nodding sheepishly.

“Yup. Not that you weren’t worth it—” 

“Compliment my ‘association’, if you must compliment someone. They’re getting every nine out of ten lira, after all.”

“Really?” I clucked my tongue. “And I thought I had salary-negotiation issues. Well, there’s no real money in reporting, either, not that I ever did it for the money, mind you. I did it for the thrill of the chase— the rush of a good story seeing ink— and for the power.”

“Power?”

“Oh, yeah.” I nodded, my eyes growing distant as I spoke. “That equalizing power that comes from shining sunlight into dark corners. My best story brought down a big-time brokerage firm. They were fleecing customers, manipulating the markets, shuffling lots of money into places it didn’t belong— mostly the board of directors’ pockets— and I spent the better part of three years following that paper trail. It was worse than a mongoose chasing a cobra down its hole. More time consuming, anyway.

“Well, I got enough to crucify their CEO with a massive exposé. That story brought all the authorities down on his company, and he didn’t take it too well.” I chuckled, shaking my head. “He was this hot-tempered, entitled prick. Not a reasonable bone in his body. He’d sued my paper five times during my investigation, trying to stop it. Of course all that paperwork was just more kindling for me, fueling my fire. Truth be told I just don’t think he understood people very much.”

“What happened to him?” She asked.

“He lost his shirt, comparatively. His company assets were frozen, properties seized, all that kind of stuff. Well, one day my wife and I were out walking down the street and he’s driving by in his lovely Rolls Royce.” I looked over at her. “You know that kind of car, don’t you?”

She nodded.

“Beautiful car; almost a privilege to even see it.” I finished off my drink and started pouring another. “Well, it turns out he was driving it down to a shop to sell it. He needed the money for his imminent ‘legal expenses’ and it was one of the only liquid assets he could get his hands on. Now that car, I guess, was like his baby— his bundle of pride and joy— and having to sell it made him... ‘cranky’. Seeing me there, walking down the street, well, when the red light turned green...”

“He hit you?”

I nodded, staring at the amber liquid in my glass.

“It’s a hell of a sensation, being hit by a Rolls Royce. It’s almost a privilege, really; it’s a beautiful car, even when it’s sitting on top of you.”

“And... your leg—”

“That didn’t quite end up under the car; it technically became part of the engine, I think.” I knocked back my drink with one motion. “Anyway, it turns out that the price of a human leg is really high in civil court, especially when it was taken off by an axe-crazy, swindling douchebag.”

“Was your wife okay?”

I blinked, tilting my head back.

“Huh? What do you mean? Oh, no. She wasn’t with me, then.” I shook my head.

“But—”

“*But*,” I held up a firm finger, pointing it right at her, and then I pointed at my camera. “What did all the money change? Nothing. I still went to work, and I still fed off that fire in my belly: the hunger for a good story. For ink. See, it really wasn’t about the money. I just loved what I did.”

“Then why quit?”

I sighed, getting to my feet.	

“The world didn’t love it. Or hate it. They just stopped caring. Six months after my story ran I found out that the authorities had really only moved the fridge; they didn’t put down any poison.”

Again she blinked with confusion. I smiled.

“Sorry: I mean they let the cockroaches scatter and set up shop somewhere else. Same company, same board of directors, same MO. The only thing different was the name.”

“Then,” she said, “the same ‘sunlight’ would be the proper poison, yes?”

I smirked, showing my white teeth. I nodded adamantly.

“Yeah, you got it. It would be the proper poison. But that kind of reporting was going out of fashion. Too time-consuming and expensive. Takes too much ink to explain it all in the shrinking margins. Gotta sell more ad space, you know. And besides, a paper running financial scandals on its front page isn’t a big seller. No, these days you gotta have a celebrity scandal front-and-center, or maybe an incendiary sound-bite gaffe from some publicity-seeking politician.” I scoffed, barely hiding the contempt in my voice.

Or not hiding it at all. Six of one...

“Nowadays, well, the newspaper’s top story is picked by an unpaid intern monitoring yesterday’s top posts on some hive-mind website. Financial scandals? Pfft!” I shook my head. “No, the good people on *Skimit* want to talk about what color a dress is when it’s shown in bad lighting...”
	
I looked up from the empty glass in my hand, again realizing I had audience, and I rolled my eyes dismissively.

“Sorry to rant. It’s a sore subject. All that work and in the end I’ve got nothing to show for it. But, after politely declining to cover one-too-many celebrity baby stories it was ‘mutually agreed’ that the paper and I should part ways.”

“You were fired?”

“In all but name. I can’t complain, really; the editor and I went way back, and he helped to get me a hell of a ‘voluntary retirement incentive’ from the company. Put that on top of what I got in my settlement and, well...”

“You have the American *muhabir* staying in the honeymoon suite of the *Ayın Doğuşu*,” she smiled.

I reciprocated the smile, raising my empty glass.

“Affording myself the pleasure of your company.”

Her smile slowly fell. She gently stepped out of bed, staring down at the money on the dresser as she pulled on a sheen pink gown.

“Why do you like ‘cold’ things, then?” She asked.

I furrowed my brow.

“You speak of shining ‘sunlight’, setting ‘fires’,” she said. “You do not strike me as the melancholy type...”

I lowered my head a bit, genuinely taken aback by her words. I finally thought of an answer for her, but by then I guess she wasn’t interested.

“It’s not important; I’m sorry,” she whispered.

I motioned to the money on the dresser.

“Do your, uh, ‘associates’ really get 90-percent of your bill?”

“Yes.” She tightened the gown around her, pulling the front taut over her slender breasts. “But I’ve been working for them for a very long time. For most of their other ‘assets’? Well, the generosity is far less.”

I smiled sadly.

“You’d think they’d wanna ‘incentivize’ their employees a little more...”

Again she fiddled with her hair, securing the yellow ribbon in place. She shook her head.

“We are not ‘employees’, *muhabir*.” She looked down at her sheen nightgown, absently smoothing out the wrinkles. “We are little more than dust to them, though well-cultivated dust.”

“Talented dust, too.” I grumbled this under my breath, instinctively, and I hoped she didn’t hear me. She did, but instead of taking offense she merely smiled that same half smile. She shook her head, pale eyes all smiles.

“It is no matter, any of that. Today is a day for celebration. For me, at least...”

“Really?” I arched my brow. “I’ll call up more champagne, if you really want. What’s the occasion?”

“My retirement,” she said, moving over to the window. She looked up at the silver moon, her eyes burning under its light like molten glaciers.

“No kidding?” I asked. “Really? I was... well... your last—”

She nodded, not looking back at me.

“Your money on the dresser: it’s the last payments of my debts. My life as a free woman— with free choices— started thirty minutes ago.”

I scratched my chin, staring at the ground.

“Ah, well, that’s great. And I guess that makes me feel less bad about... you know—”

“It is a very common prob—”

“Just so long as you got your ‘freedom’ a few minutes early, I’m happy.” My face flushed and I looked away, even though she wasn’t looking back at me. “Uh, seriously: let me get something from downstairs. You’re due a little treat, I guess.”

I stumbled across the dark room, moving for the telephone.

“More alcohol?” She looked back at me from the window. “You don’t expect me to share your bed again, do you? For free, no less?”

“Well, I figure that we’re getting along pretty well,” I chuckled. “So maybe let’s just see where the rest of the evening takes us!”

I picked up the phone, ready to dial room service, but when I looked back at her I saw a downcast brow, and a bitter twist on painted lips. She stared at the floor, her slumped body bearing all the energy of a zombie.

“Listen,” I said, “that was just a joke, okay? Seriously, I didn’t mean—”

“Will you tell me something?” She whispered.

I set the phone back down.

“What?”

She looked back up at me, her eyes as big and as wide as a cancer-stricken puppy on chemo.

“This ‘hell’ that you spoke of— the cold one, the place of this Dante: who resides there?”

I blinked. Again my brain whiplashed, returning to half-remembered lectures, half-baked discussion groups and half-read Cliffs Notes.

“I, uh...  I think it was called ‘Cocytus’. The people there were guilty of the most terrible crimes of all.”

“What kind of crimes?”

“They were all traitors. Traitors to different things: country, relatives, friends,” I shrugged. “That’s what I remember, anyway.”

She drew a breath, again returning her gaze to the window. She crossed her arms, shivering under her sheen gown.

“You okay?” I asked.

“Yes,” she mumbled. “It’s just... it’s as cold as hell in here, that’s all.” She looked back at me. “Thank you, by the way, for telling me your story. You are very honest.”

“I... uh, yeah,” I scratched the back of my head, looking away from her. “Look—”

“My story is short, and entirely uninteresting. It’s the story of a thousand girls in Istanbul. More, even. Bad family, bad debts, bad...” she closed her eyes, shaking her head. “Bad ‘associates’. I won’t burden you with what was bad in my life, but I’d only like to share with you one of the few things that is good in it. Can...can I do that, please? After all, once we’re done for the night then I’ll be free, and I won’t be telling this story, then.”

She gave me that look again: the cancer-riddled puppy. It was killer.

Something about her eyes. 

Honestly...

I nodded, sitting in a chair opposite the window.

“I’d like that,” I muttered.

She smiled her sad little smile, then bowed her head. She leaned against the railing as she spoke.

“My, uh, work takes me to many places in the city.” She motioned to the luxurious room around her. “Many glamourous places, like this, but sometimes less so. One of my clients, he concealed his ‘business’ with me from his wife by renting a squalid room in the slums. He was a paranoid man— suspicious and violent— and the work was... it was not easy.”

She picked up a loose cigarette from the table, holding it in front of her face. She didn’t light it, but only sniffed its edge, closing her eyes.

“I met her after a very bad ‘session’, one that left me nearly in tears on the ratty steps outside that building, hunched down like a dog in the dirt. She came up to me, the little thing— maybe 10 years old— and she was selling her wares in the street.”

“Wares?”

The woman absently turned her head to one side, exposing her jet black hair. She ran a finger along the yellow ribbon holding it all up.

“She knelt in front of me, her dirty red skirt brushing the ground, and she asked if I was okay. When I wouldn’t answer she asked me my name...”

My eyes widened a bit at this; I took my chin off my fist and blinked at the woman, licking my lips uncomfortably.

“Ah,” I chuckled, “that reminds me: what *is* your—”

“She told me her name,” the woman ignored me, again looking out the window. “‘Aylin’. That was her name. She was a ray of sunshine, the little thing. Like an unpolished diamond, too. You like my eyes? Nothing like hers: pale blue—”

“Then... exactly like yours?”

She smiled, shaking her head.

“Pale blue, but not like the moon. Not cold. Like the sparkling sea. Or the color of the bend in the sky, ignited by sunlight. She didn’t think I was okay, then, but all she could do was talk to me. And she did. And when I managed to stand, and leave, she offered me this.” The woman again touched the yellow ribbon in her hair. “Amazing how the simple things— someone just talking to you— can make you feel better.”

“Plus free ribbon,” I arched one eyebrow, smirking.

“I’d see Aylin often around those slums in the coming weeks, scurrying about in her dirty red dress, peddling her crumpled little ribbons. Seeing her was always a bright spot in my day. The slums are a cold and empty place elsewise. She was always eager to talk, or to share a bite of stale bread from her pocket. She always found me, even in a crowd, from the yellow ribbon in my hair.” The woman chuckled, lowering her head. “She was... just so flattered that I kept it...”

She looked back out the window, hiding the tears in her eyes.

I leaned forward in the chair, hands clasped between my legs.

“What happened to her?”

She didn’t answer for ages, merely staring up at the moon as it moved through the sky. I figured she never would, but eventually her voice broke the quiet, barely above a whisper.

“My ‘associates’ took note of my friendship with Aylin. They reminded me of my debts— so many debts— and the time it would take to cover them. They... they told me it would cover things almost completely if I had a ‘replacement’ waiting in the wings, like her. If I could just use her trust, groom her, convince her... get her into their hands...”

I pursed my lips, grunting.

“So, betray her, then?”

The woman looked back at me, nodding with a smile, and then she slowly untied the ribbon from her hair and held it to one side, drawing a pained breath.

“Yes. So I did. Two weeks of convincing, cajoling, making sweet fabrications about the ‘new life’ that awaited her. She was... so flattered, listening to my compliments. And she was intrigued by my lies. And on top of it all, of course, she... trusted...”

The woman tightened her fingers around the ribbon in her hand, crushing the cheap fabric in her fist.

I said nothing for the longest time, merely staring down at my lap. Eventually I thought enough to stand up and hobble over to her side.

“I delivered her to them yesterday,” she whispered, never losing that half-smile. “And then, today, an American *muhabir* pays top-dollar for my trade, enough to cover the rest of my debts and make me free.” She looked over at me, her smile turning into a rueful scowl. “And why? Because I have the cold eyes, like the moon—”

“Listen,” I waved a hand through the air, “you, uh... you just did what you had—”

“Can you say that with a straight face?” She asked.

I didn’t answer, and that made her smile even wider.

“*I* can,” she nodded, leaning against the railing. “This work would’ve killed me one day, sure as a bullet to the heart, and I would die a slave. Now?” She gestured with her hands, an unhealthy chuckle escaping her lips. “Now whatever I do, I can do it as a free woman. What price is someone like Aylin, anyway, huh? A handful of dust, exchanged for another!”

Her tears flowed freely for a time. I only stood there, watching her. It wouldn’t have been right to try consoling her, I figured, with any kind of touch. Thirty minutes ago her ‘touch’ cost upwards of five-thousand dollars an hour.

Now, though?

It’d be ‘priceless’, wouldn’t it?

I almost laughed at that. Caught myself, thank god, and I only looked away. This was a moment where lack of sleep mixed with good old-fashion horror made a person loopy. Well, *me*, at least.

I joined her in leaning on the railing, staring at the night sky.

“You asked me earlier why I like ‘cold’ things?”

She looked up at me, wiping her eyes, and she nodded.

“I could always understand things that run ‘hot’— quick-tempered people, or assholes pushing and shoving for their place at the table, you know. God knows I was more like that than anything. Not a reasonable bone in my body, sometimes. People who run ‘cold’, though? That quiet sense of melancholy? You’re right about that, by the way: I don’t trend toward ‘melancholic’.” I smirked. “Hell, cut me open and all you’ll find inside is roiling yellow bile, I’ll bet. No, but it was always the quiet, ‘cold’ ones I took an interest in. Other types of people, more often than not, they won’t surprise you. They’ll act according to their nature as they show it.  But the quiet ones?” 

I shook my head.

“They got no ‘tell’ about their nature, do they? With them it’s all ‘show’. That can be unexpected. My wife, before... she left, well, she was someone like that. With how I was treating her after my firing and all,” I sighed. “None of it was fair, looking back, but I didn’t know how unfair I’d been until she... served me the papers.”

I looked at the woman, realizing that my meandering point was getting nowhere fast; I tried to summarize.

“Point is, I myself have run away from a lot of bad stuff since then, instead of confronting it, and besides getting lucky with a lawsuit I’ve had nothing to show for it. But none of the stuff I’ve run from is half as bad as you’ve had it. I don’t have a right to judge—”

“Who does?” She smiled, wiping another tear from her eye.

“Mmm. See? That’s the attitude.”

“Was there not a time,” she asked, “when you were a reporter, that you would judge such a thing?”

“Reporting’s not judging.” I shook my head, moving away from the railing. “It’s just listening, and then telling it like it is. *Good* reporting, at least.”

“Were you a ‘good’ reporter?” She asked.

I shrugged.

“I like to think so.”

She moved away from the balcony rail, following me.

“Will you let me do something?” She whispered.

I nodded, brow furrowed in confusion, and that’s when she leaned in for the kiss. It was a quick thing: she embraced my head and shoulder with her hands, then planted an amateurishly sloppy kiss on my startled lips. When she finished I stepped back, eyes wide.

“What happened to ‘no freebies’?”

“Not a freebie,” she batted her lashes coquettishly, straightening out that yellow ribbon in her hands as she spoke. “It’s for listening. Thank you.”

The woman set the ribbon down on the table beside us, gently ensuring no folds or creases remained.

She walked back to the balcony. Again she stared at the moon.

“My first act as a free woman, I wanted it to be something happy, at least.”

“Glad I could help,” I managed.

She leaned against the railing, head bowed. The moonlight burned against her hair in a halo of frigid light.

“I wonder,” she mumbled, “if there’s any frozen water on the moon?”

I was about to answer her, but she didn’t wait.

“Maybe it’s hideous, and maybe it’s vulgar...”

She looked down at the ground many stories below us. 

“But then it wouldn’t be the worst place to spend eternity...”

My hand moved faster than my brain. It was a weird thing, too. Some little part of me understood what she said and acted independently of the slow and dull thing that made up my consciousness.

It needn’t have bothered.

My hand was too late, anyway.

They say she looked like an angel, the way she came to a rest on the snowy ground outside.
I wouldn’t know; I never bothered to look.

The next night I found myself back in my room, minus my passport, the local police having made no uncertain threats about me leaving the city in the near future. I knocked back some more whiskey, staring at the smoothed-out yellow ribbon lying on the table beside me. In my half-drunken haze I thought about the story of dust traded for dust.

She thought herself almost worthless, right up until the end. And the only worthwhile thing she ever did— earning her freedom— cost her all the rest of her ‘worth’.

I shook my head, leaning over the balcony and watching the city lights burn atop the Bosporus. What was this story to me? Nothing, of course. It was the kind of thing that probably happened a dozen times a day in a city like Istanbul. Aylin’s story was nothing. 

*Aylin* was nothing.

But, when I looked up at the moon it wasn’t little Aylin I thought of. It was her, with that yellow ribbon in her hair and that sad little smile on her face. She hadn’t been an angel, or a devil. She’d been something far worse.

She’d been a human.

And in her eyes I’d seen a beautiful horror, something only a trip to Wikipedia could let me describe:

“‘Magnificent desolation’,” I muttered.

And when I thought about those eyes— as pure as the moon— I thought about other things, too. Nothing to do with ice, or ‘cold’, either.

No, it was something to do with sunshine.

And *fire*.

I looked at my camera, and then I gazed out across the profane sprawl of the city. 

There was a needle somewhere out there, buried in a filthy haystack.

‘Aylin’. 

That was her name.

It was a start, at least. 

And that’s where it all started to go wrong.

76 hours later— when the dust finally settled— I’d have *nothing* to show for it.

3sl9yd,3,2015-11-12,Feeling too lonely in my LD relationship,jellaellaa,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3sl9yd/feeling_too_lonely_in_my_ld_relationship/,"I'm new to this whole reddit but I just needed somewhere where I can get advises or even just share my feelings. 

I have been with my boyfriend for about 6 months now, both of us are 22 and I met him in random chat app that I downloaded out of pure boredom. We started to talk more and more, had many similarities (I'm originally from LA and just in NYC for school and he was from LA so that started it all off, my nostalgia for my home) , I started to open up to him gradually and he did as well. Both of us clearly had feelings for each other but did not wanna make it anything official until we actually meet, so after talking for about half a year, since we lived way too far, we decided to meet for the first time when I decided to take an internship in Chicago for summer so he came to visit me, and made it all official. Then I was back in LA so we spent the summer together consistently meeting and spending the time together as much as we can for about a month and half, then I moved back to NYC for school.. And it's been more than 2 months now and recently I've just been feeling so... stuck, suffocated in a way that even when we have arguments, all we can do is call or facetime, that there is no other better way to make it all up. All I can think of is how things would have been easier if I was physically with him, how I wish I could go on dates after long week, just chill together eat ice creams and play boardgames. 

I truly love him but  I couldn't hold my feelings in anymore last night, ended up venting them to my boyfriend and he just said he is sorry and asked me what I want him to do.. I honestly didn't know what to say much so I told him I wish we facetime more often.. And he said he can do that and was looking for dates next year to come visit me  but it's just been really off the whole day today and I don't know if there is any way to fix this. Worried I might have made things worse, made him stressed out about how I'm feeling as well.. 

I sometimes feel like I'm dating a computer monitor, or my phone because that is all I can hold of him, where I feel his presence and it's been making me very very sad and lonely. Anyways.. I just don't know what is best to do at the moment anymore. "

3sle2l,12,2015-11-12,[PI] Death on the Precipice - 1stChapter - 2217 Words,chondroitin,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3sle2l/pi_death_on_the_precipice_1stchapter_2217_words/,"Elise closed her eyes and turned away from the precipice, a few shades paler from the sight of the endless blue sky below. Despite having flown by glider and on the backs of winged mounts many times in her life, standing on the edge of the landmass was different from being up in the air. The juxtapositioning of land and vast nothingness made her feel as though she was about to fall into the Depths. She peeked out at her supervisor; the veteran detective seemed completely unfazed. He stooped mere feet from the ledge to nowhere, setting down wooden stakes to demarcate a point of interest near the wall.

“How are you not feeling ill?” she muttered.

“Because murders and suicides at the Edges are an unfortunately common occurrence,” Jules replied, straightening and taking out a leather-bound notebook from his beige coat. “Look around, and report to me what you observe. I’ll give you some time.”

Elise forced her eyes open, squinting to keep the vertigo at bay and gripping the shaky, old wooden railing tightly enough to make her knuckles white. The pair were on a granite cliff overhanging the dropoff of the sky island, a precarious place that most citizens of Mahalia avoided for safety’s sake. Stairs had been carved into the side of the inward-sloping cliff, used by servicemen on weekly assessments of soil and rock fidelity at the Edges. At the base of the stairs, the waist-high wooden fence met the similarly-sized brick parapet, the only guards against plummeting from the skies.

“Jules, I can’t concentrate like this. Why couldn’t we take the dragons?”

“Because then we wouldn’t have the appropriate viewing angles for a thorough examination,” the detective replied, jotting things down in his notebook. “Are you done with looking around?”

“Uh, no.”

“Please focus on doing so. The wind is quite strong here - I don’t want to spend any more time here than necessary.” Jules drew his scarf up to his nose, and walked back to the steps.

Elise nodded, clutched her shawl tightly around her neck, and stepped shakily out towards the ledge, stopping at the stakes. After a few futile moments of browsing, she turned back to her mentor. “The only thing that stands out is the wall. It seems poorly maintained, and one of the bricks towards the top looks out of line.”

“Good observation,” came the scarf-muffled reply. “What would you say is the significance of it?”

“If you give me an hour or two, I might come up with the right theory,” Elise huffed as she walked back towards the stairs, “But if it’s fine with you, I’d rather leave this area. I feel like I’m about to take a tumble off the side any moment now.” Just then, she stumbled to the side, the wooden railing catching her at the base of her ribcage. It bent outward, leaning under her weight.

“Whoa, there!” Jules leapt forward, catching the young woman by the arm and steadying her. “Breathe. It’s all right. Let’s head back up.” Wrapping an arm around her shoulder, he led them back up the steps to the metal-gated lift, pulled the lever, and brought them back up to the surface. Helping her to the nearest bench in the park, he let go of her.

Elise crumpled to the ground, thankful for the cushion of soft grass. “Oh,” she breathed in relief, “I hope we don’t get another case like this for a long while.”

“For a moment there, I thought we would join Mr. Lorenzen in the Depths.” For the first time since she’d met him as his intern, Elise saw concern wrinkling the bridge of Jules’s nose as he rubbed it between his thumb and middle finger. “How are you feeling, Elise?”

“I’ve been better, but well enough, really. What was -”

“Mr. Neilsen?” A tall, strongly-built man in a grey coat walked up to the detective and his protégé. He had a lopsided smile that squinted his left eye, sitting awkwardly on his otherwise severe face, as though he were trying to reduce the intimidation of his sizable stature.

“Yes, Marcel?” Jules replied, “And call me Jules. No need for last name address when we’ve worked together for over a year, right?”

Henri coughed and rubbed the back of his head. “Yes, well. Jules, are you done with the area?”

“Yes, we’re finished. I’ve marked down a point of interest.” Catching Elise’s confused glances back and forth between them, Jules helped the former up. “Marcel, this is Elise Schiltz. She’s an intern in the Department of Criminal Investigations.”

“Good to meet you, Miss Schiltz,” Marcel said, looking down to meet her eyes.

“It’s nice to meet you, too, Mr., um...” Elise replied, shaking Marcel’s proffered hand.

“Sergeant Marcel Mann, the law enforcement officer in charge of this case.” Marcel shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “Er, I’m sure you’ve both been briefed and have read the case files, but per protocol, I’ll need to go over the details with you to ensure complete accuracy, and to give any information you need on the particulars.”

“Sure, but let’s talk in my office for privacy and warmth. It’s getting late, and none of us are dressed for the cold of night,” Jules remarked, received with nods from the other two. They made their way over to the Skyedge Park Station, where Jules and Marcel led their government-assigned blue-black dragons out from the waiting stalls.

“You don’t have authorization for a mount?” Marcel asked, seating himself on his dragon, which seemed barely larger than the big man himself.

“No, not yet. Misfiled paperwork,” Elise replied, retrieving her hang glider from the locker. She tossed the tow rope to Jules, who fastened it to a loop in the back of his saddle before getting on. Guiding the dragons out to the station platform, Jules took out a small horn flute and blew four notes indicating his destination. Elise unfurled the fabric sails of her glider as the dragons beat their wings, readying for takeoff. She strapped herself in, gripping the handlebar just as they ascended into the sky.

“Could’ve given me more time there, Jules!” she called ahead, shouting to get her voice above the wind.

“Sorry!” came the sincere response, “I’m still not used to passengers!”

As the sun set, they landed in front of the familiar sandstone pillars of the Department of Criminal Investigations. As the senior officers led their dragons back to the stalls, Elise went on ahead, going up the stairs and down the right hall. Still relatively unfamiliar, she checked the nameplates on each dark oaken door until she reached one that read *Jules Neilsen, Senior Investigator”. She took out her copy of the key, unlocked the door, and went inside. Stashing her glider in the corner of the room, she turned on the filament lamps, which cast warm orange light throughout the room.

Though she had been a frequent visitor in Jules’s office in the past two weeks, she hadn’t had the time to take a proper look around. The place was sparsely decorated - unsurprising, given Jules’s utilitarian nature. Mahogany bookshelves lined the sides of the room, filled with densely packed legal publications and thick case files in heavy bindings, all sorted by type, then alphabetical order. Unlike many of the offices she had peeked into down the hall, Jules’s room was neat, with no piles of disheveled paper on his desk, no books open on the ground. Nothing adorned the walls except a single still-life painting of two apples and bottle of wine; the fanciest things in the entire room were the velvet maroon curtains, which he had huffily declared were not his choice.

Footsteps echoed down the hall. Elise sat down in one of the office’s upholstered chairs, and the pair of officers arrived shortly after.

“My wife is the one who really enjoys it. Me, I like a good concert well enough, but these are two hours long before the encore. It’s a bit much, don’t you think?” Marcel sighed as he walked in, hanging his coat on the hanger. He took a seat, and Jules did so as well, setting his notebook on his desk.

“I can’t say I much enjoy them myself.”

“Really? I would have pegged you for the type.”

“No, though not for lack of trying. It’s just that, to me, they all start sounding like the same wail of strings after a time.”

Marcel chortled. “Not sophisticated enough, eh?”

“No, I suppose not,” Jules replied with a mild smile.

“In any case,” the sergeant said, clearing his throat, “Now that we’re here, let’s get to business. This is a missing persons case of one Norland Lorenzen, a forty-five year old man of average stature, working as a geological surveyor for the Department of Natural Resources. Mr. Lorenzen was reported missing by his wife on the twenty-second of Third Month, or three days ago, when he failed to return home in the evening. We canvassed the offices and his neighborhood, finding only a handful of witnesses who had seen him in the week prior, and only one who had seen him on the day of his disappearance.”

“That witness was a coworker, Alena Reed, correct?” Jules interjected.

“Yes, she was the last known person to have seen Mr. Lorenzen.”

“And you have had the chance to talk with her?”

“Briefly - she did not want to speak much of the matter, only letting us know that she had seen him that evening in Skyedge Park with a woman whom she did not recognize. She had waved to the pair, and recalled that his response was somewhat stilted. After that, they headed off in the direction of the lift,” Marcel replied, taking out his pipe and lighting it. “We have yet to have any identification or corroboration regarding the woman.”

*A lover, maybe?* Elise mused. When she realized the two men were staring at her, she realized she had voiced her thoughts. “Oh, sorry! I don’t mean to intrude.”

Jules smiled reassuringly. “No, feel free to give input - you are an investigator on this case as well, after all.”

“I think...” she started slowly, then paused. “I’m not sure. I don’t think so, though. His wife was obviously concerned after just a single missed evening - it doesn’t sound like he would have had time for regular infidelity.”

“Indeed, we asked her if she had any suspicions of the kind. She said no. Apparently, Mr. Lorenzen was the quiet type of man who would rush home after work,” Marcel said. “To be honest, I think the man committed suicide. It’s a sadly common sight at the edges. No body, no real evidence - but there you have it, you know?”

Jules clasped his hands over his desk. “I’m afraid I disagree. The death at the cliffside is almost certainly a homicide.”

Marcel tilted his head. “What makes you so certain? It could be an accident, too. No witnesses, no evidence. A slight stumble and suddenly, there he goes, over the railing.”

“Elise, when you fell forward towards the railing today, did the railing move?”

The young intern blinked, surprised by the question. “Yes. The railing gave way surprisingly easily. If you hadn’t been there, I don’t know what would have happened.”

“The railing was still intact when we got there, with no signs of breakage or repair on the wood or the ground. Has anyone serviced the area since Mr. Lorenzo was declared missing?”

“No,” Marcel replied, “The area was cordoned off the day after the initial report, given Ms. Reed’s account. But he could’ve tripped over the stone parapet instead, leaving no trace.”

“The fence was at the same height as the parapet.” Jules turned to Elise again. “Do you think you could’ve fallen forward off the parapet?”

“No,” she answered slowly, “I don’t think so. I was caught by the top bar at the ribs. Unless he was extraordinarily tall, he would’ve been caught at least at the waist.”

“He could’ve fallen backwards,” interjected Marcel, “One’s waist can’t bend backwards, so he could’ve flopped over it like a wooden board.”

“It’s possible, true,” Jules replied, “But I’ve got another detail to mention. There was one brick in the parapet out of place, as though it were pushed.”

“So he stumbled over it as he fell.”

“Only one brick, Marcel. Had he fallen backwards, surely he would’ve knocked the others off as well. Instead, only one, as though from someone’s foot.”

“Then we’re back at suicide,” the sergeant sighed, “Which is what I had said in the beginning.”

Jules poured himself a glass of brandy, and poured one for Marcel, which the latter happily took. He offered one to Elise, who declined with a shake of the head. “It’s not suicide. Were it a suicide, we would see at least two bricks, unless the man were standing on the tips of his toes.”

“Then what do you propose?”

“As I said earlier, murder. One foot on the ground, one on the wall- it’s perfect for someone throwing another person off.”

“You think Mr. Lorenzen was thrown off the parapet? By the woman with him?”

“I didn’t say that Mr. Lorenzen was necessarily the victim,” Jules said, taking a sip of his brandy."
3slhok,0,2015-11-12,[27/f] and a [24/m] he doesn't include me in family affairs/get included in mine,Kalyov,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3slhok/27f_and_a_24m_he_doesnt_include_me_in_family/,"I know I probably shouldn't be upset with him right now because of the situation but I am!

My boyfriend's dad is in the hospital in critical condition 6hrs from where my boyfriend lives and 10hrs from where I am doing an internship. He has been in there a week and my boyfriend visited him last week but I couldn't go because I was at a conference for work when it happened. Well he told me last night that he may have to go back down there today and so I asked him, ""do you want me to join you?"" He never answered, two hours later I said ""you can say 'no' I'll still be here to support you if you do."" And again he never answered. Two more hours passed and I pointed out that he never answered me about that but did when I asked a question about Skyrim and he just apologized for not answering, but still didn't answer the question.

Today I sent him a text as soon as I woke asking if he was going and if he needed me there, he said ""I don't know if I'm going or not, heading to work."" 
I just recently got a text saying ""I'm heading down tonight."" I quickly responded with ""do you want me to come? I already told my boss I may not be here tomorrow."" He said ""if you want to you can but I'm leaving now so you would have to come alone.""

Well great, thanks for including me. I don't get paid till Monday so I don't have the funds to make a 20hr round trip alone. And it makes me feel TERRIBLE!!!
I feel like a bad girlfriend because I can't be there to support him.

Flash back to 6 months ago, my father was in the hospital and we were not sure if he was going to make it or not. I was in tears on the phone asking him to please come be with me, he refused. He had gone back to our college town 4hrs away and was hanging out with some friends he hadn't seen in a couple of months. He said he didn't want to break his promise to his friends (of spending the weekend with them). 

A lot of this attitude was because I was leaving soon for a 3 month job in Alaska and apparently that hurt him even though he told me to take the job. Which caused him to shut down and keep telling me that he just didn't care anymore. (Apparently that was a self-defense mechanism so he wouldn't feel sad about me leaving). But him not being with me for my Dad's stint in the hospital really hurt me and put a huge damper on our relationship.

The summer was terrible, our relationship went through a huge downfall with the distance and heartbreak because of him being unsupportive. The only support I had from him was when I broke down crying before we went to the airport because my Dad was still on life support and I was leaving. (My Dad is better now BTW). Once I got back home things between us have gotten slowly better, but it is still not like it was before May.

I just feel like we really need to include one another in these family affairs and be there to support each other."
3sli3z,1,2015-11-12,Need Input on DoE from Manufacturing Perspective,sigmasixsigma,AskStatistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/3sli3z/need_input_on_doe_from_manufacturing_perspective/,"Hey /r/AskStatistics,

I am a lowly intern working on a quality control team that monitors a manufacturing process (expensive electronics components). My team is in the beginning stages of the process where we try to get an idea of what factors impact the quality characteristics of interest. 

To make this pretty simple for me to explain we have 4 main factors that we're looking at, let's assume we treat them all as fixed effects. My main question is, is there a more efficient way to do this experiment? 

It seems like the team is doing this a little inefficiently. These experiments are really expensive so doing unnecessary runs is costly. Right now they want to do a factorial design and run the different combinations. Ordinarily factorials I believe are quite efficient due to ""hidden replication"", but when we are trying to get information about our control where we don't actually change the other factors we are basically taking unnecessary additional replications of the control at large expense. 

Is there something like an incomplete factorial? Where I can run the factorial design on the non-control runs, and then do a separate analysis of the control?

I know this could be really confusing so I can clarify anything.

My background is undergrad in stats (have one more term), but I took a DoE class before so I have a fairly good grasp of the terminology.

Thank you all so much for any help!"

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3slo9s/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3smg5j,1,2015-11-12,I have changed so much but it isn't good enough,throwaway2948756,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3smg5j/i_have_changed_so_much_but_it_isnt_good_enough/,"I’m 18 and a senior in high school. I have been rapidly changing over the past four years as I progressed through a small high school that gave me the ability to fail and live to tell the next day. I changed an incredible amount surprising both my teachers from middle school and even myself. I have lost weight, gained new confidence that I never had, hang out with friends a lot, and I’m trying out the flirting and dating scene. Yet, this never seems good enough for my parents. 

I have been dealing with the trouble of trying to find a job since I was 16 and I have struggled since. I have tried numerous job hunting sites like Snagajob and Indeed but with no luck. I have tried craigslist but with no luck. I have tried door-to-door with no luck. There have been a few times where I have come close to getting a job and even gotten a few interviews, but, with no luck either. I sat down and thought to myself “If I can’t find a job, then I will make it my job to make myself a better person.”

I started by bettering myself in school, which from there has lead to me being in the top ranks of my classes alongside making me an excellent candidate for a paid internship/job with an architecture firm near me. After this I began heading out into the community and volunteering and finding that I really enjoy giving my time to help others. I’ve finally started getting into sports and I’m enjoying the hell out of it! I just got back from two weeks of being a student leader at outdoor school where public school sixth graders can spend a week at a camp learning about plants, animals, soil, and water. It was here I built new confidence by working with other student leaders and socializing with them. It was also at outdoor school that I started meeting girls and flirting with them which with dating them has ending up unsuccessful after this point, but I’m proud of myself for trying. 

I have really started building up my life and truly getting to be the person that I want to be, but it’s not good enough for my parents. They have been wanting me to get a job for  a while. Both of them had them when they were growing up (Both parents are currently 50 years old) and they want me to have one also. I have invested dozens upon dozens of hours into finding work (Most of which is in doing those annoying personality test) from all sorts of different companies and work. It’s been an absolute struggle to find work and without any guidance I feel like I’m flailing whenever I look for some. I’ve tried asking for help but I feel like they don’t know what odds I’m facing in finding work.

My life has been incredible recently and it’s not a life I want to waste now by working. I want to work and I feel like with such old parents and no one I can turn to for guidance I can’t succeed. I like having a free schedule to do what I’d like and enjoy my last year of high school. I like having a cash flow like I did when I worked as a babysitter during middle school, but I rarely spend money so it doesn’t matter too much for me to have more than $15. I feel like I’ve achieved astounding accomplishments in my life and I feel like I am failing all at the same time.

What really has been getting on my nerves is when I try to explain how I feel to my parents I am met with disapproval. I did an unpaid internship to get work experience which I now would now like to take and give back to my community with (Computer Technician). I emailed back and forth with a library for a month and managed to get them to agree to let me come an hour later than the posted volunteer time and I could work as a lab technician! I went to my parents and told them about the position and how I was planning on accepting it. I was met with the remark, “Well throwaway2948756, what will you do when you find a job?” I told my parents that I planned on keeping this position and finding more volunteer options since I really enjoy it. I was told to not take it and to find work to which I tried explaining how I had already tried for two years which failed and that this was an opportunity for me to build my resume while being responsible with something I love.

The conversation went no where and turned into being screamed at by my drunk dad for an hour in the hallway about how I didn’t have responsibilities, a job, or girlfriend. I missed my chance at an excellent volunteer spot in doing something I really enjoy. All this is happening at the same time I am looking at switching to a new high school. I just want to enjoy my last year of school before college, not deal with the all of the above every day :/"
3smiul,2,2015-11-12,How to be appear like an interesting person who look like he has his life together without appearing like you are obnoxious or bragging?,p314159i,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3smiul/how_to_be_appear_like_an_interesting_person_who/,"I'm wondering how far you should go when following some of the advice of this sub. 

About a month ago I was extremely quiet, and very un-confident. After reading the advice of this sub, and reading How To Win Friends and Influence People, (Which should be included in the readings of this sub if it is not already) I've made many changes and started going out more.

Being in university has made this very easy to do since my facebook feed is essentially a stream of free events to go to related to my interests, many of which have free food, which is a plus. 

Since I am new to being confident and talking to people, I don't have much experience in knowing when I go to far and start to be obnoxious or bragging. 

My confidence has improved, so I genuinely think I am an interesting person and I do my best to talk in terms of other people's interests, but sometimes I feel like I'm talking too much by interjecting myself into many different topics.

Could you give me some examples so I can learn to tell the difference between confidence and arrogance and being obnoxious. Examples of each are would be appreciated. 

Another piece of advice this sub has is you need to have your life together. I've mentioned a few times that I'm getting interviews for internships, (No offers yet, but it is still early) and usually it is very organic and fits into the conservation, (Generally people in my major will sometimes talk about internships since its an important part of it). Usually, the older students are impressed by this since I'm starting early, and are usually the people who talk about internships anyway since they actually do them. But I feel like I might talk to much about this. 

So what can I have some examples of bragging versus appearing like you have your life together. 

I have to say most of what I know about social interaction comes from this sub, I was effectively clueless before coming across this place, so while it may seem weird that I'm asking for examples of words, its pretty much because I have no idea what they actually might be. Hopefully you can help.

Also while this sub is about seduction, it seems to be very good at helping people become likeable people that people want to be around regardless of gender, and that is what I'm after mostly. I might begin to develop romantic relationships eventually, but right now I'm at the stage when I just want to make friends.

Okay, so Wordpress kicked my ass so bad I probably won’t walk for days. The software was super rough with me even though it was my first time using it. But it’s ready! I’ve launched my site around dating advice for introverted men and I’m super psyched—and really nervous—to present it to you guys.

My first article covers how I first met someone after I had graduated college. At that point in my life I was at zero: I had no friends or network, no money, and no “real” job (just an internship). After several dateless months I was finally able to turn my luck around, and I’ll show you how!

Later I’ll be covering topics such as how to talk to someone without running out of things to say, how to be confident and overcome approach anxiety, how to get more dates, and more ways to meet women.

Tough times after the birth of our daughter, 2 years of counseling and feeling totally lost",totally__lost,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3so63r/me_31_m_with_my_wife_35_f_married_for_7_years/,"My first sentence was ""I won't write a novel..."" but look what I happened. You get me going and all of this plops out. My apologies for the length.


Wife and I have been together almost 11 total years. She was my work study supervisor when I was a junior in college, she was already established in the oddball field I was studying. We hit it off right away, but decided to wait until I wasn't her ""employee."" That wait took a little bit longer than planned, she met someone that summer and continued that relationship until I graduated. I moved to the South, she was still in Southern California were the internship was. We kept in touch as friends for over a year, then she let me know that she had broken up with the other guy. A few months later, she transferred from Cali to live in my city. Throwing caution to the wind, we moved right in together. Yes, before even going on a proper date, we moved in together. 

Somehow that worked. We lived down south for a few years, then to the midwest to be closer to her brother and their kids. Bought a house together, got married, the works. Almost never had a fight. Sex was great. Communication was great. Very happy together.

A little while after we got married, there was a stretch of 4-6 months where she turned me down for sex a lot. My self esteem suffered. We talked about it, but the solutions we came up with didn't seem to stick. I ended up feeling more and more undesired and unwanted. I stupidly responded with stretches of the cold shoulder. She responded with an even colder bed. I don't blame her. I wouldn't want a sulking sourpuss in my bed either. It's a story that's been written a million times, especially if you subscribe to /r/deadbedrooms.

We would go through these ups and downs, sex was great again, although I always had trouble initiating after that especially bad period. It was tough for me to believe that she really wanted me.
Then, she got pregnant. 

We were both ecstatic. Over the moon. With all of our excitement, we somehow did a good job of laying out some potential problems that might lie ahead for us. We both voiced our concerns that this instability in our sex lives was something we had to keep on the table after the baby came. It was of the utmost importance to our relationship. There were a lot of intimate talks during the pregnancy. We became closer than I ever imagined.

The baby was born, but there were some complications. Our daughter ended up spending 2 weeks at the hospital before we were able to bring her home. Things were obviously thrown upside down with a newborn in the house. There was no more private time for us, no time for talks. 3 months in, we had stabilized a bit, but still no communication. 5 months. 7 months. I take my piece of blame for not initiating something. I should have, but we both seemed so overwhelmed at times, I didn't want to stir the pot. My older sister warned me to be there for my wife, be supportive, but don't pressure into anything physical for a year. I was ready for that reality, but I won't lie. It was damn hard. 

Many hurt feelings, couples counseling sessions, teary late night arguments, breakthroughs and setbacks later, here we are. I should throw in a Prozac prescription for me and a cancer scare for her. Some ups, plenty of downs. Some really really far downs for me.

Our daughter just turned three. Still no sex, no idea of how that can even happen.

We have ""made our peace"" through the help of the couples counselor. I understand where she was coming from, what she was feeling - she understands the same for me. We have a good foundation of communication and understanding again. I don't carry and resentment around with me any more. My wife tells me the same thing. There's just no sexual avenues open. I don't have any idea how it's going to happen - and we have agreed that if it can't happen, if we aren't getting the things we need from the relationship, then it's time to move on and find a way to show our daughter what a loving relationship looks like. I just want to be able to give us a chance before making that decision. I love my daughter more than anything in the world, and it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where I am not there every day, seeing her grow, learn a new word, try kiwi for the first time, braid her hair... 

I would sincerely love any and all feedback or thoughts from anyone that has gone through something like this. I haven't been able to talk to friends or family about this. They have no idea what things are like right now. I appreciate your time and empathy.

   
**tl;dr**: Wife and I drifted after birth of our first child, we have come to terms with most the issues that led us down that dark path, but am having trouble with the next step."

It's a competitive program which five interns are vying for one full time position (the first full time position that person will receive after college.)

There are currently two front runners for the position and there's about a month left until I have to make my final decision. There's Sarah, the demanding bitch of this year's intern class and daughter of our CFO. So naturally she thinks she has this job in the bag and has been acting like that since day one. She comes into the office late, usually hungover, with her designer clothes, driving her brand new Benz that Daddy bought for her, but she has been stepping up her game of late. She knows that she is in a position of power, but how will she use it to assert herself and seal the deal to get the job? Will she blackmail or threaten me to get the job or use her seductive skills to get me to say yes.

Then there is Amy. She very quiet and methodical. Comes into the office on time, puts her head down and just does her job. The problem is, she's too quiet and shy. Someone that unless you walked by her desk you wouldn't even know she was employed here. She's the preferred hire amongst many of the senior staff, I'm going to have to find ways to her to get more noticed at the firm, and in particular open up to me. She's too naive and needs some encouragement to open up and step outside the boundaries to secure this job.

Do you play Sarah or Amy? This is a current situation I'm in right now so can provide you with detailed descriptions of their bodies, looks and styles.

Looking forward to this!

*TL;DR:* Owe money in various circumstances, need to figure out a way to make more money before graduating next year.



**Meat of the matter**:

* Graduating next year with an AS in Network Technology and Cisco/Comp TIA certifications.
* Make minimum wage through work-study scheduled 11 hours a week
* Receive Pell Grant to attend classes (12 credit hours)
* Live with mom, $150 monthly expenses
* Skills in computers, recording/playing music, problem solving, and with people, strong enough for heavy manual labor
* Live in Florida, willing to travel after college.
* Commute by bike and/or public transportation
* Have a secure credit card with about $300 owed on it and $350 backing it.



**The problem**:

I will be graduating sometime next year finishing with an internship. I am not sure if the internship will be paid for or not and if it will be in-state or out-of-state. I currently am using public transportation as opposed to my bike because I was hit and my bike still needs repairs. In total, I need to spend about $500 to get my bike repaired and my debts cleared. I owe roughly $250 on a secure credit card that I have $350 backing, so I could potentially close that credit account and get $100 freed up temporarily. My hours at work-study were cut down to 11 hours a week which made things difficult, as I was previously working 20. 

I am trying to decide whether or not it would be worth the stress getting another job, but the employment options for part time aren't very appealing. Another factor is that my commute takes two hours out of my day. I am also considering entrepreneurial venues, using my IT knowledge and/or musical skills to get money somehow, but I am unsure of where to start on that end. I'm also worried that if I don't have money saved, or at least a form of reliable transportation by the time I graduate, that I will not be an appealing option for employers. 

**So what should I do?**

* Should I get another job or seek out ways to make money on my own? Where should I start for the latter?
* Should I aim to save or buy a car ASAP?
* Should I strive for a paid internship or should I just try to get an internship in general?
* Should I focus on clearing my debt while I have the money or use my current income to stay afloat while I seek other options?

**Bonus Question**

How could I make money by recording my music?


If you made it this far, thank you for helping. I really appreciate any and all advice. I know this isn't a very difficult situation and I may be over-analyzing it, but I'd like to nip this in the bud."
3sp92l,1,2015-11-13,23M4F - Innocent guy meets a strong woman,PenPallAddict,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sp92l/23m4f_innocent_guy_meets_a_strong_woman/,"This is my first ""official"" post in DPP, I have been lurking around and replying to a lot of prompts started by girls. I've shared quite some pleasant (smut)conversations and have gotten a lot of kinky ideas from all of you!  

&amp;nbsp;

This post however will be a test for **all** of you ladies!
So far I've always been trying to catch your attention when I try to come up with an interesting reply to a prompt. Sometimes to great success, other times... well not so much.
In most of these stories I was the (heavy) dominant one and I was the one taking charge and setting the pace of the story.  
Today I want to turn all roles around. Meaning:  
* It will be your turn to catch my interest with a exciting orange letter of love. Tell me something about yourself, which of the prompts listed below do you wish to carry out, how do you see the prompt evolving and let's discuss kinks/limits in pm.  
* You will be the one in charge, setting the pace and being the *driving force* behind our story.

&amp;nbsp;

**A few story suggestions**  
*#1: Best friends*  
We are very close friends and hang out a lot, just like tonight! Tonight is different than other nights though, wether it is because you have a crush on me and decide to proof it to me, you just have an itch to scratch or something entirely different. The bottom line is: You want me. Tonight.  
How will you get me to satisfy your needs?  
Are we in a movie theatre where you just slide your hand down my trousers and take it from there?  
Do you trick me into some truth or dare game?  
Did you take me out shopping and lure me into your dressing room to 'help' with a zipper?   
I'll leave it up to you to decide, this way you can easily work some kinks of yours into the story!  

&amp;nbsp;

*#2: The Older Girl Next Door / Babysitter / Step-sister*  
I prefer to play this as myself, but for the girls who secretly wish to have a younger man (read: ageplay) I can give it a try. (I could even be a virgin if you so chose it.)  
Did I lose my key and knock on your door so I can stay at your place until my parents get home?  
Maybe I was masturbating as you walked into my room, will you blackmail me to satisfy your needs?  
Did you walk in on me in the shower? Or did I walk in on you?  
Was I staring in your bedroom window when you caught me while you were undressing?    
Have I grown into a fine young man of who you don't mind getting a piece and doing anything in your power to seduce me?  

&amp;nbsp;

*#3: The Celeb/Businesswoman's Assistant*  
Are you famous or rich/powerful? Do you require an assistant that will aid you in anything? Why not the new shy company intern? He looks cute right?  
Am I your driver who always spends some quality alone time with you in the car?  
Am I the guy who cleans your pool, takes care of your garden and takes care of you?  
Am I your personal masseur who you command to oil up and take care of every inch of your body?  
Are you a famous singer who gets back from touring the world and decides to turn this happy fan into your personal stress-reliever after we connected on a meet&amp;greet?  

&amp;nbsp;

**What kind of story am I looking for?**  
I purposely left out all 3 prompts as open as possible. What I want is a girl who can take charge and can *drive* the story to any plot of her liking.

&amp;nbsp;

**Let's get practical**  
- Include in your response a picture of the girl/character you wish to play? What does she look like? What is she wearing.  Also include her age and name.    
- Detailed responses in correct grammar get priority. I don't expect everyone to have a masters degree English, I'm not a native English speaker myself. But I do like a girl who knows her way around words.  
- If you so request it, I don't mind sharing a picture of me (my face) so you know who you talk to.  
- **massive** bonus points for girls who can include gifs or pictures in their stories. I have a vivid imagination, but guys are just very *visual* beings. (only pictures/gifs with 18+ actors)  
- I prefer to use some sort of online chatplatform (Chatzy or skype or if you can suggest anything else). I find the layout coding of reddit to be a distraction in the writing progress."

I've finished all the courses necessary to receive a degree in Finance and Information systems double major.


I contacted a local company and basically created my own internship with them. I've maintained poor contact with them because honestly: I'm disillusioned with their business, their ideas and I'm confident it will never go anywhere.

I need to complete a 1-credit internship to graduate in a month and honestly: I'm not interested in helping this company any more.

The amount of stress to hold up this façade of caring and doing the work isn't worth it.



The reasons I would push through and hate myself for a month:
1) To graduate to please my parents who've been supporting me financially.

The reasons I would quit:
1) To restore my sanity
2) To find a spring internship that pays and that I actually care about and can learn from.

I'm pretty disillusioned with college and having to do an internship to graduate.

Here is a...boastful self congratulatory post?  Irony aside, hopefully this resonates with some people who are desperately wanting to drink their work troubles away.  I'm pretty happy right now, and want to share that with you guys rather than /r/offmychest or somewhere else, since the support I've gotten here has helped make all of this to happen.  

I've been at the same company for the past five years.  I started as an unpaid intern to get a foot in the door and knew this company was where I wanted to be.  Unfortunately, the corporate world can suck, and my company got bought by a holding company, who merged us with other companies, and long story short, shit got crazy.  

Getting promoted or a raise became a pipe dream; everyone was just hoping they weren't in the next round of layoffs.  Things were bad, morale went from great to nonexistent within 6 months, and the place I thought I'd start a long career at all of a sudden felt like a hole I needed to crawl out of.

We have a bar next door, so the thing I looked forward to every day was getting out, walking over 20 feet, and pounding a few beers with my coworkers.  Then I'd continue drinking, and so on.  Generally my hangovers kept me from being productive until at least noon, but once I had lunch and my headache was gone, my first thought was back to drinking.

And it's a cycle, as many here can attest to.  I got drunk to not feel horrible about my job and my life, to forget how underpaid, underutilized, and bored I was.  I got drunk because it made waiting for the good things that never came easier.

In the past two months though, I've changed more than just my drinking.  I was applying to places, networking, doing all the adult, professional stuff that I thought was reserved for normal people who had their shit together.  But at work, I was still bored.  So I decided to do something drastic.

I researched, put together a proposal, and went to the VP of my department with a plan to completely overhaul how my department handles our main duties.  I saw them as ineffective, knew that we were technological dinosaurs, and started figuring out how to fix that.

I felt like I was pretending to be someone at first.  Like, every time I've done some sort of big undertaking like this with a ton of responsibility, I've always let someone down because I'd rather get drunk.  Or if I was sober at the time, I'd just feel worthless and down on myself, questioning the point of everything.  

But my VP was on board.  Not just on board, he was excited.  He said he was happy I came to him with this, because it shows ""I get it"".  I was given his full support to continue mapping out my plan, and over the past month, I've been working my ass off on this.  I saw an opportunity and took it, when 67 days ago I'd say ""Ehh, it's not worth it.  Let's grab a beer instead"".

Yesterday I led a meeting about my project with the department VP, my direct manager, and three other department heads.  They helped guide my plan and figure out the next step, but they all listened and took direction from ME.  I was just waiting for the moment when one of them said ""Just kidding, you're at the bottom of the food chain, get back to your grunt work"".  And next week, we begin implementing my plan and overhauling our entire department-wide strategy.

During this time, my direct manager had taken a liking to me (she's relatively new with the company, but her word goes a long way).  She knew I was unhappy and had a foot out the door, and we'd discussed what it was I actually wanted to be doing.  And she'd spent time creating a new role for me with a new title and a raise.  But our company closed their wallets in August and has had a hiring, raise, and travel freeze, so she never knew when or if it would happen.

I talked to her today, and she said I've impressed a lot of people.  Word has gotten around, higher ups are aware of what I'm trying to accomplish, and they're pushing through the new job description my manager has been working towards.  For the first time in my professional career, I'm getting more than a pat on the back, or thank you email.  I'm getting promoted to a position of real responsibility, and have earned the respect of the right people.  Plus, a raise, which deep down is the best part to me.

I would not have done this if I were still drinking.  I know this for a fact, because my idea for this department-wide overhaul isn't new.  It's floated around in my head for a year now, but I never had the energy or motivation to do something about it.  I stopped living in the get through work/drink/sleep/repeat cycle, waiting for things to get better, and did something about it.

It still feels like this isn't who I am, or that any minute everyone will see right through me and the gig will be up.  Good things don't usually happen to me.  All I know right now is that when my new role starts (after the new year I believe), I won't be able to handle it unless I stay sober.  That's key.  And it's worth it to me, so very worth it.

So I'm going to go home tonight and celebrate with my fiancee.  I'm thinking Indian food and some friends over for Settlers of Catan.  I just know I don't need a glass of champagne or a beer to celebrate this.  That's the reason it took me so long to get to this point.

And I realize how boastful and obnoxious all of this sounds, especially for anyone who has stopped drinking, but hasn't had things turn around for them like I'm experiencing right now.  And I know it's not like I just figured out the meaning of life and everything will be smooth sailing from here.  If anything, I need to stay more vigilant now, because I'm at the place I've wished I could be for the longest time, and don't want to lose that.  

So a big thank you to everyone here, not just those who've given me advice publicly or privately, but anyone who's posted their stories, worries, successes or failures.  For those still stuck in a bad work situation while staying sober, I hope you're next.  

tl;dr: Drinking is still bad.  

Edit: Today just got even better.  The promotion was made official a little while ago, which is great.  But one of my best friends just texted me and said he's stopped drinking!  His drinking was on another level and deep down I'd hoped he'd make that choice.  I am so so happy he decided to stop and am looking forward to having a sober buddy.  

Edit 2: Thanks again for the words of congratulations!  I'll be honest, I posted this, left work, and immediately learned about what was ongoing in Paris at the time, and my mind got so preoccupied with that I didn't even check back.  It's the start of a new week and new position, so I'm ready to tackle whatever comes my way."

She was married and has two kids, 5 and 6 years old. The kids get scared at night, for what I assumed was just being alone at night, so they slept in bunk beds in one room. This means I got the spare bedroom that shared a wall with their room. This shared wall also had a closet, which on the other side lies their closet.

When I first moved in, I remember lying down to take a nap and having a dream about some old lady, smiling gently down at me, wearing a white night gown or something to that effect. I didn't think much of the dream at the time and I don't think I remembered it until everything started happening.

My friend told me that they thought they had a ghost. They had never seen anything, but their pets would randomly growl at a corner for a few minutes and then look around confused and go back to doing what they were before. She explained before they bought the house, an older woman had died there and it took some time before anyone had found her. They had renovated it afterwards and the family sold it to them. Nothing weird had happened to them, and then of course, I moved in...

I wasn't used to being in a small house with kids, and the house would creak with the fluctuations of the summer temperature. And I sometimes had to get up at 3:30am to start my day, so my sleep schedule was always inconsistent. I was never really sure if I just woke up on my own or if something woke me up. But I would hear creaking and shuffling in my closet. The door to the closet had been removed and the stuff in the closet was mostly my friend's stuff, and I just assumed it was shifting. I wouldn't pay much attention to it and just fall back asleep. And sometimes I would jerk out of sleep, or at least I thought I would. For example, I would feel like someone grabbed my shoulder and tried to spin me onto my back. Or one time, I felt my legs lift up to the knee and slam back down onto the bed. It freaked me out, thinking it was their ghost, but I thought I was reading too much into it and was sleep deprived.

Then one weekend morning, I was asleep when I heard one of their kids shout ""MOM!"" It woke me up, and I lied in bed for a minute thinking I had dreamt it. I waited a minute when I heard him shout again, so I got up and barged into his room, thinking something was wrong. I saw him sitting up, eyes wide looking at his closet, which again, was back-to-back with my closet. He didn't even hear me come in, so I called his name. He looked to me and then back to closet and said, ""She's gone!""

""Who's gone?"" I asked, deathly afraid of his answer.

He then started describing an old woman, much like I had seen in my dream when I first moved in.

I was freaking out, but I had to downplay it and make it sound like he was dreaming and not to freak his little sister out. I told my friend about it later and she just kind of teased me about having my own ghost. My sister is a ""paranormal afficionado"", so I had called her, from the safety of my car so hopefully if there was a ghost, it wouldn't hear me talk about it. She told me even if I was imaging things, talking to whatever spirit was there would either give my subconscious some peace of mind, or it would give the ghost some kind of validation of being recognized. She told me next time something funky happened, to say to please not do that again, or something to that affect.

Some time later, I woke up in the middle of the night, again. I have an Ionic Breeze, which is one of those air towers that pulls in air, filters it, and then spits it back out in the room. When it gets too clogged, it starts making an a static sound that progresses over time, say a few hours or so, before the safety component shuts it off. I have that plugged in next to my bed. I woke to that static whir and it was too loud to have just woke me up then and not earlier. Just as I thought about how loud it was, the safety component shut it off and left my room in an eerie silence. Before I could write it off as a dirty filter, I started hearing shuffling in my closet, and I was not having it.

I announced to the room that it was late and I really need to get sleep so that I can go to work in the morning and to have ""them"" please stop so I can go back to sleep. It took me a while to go back to sleep, but I didn't hear anything afterwards and don't think I had any jerking. After that night, I pretty much forgot about the whole thing, so I guess telling it to stop worked.

Not a super spooky story, but I think it's my only ""maybe paranormal"" encounter.

TLDR: Closet ghost making noises and kids are seeing it. Told it to go away and it did."

3sphdy,4,2015-11-13,Me [36 M] with my W [32 F] moving forward from first love.,movingon1234567890,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sphdy/me_36_m_with_my_w_32_f_moving_forward_from_first/,"Looking for advice from others who may have gone through or are going through something similar to me (that's why we all post, right?)

Chapter 1

Starts off with the first love. I was a late bloomer. I didn't have my first kiss or a girlfriend until I was 17. The cool thing was, my first girlfriend was the girl I always wanted. I knew her since we were in pre-school. It was the kind of relationship that was just meant to be. We were just so compatible in every way. Definitely my best friend and the one that when we kissed such immense passion was there. Quickly though, this story gets thrown off the rails. Due to us being so into each other, the mother of the GF starts to despise me.  My GF mom had so many mental issues and there were some other family tragedies their family went through that just created the perfect storm for her mom to control her daughter and take from her the one thing she loved the most (me.) What started so strong, ended with her not being allowed to see me anymore. We started a pattern of seeing each other and somewhat be considered ""dating"" again until her mom would catch wind of it, and then again have to separate. This continued for years  through senior year of high school when we first started dating to junior year in college. We went to college on opposite ends of our state. We continued to keep in touch and I would drive when I could to go see her, but it was very tough during college. We both had dates with other people during those early college years but no girl ever matched her. The problem was her mom just continued to be so controlling. We tried to date again but her mom said that they would no longer help her with any college bills if she dated me and even threatened to kick her out of the house if she was with me. This all happening after we met up one time and her mom found out and threatened to call the cops on me (the woman is certifiably insane). The summer between our Junior and Senior year of college the GF (who will call Lacy from here on out) had an internship and was asked out on a date by a guy a few years older than her. The kicker is, Lacy's mom knew this guy from a friend of their family and liked him. There was nothing really special about him. He was older than us (never went to college) went right to work, so he had some money saved up. I guess Lacy's mom felt that he was a provider for her daughter. Anyways, this guy (Matt) asked Lacy out on a date. She agreed, mostly to appease her mom. Lacy told me about being asked out and I responded by saying ""if I truly love you, then I want you to be happy and right now that's obviously not possible with me. She couldn't risk having financial support taken away with only 1 year of college left. Well low and behold they went on a date and being that her mom liked this guy, it opened the doors for her to have a real relationship. A relationship where you can be with someone for holidays and at your house, etc. When I heard that they continued to go on dates, I just fell into a depression. I became fairly reckless my senior year of college then and got heavily into drinking and not caring about women. I was too immature at the time to know what it would be like to fight for Lacy. Over the course of that senior year I guess Lacy had broken up once with Matt and the reason being is that he ""wasn't me"". She knew she didn't really love him the way she loved me. Yet, he was more mature than me at the time and knew how to pursue her and he also provided security for her as soon as she graduated college. He had a house to move into and a job to provide. I was like so many other people trying to get on my feet after college. So that summer after graduation, he proposed and she said yes. I feel deeper and deeper into depression. After being depressed for over a year, I finally was able to get my life together and I moved away from that area for a new job and a new life. 

Chapter 2

After moving away, I was on an instant messenger for work and lo-and behold, whose name do I see pop-up on my list, but Lacy's. I was overwhelmed with the butterflies and excitement. I sent a message that just stated ""hey stranger"" That one message eventually evolved into use chatting online and emailing every day. She shared how she had made a mistake getting married to Matt and everything was just pouring out over how controlling her mom was (things at the time they were happening, I knew nothing about). It all was making sense as to why something so amazing wasn't allowed to be. She also told me she had a child. That was a tough blow, but we continued talking until our conversations escalated to the point where she said if she didn't have the child, she would have left Matt go be with me. I didn't want to be a home wrecker and I was getting involved in a relationship myself, so we both felt guilty and decided it best to stop talking. Well this talking and not talking when on for years. We would talk for a couple months, things would escalate, then we'd stop for a few months, then pick up again.  Things finally got out of hand when I was in a very serious relationship. Lacy and I were talking again while I Was in this serious relationship (1+ years together) and my emails with Lacy were all the fantasies of what could have been, what things could be. Well the girl I was with at the time, found all those emails and the crap hit the fan. My relationship ended, and my guilt was so overwhelming that I just couldn't talk with Lacy anymore. I never viewed myself as the cheating type, but here I was engaged in an emotional affair. These are the times people call you scumbag in comment sections. I stopped talking with Lacy for good. 

Chapter 3

Two and a half years go by. No communication with Lacy since ""D-day"". I found myself newly married but struggling. My new wife struggles with many mental health issues that make her life and my own extremely difficult, but I love her. One day out of the blue, I get an email from Lacy. I can't believe it. I ignore it for quite a while, but my curiosity and selfishness get the best of me and I respond. Like always, what starts as innocent grows until we are back to where we were 3 years ago. We both end up being each other's confidant for our marriages and this time it's harder to stop talking since my marriage is such a struggle. WE continue the trend of on again off again communication. My guilt usually wins out and we go a very long time without talking. I don't want to be a home wrecker and I want to be there for my wife and hold true to the vows I took to love her for better or worse. But there will always be that strong pull towards the person I feel I should have always been with. 

Conclusion

I no longer communicate with Lacy. It's just too difficult. My life is so hard with the living conditions I have and I can't add that fuel to my unhappy fire.  Besides the obvious of counseling, how do I move forward knowing there is someone that is perfect for me out there that I can't have? How do I move forward and give all I can to my wife?

tl;dr (stuck on a past love, but desperately wanting help to move forward in marriage)"
3spvib,1,2015-11-13,Depression and emotional invalidation.,motherfuckingriot,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3spvib/depression_and_emotional_invalidation/,"I've been dealing with depression periodically since high school. The last 2 years it has gotten particularly bad (especially the last 6 months). I have a particularly hard time talking to people about it and there are only a few people I really feel comfortable talking about these feelings and problems with (typically very close friends who can relate to these emotions).  

I'm a senior in college and about 3 weeks ago I had to withdraw from my classes because my depression/anxiety were really getting in the way of my progress, and on top of that I totaled my car (making it impossible to travel to my required internship). I'll be returning next semester (with an easier schedule and a job I truly enjoy).

I made appointment with the doctor and he started me on lexapro, recommended eating right, sleeping right, working out, working, engaging in my hobbies and going to counselling.

 I'm living at home now with my parents. They moved about 2 years ago, to the middle of no where. I feel totally worthless because I'm stuck with no one around me, no school, no work and just generally feel uncomfortable here. Its really not home for me, I don't really have a room of my own and I've been sleeping in the guest room.My belongings are all in a pile in the basement. I feel like I have no reason to get out and do anything because there really is nothing for me to do.

These  2-3 weeks I've been feeling even worse. I hate being here. Usually over summer and break I would stay at my sister's house in my home town. I had a job there, friends but I still didn't have a room of my own (I would sleep on an air mattress). I sort of feel like I'm just in the way anywhere I go.  My parents want me staying where I am until the end of January when the next semester starts up again. I haven't made any progress

I would have really liked to have stayed down by school, because I was offered a job, I had friends and people who listen and a gym I could have gone to, but the school kicked me off campus because I had to withdraw from my classes.

Anyway, I think a big problem with me staying with my parents is that they invalidate my emotions. Any time I am honest with them, it seems like they disregard my feelings. I feel like I am being told I'm wrong for feeling the way I feel, such as my mother telling me it's not important for me have a healthy social life right now. On top of that, I feel very guilty for not wanting to be where I'm at or being there for the things they dealt with. My old brother had a TBI, heroin addiction and has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for ~7 years and my mother is recovering from breast cancer. I feel like an asshole for not being there for the things they put up with. I feel guilty and I feel selfish and I feel wrong for feeling the way I do. I don't think I should be feeling this way. I don't know what to do to make progress with myself. I haven't left this room in 3 weeks to do anything besides eat and smoke cigarettes. I can't talk to my parents because it just makes me feel worse. When I do talk to them I feel like a real asshole.

I'm sorry this is so long, and if you made it this far, I really appreciate it. Any help would be great. Thank you. "

Rant:  My GF is employed with health benefits while I am an intern at the moment for the next year.  It is that time of year for open enrollment and we found out that her Kaiser premiums are going up.  We were expecting to not pay much other than a copay for the delivery and fees.  Starting next year kaiser will charge a $250 deductible + 10% co-ins for maternal coverage.  We confirmed with Kaiser that we will most likely be charged our max of $6k.  That is ridiculous and no way in a financial situation to pay that.  

  It sucks that we already had a doctor and had planned to have our baby delivered at a certain location.  
 
  Our solution is to change insurance provider with Aetna which will cover everything 100%.  However, know we have to start over in selecting a hospital and doctor where we will deliver the baby.  It is our first time outside of Kaiser so we are a bit confused on the process.   

 Anyone have any suggestions or tips on how to choose a delivery center/hospital?  

Thank you!  "

I've felt really empty lately.",Macklem0st,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3sqn1v/i_hate_to_ask_for_this_but_please_pray_for_me_ive/,"Second year university student here, and I shouldn't be complaining about my life but it's like I can't find happiness. I go to a school that I love and surround myself by people that I live and have landed my dream internship for this coming summer.

I feel empty though. I'm an extrovert feeling like I don't have real friends. I live with 4 other guys and oftentimes feel like the odd man out. One man is the life of the party that everybody loves, two of the guys are best friends together, and the last is enough of a lone wolf that he does his own thing. I crave a tight-knit group of friends, but I just feel out of place and disposable among them all. That being said, I haven't developed super close relationships with other people enough to where I can hang out with them outside of class/student orgs/casually running into each other. I put a lot of pressure on myself socially, and right now it's just not coming together. I have the best group of friends from high school that I still love to death, and I can't find anything close to that here.

During my internship search I was really growing in my faith and got really close to God, which after half a year of letting my faith slip was a relief. It was easy for me to go through a taxing period of interviews and job search and pray to God that I can follow His perfect plan for me. Now I can barely think of anything but myself feeling lonely though, and my prayers don't feel genuine.

I have so much that I'm so thankful for, but I can't find happiness, I can't shake this feeling of loneliness, and I'm drowning it with alcohol and girls that I meet at frat parties. I just hope that I can regain my faith again and feel full, and would really appreciate your thoughts and prayers.

Thank you for listening to my stream of conscience."

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sqoej/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I've never managed to figure out exactly where it is.

Back in 2007, I was employed with the Albemarle County IT Department as an intern for literally two weeks (long story). One afternoon, we hauled several old computer monitors to an old factory somewhere near Market Street or the surrounding area. It seems that we traveled through a small neighborhood to get there. The factory was being used as a big storehouse for junk that I suppose was being kept there for eventual disposal/recycling.

My question is whether anyone knows of this factory and its location. I suspect it's the Woolen Mills factory on the Rivanna, but I'm not sure because I'm not particularly familiar with that part of town."

3sshmg,1,2015-11-14,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sshmg/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3ssrii,2,2015-11-14,[REQUEST][STEAM] Another person asking for Fallout 4,CannibalisticZebra87,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3ssrii/requeststeam_another_person_asking_for_fallout_4/,"Okay, where do I start... My name is Cannibalisticzebra87, but all my friends call me Zebra. I am a Fallout addict. I guess it's been about 6 years since I got hooked and look where it landed me. Living on the streets, scavenging trash bins for a little sip of some left over Nuka-Cola, even going as far as to mutilate other people in my situation with a massive hammer just to get a few extra caps. I need help...

Alright all joking aside I really do love these games and believe me, I would have bought this one by now if I had the chance. I am a freelance photographer, an unpaid intern for a local video production company, a donut salesman, and a student. you may be asking yourself right now ""what the hell?! This piece of shit has three damn jobs and cant buy a $60 dollar game!!"" Well you'd be right. My internship is unpaid, I started as a way to make more connections and get a head start for when I choose to jump into the field on my own and it takes up almost all of my time. As for the photography, not many people want any kind of shoot done in the middle of Georgia winter. I mainly work with senior photos for high school, prom pictures, and children sports photography. None of which are thriving right now. Over the summer months I tend to make a large sum all at once and am able to ration that out with smaller side jobs until spring comes around, but once winter comes, well there isn't much wiggle room for ""will nilly spending"". Donuts don't really help too much either as that is more of a passion project than something to live off of.

I wanted to ask for this game sooner to be honest. I just couldn't make myself do it. in all honesty I hate asking for things. I feel as if i'm taking advantage of a good community and receiving a game that someone more deserving should have gotten, but I guess I just caved. Fallout has been my favorite game since I played Fallout 2 and then went back and played every other game in the franchise even a few of the spinoffs. I love everything about the games, flaws and perfections. I've always been a pretty avid gamer. No matter how much I know i'm going to regret it in the morning, I'll still stay up an extra hour on work nights just to get in a little bit of GTA or Titan Souls before I reluctantly go to bed (maybe it's for the better you actually don't give me this game so I can keep my job)J^K^J^K^J^K Every time I play one of these games I feel like a whole new person. Out here I may have only $100 dollars to spend for that week, but in there I'll be damned if I don't pick up every piece of scrap and sell that shit to be a millionaire and bathe in all these sweet, rusty, caps.

I'm not going to lie. I am an extremely busy person. I may have only 3 hours everyday to play this game, but I can put my life on it saying I'll be enjoying the shit out of it for those 3 hours. I love these games so much and just getting to enjoy this one would make my year! Everyday at work I walk past this old restaurant that plays the same sweet, relaxing hits as New Vegas and every now and then I'll hear the smooth lyrics of Dean Martin as ""aint that a kick in the head"" plays over their one speaker and I just stand there for a moment and take it all in. My point behind this is that, I won't neglect this game. I'm not some stay at home bum who just doesn't want to go work up some extra money for the game and I'm not some guy who will get it and throw it off to the side after a few days. I can make a promise that I will play it every opportunity I get and not just to show my appreciation but also to because I love the games.

I'm sure there are plenty other people who deserve this game way more than I do and most likely just have the same fear of asking just like me. Even if I don't receive this game I hope everyone who is like me, see's this post and can muster up the courage to ask for that game they really want but know they just can't afford at the time. Who know's maybe that one cool guy/gal in the same situation is you, got a little extra cash and is looking to help someone out! I know that as soon as summer months come around I hope to be that cool guy in this community that can help people get that one game they've been dying for. Thanks for taking the time to read through all this and have a happy nuclear winter!

TL:DR I didn't know if one of these were required so i'm putting it here just in case ;)"
3ssthi,2,2015-11-14,Diagnosed as undoubtedly ADHD-PI (ADD) 5 years ago. Returned to therapist after 5 years of no help/medication and he said I reminded him of Asperger instead. Accepted it until I read online. Now sessions have devolved into discussions and I feel like they don't let me explain myself decently.,DenGrijzen,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/3ssthi/diagnosed_as_undoubtedly_adhdpi_add_5_years_ago/,"I don’t want a diagnosis from you guys, I hope it doesn’t like I do in which case it would be against the rules (I hope not, it took a lot of time writing this). I just get the feeling that there is a chance that you people who actually have Asperger will laugh at this situation and that you might find the whole notion of me having Aspergers or another form of autism ridiculous.

It's a bit of a last resort together with new tests I’m going to do, psychiatrists and therapists most of the time don’t share our conditions (whatever mine might be). They know about the symptoms but they’ll never know how it works exactly (my opinion). I'm in search of answers and I think those provided through the ""official"" channels (psychiatrist/therapist) were not enough.

I hope I don’t offend anyone here, I don’t want to come over as someone who desperately doesn’t wants to be labelled with this “handicap”. (For the record I personally think a lot of these disorders are just natural diversity amongst the human race, if everyone was the same society wouldn’t function.)
In fact I’m warming up the idea of being a hybrid and belonging to both “clubs”. I’ve never saw my ADD diagnosis as negative and I won't see the new one (that I'll get after the tests) as negative. It doesn't change who I am, I feel like if I could get my irrational anxiety and shame under control that I could do anything. That I'm not that far removed from functioning in a way that I can do what I want.

But I let the psychiatrist and therapist talk on and on and it ended with me getting prescribed “anti-psychotic” Absilify against stress. Which I feel is a bit overkill, if I already need such medication I think a lot of people need it too.

The psychiatrist nor the therapist seem to be able to provide me with clear answers, one hour each appointment is just not enough. The whole ordeal feels rushed. After all this reading and listening I still don’t know what Asperger entails exactly.

I’m of the opinion that they haven’t given me the chance to explain myself decently and they are drawing simplified conclusions on rather complex issues which are caused by many factors.

**Now for some more background information (I tried to keep it as short as possible). If you feel like TL;DR you can skip to the symptoms below.**

I have recently accepted that I might have an unhealthy social lifestyle (although I’m content) and that I probably have social anxiety that has taken extreme proportions in the last years. That I should seek help in the form of therapy. This was shortly after I returned to a psychiatrist for a Ritalin prescription and Insomnia bursts getting out of control.

During the second appointment he suddenly dropped that I didn’t remind him of ADHD-PI but of Aspergers. At first I was taken a back a bit but then he explained and I was still in a slight shock but I accepted it. “I didn’t know people with Asperger had concentration problems too!” But then I started reading, first on official sites he gave me (the wording was a bit vague there) but then I expanded. During the first hour I was still in agreement but then I started reading things that I really didn’t see myself in. I talked with my mother about it who had also been reading about it and we were both in agreement that I probably didn’t have it.

I made a list of symptoms I didn’t find myself in, with anecdotes why. I think it was about 10-12 symptoms. With every symptom he would say that not all people with autism or Asperger are the same, some lack certain symptoms or have reduced version of them. After the third appointment ended I was once again convinced of my Asperger. Then I discussed some more with my mother and was once again convinced I didn’t really share your condition, or maybe a light version of it.

The therapist sent his information to my psychiatrist with my approval, it’s during the appointment with the psychiatrist that it went wrong. I really felt like he had the wrong image of me and that I wasn’t given the chance to correct it. My mother is really against stimulants and she emphasized the negative effects the Ritalin had on me. I think she hoped he would force me to stop, but what she didn’t expect is that he then prescribed Absilify, he said she shouldn’t worry about the label “anti-psychotic”.

At first I found it funny that my mother had accidentally helped validate the psychiatrist his views and that her actions caused the prescription in part. I approached the Absilify rather positive, I thought it was overkill too but I would find it rather awesome to never feel stress. To become that ice cold guy in complete control like I always wanted to be (well since I took Ritalin). But after I read about the side effects and the half-life I was taken aback. My mother was relieved. I started getting the feeling that this was going too far. I had always put a lot of trust in psychiatrists and trusted their judgement, discarding people’s criticism of them and their stimulant prescriptions as ignorant nonsense. But I feel like maybe I should put up some resistance and that they might be wrong. 

Wtf happened? Three years ago I thought of myself as stress-resistant and now I would suddenly be unable to handle stress and suffering from meltdowns to such a degree that I’d need Absilify? The stress-resistant thing was a self-delusion, but I don’t think you can keep the delusion up if you’re actually overburdened with stress.

I brought my mother to the next therapy session. Well to cut things short, the sessions have devolved in discussions, which I wanted to avoid as I don’t want to offend the therapist. And I would almost take the Absilify not to offend the Psychiatrist (with which I have another appointment), or maybe I don’t want them to think any less of me.

So I said I wanted to do tests with a new and neutral psychiatrist who knows nothing about me. And I don’t want tests with questions since I sort of know what answers I need to give for a certain diagnosis and I feel like the answers of these tests are influenced by many other factors independent of disorders.

To be honest I’m really starting to get confused. It’s like I no longer fit the mould for ADHD-PI and I don’t think I fit the mould for Asperger/Autism either but I’m definitely not neurotypical, well most people aren’t, but I’m as far removed from a neurotypical as someone with extreme ADHD. 

I have gone as official as I could, with DSM-V criteria. The DSM-V criteria of ADHD-PI describe me perfectly. I feel like I could have ADHD-PI (with a lot of symptoms under control) with an out of control Social Anxiety coupled with laziness.
I have the feeling that it could be glaringly obvious that I don’t have Aspergers when I list all my symptoms. I know that it can be annoying when people claim to have the same disorder as you when they really don’t go through the same struggles. This goes in the territory of “Well I have that too, it’s normal and not that big of a deal”. I once had this with a girl when I tried to explain to a rather large group people who were mocking me being so weird, in my panic I said I have ADD and she then proclaimed she has it too (and look at her being so normal). 

**Symptoms:**

* First off, I have concentration deficits. Or rather I’m unable to focus on things that don’t interest me. Well there are gradations, I can focus more on physics and math than economics. But I can focus even more on programming than math. But all of those things don’t interest me as much as my really interests. When I’m doing those things other thoughts are constantly running parallel or through my focus. I’m working on a book right now, I have a great imagination and 5 years of not paying attention in class and daydreaming on the train has resulted in a very cool idea. The book interests me but it’s still work. Sometimes I get these bursts of inspiration and then I start working on the book. But even then the thoughts are all over the place and I’m racing to write them all down. I’m working on one scene and my brain is already generating dialogue for a separate one. 
* I’m a huge procrastinator, I have tried to fight it but I always fall back 
* To overcome my concentration and procrastination deficits I have used pressure/stress to do my schoolwork. During my internship it was peer pressure that kept me going. I didn’t even dare to look at reddit.* 
* Before this whole chain of events I always thought me empathy was overdeveloped. When I watch the news and see people suffering I used to get a feeling of sadness over me and then feel really angry and imagine crazy things about saving those people in the most heroic ways and killing the ‘baddies’ without mercy. I had to actively try and disconnect myself from those things. I strived to become more selfish, because of the belief that too much empathy is weakness which can exploited. Along with some naivity I used to have people have abused my kindness, which caused me to become really suspicious of most people. 
* I think I have gotten most emotions under control expect shame. I’d describe myself as shame-phobic, I go to great lengths to avoid even the slightest feeling of embarrassment. There is also this thing when I’m watching a movie or a series that I feel shame for certain characters who are doing awkward things. I sometimes even pause the movie/episode when it gets too much. Talked with my mother about this and she said she has that too. She often changes the channel because of it.
At the party for my sisters birthday I looked away when she had to dance in front of everyone with her boyfriend. When I watch performers (violinist, stunt(wo)man, …) doing crazy things I also get this uneasy feeling, like I’m really afraid that they’ll fail and embarrass themselves.
* I’ve always had friends, most of them are still from primary school who also followed me onto secondary school (the “big school”, 1500 students, age 12-18). Never felt the need to make any new ones, it’s already hard staying in touch with the ones I already have. We have some tensions from time to time but we stick together. Did I get lucky?
* I have bullied others (really regret this) to try and advance my “reputation”. I joined in on the bullying of someone I once considered my best friend in primary school. He fell out with the rest of the class. Funnily enough because of my extreme behaviour I became an outcast myself in that class later on. But there was no bullying, only that I was the last one left when forming groups and stuff like. I’m not trying to excuse my behaviour, but it was like the “culture” of school life guided me in that direction. This was mainly from my 12-15 years. I have sort of been bullied myself but it probably wasn’t that extreme. It didn’t take much to get me down, I was really fragile and insecure. A horrible cliché for a bully, I know. Besides regret, I’m really ashamed. They laughed with a facial tick around my nose for about a half year once (which made it worse of course) and I remember one guy throwing my pencil case around.
* There have been times that I have stopped situations getting out of control (like attempts to harass me) with violence. I was never good with words at those times, especially when my brain freezes (I was too easily swayed by emotions), so my frustrations often turned into hate and anger. Sometimes it overtook me and I ended up hitting 2 guys on the nose and one on the back of his head (luckily I was too slow that time). That was during the four years on my first secondary school. I then switched schools and I just remembered that I stopped a harasser there too. Who funnily enough became a friend later on because we both played the same videogame. Which leads me onto the next thing.
* Apparently I’m really forgiving, even though I think I’m not. I always think I would make harassers pay if I meet them again. Yet there have been three people who harassed me in the past and somehow when I met them again years later I automatically acted as if we were “friends”, as did they.
* I can be impulsive. The punches I dealt out were impulsive but also in traffic I have done dangerous things, I have gotten that under control now. The aggressive and impulsive behaviour is something which defines my father, even when he is nearing fifty.
* I’m afraid to offend people. When I write an email I always try to make it sound as friendly as possible without becoming informal. I often say to my friends or relatives that I found their behaviour a bit rude or offensive and that they should avoid such things in the future. I always postpone emails, it seems my social anxiety also doesn’t help.
* -I’m also generally way too busy with what other people think of me. So far that I avoid social situations or avoid talking about my social life.
* -I definitely have social anxiety, which seems to have taken extreme proportions lately. Whereas I used to be only afraid of parties or large social gatherings with people of my age group. When its social gatherings of adult people I never feel this way though. I feel like a lot of the “nonsense”, that doesn’t interest me, is pushed aside when it comes to adult events. You can just stand, drink and talk.
* I love to talk about a broad range of subjects, but I guess it needs some sort of depth to them (hope that doesn’t sound pretentious). I dabble in multiple subjects, like politics, history, psychology, video games, movies and books (just stories in general), philosophy, … I go as far as they interest me but I never go super deep. I have never really read in great detail about certain philosophies or political ideologies.
* Small talk doesn’t interest me in the slightest and I always feign interest when necessary. When my mother starts talking about clothes I just become unresponsive and nod. I do love talking about family drama, don’t know why. Analysing why said relative does what (s)he does.
* Never noticed problems or a difference with other people when it comes to recognizing faces. I’m always the first one in the group who notices someone getting agitated at our behaviour. Which leads me to the next thing. The smallest indication in one’s body language leads me to thinking the worst in that they think I’m weird and that they think less of me.
* In certain social situations I can become really aware of everything, including my own behaviour. I often get the feeling that the whole room is watching me, analysing my every move and appearance.
* I am lazy, just like my father and my grandmother. (But of course now the therapist sees that as an excuse to avoid Asperger diagnose).
* Guessing people’s intentions, motivation and feelings is hard one. I have made “diagnoses” about people in the past which later turned out to be spot on. But on the other hand I always think of the worst case scenario when it comes to feelings related to me. I have a really stubborn friend who has done that in the past though, could my interactions with this person over all those years have had their influence?
* Don’t think I suffered from meltdowns or something like that. Both my mother and father have said I was a calm child (unlike my sister and half-brother). As long as you didn’t take away time for video games I didn’t put up much of a fight. When we mentioned this to the psychiatrist he simply said, “then you raised him very well madam.”
* Unexpected things can give an annoying feeling. If I expect an evening playing video games or watching a movie I really want to watch and then a friend asks to go out into the city or some other event then it needs to sink in for 10-30 minutes before I would accept. On the other hand if I expect to do some boring chores for a whole evening and suddenly it is cancelled then I get really happy. Pleasant surprises can make feel very good as in “I’m one lucky son of a bitch.”
* I don’t really have a planning, when it comes to schoolwork I make vague and unrealistic expectations in my head which I never meet. Like I’ll push myself so I’m done with homework at eight pm so that I can play some video games for three hours. I don’t reach my deadline and I end up working until ten and only play one hour of video games. I haven’t played as much as I wanted but at least my school work is sort of in order.
* I love discussing, or I think I do until I notice I have brought it too far and endangered my relation with someone. I just realized I’m often afraid that my friends will turn on me, that they’ll get sick of me and abandon me. Anyway back to discussions. It was a frustration during secondary school that I couldn’t express or state my opinions exactly how I wanted to due to a brain freeze in tense situations. The Rilatin seemed to have helped with this. In situations where I don’t feel the threat of harassment I can now express almost exactly what I want and suddenly got very good in discussions.
The drawback is that I love to attack someone else his opinions. When someone is mad at me and blurt outs what he thinks interrupting me and then says “And now we’ll stop, I’ve had enough of it.” Then I think, “now it’s my turn” and then I go for the kill. Even though I know it’s dangerous and the other person is getting agitated I will not stop because of selfish reasons. I give them the chance to speak, I just expect them to do the same for me.
But as soon as people (who are not friends or relatives) seem to go in “bully mode”, I feel threatened and my brain starts shutting down. It’s like it triggers some sort of flashbacks to secondary school.
* I go way too much into detail, both when I speak and when I write. I thought this was going to be short, I ended up writing for five hours. And now it’s probably going to get removed and I’ll think fuck, why did I have to spent so much time on this. I’m a really bad storyteller because of this, I keep remembering details when speaking which I then need to mention of course.


So is there any chance I belong to this club? Or is it just too far-fetched?

3stnlr,132,2015-11-14,"My dh refuses to work for a job. He is 37, out of work since end of February. I am going crazy.",LHRla,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3stnlr/my_dh_refuses_to_work_for_a_job_he_is_37_out_of/,"We live in Los Angeles, we have no kids. I am 38, married 5 years, together for 10.  DH was laid off end of February, no big deal- it was just a job to get by while he completed his masters degree in IT. He collected unemployment benefits and I told him it was an opportunity to network, even intern, in his new field.

Fast forward to today, Dh did finish the degree, but does nothing but smokes pot, works out, a bit of household chores. No effort made to get a job. His benefits are used up and now he must draw from his very limited saving in order to contribute to household expenses. 

I am going crazy, we really need a second income!! I own my own business and have gone through a slow time-- at the moment I cant support the two of us!! Los Angeles is very expensive place to live! 

Nothing works- we go to marriage therapy, I nag him, I don't nag him--no change. Each day goes by without him making an effort to find a job!! Every week in therapy he says he will start looking, never does. Fwiw his father paid for his masters degree.

We own our house together so I can't kick him out. Everyone tells me not to move out--- but it is so draining and depressing spending my life around him, I am thinking of just moving into my office.

I realize I am married to a man child who will likely never change. I am working on getting myself in a place so I can walk away-- I have no family at all near by. Should I just completely give up on my dh?

TLDR- my husband refuses to look for a job, we need the second income. How do I stop myself from going crazy with worry?

3sv1qt,1,2015-11-14,My ex [22/M] and I [20/F] mutually broke up after almost 2 years of relationship. Ex brought Tinder girl over but I'm more upset about how I'm not going to sex with him anymore?,mokkasins,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sv1qt/my_ex_22m_and_i_20f_mutually_broke_up_after/,"A little about me and my ex: My ex and I have completely different backgrounds. I go to school, he doesn't. I work as a hostess on the weekends while he's a music producer who doesn't really get paid, unless there's a huge project going on. We don't really listen to the same music. He smokes, I don't. I'm Asian, he's white, therefore the family values collide many times. Despite the differences, we loved each other through the good and bad. And at times, it was the differences that kept us together. We broke up once during Christmas 2014, and again 2-3 months ago (final), and as of right now, still talk as we are best friends.

As a student and part-time worker, I'm really busy ever since I started college. The past summer, I've interned at an aquarium from 9am-5pm, and continue to work at my part-time job on the weekends. My ex was very lenient with my busy schedule however, it started to go down as the summer comes to an end. He started to complain how he felt like he was ""in a relationship with a phone"" and that ""we never really get much intimacy anymore."" I convinced him that it'll be a lot better when school starts (false) and that I'll be able to visit him much more after I finish up the internship (true). 

However, fights and arguments ensued as school started as I get very nit-picky about things (Type A personality) whereas he gets really nonchalant and laid back about the things that I get up-tight about (Type B). Although we always ended those arguments with ""I'm sorry,"" tensions lingers as my ex is the type that says that ""It is ok"" or ""You don't have to apologize,"" when a day or two"" he brings back the topic up again. As midterms rolled around this semester, our sparks dimmed, and dimmed, and dimmed. I found myself downloading Tinder for one night only (later deleted) and flirting with a guy at the library. I told my ex about how I felt and that my ex understood what's been happening and talk about the plans how we should light up the spark again. 

But once again, arguments ensued several days (or maybe weeks) afterwards and we finally broke up two or three months ago on mutual terms, starting that we are just two different people with two different schedules and two different goals in the future. Earlier I said, we broke up around Christmas but went back together. During that Christmas breakup, I broke down very very hard. However, this time I felt ... normal and relieved, like I wasn't being suffocated by the neediness, and I finally had some time to myself without any complaints. However, we began a fwb relationships after we finally broke up and our fwb relationships worked a lot better than the relationship during my internship. Regardless I missed him and loved him very much even though we were just two different person with two different personalities. 

Since those 2-3 months, we have been fwb but still talk and hang out as best friends like we always were. I didn't feel any of those emotional feelings flourishing but more on the sex (physical aspects) that I really enjoyed.  I made clear to him that our fwb will end once he starts having sex with someone else (I usually don't go out and find people to have sex with ...). 

Yesterday night, I realized that he invited a girl from Tinder over, had sex, and slept over. They are together right now and sleeping over until tomorrow morning.

This morning, I felt awful. I felt I was ""betrayed. Not about how the ""friendship"" or ""relationship"" with the Tinder girl have with my ex, but more like I don't have a sex partner anymore and I felt really sad that I'm not going to have sex anymore. Like there was a void empty when it has always been filled for the past 2 years. Which led to me text spamming him, like a crazy ex, trying to get my point across when he thinks I want to get back together. 

Is there something that I'm confusing myself with? 

TL;DR: Ex and I broke up after an almost 2 year relationship. Remained fwb for a short time afterwards. Ex invited Tinder girl over yesterday night. I'm more sad on how I'm not going to have sex with him anymore than the girl sleeping over. Am I just having a void of sex, generally? Or do I actually still have feelings for him?

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sv402/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3svjuq,2,2015-11-15,"Me [25M] with my partner [28F] have been together 3 years, but it's all falling apart",draix89,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3svjuq/me_25m_with_my_partner_28f_have_been_together_3/,"Male (me) &amp; Female in mid 20s with 4 year old son. Relationship for over 3 years.

The past three years have been a rollercoaster of emotion. Just over 3 years ago I met this girl online, things went well - really well. She had a kid, but that didn't phase me. Six months into the relationship we move in together, in another city and began a new life together.
In hindsight, this is where it started to go wrong. 

In short, she got depressed. Moving from a small town to the big city, away from her family was too much for her and it put strain on our relationship.
My job up there finished (it was a year long paid internship) and we returned back to her home town while I finish off my studies. We got back (around 18 months ago), things were tight, we both got jobs eventually but neither of us were good with managing the money. I went back to finishing off my studies - my university is in my home town (around 1 hour drive away).

Cut forward to about 7 months ago and I get an offer for my dream job - but it's in another city thats about a 2 hour drive away. I am still studying (due to finish up next month) but I decided this opportunity is too good to pass up. We decide to stay in her hometown, in the house we currently rent now.

Since then, I have been working 30+ hours a week, commuting 4 hours a day to this awesome job, while also studying to finish off my degree. It's been really tough - I have no energy and anytime I have left at the weekends I try to spend with my step son. I've kept going because I want to better our situation, and come January next year I will be on a great salary with a degree in hand working at a job I love - what more could you want?

The difficultly is everything else is falling apart. My partner and I had a few long discussions, and we both feel like we love each but we are not in love anymore. She is coming round to the fact that she has an issue with subscription drugs to the point that it is impacting on our sons life. I am stressed out all the time trying to make our pay stretch to the end of the week, every week, and I end up taking out my frustration on her - we argue all the time.

She came to me today and said that she needs to break away from me to start to piece together her life, but what is stopping her is how much our little boy cares for me, despite me being his step Dad.

I have so much to think about - I have my dissertation and the rest of my exams to finish and study for within the next 3 weeks. My partner wants us to break up with me moving back in with my parents, but then we still have our rent to pay, bills (some of which are in contracts), my car and fuel and our living costs (food etc). How do we sort this out?

I am concerned that she won't be able to cope with the other big issues when we split. She can't manage her money (she was in a ton of debt when we met - we still have a fair amount between us) and she is struggling to even take her son to school most days.

I have been so invested in our family that I don't know what to do. I feel so numb at the end of the day. I have never felt this much pressure in my life, and I could really do without for the next month. More importantly though, we are going to tear this Childs world apart - and I just don't know what to do.

**tl;dr:** Relationship has fallen apart; not sure how to deal with the remaining fallout."

I connected well with both firm (especially regional). Is it worth doing both, or just sticking with the big 4 offer? Is taking the 2nd internship offer worth delaying my graduation by a semester for experience, which would be a semester I could spend in the real world?

Currently I am a senior in my 4th and final year of technical school where I study Web design/development. I have a decent skill set with html/CSS and some Javascript, I'm more of a front end designer with the ability to design an attractive website and actually code it. I've entered and won competitions for Web design in my previous years and am currently competing in the FBLA Web design Competition. That's just a good overview of myself as of now. 


I plan on going to a technology college (Pennsylvania college of technology), to get my bachelor's in Web and interactive media. I hope to gain enough experience and expertise in Web design to be able to take internships between school years and build myself up to land a job as a front end designer/developer after college. From there I'll see where the wind takes me. 


So, the amazing designers of reddit, do you have any suggestions or advice I can use? Also, would I be able to land a job right after college? Finally, would I be able to pay off the student loans?

We clicked instantly, I am admittedly a shy person however I always had decent luck when it came to girls. This girl was different everything felt right with her. However after a short two months we both decided that we were both not ready for a relationship and we would remain friends. (Both of us were coming off the end of a relationship hers a quite abusive one.)


A year and a half passed and we remained very good friends, best friends in fact. I would share my stories/problems with her and vice versa. We seen other people in that time and we were relatively happy.Then in October of last year I went to visit her for her birthday and we slept together. This was the first time in nearly two years. It was one of the best nights of my life and she whole heartedly agreed. 


This time we said we would take things slow, take time to enjoy each other. The following months were the best of my life, everything seemed to make sense and seeing her at the weekend or if I went to visit during the week felt like a blessing. Seeing her smile made me the happiest I could ever be. 


April came and things began to get very serious it was non stop contact with each other and we were loving every moment of it. At this point it was time to look for summer work be it an internship or something related to my field of study, same for her. We both found work abroad and were delighted. 


The two days before I left to go I spent with her. That is my happiest memory. Never have I felt so close to another human every second we savoured knowing we do not have much time left together. At this point we both knew at the back of our minds that it would be foolish to assume we would remain monogamous throughout our time abroad, as we were still relatively early in our, whatever it was, non-relationship? We said we would do our best but nothing would be certain.I taught I was happy enough with this. As I was leaving we both cried and cried, but my attention then turned to when I would see her next I booked flights to visit her halfway through our Summer. 


The Summer started and time went on. Our contact was obviously lessened but we both always found time each day to call or send messages. I often return home from a late shift to find paragraphs going into great detail of how much she missed me, the feeling was mutual. July couldn't come soon enough.


July finally came and I seen her. I felt like I was going to explode. She ran at me and we embraced. The feeling of being loved, feeling wanted is like no other, nothing exceeds it. I could only afford a short trip, four days, but they were worth every penny. At that point and time I was just waiting for the summer to be over so I could see her again. 


As the summer drew to a close messages were more sporadic due to increased working hours on both sides however we both still messaged back and forth.I taught to myself we aren't going out,we aren't boyfriend and girlfriend why not test the waters. During this time I was with another girl but I felt empty and cut it off immediately. She didn't make me feel like the other girl.


We both arrive home and we immediately make plans to meet up. We do and things are a little off. However I am so happy to see her I take little notice.(Hindsight is 20/20 right?) A few weeks go past and things don't change. She just doesn't seem as interested any more. So I confront her and ask her. She says that she loves everything about me, she loves being in my company, I'm the best sexual partner she has had and that no body makes her feel the way she feels when she is with me... but she isn't attracted to me any more and that she is not interested in a relationship. What?!?


I am completely thrown, I don't know what to do my world is completely upside down.  At first I taught we could help me get over the situation and get back to being friends. It's not what I wanted I wanted to be with her. She slipped straight back into how we were a year previous when we were friends. I just couldn't handle it any more and I cut off communications from her after advice from friends. It's been over a month and things have gotten worse and worse. 


I try to occupy myself but the second I finish what I am doing my thoughts go immediately back to her. I have tried being with other girls, I don't want to be there. Everyone is telling me that the best way to move on is to be with someone else for me its the opposite it drives me deeper into this depression, this confusion. I just cannot wrap my head around the situation.
 

Every moment of everyday my body is aching, longing to just call her, message her, see her face anything. My confidence is shot, I don't feel as involved in my hobbies be it my sport, the gym, drone flying. 


This girl is solely responsible for my highest highs in my life but also the lowest lows. I am trying my best to get out of this slump but I feel with every step I take to get out of here be it talking with friend or family, doing my hobbies, throwing myself into my studies or like I said previously trying to find someone else, nothing is ridding me of this emptiness I feel inside each and everyday. What should I do?


Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read my post and perhaps offer a slight piece of advice, anything is appreciated. Didn't want to post here and seem like one of these friendzone type posts but it's what I feel is my last resorts. Thanks reddit :)




   
**tl;dr**: Met three years ago, had 2 months of a relationship decided it was best to be friends by mutual consent, things picked up this time last year, were seeing each other exclusively but not in a relationship as we both were going abroad to work for summer months. Returned from summer working and my feelings the same hers have changed.

3sx2ts,3,2015-11-15,"Me [22M] with my ex[20F] of 1 year, she's having a lot of issues at home after break up and it tears me apart",Llamas4Brazil,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sx2ts/me_22m_with_my_ex20f_of_1_year_shes_having_a_lot/,"Three weeks ago, I broke up with my ex because I didn't really see a future with her. She on the other hand adored me, I was her escape from parents that didn't really seem to care all that much and always demand. My ex also has some psychological issues that are undiagnosed, but I'm certain are present. She's always very stressed out, used to cut herself and tried to kill herself in her youth.

Anyway, break up was super hard for me to do because I felt a lot of pity for her. I knew she loved me a lot and had issues, so I felt I was abandoning her. Three weeks on and off she's been texting and calling me, ranging from blaming me for the relationship, to saying she hopes we'll get back together, to wanting a hook up for the night. All the while the blame and guilt over the break up are really bringing me down, bringing on a depression I haven't had in a long time.

Today she sent me she had a big fight with her parents (again) and that she ran away from home for a few hours. When she got back, her parents hadn't made dinner for her and they told her they weren't paying for her foreign internship anymore because she's not doing enough to raise money (even though she's already raised over 600 euros) so she ran away again. She texted me saying she has no reason to live, that no one supports her and that she wants to run away from home. I try to be supportive, but it's difficult because we only just broke up, and in the mean time it's just tearing me apart because I feel directly or indirectly responsible for the bad things going on with her and that she now doesn't have anyone she can rely on. As a psychology student, I directed her to a nearby center where she could get free help.

On one hand I want to be there for her because I know she's having a hard time, but on the other hand I don't want to feed into her hopes of getting me back, because she has been manipulative about that. She's always saying she needs someone to hug but I can't just go over and provide that...we broke up, I'm trying to move forward but everything she calls or texts I'm pulled back into the maelstrom of guilt and pity. I'm very tired.

tl;dr Ex girlfriend is having a tough time at home, I feel guilty about it and feel I get sucked into her problems despite our break up"

3sxku9,38,2015-11-15,Food Pushers [Rant],_Pandasaurus_,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3sxku9/food_pushers_rant/,"I wasn't sure if this is the appropriate place to post this, but here it goes.

At my internship the other day (at a transitional living facility) unknown neighbors dropped off several pizzas that they have already taken slices from. Everyone at the facility is excited and apparently this is a normal occurrence. Whatever. First of all, I'm not going to eat pizza that unknown people have already gotten into, but I didn't mention that. 

The person I'm interning for offered me some. I declined. She told me to take some *at least* five more times within the next ten minutes. I told her I didn't want it, wasn't hungry and just ate. She said, ""Here. You're eating it!"" and put two slices down in front of me. I ignored it. 

Her friend showed up. (Another employee of the agency.) And brought churros and donuts. I politely declined but she insisted. I (partially) lied and said, ""No thank you. My doctor put me on a special diet for medical reasons."" Thankfully she let it go. She then proceeded to eat the churro and the pizza that had been sitting out in front of me, wrapped in a paper towel. Blegh.

Afterwards, my SO and I went to a candy shop to do some Christmas shopping. First the employee offered me a sample and I declined. Then she turned to my SO and offered him one and he said, ""No thank you. I'm allergic."" And she said, ""Oh. Are you sure?""

What the hell...no thank you means no thank you!

3sxlu3,58,2015-11-15,Mechanical Meetup Introspective,manofinterests,MechanicalKeyboards,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3sxlu3/mechanical_meetup_introspective/,"[Warning: Wall of Text]

Yesterday was the wonderfully fun 3rd Southern California Mechanical Meetup. I was able to organize the event with the help of /u/waikane of Originative Co. /u/waikane did so much to help set up the event, so shout out to him! Also a shout out to Datamancer for the raffle and giving away a keyboard to the winner of the typing contest.

&amp;nbsp;

This is the third meetup I’ve helped organize, and it was wonderful, but everything started a few months ago when I decided to host the first meetup. It was at a small fastish food place called Mendocino Farms. We sat outside, and there were about 6 of us there total. We spent hours trying out each others’ keyboards, admiring keycaps, and talking keyboards to each other. We talked about the upcoming PMK website. We talked about upcoming groupbuys. We talked about upcoming projects or keyboards in our future. We talked about the hobby we all enjoy so much. With around 6 people and a table full of keyboards we were the ‘nerds’ of the venue and we couldn’t care less. We finally had other people who wanted to talk about our hobby. People who wanted to hear what we had to say about our hobby. We wanted to hear about each other. There were students, data entry clerks, and even a chef who could all shared this passion with each other. It wasn’t much, but it was something that would lead me to continue down this wonderful road full of keyboards and a wonderful community.

&amp;nbsp;

A little bit after, the idea for the next meetup arose when I was talking to one of the members who attended the first meetup. /u/shrubkeys reached out the EliteKeyboards and we had our venue. We all coordinated a date, posted to Reddit and GH, and waited excitedly for the meetup. At this point in time, more people were vocal about attending. More people, more keyboards, more hobbyists. I really didn’t know what to expect considering the first meetup had around 6 people. To be honest with everyone, the night before this meetup I was unsure if I would make it to the meetup. I was out of a job, out of a girlfriend, and would soon be out of an apartment. I decided to go. The morning of the meetup I arrived at EliteKeyboards an hour early and simply waited. I cleared my head of expectations, hopes, and worries. There was no need for that. I just wanted to talk about my hobby to someone and truthfully I just wanted to talk to someone. It wasn’t until about 30 minutes before the official start of the meetup an intern at EK arrived and opened the door. The owner/manager of EK came only a few minutes after. He brought some waters and some basic snacks like crackers, celery, carrots, a cheese plate, and some ranch dressing. I was so happy that we could have the meetup at a keyboard orientated store as opposed to a fast food joint. When it was time, people started coming in slowly but surely. There was only 1 table to put keyboards on, so as that table filled up, keyboards started going on the front counter, the small couch in their lobby, and eventually a few had to rest on the floor. To be honest more people came than I expected, but I still felt unprepared. I felt bad that keyboards had to be on the floor while others could shine on from the table. Despite this, the event was amazing. EK was a wonderful host and even more people came out to support the meetup. At this meetup we had our first real sponsor; EK for providing a space to meetup. That was one of the first times I really thought ‘whoa, I guess there really are a decent amount of people in the area who support the hobby’. The meetup went great with more conversations about keycaps, keyboards, switches, groupbuys, and the list goes on. More people had a great time, and like with every meetup, I’m so happy people came out to interact with the community that forms the hobby they enjoy.

&amp;nbsp;

This most recent meetup yesterday was amazing. Our sponsor number increased a full 100% from 1 sponsor to 2 sponsors! After I posted my interest check for the third meetup on Reddit, /u/waikane of Originative Co. reached out to me offering to possibly host the meetup at the building where his office is located. This idea was scores higher than the other alternatives. This time I hoped to be ready. I posted asking for tables and a few chairs on the official meetup post and I was moved by how much generosity the community had. Datamancer and /u/Kurplop both brought about 4 tables so shout out to them for helping out so much! Thank you to everyone who provided a table as well. I’m glad to say at this meetup no one had to put their keyboard on the floor to show it off. Once again I showed up early to the meetup (habits are hard to break) to help set up. /u/waikane and his girlfriend did a wonderful job with ordering pizza from Costco, providing water, tables, snacks, and a place to set up. Once 11am hit, we were still the only three at the meetup, but that would quickly change. Before we knew it there was a rush of people setting up their keyboards. It did get a little crowded with around 40-50 people in attendance, but it was a wonderful time. There was a raffle and there was a typing contest. There was a soldering demo with /u/waikane demonstrating how to solder. He let people who never tried soldering  before do so. /u/waikane even fixed a few people’s keyboards. I saw a wondrous amount of facets in the hobby. I saw different artisans, to different styles of keyboards and keycap sets. Most importantly, I saw the faces and met the people behind the usernames. We are all humans who are more than just a username but sometimes it’s hard to remember that. This meetup definitely helped to remind me that behind every hobbyist on /r/mechanicalkeyboards there is a face, a name, and a personality. I’m so happy to have met so many wonderful people at the meetup yesterday. 

&amp;nbsp;

This community is unique in my eyes. When you boil it down, it is a simple hobby that we took to many lengths in many directions. Despite the different lengths in different directions, we are still all bound by our love of this hobby. After talking more with /u/waikane, I started to understand a bit more about his sponsorship, Datamancer’s sponsorship, and EliteKeyboards’ sponsorship. The truth is none of the three made any profit or commercial gains aside from a small amount of advertising (to an audience who probably already knows their name and products). Despite the fact that they undoubtedly lose money in buying pizza, raffling keycaps, and running the electricity for us, they and many others still want to be involved in the community. They want to be involved in the community because they are no different from any other attendees at these meetups. They want to talk keyboards, keycaps, switches, and a plethora of other topics to hobbyists who will understand. They are you and they are me. They enjoy keyboards.

&amp;nbsp;

The future of keyboarding looks bright I think. I’m currently planning and scheduling the Northern California Mechanical Meetup. I have a venue picked and a set of dates I’m working on. I have a choice for venues for the next Southern California meetup, and will be exploring the options in the coming months. You are all wonderful people, so all of you shine on you crazy diamonds.

3sxopy,3,2015-11-15,"A few months out of college, are my goals smart?",MuphynManOG,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3sxopy/a_few_months_out_of_college_are_my_goals_smart/,"Sorry this post got longer than I planned on making it. I wanted to be thorough. Let me know if I should cut down on it to get better feedback from this subreddit.

**Background info:**

* Currently work about 30-35 hours a week as an actuarial intern, take home $700-750 every 2 weeks

* My internship was only for the summer, but I accepted the extension because my boss is a former company president in the field I work in (good size company too), and I'm usually only 1 degree of separation from him, occasionally I report directly to him.
* I may be over-valuing how much his recommendation means to future employment
* Typical starting salary for an actuary is $50k
* Commute 70 minutes one-way twice a week, work from home the other hours
* Live at home with parents, rent-free. Chores like yard work and house work. But they usually cook me dinner. I have it easy here.
* Drive a car owned by parents. Old jeep, bad on gas, but reliable mostly (my dad and i work on it together when something does happen). I pay all my gas, and pay for parts usually.
* I owe $11.5k to my parents for college. No interest accruing, no set date to pay back, but would like to soon.
* I have about $10k in cash, but $3k is tied up in a CD maturing in about 16 months.
* I don't typically fritter away money that much, but I will soon make a spreadsheet to check how accurate I am in this assumption.
* I can see several apartment listings near my current work office around $700-800 a month
* Currently in the process with another boss of mine (not the big shot mentioned earlier) to compile a list of things to put on my resume/LinkedIn, to then submit to the big shot boss for approval (I have a non-disclosure agreement). I will also see if he'll write me a recommendation that I can highlight on resume/LinkedIn, since his word is worth a lot, I think.

**Current wants:**

* I told my parents I'd move out by the end of January. They aren't forcing me, but I want to from a combination of cutting down on commute, entertaining my lady friends, and ""getting out into the world"".
* From advice from my parents, I'm better renting than buying when I move out because property value is fairly stagnant here in CT, and I'm likely to move around a bit, given I haven't yet held an entry level position yet.
* I'd like to own a car by this time too. Not lease because I'm fairly handy due to fixing cars with my dad. Alone I can do brakes, rotors, shocks, alternator, battery, oil filter given the tools (I may get a starter tool set for Christmas)
* End of December I'll know for sure if I have a full-time future at my current job (not performance related, information withheld for privacy reasons)
* I want to get into Vanguard mutual funds, I've read great things about Vanguard here and elsewhere.

**My questions:**

* Do I have any glaring issues with assumptions that I've made?
* Are my goals reasonable?
* Do you have a better suggestion than what I have in mind for my goals?
* What other tips do you have?

3sxtlu,1,2015-11-15,My [18 M] long distance gf [18 F] is really bad at responding.,ViperLegacy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3sxtlu/my_18_m_long_distance_gf_18_f_is_really_bad_at/,"My gf and I have been together for almost 11 months now, and are currently long distance. We haven't been able to see each other in person for the past 4 months, so during this entire time we've just been texting each other. Here's the problem: she's very bad at responding because she's very often preoccupied with something else. We would often have conversations end abruptly because she's busy talking to her friends and would respond half an hour after I've said something. Meanwhile, I almost always respond to her when I feel my phone buzz in my pocket, even if I'm hanging out with the guys. Just today, while we were in the middle of sexting, she vanishes for 40 minutes and then attempts to return to the conversation like nothing happened. Apparently she was out eating food with her friends and just completely forg0t about me.


Sometimes I feel like this goes beyond just texting, and that perhaps I put more effort into this relationship than she does. She once told me she liked good morning texts, so since then I've almost always made sure to send her one when I wake up since I have classes a lot earlier than she does. After class I check my facebook messenger and see that she's on, but she still hasn't said anything back to me yet. Half an hour later she decides to respond with a good morning text of her own. Our conversations also end up looking more like me talking to her, and her just simply replying with short answers.


Every time she does the whole leaving-the-conversation thing, I would get kinda upset at her, and she would notice and say that I don't love her anymore. And every time that happens, she becomes visibly upset, and says self-deprecating things about herself like ""I'm a horrible person"". It ends up as me trying to comfort her and telling her how much I love and care about her, but it gets so tiring after a while of the same thing happening. I really just want her to love me as much as I love her, and for us to keep the only means of our communication going, since I don't really ever get to see her in person.


Just the other day, my friend at my university asked me how often my gf and I skype, to which I responded ""like once a week"", and I tell the friend that my gf's busy with school work and her business school stuff. My friend tells me that she and her long distance bf probably skype once a day, despite him having to juggle school work with internships and frat stuff. When she said that, I just kept trying to justify why my gf doesn't do the same. The first time I asked her to skype me 10 mins a night, she told me that she can't do that because she's busy with too much work, but at this point I just don't thing she wants to put in the effort.


To be honest, I don't really know how to judge this whole situation since it's very hard for me to be objective right now. I know that reddit is sometimes very keen on picking up what the OP is doing wrong when the OP is actually at fault, so I just want people's opinions on how to proceed, and hopefully my gf and I can be happier, because I really do love her.

3sy797,1,2015-11-15,How do I open up to others about depression?,Fuckingthrowaway88,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3sy797/how_do_i_open_up_to_others_about_depression/,"I'm sitting in my university cafeteria as I type this on my phone, as lonely as ever. I've been telling myself for a couple months now that I will tell my parents about my depression, and that I do not want to go to this school anymore. But every time I try, I freeze up and just can't do it. My parents seem so happy together for the first time in years, and I feel like if I throw this at them, it will cause a lot of tension within our family. Also, it would be really disappointing for them to see me give up on school (for now), but I'm so miserable here that I can't imagine myself lasting two more years at this place. I usually end up making up quick lies about friends or weekend plans so they don't have to worry about my social issues. If they ask if I'm happy or even just how I'm doing, I just pause and mumble that I'm ""pretty good"". I know this isn't helping my cause but I get too scared in the moment. 

My dad has no idea that things are this bad because he's terrible at reading people. My mom knows that I have a lot of worries about my future, and I even told her about a breakdown I suffered last year when my depression first reached this level of intensity. But she doesn't seem to relate to any of my concerns, and often gives advice that I don't find very helpful.  She tells me to join clubs, which I've done countless times. She tells me to talk to an academic advisor, which I've done and hasn't helped me realize anything about what I should do for an internship or future career. I'm just too lost to benefit from that. The only thing I haven't done is reach out to a therapist or some kind of mental health professional. But the thought of doing that is just as scary as telling my parents. I also feel like I'd want to leave school before taking that step, because I'm afraid that someone who works for my school will try to convince me to stay here, and I really don't want that. 

I've already posted here a month ago about this same problem. A couple very nice people responded and tried to convince me to tell my parents, and I decided that I'd do it. But now a month has passed and I'm still too scared. I just wish I had someone in real life who could push me to get the help I need. Too bad I have no friends here. Sorry for the rant, I'm just completely lost and writing things out helps me feel a little better. "

#/r/grunge 

**7,315 *losers* lovin' that sweet sweet Seattle sound**

This is an sincere apology letter to the mods of /r/Grunge.

Hey Atticus138 &amp; gang, I just wanted to mention I haven't forgotten about /r/grunge and my promise to feature it. I actually wanted to feature it for a few months now. Things just got delayed to extremes over here in SROTD's garageband. The unnamed intern who wanted to originally feature your subreddit, started writing a feature then fashionably rage quit without telling anyone. Which is quite a [*dumb*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj3bCXViNNM) thing to do. So our hiring policy used to be [*Come as you are*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabnZ9-ex7o). Since then our hiring policies have become much more stricter. They just don't [*breed*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee6xkwVucIE) good interns like they used to. I swear stressing out on writing this feature myself is gonna end up giving me an [*Aneurysm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD0D7IuriWQ).


In all honesty I am *soo* not a good writer for this particular topic let alone any topic. Please forgive me in advance if I don't give your subreddit the respect it deserves. I'm not making excuses. I really was forcefully removed from the genre when I had to move locations to a totally desolate part of the world where grunge did not exist at the time. So the only grunge related music I know on the back of my hand is a few songs from Nirvana.  Sorry for all the lame puns, [*All apologies.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LFVQpDKHk4). Which I know doesn't do grunge justice.

So I am asking you, no pleading to you and your community. Educate me. Seduce me. [*Rape me*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax0C6rlo-54) (sorry last one) with that seattle sound I so yearn for. If you haven't heard of grunge... just wow. Go google it or explore /r/grunge with an open mind.

&gt;#2. How did you get involved in r/grunge ?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** I discovered this place through /r/music's ""master list"" of music subreddits a couple years ago. I was born in 81, so I was in junior high and high school when grunge was  in its prime.

&gt;#4. What your grunge favorite band? Why?

&gt;&gt;**atticus138** At the risk of sounding cliche here, I have to go with Nirvana. They're the ones who opened my eyes to the genre and absolutely love every single thing I've ever heard from them. STP would probably be 2nd. Core, Purple and Tiny Music are fucking masterpieces IMO.

&gt;&gt;**oldwhitelincoln** Alice In Chains. First heard them in 1992 on the ""Singles"" soundtrack which I had stolen from my older sisters.  Been in love ever since.

3sycnz,5,2015-11-15,I don't know what to do with my life(x-post from /r/depression),Sorsappy,SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/3sycnz/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_lifexpost_from/,"Shamelessly copy-pasted, here's my dilemma. 

Hello everyone. 

I  know I'm posting on /r/depression, but I have never been diagnosed with depression. I went to a therapist two years ago but she only prescribed me lithium - I suffer from misophonia (some noises drive me really mad) and she must have thought I'm schizophrenic or so. 


I have a problem in my life : I don't know at all what I want to do with it.

I'm Clem. Nineteen years old since a few weeks, a tall guy, slim, living in France and studying biology. I'll just... Try to explain my situation the best I can. 

As I said, I study biology. After I got my high school diploma - what we call the Bac here in France - I decided to study biology. I didn't really like biology, I wanted to do something like computer science... But it didn't feel really appealed by it. I had a very nice biology teacher so I chose biology. Plus, I read a thing about a biology DUT. DUT are diploma that you do in two years, and you have an internship at the end of the second year. Perfect, I'll do a DUT of biology then. I found the only place in France that does this diploma with a bioinformatics specialization. I was pretty happy, plus it was far enough from my home. 

I wanted to go far away back them. I had a great childhood, great memories, but I couldn't stand living in the same place anymore. I didn't want to spend my life in the same place that the assholes who bullied me through my childhood, and I didn't want to spend my life in the same place than my sister. 


Now is the part where I talk about my sister. We all have relatives. I have a sister. Two parents whom love me, and who also love my sister. She's two years older than me and I have no, absolutely no memory of her not bossing around, not being ""better"" than me, not looking more experienced. I can't stand it anymore. It only brings me pain, just to think about her. I have never done anything that she hasn't done before. She knows everything. She is the one who helps other people, who give them the answers they want. She's perfect. As a parent, I guess I'd be proud to have a child like her, but it's because I would be blinded by the fact she's ruining the life of someone without even knowing it. ""Have you heard of that?"" -- ""Of course ! It's so great blah blah blah"" . ""I've been doing this incredible thing..."" -- ""Oh, I can only remember when I did it for the first time !"" I... I don't want this life anymore. I don't want to live in her shadow.

For my parents, it has always been my sister, then me. They never told it to me. They told me it was my imagination, it was the contrary. But I know it. Everything, every single thing I do, she has done it.

She wants to become a translator. And since she aces everything she does, ever, she... She will become a traducer or translator or whatever you call it in English. I told myself that I'd just... I'd just sink in the only two domains I'm better in than her : music, and video games. I play the piano. It's been twelve years. She doesn't know anything about music, just listens to hipster indy pop and tries to sing but heh. She acts like she knows stuff about her computer but... I've always been the nerd. I know how a computer works, I know how a video games console works, I enjoy playing video games and she doesn't. 


This brings us back to two years ago. I had to chose studies to do after my high school diploma. I mixed biology and the one thing I was better at than her - not music since I'm not good enough to make it my job. I decided to try bioinformatics. 


Living alone is great. I love the city. i love my new friends, or at least I guess so. But oh how  I hate the studies. Last year, in my freshman year, it was all chemistry, physics, the things I hated in high school. Biochem. Quantum physics. I yawned my way through my first year, stressing and not being happy with my life. Told myself that the second year would be more interesting... Well, I do have a lot more computer science and programming than before. At least I can do that kind of stuff but I'm really lame at it. I can just create really simple PERL and C programs and look at databases and tell myself ""ooh it's beautiful"". The biology part is lame. I mean, nucleic acids are a bit interesting but I don't want to spend my whole week studying ribosomes and polylinkers. 

In a word, I don't like what I'm doing. Biology is boring, computer science is annoying. I wish I were better at them but they just don't interest me. Like every nerd I want to develop software but I realize it's not a thing I like to do. I just want to eat a bowl of alphabet noodles and shit a program that will make me a millionaire. 


Why don't I just study more? I try to, but it bores me so much that... I can't... I... You know, I can't go on.


I would love to join a big... A big company. Maybe one making video games? A dream I'd had forever : joining Nintendo, Valv^E , Bethesda, you know them. I would like to be a teammate, to have my name in the generics of a game someday. Not only because it was one of my dreams, but also because my sister knows nothing about computers.


Last year, while I started my new life in my university, I thought I was far enough from home. I thought people were going to care about me... I've been very wrong. While I drove four hundred kilometers to go to Auvergne, my sister flew thousands miles to study one year in Japan. living the big life. I always got the questions ""oooh but does she talk Japanese?"" and I had to answer ""yes"". I got asked ""isn't it too hard for her?"" and I had to answer ""no"". I got said ""and what about you? nah, it shouldn't be too hard, you're in Aurillac. It's not like your sister in Japan..."" 


My heart bleeds each time I think about her. She's just... Better. If she were to die every single soul on this planet would mourn her. 

So I went to Japan. My parents wanted to see her, so they bought plane tickets and gave me one. Two weeks of hell. I spent two weeks in hell this summer. I loved Japan - the people are awesome, the nature is beautiful - but she has done every single thing you can do on this planet. Remember in The Martian when Mark says ""everywhere I go, I'm the first one"" ? Well my life is exactly the contrary. And it makes me cry. it keeps me awake at night. It just... Confuses me. 



This year, i started the ""informatics"" side of bioinformatics. It was a bit interesting but also very rough, very stressful. There's something about programming that makes me stress really bad, I don't know why. But after a few weeks I was a good one ! I managed to do programs that could extract FASTA sequences and read them and count the GC% in them. My sister came back from Japan and she's getting a...

Remember when I said she wanted to be a traducer, and that was cool because I didn't want her to do something I can do?

She's doing a masters degree in web development. Her new goal in life, is to work for a big video game company. Mind you, the only games she's ever played are The Sims and Animal Crossing. I bought her Skyrim and she spent one hour on it. Bought her Minecraft (for birthday presents, eh) and she spent two hours on it. Bought her Mirror's Edge and she's never played it. She just lets thing slip in the conversation like ""oh I plan on working for Nintendo Europe since they're in Germany and i'm near Germany"". Fuck. You. 

Fuck. You. 


Stop. Stealing. My. Dreams.


Now.


She talks about working for Bethsoft or for Square Enix but has never played a game made by them - and I know she will manage to work for them eventually. Why? Because she has a will of steel and can do anything ever - contrary to me.


While we were in Japan, we were eating at a really nice restaurant in Tokyo, and my father casually asked my sister ""so, what are trending video games nowadays?"" To which she answered, ""in japan?"" -- ""No no, everywhere in the world ! What's famous, what is trendy."" 




I've never felt so bad in my entire life. I love my dad. We love to go on long walks together and talk about CGI in movies or computer stuff. I always tell him everything about video games, I always tell him everything about the games I play. I tell him ""if you want to play a game, this one's great..."" I spend way too much time playing video games, I have 252 games in my steam library and I receive daily news about gaming from several magazines and websites.


But no. He asks to ask her what are the trending topics in video games.



I still love my dad but it's so fucking annoying to know that he prefers asking that to someone who can barely press the power button on a DS than to a son who spends his evening reading online about gaming. I know it sounds ridiculous but I never felt as betrayed as this day.




Anyway. Back to now. 


I looked at my schedule for this year. PERL. JAVA. Proteomics. Genomics. I don't want to do that kind of stuff. I don't want to spend my life studying that. In January I'll have ten hours and a half a day studying genes and I know that I'll just yawn from eight AM to eight PM because it only interests me a little. I know that I'll just take notes and study for the test and still have a bad grade because it doesn't interest me at all. 



And I'll have to find an internship. I have to hurry, I have to find a four months internship from April to whenever... I've already looked at countless sites, countless companies, countless laboratories, but none of them interest me. I know that I won't do anything special in any of them, just yawn and do what I'm asked to do. Once again.


And I have to re-do the ontology database of a site for December. A project I don't want to do at all but I can't let my classmates do it alone so i'll just try to do it properly while hating my life a bit more each day.





I lack interest so bad in my field that I know I'll fail. I know that I won't have my year. i'm working hard, I'm studying, but my notes are shit and I have to find an internship. I... I have no choice. Next year, I'll have to find something completely new to do. 


I don't know what. I just don't want it to be in Japan or in a city my sister has already been in. Maybe i'll become a farmer in Greenland, maybe I'll become a KPop singer. I don't know, and it scares me.


I know that tomorrow is made of boredom and tears, but it's just one day - however, i don't know what the day after is made of and it scares me to the deepest point.



Do you have any idea of something I could do with my life?

Do you think I should see a therapist?


Thanks a lot Reddit. Have a very nice day."
3sycwc,3,2015-11-15,Advice?,EtcEtcWhateva,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3sycwc/advice/,"I got out of college and started working this job. I became really isolated, which is never good for me, because I tend to start developing a certain perspective that is negative and hard to shake. At first my friends were interns there and I sort of felt okay. Then they left, I started feeling much less interested, crying on my way to work, at work, and sometimes in meetings, playing video games all the time, wanting to die when I was falling asleep, and daydreaming about killing myself, though I don't feel like I really want to actually do it. That was about two years ago. Since then, I've been trying, but it just doesn't seem to click for me. I feel terrible anxiety talking to anyone or looking people in the eye. I'm really confused what has happened to me. I used to make friends pretty easily and enjoy other people's company. I did feel more weird or anxious than most, but it was okay and I still felt like my life was alright. Now it feels like so long ago I wonder who I even am anymore or what I like doing. There's just this feeling like, ""this is it, this is how it's going to be for the rest of your life"" and it hardly feels worth it. Not much brings me pleasure anymore, it just seems like I'm killing time or trying to convince myself that things will get better. I feel like I'm always sad but pretending to be happy and so sick of it, because I never feel like myself. I want my life to just be okay and not an ever constant struggle. I go out and do things but I feel just horrible anxiety and feelings like ""why can't I just enjoy this""? I have periods of relief, where I start to feel normal, then it just all slips away. I've started feeling really tired, except in the mornings. I often watch TV when I get home but I don't even enjoy it. I feel like I always want to sleep but my mind keeps buzzing when I finally lay down. It seems like too much effort to hit the gym and just going to the grocery store feels like a massive effort. Things got better for a little while last year, but I feel like things are getting worse again recently and I'm getting scared about how bad they will get now. I took this empathy test yesterday and it says I have Asperger's or something, so I took another one specifically for Asperger's and it said the same thing. I feel like this was never something I would have expected if I looked at myself 10 years ago. I do not feel like that accurately describes me, but maybe it does. I feel like I've just gotten so wrapped up in my own head and my own world that it's starting to seem that way. What the hell is wrong with me? How do I stop things from getting worse? Does anyone have advice? I don't really want to go to a therapist because I don't want to be put on medication, but maybe that's the answer. Is there anything that will help me snap out of it and never get back to this place? I keep trying to start different ways and tell myself that there are more things I could try, but feel like I never get to where I'm supposed to be."
3sydat,1,2015-11-15,Rough stretch - long story.,Peterowsky,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/3sydat/rough_stretch_long_story/,"I'm 24 years old, I got into university at age 18, met a little asian girl I fancied, we started dating, her family freaked out, without her home to pacify her parents they freaked out even more (because her father had brought another woman to live with them - who the fuck does that?) they broke up and her mother decided to go back to Taiwan, leaving her and her two younger brothers - both adults- with her father, after divorcing him, with her as a witness on the civil registry on her daughters birthday.

Long story short, she got the short end of the stick and was pretty miserable. I encouraged her to contact the rest of her family (that didn't talk to her because of some more crazy manipulative bullshit her father had pulled on them) and move out. She did. I spent years with her and while things were not rosy we were ok, until she got a job to support her expenses and my depression hit hard and so our time together went to zero. My grades dropped, and because mine was the only graduation in the university with this stupid system where I couldn't take classes with any of the other courses nor carry on with my own if I had any failures on any of my courses (offered only once per year, even though they were based on semesters, and the two previous and two subsequent classes to mine own year could carry on with the same exact failure as I had, but not on my year I couldn't) I spent and entire semester doing jack shit depressed in a corner. During that time her mom came back to leech off her treat her like shit and tell her to dump me for any of a number of rich chinese dudes, all the while the university entered a strike that lasted almost 6 months altogether. 

I changed universities. Night classes now. She had a day job by then so we barely ever met, and when we did it was to run errands for her mother or to take her cousin's dog to therapy after a botched ligament surgery. Did I mention she didn't trust me not to cheat on her? In a small part because of that I avoided most contact with my new colleagues, in a much bigger part because depression was still hitting hard. I eventually decided enough was enough and asked her for help, told her that I could just barely get by a single hour without thinking of killing myself and asked her to help me do something. By then her relationship with her mother was in the dumps, and she was stressed out with her job, so I kind of got it when it became very clear she hadn't heard a word of what I said and just replied ""Ok"" in the most inflection-less tone I can think of.

Fast forward a few months, I'm doing a bit better, had an internship, my grades were improving, I had taken to exercising again and it was crista clear that we wouldn't work. For once she decided hitting me, unprovoked and for no apparent reason was a good idea. I talked to her, explained how I didn't feel like I had a girlfriend anymore, how I was a glorified unpaid errand boy/chauffeur dealing with verbal and then physical abuse, but offered to help her until she could get someone else to transport the dog, herself and her mom around, which I did. 

A month or so later she called me out of the blue asking for help to move out to live with her cousin, while leaving most of the stuff she had bought over the years with her mom. And help I did. 6 months after that she called me again asking for a second chance. Why the hell not right? Welp, same issues, we could only meet on the weekends, we never did have all that much in common and shit didn't work out. We both realized that this time and eventually she called me to a meeting at a park near her cousin's house but not at said house. We agreed to live on our lives as best we could. Didn't hear from her for a while, eventually we met again, fucked again, remembered that while the sex could be pretty good it wasn't enough and decided to leave it at that. Moved on. 

So this last week was my birthday and also the day after the last big paper to turn in, and the week before the finals started, so I decided to invite the 50-ish friends I had made over the last 10 years, while commemorating my birthday with friends for the first time in 10 years. I'm approached online by a friend I had invited and asked if I would be ok with uniting this event with a mutual friend's farewell party because she was moving away for slightly better work opportunities. Of course, most of the guests would be the same anyway. 

I scheduled the thing for 5 pm. I arrived at 5 pm. Nobody showed until 6 pm. In total 7 friends I had invited showed before 10 pm of which 4 had to go to previous arrangements, with the going-away girl showing up at 10. I remembered most of my friends sucked, big time. Not long after that my ex shows up, a bit over a month after we last met and agreed upon our happiness seeking taking precedence over familiarity, with her new boyfriend, a dude 4 inches taller than me, better looking than me, more athletic and coordinated than me, a better talker than me and overall a nice guy. I feel my legs turn to jelly and thank the fact that I sat down a minute before. I feel like crap and take almost half an hour to recover, while taking furtive glances at her and being met with a frown every time.

I corner a mutual friend of ours and ask if she's doing ok. I am informed that she's doing fantastic, and for some reason that actually made me feel better. By that point it's clear no more friends are showing, my ex is looking at me like I'm a freaking villain and I've been drinking for 5 hours, despite the sobering experience. I decide to go home and manage to tell the dude to take very good care of her, of which I am reasonably proud. I later message her saying that If I know anyone that deserves to be happy, she is that person. Two days later we have a conversation where she says she hopes I'll find someone and how that dude is really really nice, to which everyone that's met him (hell, me included) can attest. Thinking back on it she did the best possible thing she could have done for all parties involved, but damn if it didn't make me feel like hammered shit.

The thing is I can't even feel sad for that. I truly am happy for her, but the feeling that I don't have friends that give a fuck or that I can rely on (having previously asked some of those for help regarding my depression) is heavy. I'm not sad, I'm not sorrowful, I'm not angry I'm not really anything, but I have this feeling of dread, of the inevitability of my failure to meet and charm someone enough for them to be my friends, let alone a companion. I have this feeling that who I am (goddamn introvert that can't rest at all when around people) and having someone that cares for me, or more importantly than that, *someone I care for*  are incompatible. I am afraid of being alone because then I have to fight everything on my own, I am afraid of being alone because I don't feel like I have a purpose then, I am afraid of being alone because I can't take the lead, because I work best as that forgettable supporting character that still gets shit done, because that's where I am comfortable, and without friends, without a job, getting fucked over by yet another university because I don't have the talent for bullshitting people like my colleagues and instead try to actually solve the problems I am presented with (I study law). I am terrified of not having someone I can give my care and my love to because honestly I can do without receiving it, I've done so for quite a while now. 

I am scared because I'm not sure I can, and I definitely don't want to, live just for myself.  I am afraid of losing myself again, I am afraid of not having a safe port or a beacon to guide me, I am so goddamn tired of having to fight myself every time I talk to anyone just because I keep trying to analyse every phrase and adjust my behavior based on how they react, I am exhausted of having to battle myself to actually not go down the least effort route because that road leads to me facing my demons alone and I'm not sure for how long I can keep them at bay. 

Holy shit that was big."
3sywd6,0,2015-11-15,Interview this Friday. Can use help!,GeorgeBushi,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3sywd6/interview_this_friday_can_use_help/,"Hi all,

So like the title says I have a interview this Friday(Wooowoooo!). Normally, I wouldn't post to ask for advice and I'd do my own research but I'm afraid I really need this position as I've been striking out for the past year.

The position is an Accounting Rotational in a big technology corporation. I'm currently a finance analyst(PT...) in a big corporation in the IT department so I think that may be an advantage for me. How would you guys go about this and would you emphasize this point?

What other tips would you guys recommend. If you were in my position how would you handle the dreaded salary question(I'd probably say I'm not concerned with salary and I'm sure if you find me a fit we can come to an agreement and that id be compensated fairly)? I've done my research on the salary too.

Other basic info about me. 23, graduated last may, currently employed in said position as PT(technically intern), CPA test this Thursday(kill me pls...), I'm actually content with my resume and experiences for what its worth. Had a 3.84 GPA and I like long walks.

Should I mention about my CPA aspirations and how I took the test the day before? Or would you think some hirers would be hesitant because they are afraid I might leave once i pass my parts?"
3syx1k,4,2015-11-15,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3syx1k/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!"

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sz43q/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3sz80n,0,2015-11-15,I'm an Irish-American interested in doing an IT internship in Ireland. Is there any likelihood I could get hired for something like this?,tommy16p,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/3sz80n/im_an_irishamerican_interested_in_doing_an_it/,I'm currently a computer science teacher in the US and I'm also working on my CS masters. I'll have some free time this summer and I was wondering if anyone has any idea what the hiring/internship culture is like in Ireland. I'd probably do something in web/mobile development (full-stack) or gaming because that's what I have experience with. Would an Irish company hire me for a 4-6 week internship even though I live in the states and assuming I would fly out and live in Ireland for the time I was working?

So the title pretty much sums up my situation. I'm a 21 year old senior majoring in computer science, graduating next December 2016 with uncertainty of where I'll work and when I'll start working. 

I've always wanted to travel to East Asia and visit extended family for a couple months, but due to personal financial issues I haven't gotten since I was 3. Have any of you guys had an experience where you traveled with money being a problem in the back of your mind? 

Things to take into consideration:
- $15k debt from school loans after graduation 
- I grew up very in a conservative house (Asian parents), so I pay off my credit card debts when I can (my score is about 740)
- I am uncertain of where I'll work after I graduate and I fear that I might miss great career opportunities if I don't go straight into a field of technology (I'm an average student with only 1 internship experience and only school related side projects) 

Any help would be appreciated! Thank you :)"

I know nobody really talks about family matters on here but I don't know who else to ask.

Late October, my mom died from an overdose (I forget what drug it was) and left me to care for my little sister. I planned her funeral myself and it's been pretty hectic. All extended family hated her so I haven't really gotten any support or help.

She was physically and emotionally abusive to me all my life, so I'm just really numb. But, I don't know what to do with my little sister. I've protected her from our mom since she was born and basically raised her myself. 

My mom didn't care about her at all and I still don't know her father is. She got knocked up by some random dude who obviously didn't stick around.

I love my sister with all my heart, though. I'm the only parental figure in her life and I've single-handedly cared for her since the day she was born. I've worked multiple jobs in the past to support us financially until I got a internship at a record label.

That leads me to my main point, my future...I've interned at a famous record label for the past year and made lots of connections in the music industry, in addition to taking business classes. I've loved every second of it and it's really cemented what I want to do.

I want to become a tour manager (goes on tour with bands and helps their tours go smoothly) and I have since I was fourteen (before my sister was born). I want this more than anything and I've done everything I could to do it. With the connections I've made, the opportunities have been knocking non-stop. I want to take them all but I don't know what to do about my sister.

I have no source of income at the moment (busy with internship and classes) and my mom left us nothing. I want to jump into my career but it requires being on the road non-stop and I won't be able to take care of my sister. I don't want to get another job but I guess I have to.

I love my sister and I don't know what to do. I have no friends or family that could take her in and I don't want to put her in the foster care system. I'm pretty much her mother and I don't want to give her up...But I don't want to put my life on hold.

Please help, my entire future is in jeopardy.

Tl;dr: Abusive mom died, have to take care of sister, want to start a traveling career, very broke and confused."

Everything was fine, the mouse I was using (apple mouse) was behaving perfectly, the iMac was behaving perfectly, alls well. 

I had to restart the computer friday though, and so I lost access to her account. I got signed in to the Intern account, which I suppose was where I should have been in the first place. gr. but since then, this computer's been...god, fighting me every step of the way and I'd really appreciate a little insight. I've googled the shit out of my problems, but nothing seems to really apply to me. 

1) the apple mouse is being a jerk. I can't left (right? idk, I'm left handed, I swap the buttons wherever I go so I've largely forgotten which one was supposed to be default)  click without pressing the ctrl button. That has to just be some feature somewhere, but I can't find it in settings and no articles I read online talk about it only working with the ctrl button.

2) I can't drag and drop anything onto the desktop, I can't create new folders there or anything. Even screen shots I take (and as I'm QA testing a website, screenshots are really important) don't show up on the desktop.

3t0v1l,3,2015-11-16,I (24M) am in love with my best friend (24F),Quark_eater,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3t0v1l/i_24m_am_in_love_with_my_best_friend_24f/,"You've probably heard this a million times, but I just want to get it out of my chest.

I am a guy, she's a girl, both of us 30 years old and single at the moment. She's always been very straightforward, extrovert, likes to party (not too hard) and she's a Catholic. I can't say we're the exact opposite, but we're definitely different, I am the typical super nerd that enjoys Star Wars, LOTR, I spend my free time reading classical novels or watching Dr. Who, and I'm an evangelical Christian, not the crazy type though. We've been friends since college, we're both engineers. For a long time we were just very good friends, then two years ago she helped me get an internship at a company she was already working, I was very thankful, eventually I was offered a position and I've been here two years now.

She's an awesome woman, I met her at one of our chemistry labs, I was barely able to talk to her, because I was too shy, but she immediately took me into her group, back then I was really overweight. Over the years I have known a few of her relationships, and I didn't even paid attention, she's always said that I'm the cutest thing, first I didn't mind, now it hurts me. Somehow we have become best friends now, I have become her go to guy (I have a few other female friends that talk to me when they need some advice, not that I'm smart or anything, probably is because I'm really quiet sometimes and they know I won't share their secrets).

Well, when I started working here she was in a relationship with a coworker, it ended up bad, I was always there for her, because I really care for her, at first not in a romantic way, but I'm afraid it has become that, and I hate it, because I don't think she'll ever see it that way. She will probably never know a series of sacrifices that I've done to make her happy, she's still very nice and attentive to me, even flirty sometimes, she hugs me whenever she can (because long ago I told her I am not really comfortable with human contact, but I don't mind about her anymore), a few people has asked her if we are dating in front of me (people here knows I'm an introvert) and sometimes she jockingly says yes, and she's the first woman that practically forced me to dance with her at a company party, the first time I ever danced.

I wish I could tell you that I'm gonna make up my mind and tell her straight what she means to me, but I have grown to love her, and I'm almost paralyzed by the fear of losing her as a friend, at different occasions she's stated that she wouldn't date friends so she wouldn't lose the friendship, and that's pretty much what I have to say right now.

**TL; DR: I have fallen in love with my best friend, but she doesn't want a relationship with a close friend and I'm to afraid to reveal my feelings to her because I don't wanna lose her**"

I've heard that somewhere around 28k a year is practical, but from research I've seen that somewhere around 40k a year is what people are getting. I know that you don't really learn a lot from college, pretty much everything is learned on the job. However, having a degree and certifications next to your name will carry some weight if HR will be handling hiring. I'm not sure if anyone here is well versed in starting salaries are not, but I would like to know what to ask for if I'm going to be an official member of the IT staff and not the intern that never left. I live in Central Arkansas if that means anything. Any advice would be much appreciated."

It's a competitive program which five interns are vying for one full time position (the first full time position that person will receive after college.)

There are currently two front runners for the position and there's about a month left until I have to make my final decision. There's Sarah, the demanding bitch of this year's intern class and daughter of our CFO. So naturally she thinks she has this job in the bag and has been acting like that since day one. She comes into the office late, usually hungover, with her designer clothes, driving her brand new Benz that Daddy bought for her, but she has been stepping up her game of late. She knows that she is in a position of power, but how will she use it to assert herself and seal the deal to get the job? Will she blackmail or threaten me to get the job or use her seductive skills to get me to say yes.

Then there is Amy. She very quiet and methodical. Comes into the office on time, puts her head down and just does her job. The problem is, she's too quiet and shy. Someone that unless you walked by her desk you wouldn't even know she was employed here. She's the preferred hire amongst many of the senior staff, I'm going to have to find ways to her to get more noticed at the firm, and in particular open up to me. She's too naive and needs some encouragement to open up and step outside the boundaries to secure this job.

Do you play Sarah or Amy? This is a current situation I'm in right now so can provide you with detailed descriptions of their bodies, looks and styles.

Looking forward to this!

3t1hjs,0,2015-11-16,Trying to find out what I have.,JavidanOfTheWest,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/3t1hjs/trying_to_find_out_what_i_have/,"I seem to have a mix of symptoms of aspergers, high functioning autism, OCD &amp; perhaps even ADD. But I don't know much about any of the subjects, just about the generalizations. And I've never seen or spoken to anyone about it. I also became VERY aware of these social abnormailities at a young age, which gave me a lot of time to become truly adept at hiding or even altering them.

I am 25 years old now and not even my family genuinely even remotely feels like I have a disorder of any kind. They just find me to have become this ""hard"" &amp; ""ruthless"" person as opposed to the kind and gentle kid I used to be for the first half of my lifespan.

First of all, there's two traits that I truly excel at. Those are Empathy &amp; Psychology. What I'm good at is instantly looking through someone and being able to accurately gauge what they're thinking or feeling. I'm also adept at manipulation people into doing or thinking what I want. It's hard to explain but with every new person I meet, it's like they hand me a manual about themselves before we even exchange names. On top of that, my social and nonverbal communicative skills are also very developed. I quickly notice when a conversation becomes awkward and I know and understand how to shift the conversation from there. So I do not know for sure if i have some form of autism.

But I do remember that posture, gestures, eye contact, sharing too much information were big problems for me when I was young. I remember teaching myself at a young age to straighten my back fling my arms around freely when walking in public places. As I used to unconsciously assume somewhat of a fetal position in public. Which is a very common autistic posture, is what I mean to say. 

Another characteristic I seem to have developed is some form of selective mutism where instead of not at all talking to some people, while speaking excessively to others. I just speak excessively at times while at other times pretending to be busy with something, not making eyecontact &amp; just giving generic answers to further the conversation &amp; pretend that I'm listening. It's also hard to explain but I am not fully aware of doing it and even though I don't listen the slightest bit, I pick up key words &amp; when asked for my opinion, I have to wait for a brief moment, remember the last words they said &amp; quickly create a possible scenario of what they might be talking about. And then I reply with an appropriate answer. I've done this for years, I do this on a daily basis and nobody ever seems to notice.

Now, as a kid I didn't fit in. I myself remember seeing 6-10 year old kids with traits similar to mine being treated badly and very quickly knew I had to change if I wanted to be perceived as ""normal"". I did not know there was a name for my symptoms, all I felt was that it was some kind of weakness I had to get rid of. And the way I tried to adapt seems to be described in disturbing detail on the Aspergers wiki:

**""The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.""**

I remember getting the forced eyecontact wrong on occassions because I was forcing it. But it turns out that eyecontact is supposed to be awkward with people you don't really know unless you're looking at someone you like in a romantic way. And eyecontact between two guys that don't know each other is nearly always brief, but long enough to maintain eyecontact until the less dominant guy looks away. Eyecontact with the opposite sex is either long and flirty, or brief where one party ends up staring into nothing (mostly at the ceiling). This is also normal behaviour because and it often turns out they like you either way. And about the other points made in that quote. I did have trouble applying what I wanted to learn in fluid, real-life situations at first. But I had a lot of time to practice and alter my behaviour &amp; patterns. Everything I do seems very fluid and real and most of it does not even feel forced anymore, even though it feels like I am wearing a mask.

The trait most associated with AS seems to be that we/they seem to pursue a narrow and specific path of interest. This does not sound like me at all. Sure, I like videogames &amp; I like programming. But I'm also really passionate about factual knowledge, reading &amp; teaching. And being the center of attention or a public speaker on a subject I'm passionate about while also being an introvert that feels absolutely alive when he's alone at home.

My transformation from a kid with no opinion to an opinionated adult came in three stages. these stages were **basic school (age 4-11), high school (age 12-15), college (16-23) and the university that I am in now.**

At age 4-11 I was the kid that didn't fit in. The daydreamer that couldn't really draw full circles (actual circles), but was able to fully draw and fold tiny 3D paper models on and out of paper. I was misunderstood for a bully while simultaneously being bullied. I had a good friend among my small group of good friends. Hehad similar interests and who also got bullied. I learned a lot about social interaction during this time and I remember feeling prepared to apply this knowledge to net myself a place in the cool kids club on high school, starting from day one.

There were two problems right off the bat. The first one was that I ended up in a class with many of my basic school classmates who knew who I really was. Another reason was that people could easily see through the fake personality I put up. The only time I got along with classmates was when they needed me for a good grade. They acted nice and I mostly fell for it. At this time, my best friend was placed in a lower class and he actually ended up becoming one of the most popular guys at school. We grew apart despite him not treating me much differently. But I studied how he was able to go from a nobody to about the most wanted guy in school.

College came, during this time I completed three different educations, so I had three different chances to break this pattern of being the awkward bullied kid. the first time I failed. The second time I managed to keep up the act for 2 years until I slipped up once and got bullied for rest of the last year. During the second and third educations I changed a lot. You often hear how victims of bullying develop either a minority or a superiority complex. By now you can probably guess which one I've developed. I started instantly recognizing the very first snarky comment that would lay the groundwork for bullying and I would hammer down on that person with witty and insulting comments to prevent them from ever trying to bully me. This was so effective time and time again and ever since that realization I've become more and more like the real me. I had created space for myself to develop into the person I wanted to be.

I might have altered my own personality traits, but ultimately it just became the real me. If my friends describe me now, the word 'asshole' is the word of choice. It's not because they actually do not like me, but because I do and say whatever I want. And girls seem to associate the word ""arrogant"" with me when they recall meeting me for the first time, but that it was different once they got to know me. I'm still disliked by people, I have a serious case of passive aggressive behaviour and will physically dominate people who I feel offended by. **But it sure beats being bullied and feeling left out.** I have many friends now and make sure guys with clear autism aren't bullied but treated equally within my group (a friend with very apparent autism was actually bullied into leaving my class in a matter of a few days after we had a surprise seminar about autism). The bully did not get punished by the school system but I sure made sure to bully him into submission. I also sometimes have to work together with guys that have autism. They often need to be told what to do before going to work, but they'll work really hard and aim to please. If only more people knew how to patiently and positively communicate with them.
Whenever I'm around sincere and pure people like that, I feel at ease and I'll have lots of patience as opposed to when I'm around the people who always complain and feel entitled to something.

The reason I went into detail about who I am and how I adjusted to my surroundings and how I experience things is because I wonder if it's because I've been going without medication all my life. And I wonder if medication for my symptoms would give me more energy. Or if it will actually cause more problems than it fixes.

**My more apparent symptoms are (the ones which I always pay attention to not to display around other people):**

**1.)** Having to arrange everything equally (from eating two blocks of a chocolate bar on the left side of my mouth and two bars on the right side)

**2.)** Daydreaming while driving the car. This is the biggest of my concerns as I practically don't drive unless I truly have to.

**3.)** Feeling the need to touch certain objects again after accidentally touching them once.

**4.)** Having to walk in the middle of sidewalks. If the sidewalk has 5 rows of sidewalk, I'll walk on the third. If it has an equal number, I'll walk with 1 foot on each of the two middle rows. I do this unconsciously too.

**5).** Counting every single step I take unless I'm daydreaming. 

**6.)** Always being mentally drained &amp; getting headaches if I spend too much time at school or at a workplace (even when doing nothing). The headaches disappear instantly the moment I get home as well.

**6.)** The only thing teachers ever pointed out was that I'm a daydreamer. And this is something I have almost no control over. And I daydream for many hours each day. For example; I have a dog that requires daily long brisk walks and while I do that, I daydream for almost the entire walk.

**7.)** I have this need (and I suspect my father has it as well) to repeat words or a full sentence a second time. My father also feels uncomfortable doing new things, like I do.

**Things I've forced myself to overcome:**

**1.)** Fear of picking up the phone and not having the knowledge to help the person I'm talking to (very apparent during internships where they always make you their helpdesk-slave).

**2.)** Finding the right words to explain myself when I'm doublecrossed instead of keeping it in.

**3.)** Feeling uncomfortable doing new things such as taking a bus for the first time while constantly fearing that I'd end up in the wrong place.

I think I'd definitely been an entirely different person if i was (wrongfully) diagnosed with a form of autism. Especially considering with how people will blame everything on that diagnosis specifically.

I'll try to get out the bad grammar &amp; typo's but english isn't my forte."
3t2ei5,6,2015-11-16,Desperately need help dealing with an ESFJ roommate,lamercie,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/3t2ei5/desperately_need_help_dealing_with_an_esfj/,"Hello friends. I'm sort of dying right now and don't know where/who else to turn to, but I think this lovely subreddit of like-minded people could be able to help me out.

So we're college students, and this is our first year living off campus in an apartment. Our lease ends in the summer, though we've planned on renewing and staying in this apartment until next winter. We started off the school year confident and idealistic, but I don't know how I'm going to last another year. We are complete opposites. Most relevantly, I am quite ambitious, and she is very not ambitious (i.e. extremely lazy). She basically lies in bed all day, eating various forms of chicken alfredo or ice cream sandwiches, playing on her computer, giggling to herself. Whatever. She keeps the bowls on her side, and she can live her life. 

The problem is that her laziness impacts *my* life. Right now, in addition to school, I'm doing two internships. Currently, I take the bus, but winter will soon rear its ugly head and make it extremely inconvenient for me to bus. Luckily, she has a car, and I pay for half of the parking but none of the gas, and in exchange we've agreed that she will drive me places. The problem is that she's LAZY AF. She's been extremely unreliable, promising me rides and now following through, falling asleep at 2pm and not answering my texts and calls. I am worried for next semester when it's cold and snowy outside every day.

I think, though, the greater issue is her anger, as this prevents me from talking with her about these types of things. She is quick to anger, very proud, very defensive, very uninterested in calm debate and logic. She's the type of person who will talk louder than you to get her point across. She's also the type of person who believes in respect and pride, and if you even DARE to cross her, so help you god she will DESTROY YOU. So, conflict resolution is basically her getting mad at me, me trying to defend myself, her snapping at me even more harshly, and me giving up because it's just not worth it. And as an ENFP, it's very, very hard for me to shut up when I think I'm right. But I've been doing it. And it's taking its toll.

She told me that she is, like, the nicest person ever! And that she's super chill and never gets mad at any of her friends! But she always ends up mad at me for some reason. Honestly, sometimes it feels like she's trying to put me in a submissive position. What she's looking for is a codependent sycophant, which I most definitely am not.

As an example: today, she was driving me to school, and she was running through every single stop sign and driving somewhat recklessly because she was running a bit late. At one point, I said ""oh my god,"" because I saw an oncoming car into a lane she was turning into, and she started straight up yelling at me. Telling me that I shouldn't tell her how to drive, that if I don't like how she drives then I can find my own ride. Shit like that. I tried defending myself, saying that I can't help feeling afraid if she's driving recklessly, and I also told her it was completely inappropriate to yell at me. We are not that good of friends. But she just yelled some more until we arrived at school and I shut up and stopped talking to her. 

This all makes it sound like she doesn't like me very much. I don't think this is true. We get along most of the time. We mostly gossip about our classmates. I'm also basically her only friend at this school, for various reasons (no one really gets along with her, save a few acquaintances).

Has anyone had to interact closely with someone like this before? If so, how did it turn out? And does anyone have tips on how I can survive this (or if I'm just whining too much)?"

3t2ly2,10,2015-11-16,(PA) Help me (22yo) plan my next 8-10 years (I just finished college and IDK what to do next),pm_me_yourfinancetip,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3t2ly2/pa_help_me_22yo_plan_my_next_810_years_i_just/,"Throwaway because I don't want all this info linked to my main account.

Okay, so I just finished college (at the moment I'm working on my thesis and doing an internship at the same time), and I have no idea of what to do next. I've written down the main goals I'd like to achieve before I turn 30, but I don't know how to approach them or which goals should be prioritized:

* Getting my Master's Degree with an scholarship.

* Getting an apartment.

* Start saving for retirement.

* Getting a nose-job.

* Getting a boob-job.

I suppose I'm asking you guys to help me create a timeline so I can reach as many of those goals as I can in the next 8 years. I guess you could say I want to create my Plan de Ocho Años (Club de Cuervos, anyone? Hehe).

I think it's relevant that I live in a third world country (a western one, though) and that means I'm NOT from the US so a lot of things are done a little different around here. I guess the main differences are:

* Life cost is cheaper here so the numbers in general might be a bit lower than you are used to.


* I went to a public university so my education was REALLY cheap, specially compared to the prices of the US's. Because of this my parents had no problems paying for my education (around $900 for the whole thing, studied engineering). This means I don't have any student debts.


* People here usually live with their parents until they get married (in their late 20s), but I'd like to move out as soon as I can because I have really overprotective parents (picture traditional Catholics trying to raise a liberal atheist) and I'm craving independence. I mean, my parents and I get along most of the time (now that I'm no longer an angsty teenager), but since we're so different I think our relationship would improve quite a lot if I could get some space. Realistically I'm expecting to move out after I finish my master's degree.


* Maybe the most important goal I have is getting my master's degree in Europe. I'd be applying to several scholarships, but I don't know if I should be applying in one, two or three years.


* As I mentioned before, I'm currently in an internship (until December, with the possibility of staying here until March), that gives me a $1000 monthly stipend.


* I have a savings account with almost $9000 (the result of saving present gifts instead of spending them), which works as a emergency fund.


* The price of the apartments I'd like is around $150-180k right now. I think buying it with a mortgage would be a better choice than renting.


I would also like to be prepared in case I decide to get married (weddings usually take place in the late 20s, early 30s and those things are expensive) and in case I need to buy a new car (I'm currently using a 2009 Toyota my dad 'bought' me when I got my driving license, it's on his name but I'm the one who drives it. I've also considered buying him the car in the future so it's 100% mine).

I realize things rarely happen as you plan it, but having any sort of plan or guide to follow would help me reduce my current anxiety quite a lot. If you guys think I left anything out please tell me and I'll include it here gladly.

Thanks!"
3t2mst,2,2015-11-16,"Student loan and debt. Unemployed. Marriage. His records are perfect, I am a sinking ship. Don't want to ruin this for him. What to do?",wishingforbetter_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3t2mst/student_loan_and_debt_unemployed_marriage_his/,"Hey guys, not sure what to do at this point in my life so hoping to get some perspective that my personal demons are not allowing me to see

I have just received student loan notice for the amount of 63K. This all down to switching school once out of province due to family moving me by force. Signing up for diploma and degree program - brand new at a different province as my credits and such wouldn't transfer over. I have still couple of courses left which are online to finish my bachelors (easy enough that should be done in a couple of months). 

The problem is, my province, in my industry went through a vast recession this past summer and I, along with a few peers were left unemployed. Those who were hired (after having heart-to-heart with a few of them) found out the various family, friends and past employment connections they possessed. The ones hired were about 33% of the graduating class. The rest of us were struggling to make ends meet. Not only do I not have anything to pay off my loans with, or any savings (as I am surviving on the measly amount I saved during my last summer internship), my debt is much higher than my classmates (due to having an additional diploma and a halfway bachelors left in a different province) with whom I can't even begin to negotiate this with as they just raise their eyebrows and thank *supernatural being of choice* that it isn't them in my position. I, in my globally insignificant and irrelevant way, is at my worst amidst my peers.

Question 1) How to proceed with payment!? I have applied for repayment assistance but have not heard back yet. Any tip with regards to this? Any loan forgiveness plans that I can take advantage of?

Second problem is my SO. I do live with him although I support all my own bills and expenses. We share food and bill costs with him carrying often the blunt of the payment which I am eternally thankful for. He has a great job and makes quite a bit of money. Not to clear out 63k in a blink of an eye, but enough to have a comfortable life. I, however, won't be able to ask him for money in my wildest dream. I have always been independent in my earning and spending and that is one of the characteristics he strongly appreciated. This is also why he never hesitates paying for my day-to-day need should it arise to help me meet my monthly bills. I never really discussed the loans with him (he is aware I have some) and I would like to pay this on my own accord. He is also the kind of remarkable man who has asked me to marry him after my last semester. We hope to get married next summer for which he has mentioned me will carry a big portion of the expense along with very minuscule contribution my family as I don't have much to contribute at this stage in my life. I am devastatingly in love with him, his incredible heart full of compassion, and I want to be with him forever even if we have to live in a cardboard box together. That's without a question. But I am terrified that my marriage to him will put my bad loan and bad credit history (survival reasons - had to make some choices) on his shoulder. He has a home, but should he ever choose to use his credit for purchases, my bad history will negatively affect him. I can't do this  to him. My marriage date is coming soon. I want to marry him right this moment. But how do I safeguard him from any of my financial troubles affecting him?

Just really upset, confused, heart/spirit broken, and frustrated right now. Looking at my state of unemployment and the $ for degrees makes me want to question my entire existence and every choice I've ever made to put me right here in this situation where I am in fear of marrying the one person who I love more than everything I've ever loved and also question whether I can do anything at this point to help my already sinking boat.

Would love to hear any thoughts, advice, tips/guidelines, kind words, life stories to inspire. Already broken-hearted here, please no meanness."

3t2vgf,10,2015-11-16,"Contracting and Consulting: Thinking Outside the Box With Your Marketing Career | (Also, marketing jobs)",marketprosocial,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/3t2vgf/contracting_and_consulting_thinking_outside_the/,"Hey folks, hopefully this is shameful enough: Even more than most professions, marketing is a prime discipline for ""alternative"" job opportunities and career paths beyond the traditional full-time, 9-5, climb-the-ladder system. 


From freelancing to consulting, contracting and interim management, there are a lot of non-traditional options (though they sometimes, understandably, carry a negative connotation). A marketer with a lot of talent and a little luck can often find better opportunities that they would otherwise.

We obviously have reasons think these alternatives are perfectly viable--but we also understand they're not for everyone. This alternative career path requires you to be much more self reliant, and carries some amount of uncertainty that some people just aren't comfortable with. Here's some things to consider about non-permanent contract work that might interest you:

________________________________________
What’s your vision for your marketing career path? If you see yourself simply climbing the ladder, working full time job after full time job as you work your way up to more senior and management positions related to your expertise, there’s nothing wrong with that. But some professionals believe this to be the only way to progress their career, which not only limits their options but could be holding them back from fulfilling their potential as quickly as possible. 

In the marketing profession in particular, part-time and contracted work offers an exceptional alternative to the traditional career model that could help you achieve your goals and find more satisfaction in your work.

To some people, part-time and contract work carry a negative connotation associated with unpaid internships or menial freelance work. In reality, there’s plenty of advanced, highly rewarding and fulfilling marketing work to be found on a regular a basis, if you’re qualified to do it and know where to look. If sitting at the same desk at the same company every day indefinitely waiting for a promotion doesn’t match the vision you have for your future, here are some reasons you might want to consider moving your career into marketing staffing.

**Greater Potential for Personal and Professional Flexibility**

Most full time jobs, even in the ever-changing field of marketing, eventually fall into a fairly rigid and repetitive work pattern. However, contract marketing staffing work can have considerably more flexibility, allowing more avenues to pursue your long-term career goals.

This path provides more opportunities to try new things, move from industry to industry, and add new skills and competencies along the way. With a carefully thought out plan, an ambitious marketer can strategically choose staffing jobs that will methodically move them close and closer to their ultimate destination.

**New Experiences and Challenges**

If you’re the kind of person who prefers to constantly try new things, push your limits and gain a variety of experiences, contract work can be an excellent way to keep things fresh. Instead of working for the same company on the same kind of projects for years, you’ll have the opportunity to get an insider’s view of different organizations as you move from contract to contract. 

You’ll encounter new people, overcome novel challenges, and be presented with a unique need at every position that you take.

If you’re not sure which direction you want to take your career, this is a prime opportunity to experiment or take a chance on something a little out of the box. You can learn what kind of work and organizations you prefer. And if you find yourself in a role that’s just not right for you, you can push through knowing that there’s an end in sight when the contract ends.

**Better Growth Potential for Career and Compensation**

In a traditional marketing agency or department, you’re typically at the mercy of the organizations’ structure and management policies when it comes to opportunities for raises and promotions. If there’s simply no budget for the kind of compensation you think you’re worth, and no room in the org chart for advancement, then you’re probably out of luck regardless of how well qualified you are.

On the other hand, contract staffing professionals are only limited by their ability to drive demonstrable results, market their personal brand, and find the right opportunities. Instead of waiting in line for a higher salary or fancy new title, you’re empowered to seek work at the level you deem worth your time and can be selective about which jobs you take on.

A good marketer can typically expect to make considerably more money on a per-hour basis than they would working a comparable job full time. Of course, since your client isn’t your employer, they’re not obligated to provide you with benefits like healthcare  insurance or a retirement plan, which must be taken into an account. You can compensate by working through an established marketing staffing firm. Agencies of a certain size are required by law to gain access to some of those benefits.

**The Risks and Challenges**

As attractive as contract staffing and marketing consulting work might be, it’s not the best career path for everyone.

If you work as an independent contractor, you’ll become entirely responsible for your own insurance, often including things like workman’s comp, liability insurance, health insurance and more. You’ll have to manage any investment and retirement plans you want to participate in, potentially pay additional taxes, and many other things that are frequently taken care of by a full time employer. Partnering with a marketing staffing firm will provide some of the support that’s missing, but if you’re the kind of person who likes or relies on employee benefits, then moving on to the much more independent life of a staffing professional might not be for you.

The other major challenge with moving to contract work for your marketing career is the uncertainty of finding consistent work. Talented marketers are in high demand right now, and those with the right skills and a proven track record of success rarely struggle to find things to keep themselves busy. But you’ll still have to work considerably harder to build a strong network and learn to be constantly on the lookout for the next job to take on when your current contract expires. Again, partnering with a reputable marketing staffing agency is one way to mitigate this challenge and get better access to more reliable work.

3t346o,1,2015-11-16,"Full-Time Masters Student this winter, just rejected a full-time offer at a small firm. Did I make the right decision?",PiddyPiddy,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3t346o/fulltime_masters_student_this_winter_just/,"If you read my last posts I've been stressed about my offers. Long story short, I'm going to be pursuing my Masters this winter and a small cpa firm extended an offer, while my current temporary job extended me until February. I was debating which job to keep, whether cpa experience or grades were looked at more, and ultimately choose that working full-time in a small firm while going for my Masters full-time will be too much on my plate and my grades will suffer. 

I ended up calling the firm to let them know and the guy said I was being ""unfair"" for not wanting to work 40 hours and he thought I was taking evening courses. I explained that I am taking evening courses but working 40 hours a week (and some overtime) and three evening classes, one online class is still too much and as I'm paying 10k for my Masters, I really don't want my grades to sink and my money gone to waste and everyone I've talked to (reddit, friends, family, campus advising) told me I am not going to be able to be a full-time student while working full-time at a firm during busy season. 

He wasn't understanding and kept saying I was being unfair to him, which I don't understand. Would he prefer I take his job offer and my work performance suck because my main focus is school? Or did he want me to drop my classes to meet his requirements. Or to try to do both, and if I don't do well in the Masters, bye bye 10k? After the conversation, I believe I made the right decision and everyone on Reddit is right when they say you have to look out for yourself because nobody else is going to. To me, my future meant more and to him, me not pursuing my masters and working 40 hours for a firm, mattered more to him. 

I've been so stressed, as you can see from my past posts, but today I am relieved and I feel a sense of freedom. I will be leaving this recruiting season with no offers (I still have my temporary accounting/business intern until end of Feb) but I am leaving happier and surprisingly I don't feel bad, I actually feel like I got a solid plan as I've been so lost recently.

3t361q,0,2015-11-16,I feel extremely doomed,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/3t361q/i_feel_extremely_doomed/,"Hey guys,

I am currently a senior at UCLA studying Financial Actuarial Math. I have a 3.0 GPA, no extracurriculars, no exams passed (taking FM in december and P in January), no internship experience, and a lot of worry. 

I've been lurking on the internet, especially recently, reading up on how poorly I compare to other ""star"" students out there and I just realize how $&amp;@#ed I am right now.

My biggest regret in college is not having taken more interesting classes because I feel like I developed, as a thinker, so much more in these classes since I was surrounded by brilliant classmates. It was in these classes where I witnessed the effective study habits of classmates and worked on my focus. Don't get me wrong, I have had the opportunity to take courses on actuarial models, real analysis, probability theory, stochastic processes, machine-learning, and basic computing... but so has everyone else - and then some. 

However I can say that my energy is unmatched, my interpersonal skills are amazing, I find it easy to develop a *genuine* interest in many different things, and I *now* place an immense amount of commitment to important projects or tasks. I also love collaborating with classmates to solve problems, such as from the homework or self-conjured ones.

I am preparing myself to have no offer immediately after graduation - although this will not prevent me from trying. I understand no one will empathize. I understand this is a product of my decisions, which were poorly made, and that a lot of people are in the same boat as I am.

I am here to ask for any relevant advice. My overarching goal in life is to raise intelligent, curious children who are passionate about something useful. I really believe the actuarial field is one where I could simultaneously develop as a person and provide for my family. Any amount of help would be amazing and I would greatly appreciate it. 

Cheers!"

My ex is still a good friend, and is about to have to talk to me about him hurting me in his 8th step.

I've been single since early June (so 5-ish months) after a 2 year relationship. I have also been conflicted about where to look for help in dealing with this. Looking back, the relationship was relatively unhealthy at times because my ex had a few secrets. Some back story, we dated for three weeks before becoming official in our university town, and he was my first relationship. I was 20 and he was 22 at the time. He had been in one other serious high school/college relationship before me. He had also had multiple sexual partners before me, where as a month into our relationship, he was my first. We were both really happy with each other, but he was having a few problems dealing with his past: drugs, previous relationships, school etc. He had just recently moved back to our city to start school again the next semester after taking some time off to deal with these problems. He got a cat and let me name it a week into our relationship, and I met his parents that same week. 

Though things moved really fast, I was excited and happy and he made me feel loved. He was very sweet, would set up treasure-hunts and got me flowers a few times throughout our relationship. His gifts were always well-thought out and perfect. About 5 months into our relationship Valentines day had come around. This was one of the first times I felt insecure about our relationship. His ex's birthday was on Valentines day and he asked me if it would be alright to text her. I said it was okay, but asked if he was still wanting to be in contact with her or anything of that sort. He said 'no' but felt that because he had texted her the past five years, he felt he should. I was sort of upset, but trusted him. a few days later he surprised me with a teddy bear as a late Valentines day gift. 

Now, don't start thinking this is a cheaters story. It's not. I just want to get everything out, even if no one reads this. A month or so later we are at his apartment, and he asks if I want to shower with him. I didn't quite get the hint until 10 minutes later I realize, change my mind and walk into his bathroom to join him. I see he has his phone with him in the shower, and my first instinct is to think he is cheating. After asking what is going on, he shuts down until he finally tells me he likes to look up naked girls to masturbate. He told me he didn't like what he was doing, and wished he was strong enough to never do it again. I was so relieved that I didn't even realize that this was going to hurt me until a little while later. In the past we had discussed porn before, and he had told me that he didn't like porn and that it freaked him out a little bit. I felt hurt that he had lied to me before, because what was coming in the next year of our relationship would have been much easier if I knew I could trust him. 

He found some friends a month or so later and I thought they were decent enough and didn't think much of it when one night he told me he was going over to their house to play drunk Mario cart. The thing is, he didn't leave my apartment complex for a while, choosing to hang with them at our pool/basketball courts to wait on a drug dealer to bring acid. This is were I should mention that he has had a strong problem with acid before and jumped through several windows on a bad trip and almost died. My roommate got a phone call later that night from my bf's friends as they could only find her number on facebook. They let me know that my bf had another bad trip, broke into the frat neighbors house and got the shit beat out of him. By the time I got over there my bf was in his friend's bedroom screaming for his ex girlfriend, but clming down when he saw me. I was able to get him home, heartbroken. I talked with him the next day, and he said he thinks he as yelling for her because she knew of his problem and didn't want to disappoint me. At this point I was really upset because I told him that I didn't want drugs in my life and if he didn't get his act together I couldn't be with him. None of this was news to him because he knew it from day 1.

 Going on from there, we had a relatively calm summer, and talked of moving in together. We found a house, and my roommate moved in with us for a month until she found a job and moved. But after the first two week of moving in, we were robbed. They took so much as a lot was still in boxes, and took my brand new puppy. I was heartbroken and went through a depressive state. My bf, having depression problems in the past, said we should go to counseling, but I wasn't really interested. Then as we were nearing our 1 year anniversary, he told me that if things didn't change then we should break up. I said I would get counseling and he did the same and things were better for a few weeks. Then our 1 year came around and I went over the top. Spent what little money I had saved up on presents for him, trying to let him understand that I was paying attention to his interests. But when he made it clear he hadn't prepared anything, I told him I was hurt and he said he would make it up to me. 

A few weeks later he took me camping to the caves, something we both love to do together, but was acting distant the whole weekend. when we were making bracelets in the tent one early morning, we got in a fight over something so small. He had a knot in a string so I asked him to see it and took some scissors to it to get the knot out. He freaked out and started yelling at me saying I was gonna cut it and ruin it, and I asked him to trust me. He said it was my fault that he freaked out because I said I wasn't going to cut it, but grabbed the scissors anyway. See? small fight. He then told me it was over and that we should go home. That this trip was a test to see if he wanted to stay with me, and we should pack up for the 4 hour drive back. I was heartbroken and asked why he lied to me saying this was a re-celebration of our 1 year, and he just told me that he's been having doubts all summer. I asked him why he convinced me to move in with him then, and he said he wanted it to work out. He then made things extremely worse by informing me that the night he asked me to be his girlfriend he was tripping on acid. 

The next few months involved him saying we should continue dating, while still living together, him getting other girls phone numbers, apologizing, but eventually us getting back together on New Years Eve, after a heartfelt letter, a romantic lunch at my favorite place and a diamond necklace. Things were great for a month until his depression worsened, he was smoking and drinking a lot with his friends, and I was put on the back burner. He agreed to go to couples counseling, offered for free at our school, and when things got better agreed to single counseling for himself and therapy and a new prescription to help with his depression/anxiety. 

Things were finally looking up. He was going to study abroad in France that summer (this past one, 2015) and I had an internship in London. A few days before we left he started talking about us getting married and when we should. We planned a new place to live for his last year in school, we got a new puppy that my parents would take care of until he got back a month before me. He flew with me to London and we had a great week before I started working and he had to leave for France. A few days later was my birthday and he forgot. And I was hurt initially, but when I pointed it out to him he apologized, I forgave him and things were fine again. We were both busy, and could not talk as much as we liked. A week later I get a text and he says he's having doubts again. It came out of the blue. I was so shocked. He broke it off completely a few hours later. I know right now a lot of redditors are probably a little pissed I waited so long, but you guys should know that the long periods where I don't mention anything, we were very happy together. He was/is my best friend. 

That is my dilemma right now. A couple weeks before getting back from London, where I dated another guy for a few weeks to take my mind off missing my ex, I reached out to my ex. He wished he hadn't rushed into breaking things off, and that he still loved me, but felt that because he was having doubts he didn't want to make me remain faithful, although to this day he is the only one I've had sex with, if he wasn't sure we would last. I respect that, but as you can see this doesn't help with my conflicted emotions. When I got back, things were passionate and loving. We still weren't together but we acted as if we were. We've kind of done that since August. We go through rough patches, then we are best friends, and then we sort of mess up and have sex or fool around and after doing that a few times we realize we shouldn't, he shuts down, and I'm pushed away.

His depression has been significantly worse the past few months, and he is trying no meds and therapy. He has gotten into some AA and the like meetings, been making new sober friends. And I'm genuinely happy for him. I just can't help but wish I hadn't been dragged through a lot of it, and lied to so much. I never thought a person that once said they loved me and was always making the 'first' steps in our relationship to put me through so much hurt. I still love him and am in love with him, and I know he doesn't feel the same about me anymore though he does remind me he still cares. Honestly, after typing all this I feel better, I think I just needed it all down in one place. Right now I'm living with some family members in my University's city, but all my friends have left after graduation as it's not really a town anyone stays in unless they are in oil/agriculture. I have a class to take in the spring before I can get out of here for good, and my ex is my only friend. Once I get back into school I can take advantage of the free counseling, but until then, I keep a smile on my face for my family, because I'm tired of all the ""are you okay?""s and the like. He informed me he is going through his 12 steps, and is on number 4 currently, so once he hits number 8 I'm going to have to face all this again. I don't know how to go about it. I'm deeply confused, completely heartbroken, but I'm not mad. And I don't know if I'm not mad just because he's going through his own problems, because I know I have the right to be mad, and many people have asked me why I'm not, but I think I really don't have the energy anymore. The whole last two years were so many many extreme highs and lows that I don't know what to makes sense of and want to let everything go but can't jut because the biggest factor is knowing I was lied about very important things in a relationship, and it's broken me.

Thanks for reading this if you made it this far. Even if no one does, or you don't feel like responding or saying anything, just know that I'll keep this post for future reference, and a starting point with a possible future counselor."

I have given him lots of encouragement, support and love telling him he can do it but he just doesn't study. And on top of that he has no idea what else he could do. 

He works a meagre service job with little prospects. People around us are getting internships or jobs due to good grades and of course he isn't. 

He doesn't seem to have many friends, only family friends, and doesn't really hang out with his uni friends because he feels a bit inferior. He says he doesn't like small talk or parties. He likes to spend most of his time with me, but I'm busy with uni, work, acting and the arts (piano and singing and dancing). I spend most of my down time with him and I'm sort of losing my friends a bit due to this and I'm beginning to resent him. He should be studying instead of being on Facebook all the time or playing clash of clans or watching basketball. 

He's too thin. He admires people who have good bodies but says going to the gym is stupid so he plays team sports instead. But he doesn't even do weight exercises at home and yet feels insecure around other buff guys and questions me about it. I say no you look fine but I do like your shoulders and abs (the only buff part of him) and it would be nice if you wanted to work out a bit more. 

He's stingy with money, normally goes half half but he earlier on said I don't have to pay what he does. But I do. And once he made me eat an ice cream and got angry he had to pay (when I didn't even want to eat it). He made me pay for a free movie ticket he got. 

My parents think he has no prospects because he's failing, isn't looking for a job, and has no ambition. They think he's not a good match for me because he's selfish (wants all my time), has no friends (always with me), no prospects (failing), stingy (wants to go on free camping trips with friends when they are really inconvenient times or places). At first I couldn't see it but now I'm starting to agree. 

He's White also, and I'm Asian. There are certain cultural things that are different. 

We have very different interests, which sometimes makes for interesting conversations because we learn about new things, but often there are long pauses between us. I have a lot more to talk about with my friends and he's a bit awkward there. I try and include him but he's shy and also doesn't really want to talk. 

Sometimes he talks down about arts students but I'm an arts student. 

On the other hand, he's affectionate, clingy in a good way, clever supposedly (good intuition), likes to do the planning and organising when I can't stand that sort of thing, and likes to cook. He's supportive of me, the opposite of my critical and derogatory parents. Tries to try new things with me. Maybe these are things that can balance his other traits? If I give him time will maybe things get better? 

**tl;dr** Although romantically he's an attentive, giving, supportive and affectionate partner, realistically I feel like due to his failing grades, stinginess, certain narrow mindedness like things about people doing things differently to him, I will eventually break up with him. He says he wants to be with me forever and I don't know if I'll find someone as caring as he is. I also like our sex and cuddles.

3t3rs2,6,2015-11-16,Discovered this sub today and it's the reality check I needed,intellectual_error,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3t3rs2/discovered_this_sub_today_and_its_the_reality/,"So I'm a 20 (almost 21) year old student in my final year of a fairly intense degree. Been a smoker since 14/15.

I wouldn't have been a daily smoker but every weekend, every summer holiday, every chance I could get I'd smoke with my friends and my brothers. Now and then, I'd smoke non stop for a few weeks at a time. I always thought I had a decent relationship with weed but In the past year my life has changed dramatically and I've come to realise I was very wrong.

My parents split and we had to leave our home to live in the smallest, darkest and most depressing house ever. The separation has been an emotional nightmare (one parent is really mentally ill). I came out of a relationship and have been battling with depression since.

Now I couldn't exactly afford to smoke so much but you know how it is. You always find some way to maintain the habit and in these times, smoking was my only coping mechanism. Things got a little more ridiculous when I started an internship as that let me smoke as often as I wanted. Basically every evening I'd get a little high and then the weekend would be a total blur. That went on for 8 months before I returned back to finish my final year of college this September.

Well... Things haven't been going so well. I've squandered most the measly amount I managed to save. I've been smoking mid week a lot more often. In the past year the depression/smoking cycle has caused me to gain about a stone. (Used to be quite fit and lean). My grades this year have gotten off to a really bad start. The pressure of assignments and classwork paired with my lack of willpower and inability to focus has left me experiencing anxiety like never before. I feel uncomfortable in lots of social situations and the weight gain + depression + smoker's anxiety has left me with no confidence whatsoever.

I smoked my last joint last Tuesday night.

I decided that I have stop this before it gets worse. I'm lucky that I'm young and I haven't screwed my life up yet. I've watched the majority of my friends fall completely into it and it seems like they'll never escape. I've told myself I'll quit countless times before but I never did. This time I have to. It's only been five or six days and every day I get home from class I'm dying for it.

For me, the worst and most humiliating part was when I told a close non-smoking friend I'm quitting and they just laughed it off. I realised I've said it so many times before that nobody takes me seriously. I've always been full of shit every time before but this time I really mean it.

It's only by chance I found this sub today. I read some of the top threads and I'm so glad to find all these stories that I can relate to. I'm sorry for the long ass post. The sidebar encouraged people not to lurk and I just felt like venting. 

tl;dr Stopped smoking last week. Discovered this sub today and I'm happy to be here!"
3t3vzh,0,2015-11-16,Current CS Student Seeking First Internship in the Field,atlantiku,sandiego,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/3t3vzh/current_cs_student_seeking_first_internship_in/,"Hello /r/sandiego,

My name is Jason.  I am a college graduate currently enrolled in Oregon State University's online post-baccalaureate Computer Science program.  Previously I attended the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Political Science: International Relations and minoring in Mathematics.  While at UCSD, I considered work in an NGO and later as a high school math teacher, but after a year of classroom experience in local public schools, I decided that I would prefer to pursue a different path.

Once I graduated, I went into business as a private mathematics tutor, serving high school and college students locally.  This gave me a greater understanding of the business world and helped me harness some professional skills, such as leadership, patience, and formal speaking ability.

Now I have decided to pursue my dream career: one with computers and technology.  Although I am just now beginning my official studies of computer science, I have a fair amount of personal experience with programming and some with server administration.  While in high school, I learned Java through the school's computer science course.  I continued my study of Java through a course at UCSD and later did the majority of coursework for the Data Structures class taught by Jonathan Shewchuk at UC Berkeley, thanks to the course materials being [publicly accessible](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/61b/).  This course really helped me knuckle down with OOP and gave me a greater confidence to continue learning on my own, with or without school.  Through the OSU program, I have increased my knowledge of C++, and in my free time I have been studying C++11 and C++14.

Since my days in high school, I have tinkered with various Linux distributions.  I am most fluent in Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linuxes, and my two favorite distributions are CentOS and Linux Mint.  I have set up web and ftp servers on Arch Linux and CentOS.

While working as a private tutor, I also learned Apple's new language, Swift, and to test my knowledge, I programmed a Portuguese verb conjugator in both Java and Swift.  I still have not learned how to effectively create GUIs, so the conjugator is console-based, but I am working on releasing Android and iOS apps in the near future.  This project has been mammoth in distinguishing between the various dialects and orthographic agreements that dictate the proper way to conjugate verbs as well as actually implementing an algorithm to conjugate all possible valid verb infinitive forms.

Currently I am in my second term at Oregon State, and will be graduating in Spring 2017.  I am seeking an internship or position in the field here in San Diego, but I would consider moving if I can afford it.  Although I have not yet worked in the field, I am excited to dive in and get a bit of practical experience.  I may not be familiar with the exact language or framework you use in your company, but I am a fast learner and will put in the extra time to get up to speed.

You may find my GitHub portfolio [here](https://github.com/jrgoldfinemiddleton/).  Please contact me for a copy of my resumé.  If you are interested in getting in touch with me, I would appreciate it if you contact me initially through the reddit messaging system so I can be aware of how you know of me.

Thank you so much for your consideration.

Unfortunately, as I learnt the hard way, that isn't sufficient. I failed two of my courses, got average grades in others, and now I've been asked to withdraw from my graduate program. On the other hand, I have a great one year internship offer from a top software company which doesn't care about my grades because in my interview they were very impressed by my knowledge of the field. Being an international student, I cannot intern unless I'm registered in some university, and my university doesn't want me to continue. I'm in a fix. Any advice on how to get out of this mess and still keep my internship will be appreciated."
3t5ga4,5,2015-11-17,I [26M] have to move to a different city from my [23F] girlfriend. How do I keep us together?,Kuuzon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3t5ga4/i_26m_have_to_move_to_a_different_city_from_my/,"So about us first: Me and ""Carina"" have been together for about 9-10 months.  We're crazy about each other and think we're a real match for the other.  Both of us have long histories with bad relationships, and this one feels like a real shift in type for both of us.  For the better.  That is, up until today.

Today I was offered a job which I literally cannot turn down.  It is the dream offer and I would be foolish to turn it down (many on this subreddit have emphasized career over romance, which is fair enough).  It is in a city that is in the next state and plane trips between them take about an hour.  Fair to say, I can visit maybe 3-4 times a month for weekends, at best.

I thought a long-distance relationship might work, and she is generally very open to ideas and has been super encouraging about my job hunt the last couple months.  So I largely accepted the offer (wouldn't have turned it down) and told my girlfriend today.

She was happy for me but clearly did not like the move.  After some time to think, we had a big Facetime convo (tears were shed by both), where she revealed she has had two long distance relationships which ended badly (one cheated).  She is really scared about being hurt and about us potentially falling apart like them.  I honestly believe we've grown up from those types of relationships and I deeply care about her and want this to work.  More than that, I honestly cannot bear the thought of hurting her or cheating on her (skeptics can choose to disagree with me here).

The long distance thing is likely to last 12 months (I leave early next year).  After using all my Oscar-award speech skills tonight, she agreed that we should at least continue our relationship until I have to move (albeit admitting she will have this thing in the back of her head till then).  But regardless, she has indicated that when I move, she doesn't believe she could do another long-distance relationship due to her past.

I know our relationship hasn't been long compared to some others, but I really do care deeply for her and love her.  She ""feels like the one"" (as naive as that sounds) and just matches me perfectly.  Is there anyway that I can convince her to give long distance a shot, or is this thing doomed from now on?  I've gone from thinking of super romantic sweeping gestures to even trying to prove my commitment with some kind of promise ring deal like in the Bachelor (don't judge me :P).

However, I understand at the crux of it that she has trust issues and fears being hurt by someone cheating on her/betraying it again (she said she would ""never do this again"").  How can I show her I want to be the man she can trust and let her give us a shot at least?

**PS.** Been stalking this sub for many, many months.  Weird to become part of it now.  Never thought I would be in this position.  But my world has been flipped upside down today (to quote the Prince of Bel Air).

**tl;dr**: I'm moving to a different city for work.  Girlfriend will likely break up due to long-distance relationship based on past bad long-distance relationships.  How can I convince her to give us a shot?

**EDIT**:  Should mention, ""Carina"" is in a similar position to me regarding work.  She has a paid internship with a hospital in this city for the same duration as my job in the other city.  Like my job, she would be foolish to turn it down and I would never make her do it.  She worked super hard to get it.  So yep, we're stuck in our relative cities by early next year :("
3t5h2v,14,2015-11-17,Stopped smoking daily since last sunday. I dont feel well.,bivukaz,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3t5h2v/stopped_smoking_daily_since_last_sunday_i_dont/,"Hi everyone,

I'm 23 years old and I've been smoking daily since i'm 17. I couldnt go to sleep without at least 1 or 2 spliffs. I smoked everytime I had the occasion and spent all my money on weed.

Last sunday (8 nov.) I decided that I should stop. I made an appointement with a therapist for 27 nov.

I still want to smoke casually, and I did this week end at a party. I dont plan on quitting weed totally. Just the daily use.

So far I dont feel very well, I have never been this anxious before. I just feel sad and tired all the time. Just writing those words bring tears in my eye. I dont know what I expect by doing this.

I used to smoke weed to forget about my problems (My internship will end next month and I have nothing to do after it, so I'll have to go back to live with my parents because of it / I'm dating a girl I really really like but I dont think she feel the same way / ...) but now my problems hit me in the face harder than never before. I feel like a worthless piece of shit. 

I cant focus on shit. When I'm at work, I feel tired and on the verge of tears every single minutes. When I'm home alone, none of my past hobbies (making music, drawing, geeking, ...) seems to occupy my mind like they used to.

The only times I feel ""normal"" is when I hang out with my girlfriend and my close friends, but as soon as I am alone I become sad and worthless. I dont want this to be burden to my girlfriend and my friends who also go through rough stuff in their lives. I hate being weak in front of them.

I just cant wait to go see my therapist (it'll be my first time ever) because I feel like I have so much to say, even though I know I will spend most of the time crying. 

Sleeping is horrible, going to bed is harder than it has ever been. I cant help but cry myself to sleep every night for no specific reason. When I wake up the first thing I feel is sadness, and it carry on through the day. 

Anyway I just needed to write this somewhere, for someone to read. I just needed to share. "
3t5lke,1,2015-11-17,My untragic life story,throwaway01241997,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/3t5lke/my_untragic_life_story/,"I'm going to be using a throwaway because I have don't want someone I know seeing this.

So there's a lot of reasons as to why I'm creating this. Maybe to help get over it, or maybe just to see if this has happened to anyone.

Let's begin. My parents and I are no longer speaking, and will remain this way for good. My father is a narcissistic man who has put me down in everything I've ever done in my life. I have two brothers, my older one who is a CS major at Stanford, which is super awesome and I'm totally happy he's doing something he loves. But, he's my father trophy child. I also have a younger brother who is honestly being babied too much ( which is to be expected ), but he's turning 10 this year and has serious behavior issues. He's my mother's favorite. 

Early on, I grew an interest in skateboarding, I was around 7 when I first learned to ride a skateboard. I loved it, I managed to get a very small sponsorship on a youth-team for my local Skate shop at 13. However, my father was never approving. For example, during the early days of learning to do tricks, I was told ""You suck and that I should start doing a real sport"", from my father. The man who was supposed to encourage me. It happened so much, that I quit skating all together my freshmen year of high school. I joined the football team to please my father. My first year of football, I was a backup, but saw a fair amount of play time. My parents never came to my games, and forced me to walk 11 miles to and from football practice in 110' degree heat, and always had an excuse as to why they couldn't go to my games. Their excuses were honestly half-assed. After the season ended, my old brother was accepted to Stanford. Which was a great time for my family, except me. Don't get me wrong, I was happy for him, but my parents always brought up at family events that I could never get accepted into Stanford. Which is true, I'm terrible in math, and have struggled to keep a C average in any math class. But, they always brought up the point I was never good enough, that I was never as good as my brother. It ruined my relationship with my older brother. It still affects our relationship, but as I grew older and matured, I've realized that I was selfish enough to let it impact my relationship with my brother. Luckily, my brother knew how I was feeling, and never held it against me. Love that guy.

My sophomore year of highschool, I earned the starting Wide Receiver position, which was great. I finally felt as if I was good enough for someone. I gave it my all, and ended up hurting my MCL for playing on an injured knee. My parents refused to take me to see a doctor because they believed I could just ""walk it off"". Well, my coaches eventually had enough of it, and had the physical therapist from my school district come down as help me recover every week. After football ended, my parents decided to move to a totally new area. I was really upset. I was dating a really nice girl and had a decent opportunity with football. But, they refused any notion of staying to let me finish my last two years of high school. Not a big deal, just upset they let me pursue something I actually enjoyed doing, even though it was first only to please my father. At my new school, they didn't allow me to play football. I was heartbroken. Football, the one thing I loved after I gave up skating, was suddenly no longer available to me. This is when I started playing a lot of video games. I had no friends at my new school yet, so it was my only way to socialize with my old friends. This hobby grew into more of a passion, and I started making youtube videos. I grew a decent sized following, and started making money off the videos. My dad came up to me and told me he wanted 50% of everything I earned. I didn't like it, but he offered to help me get better hardware and software to be more successful, so I started forking over 50% of my money that I earned. He never held up his bargain. Then my family got back in touch with my estranged grandparents who have missed out on my a good 7 years of my life due to a fight between them and my father. My grandfather noticed my interest in computers and how I could make better videos if I had a better one. I show him one I was saving money up to get, but my father refused to let me get it. My grandfather then went home, ordered it online and then surprised me with it. Imagine my joy, it was amazing that a man who hasn't seen me in over 7 years, do something so generous for me. ( It was an expensive computer) Him and I would then have long talks about computers and everything since he was a computer programmer for the government. It was nice having someone encourage an interest for once. Still doing youtube to this day because of his encouragement.

 At my new high school, I joined choir. I had interests in music, but didn't know how to sing. However the choir teacher found out I had a very pleasant baritone voice. It was awesome. I found something I enjoyed and was decent at. I told my parents after being in choir for about two weeks, that I was in choir. My father's initial reaction was ""That's gay, are you going to turn gay next?"". At this point in life, I learned to do things for myself, and didn't need my father's approval or even respect. I continued to do choir for the rest of my high school years. My senior year of high school, I met a very amazing girl who would eventually be my ""first love"", or whatever I thought love was at my current age. My parents didn't really approve, but they never showed that when she was over. They would put on this fake show and try to look like these amazing parents who were the reason for any success I had in life. This really urked me the wrong way. Anything I've done, was without their approval, not necessarily my mother, but she never disagreed with my father so she's just as guilty. After a long while, this girl and I broke up (we got back together about 6 months later ).

This next part, don't judge me. I got really depressed, as she was also in choir, it was extremely hard to break contact with her, and was forced to see other guys try to flirt with her. My parents then proceeded to bash this girl I cared for so much, calling her a ""lil whore"", a ""cunt"". I defended her at every opportunity but this showed me their true feelings about her, and since we were no longer dating, they thought it was okay to make fun of a 16 year old girl. I still have not forgiven them for this.

After a while, I overcame my depression, but I was also no longer the person I used to be. The love that I had for other people, the good I saw in the world, gone. This is what lead me even further away from my parents. Something I regret, but can't take back. What little of relationship I had with my parents, was gone. I ended up getting my GED early to just enlist in the Army already, and be away from them. I've always thought about enlisting, but got really serious about it my last two years of high school. It's one of the reasons that girl and I broke up. However, my parents convinced me to stay longer so I could look after my younger brother. After a while, it came to time to enlist, my parents tried to convince me not to. I remember having a fight with my father because he said ""That it would be a lot of hard work, and I don't think you can handle it"", I then proceeded to tell him to fuck off and started to pack my bags. I had enough. As I was leaving, he thought it would be a good idea to stand in my way, and no matter how many times I asked him to move, he wouldn't. Then I tried to just walk past him, he then punched me in the face. I'm only 5'8 145lbs, and a 260lbs man had punched me directly in my jaw. It hurt. A lot. I got up, and walked out. Surprisingly he moved this time. He denies the fact that he ever punch me, but I still have the scar in my inner lip from it. Eh.

My mother convinced me to come home after a week or two. They wanted to fix the relationship before I left, I was willing, but not hopeful. My older brother had also talked me into trying to fix things. It was then I found out my father had told EVERYONE in my family that I was some super huge drug addict. I was unaffected by it because I honestly could not give a damn about anything that man said. 

After getting my ship date delayed due to needing a medical waiver, my father seemed convinced that I wasn't good enough to even be accepted into the military let alone make it through basic training. His reason was kind of weird though. He believed it was because I didn't finish high school, and that I was some drug addict. Yes, I didn't finish high school, but with an asvab score for 92, the highest being 99, the recruiters were happy with me enlisting. I don't do drugs so, I'm not sure. My father is the one who abuses his prescription. Soooo

After a while, my father began to turn my little brother against me. After picking up my brother from school, my brother told me things he heard from my father. ""You're not good enough for the marines ( he doesn't know the difference between Army and Marines ) because you didn't finish school. I'm smarter than you because I get all A's. I was devastated that my little brother thought so low of me.. But I know where he overheard this, from my father. I confronted my father about it and his only response was ""But it's true"".

I had to get a private doctor to write off for my medical waiver. My mother drove me about 15 miles to an eye-doctor, and told me my father would come pick me up when I was done, she had to get back to work. So I finish up my exam, call my father, and no answer. I called about 10 more times, left several messages, but to no avail. I waited around two hours for him. The doctor's office closed by then. So I had to wait out in the windy rain. I like the rain, so it wasn't too bad. I then go fed up and began to walk home. It took me several hours, and it was around 11pm when I got home. Got home, and my father said "" Where were you all day"", he then proceeded to provoke an argument, but I kept just telling him to leave me alone so I can sleep. Eventually he got fed up because I didn't argue back.

I didn't speak to him for about a week when he decided to kick me out, for good. He took my phone, the only way for my recruiter to get a hold of me and tell me when I would be leaving for training, and smashed it to pieces. And then proceeded to tell me that I was the reason for my little brother misbehaving, at this point, I no longer saw him as a father, but as someone who has put me down in a lot of ways, a lot of which I didn't go over here, didn't want to bore you with them. I flat out told him, that it's his terrible method of parenting that is causing him to misbehave, It's called discipline and you aren't giving any. He then punched me another time, I probably deserved it but hey.

My mother wasn't home for this, wasn't even told about him kicking me out until I was already gone. My father probably lied to her about his reasoning, but I don't really care.

I'm now living with my grandmother who was gracious enough to take me in for the short time before I ship out to basic training. She's heard his side of the story, and can't believe his actions. She's the one that raised him, so she understands him better than anyone. She's pretty pissed about the way he's treated me, but I keep telling her it's not a big deal. 

So here I am, writing this while sitting on this extremely comfortable couch which acts as my bed.

I told my grandmother about how my parents still pay for my older brothers clothes and how they send him money every 2 weeks. And his expensive tuition And how I would be yelled at for asking for $20 dollars to go see a movie every now and then. And how I have been buying all my clothes and items, from my youtube money, for the last year and a half. Even though, my brother who has a high paying internship. She thought it was down right wrong for them to neglect the things I needed, but I actually really enjoyed it. I felt like I was independent.

After 18 years of being discouraged, or being constantly compared to my older brother, or even having my heartbroken, I can honestly say, I've never been happier. I try not separate myself from things that harm, and I feel like I finally have. :)

Now, that girl that broke my heart. It was all a misunderstanding, but we were both to prideful to work things out after we broke up. Then by chance, we started talking again, and still have very strong feelings for each other. We got back together, but since I'm leaving for the Army, we decided it'd be best to see if we still feel the same way once I get back. I know for sure, that I will. When I get back I plan to show her the man I always could be, and show her we could work.

So that's basically my life story. If you managed to read this, thanks. I just wanted to write it because it really helps me with everything."
3t5scn,61,2015-11-17,Had a unique situation on my show last night. WEIRD,theSDRshow,podcasts,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/3t5scn/had_a_unique_situation_on_my_show_last_night_weird/,"So we had these two porn stars on (Nikki Benz &amp; Alexis Texas).  They were here because tomorrow they are walking topless in Times Sq. to promote awareness for women I guess?   Anyway - we talk about the fact that they both were born outside of the US (on in Panama and one in Ukraine).. so I said that it's cool that you are both immigrants and are now here in the US.

Holy crap - they freaked out on me!  We aren't immigrants, what the fuck are you talking about.. etc...  And I had our intern read the definition of immigrant on the air.. to assure them that they are indeed immigrants... but no - - we are US citizens, I pay taxes, etc... and I said - be that as is may - - you are immigrants, as you weren't born here. It's not a dirty word.  You just can't be president.. what do you want me to say?

Then I tried to soften the situation - saying - look everyone is this room are descendants of immigrants... and if anything - I am the worst offender, as my grandparents on my dad's side are Syrian, which is certainly not something to brag about these days... 

And then they started saying I was Isis, and I am on food stamps, and my family is awful or whatever...

It was SO WEIRD!  They refused to take pics, we ended the early as they would no longer have a conversation.. it was NUTTY!

BUT - that being said - I think it will make for a good controversy on the show - and we should probably get a good bump in listeners when the show is released - as I plan on jumping on board the #immigrantswelcomehere hashtag among others.

Coffee in hand, head throbbing from drinking too much while watching football all Sunday. I'm only a half hour late. Not bad given my state. 

As soon as I sit down and log into my computer, I get an angry ping from the receptionist. 

&gt; Where the hell have you been, your new intern has been sitting here for 45 minutes waiting for you to show up!

Fuck. I completely forgot she was starting today. Taking a giant swig from my coffee cup, I stand up and try to compose myself. When I get to the reception area I see a young woman dressed like she is ready to go out to the club. Skin tight dress that is way too short, 4"" heels, perfectly done makeup, her breasts just barely hidden by the low cut top to her dress. 

I think to myself ""Poor girl, she's never going to get the job dressed like that."" After taking a long, very obvious stare at her,  my mind only working at half speed, but using all it's power to try and figure out what she would be like in bed. I turn the secretary.

""So where is this intern?"" The only response I get is a death stare - I'm going to have to get her something nice now - and a nod at the girl sitting there. 

""Well, shit. This isn't going to end well."" I think to myself as I say ""Common, lets go."" And start walking back to my office. "

So back to the start where this all began three years ago when I met her. We clicked instantly, I am admittedly a shy person however I always had decent luck when it came to girls. This girl was different everything felt right with her. However after a short two months we both decided that we were both not ready for a relationship and we would remain friends. (Both of us were coming off the end of a relationship hers a quite abusive one.)
A year and a half passed and we remained very good friends, best friends in fact. I would share my stories/problems with her and vice versa. We seen other people in that time and we were relatively happy.Then in October of last year I went to visit her for her birthday and we slept together. This was the first time in nearly two years. It was one of the best nights of my life and she whole heartedly agreed.
This time we said we would take things slow, take time to enjoy each other. The following months were the best of my life, everything seemed to make sense and seeing her at the weekend or if I went to visit during the week felt like a blessing. Seeing her smile made me the happiest I could ever be.
April came and things began to get very serious it was non stop contact with each other and we were loving every moment of it. At this point it was time to look for summer work be it an internship or something related to my field of study, same for her. We both found work abroad and were delighted.
The two days before I left to go I spent with her. That is my happiest memory. Never have I felt so close to another human every second we savoured knowing we do not have much time left together. At this point we both knew at the back of our minds that it would be foolish to assume we would remain monogamous throughout our time abroad, as we were still relatively early in our, whatever it was, non-relationship? We said we would do our best but nothing would be certain.I taught I was happy enough with this. As I was leaving we both cried and cried, but my attention then turned to when I would see her next I booked flights to visit her halfway through our Summer.
The Summer started and time went on. Our contact was obviously lessened but we both always found time each day to call or send messages. I often return home from a late shift to find paragraphs going into great detail of how much she missed me, the feeling was mutual. July couldn't come soon enough.
July finally came and I seen her. I felt like I was going to explode. She ran at me and we embraced. The feeling of being loved, feeling wanted is like no other, nothing exceeds it. I could only afford a short trip, four days, but they were worth every penny. At that point and time I was just waiting for the summer to be over so I could see her again.
As the summer drew to a close messages were more sporadic due to increased working hours on both sides however we both still messaged back and forth.I taught to myself we aren't going out,we aren't boyfriend and girlfriend why not test the waters. During this time I was with another girl but I felt empty and cut it off immediately. She didn't make me feel like the other girl.
We both arrive home and we immediately make plans to meet up. We do and things are a little off. However I am so happy to see her I take little notice.(Hindsight is 20/20 right?) A few weeks go past and things don't change. She just doesn't seem as interested any more. So I confront her and ask her. She says that she loves everything about me, she loves being in my company, I'm the best sexual partner she has had and that no body makes her feel the way she feels when she is with me... but she isn't attracted to me any more and that she is not interested in a relationship. What?!?
I am completely thrown, I don't know what to do my world is completely upside down. At first I taught we could help me get over the situation and get back to being friends. It's not what I wanted I wanted to be with her. She slipped straight back into how we were a year previous when we were friends. I just couldn't handle it any more and I cut off communications from her after advice from friends. It's been over a month and things have gotten worse and worse.
I try to occupy myself but the second I finish what I am doing my thoughts go immediately back to her. I have tried being with other girls, I don't want to be there. Everyone is telling me that the best way to move on is to be with someone else for me its the opposite it drives me deeper into this depression, this confusion. I just cannot wrap my head around the situation.
Every moment of everyday my body is aching, longing to just call her, message her, see her face anything. My confidence is shot, I don't feel as involved in my hobbies be it my sport, the gym, drone flying.
This girl is solely responsible for my highest highs in my life but also the lowest lows. I am trying my best to get out of this slump but I feel with every step I take to get out of here be it talking with friend or family, doing my hobbies, throwing myself into my studies or like I said previously trying to find someone else, nothing is ridding me of this emptiness I feel inside each and everyday. What should I do?
Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read my post and perhaps offer a slight piece of advice, anything is appreciated. Didn't want to post here and seem like one of these friendzone type posts but it's what I feel is my last resorts. Thanks reddit :)
tl;dr: Met three years ago, had 2 months of a relationship decided it was best to be friends by mutual consent, things picked up this time last year, were seeing each other exclusively but not in a relationship as we both were going abroad to work for summer months. Returned from summer working and my feelings the same hers have changed.

Most of the time, I've been stressed out, whether it's regarding my schoolwork, internships, or my social life. The thing about being a student that I realized is that it's a marathon for an entire semester; it's a 24/7 commitment, that there's no way of escaping until the end of the semester when you're done with finals. And then it starts up all over again. 

For my internship this summer, I worked full-time, had my own apartment, and my own car. I was basically living the post-grad life. I honestly prefer that lifestyle over college any day. After work, I basically got to do whatever I wanted or go wherever I wanted. Even when I had a really stressful day at work, at least when I left for the day, I didn't really have to worry about it. During the weekends, I went on roadtrips all the time, and drove to visit friends all over the place. 

It was even easier to meet people on my own. People always say that it's so much easier to meet people in college/you'll never be around so many like-minded individuals in your life. I can sort of see that, but as a minority in a southern school filled with snobby rich kids, I honestly never really liked the college social environment. It's not like I didn't try to branch out and be social -- I'm on an athletic team as well as a fraternity. It's more like, people in the ""real world"" were a lot more approachable than the narrow demographic of the rich white elite who populate this school. 

At this point I'm just rambling, but I really miss being in the ""real world"". It's to a point where I can't wait to graduate, just so I can escape from this environment. Does/did anyone feel the same way?"
3t6n7l,4,2015-11-17,Stuck between a rock and a hard place,zpapa,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3t6n7l/stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place/,"Hey guys, in the name of not self diagnosing and panicking I am just going to lay out the facts and save any real detective work for a professional (which I'm currently trying to figure out). I am in a bit of a pickle seeing as I currently have no insurance. I contacted my state medical department and spoke with them briefly about re-applying for government coverage which they were happy to help with. After providing them with my personal information it was determined I didn't qualify for Medicaid and wouldn't be able to select a private insurance until the New Year. That is the biggest issue I am facing right now to get the help I need.

Now a little background...

I am a 28 year old male with a history of depression since my teens but never saw a doc until late last year. I was living at my father's house with no job and no motivation. I wasn't happy with the situation I was in but I felt powerless to change it so I continued to sulk and lay around like a sloth waiting for the day I would wake up and feel ""normal"" again.

After nearly two months of this anti-social and generally depressive behavior my dad finally approached me and asked how he could help. I told him I had no motivation to get a job and was scared that even if I did get a job I wouldn't be able to hold it for very long. I hated feeling like a failure but I just didn't have the energy to do anything about it.

Long story short... we went to his psychiatrist (my father has BP I disorder, his mother suffers from major depression as well) where I sat down and was asked to talk about how I was feeling, etc. 

I told the doc that I go through periods where my mood is fantastic, my energy is great and my general outlook on life is very positive. I feel like I can do anything and everything. I'm very physically active and lift weights 5+ times per week when I'm doing well. I'm up early without an alarm (between 4 and 5 am) and ready to tackle the day. It's at these times that I have the self-esteem, motivation and energy to pursue my goals of developing a personal brand and making something of myself in the fitness industry. I do just about everything that the book would say to take care of myself including all the basic grooming and hygiene habits one would expect from someone who takes care of themselves. This usually lasts for a few months. I'll work myself into fantastic shape and be at a point where life seems easy. Everything seems just right. If only it would stay that way...

I then told him eventually it all falls down and I spiral down a path where I see my energy decreases, my moods worsen and my general outlook becomes very pessimistic. I display all the classic signs of depression and begin to make poor choices that make me feel worse about myself and my current state of mind. My diet goes to shit. I begin sleeping 12 hours per day. I don't want to go to work. When I show up to work I have a bad attitude and it's noticed by my boss/supervisor which then leads to the inevitable meeting about my performance. I get asked to hang out and I decline or don't even respond. The gym becomes an afterthought even though I think about it everyday and wonder why I'm not working out. All of these behaviors feed upon themselves and keep me down. Until magically I begin to feel better and I repeat the cycle all over again...

This all took place about a year ago so the doc's first inclincation was that I'm suffering from SAD (I do live in the PNW) which made sense but I told him that the behaviors can happen anytime of the year. I've just noticed a pattern that there's an up followed by a down follwed by an up and so on. It usually lasts a few months on the up and then slowly degrades into a down until it becomes an up once again.

He decided the best course of action was to go on a medication called Pristiq at 50mg once per day. I remember I started the medication right around the New Year. He was generous with the samples he gave me so I had enough medication to last me for awhile which was great because I only had state health insurance at the time and Pristiq would not have been covered.

The medication took effect rather quickly and had me feeling more upbeat and positive within a few weeks. I began searching for jobs more diligently and eventually got hired to work for a PT clinic as an aide. I also started to search for a place to live on my own and was able to secure an apartment at the beginning of March. That's quite the turnaround in only a few short months!

So now I had a new job and an apartment to go along with it. I also was eligible for employee insurance so at the 60 day mark my insurance kicked in and I met with my doc once again. I found out that Pristiq wasn't covered by my insurance so I had to explore different options. I should note that after the initial boost from the Pristiq life wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I didn't feel like the medication was working amazingly well and when my insurance kicked in I didn't have a problem moving to something else to see how it affected me.

After lots of haggling and doing some of my own research, I found a similar medication that was covered by my insurance. Enter: Venlafaxine 150mg. I started the medication in May and never really noticed any sort of benefit from it. I was going to work, working out regularly, had (still have) a gf, living on my own but I still didn't feel right. I started to have problems at work and eventually had a sit down with the manager to talk about me being late to work (2-5 minutes) and my general disposition while at work. I expressed my frustration with unfulfilled promises and my pay being too low as the primary reasons for my decreased performance at work. The truth was I just didn't feel happy and could feel the general heaviness of depression hanging over my head. I put in my two weeks notice without any sort of job lined up. I also found out my insurance ran out a the end of the month which was only a week away so I made sure to fill my last 30 day supply of Venlafaxine before the insurance ran out.

So now it's the end of August and I'm unemployed with my own apartment and rent due soon. I had planned for the next month's rent by putting in my notice at a time where I would be paid and then paid once more at my usual two week pay amount. That gave me 5 weeks to figure out October's rent.

I went off the Venlafaxine because I really didn't feel like it was helping and because I had no health insurance to continue to pay for it each month anyways.

And then something crazy happened...

I started feeling really good again. I was waking up super early in the morning, working out for 2 hours everyday and feeling really motivated. I ended up applying for a fitness job and landed the gig in mid September which was fantastic! Now I'm doing something I enjoy and I'm feeling great! This is awesome!

Things continued to be great for a few weeks. I had lots of enthusiasm and was excited to be with a group of 20 something guys who had fun and joked around a lot. And then I started to noticed my motivation in the gym waning, I began sleeping 12 hours and my moods were all over the place.

I'm now at a position (once again) where I'm unmotivated, sleeping too much, exercising too little, not making enough $$$ to pay all my bills and becoming frustrated at work. The owner has already noticed a change in my behavior and was frustrated by my hesitancy to adopt a new schedule.

I feel the same inside as I did last year but I have much more on my plate. Rent to pay. Bills to pay. A job to work at. A girlfriend to keep happy. It all feels so overwhelming and impossible to keep up.

I'm in a position now where I don't have the insurance to see someone and can't afford cash rates. The psychiatrist I saw last year is cash only and that isn't something I can do right now.

I did reach out to my father yesterday (we haven't talked much since I moved out, long story) and expressed my concern about my current mood state. Like I said, I don't want to self diagnose but my father has been living with BP I disorder for a very long time and these swings back and forth have me going from invincible to full of doubts.

I did call a mental health hotline yesterday and asked for recommendations on various clinics in my area. I've already contacted a few but there isn't much available w/o insurance and the option I do have (4-6 free sessions with an intern) don't seem like the solution to this particular problem.

Just to reaffirm... I am not currently on any medication. I haven't been for nearly three months. In that three months I've also experience the elevated mood and optimism I've become accustomed to for periods of time throughout my 20's.

All I'm trying to do is figure out what my options are w/o insurance at this time. 6 weeks until insurance kicks in is just too long to wait. I don't want to lose another job because of my mood fluctuations and will do whatever it takes to get the help I need.

I appreciate any and all input you guys may have.

* Are there any things I can do to take advantage of the situation (e.g. Things like taking out a credit card that offers airline points beforehand and use that to pay the debt to accumulate airline miles?).  

* Is there any wiggle room or negotiation on paying off my debt?  

* How do I protect myself from the debt reappearing later

* $127 - Utility Bill (in debt collections) 

* $118 - Phone Bill (in debt collections) 

* $101 - Cable Bill  (in debt collections) 

* $5794 - Bill to my University (in debt collections) (This is for my last semester of college, which I didn't take a student loan out for. I looked into this and I do have a degree, but because of this debt I've never been mailed my diploma.)

**My Situation:** 

I paid my way through a school and graduated in 2013 with a degree in applied math &amp; environmental hydrology. I spent all the money I had moving to Washington DC for a 6-month internship at a fairly prestigious research organization doing environmental geospatial analysis. I was making way below minimum wage, on food stamps, living in a terrible DC neighborhood. At the end of the internship, I didn't get the job; my project role was given to grad student from an Ivy League. I couldn't compete with that. 

After 200-300 job apps elsewhere I had a few interviews but zero job offers. I then moved home and took a job as a food server and a 2nd job working in a warehouse shipping packages for a bicycle company. I'm exhausted all the time. I'm depressed and somewhat jaded by the job process. In what free time I am teaching myself computer coding - github, html, css, javascript, jQuery, mapbox.js, leaflet.js and a slew of other GIS specific coding languages. I taught myself web-mapping and I will be giving a presentation on a project I've been working on at a Meetup Group of GeoDevelopers later this month. I try and remind myself how much hard other people have it. I could be a Syrian Refugee, or Iraqi War Vet - how the fuck am I depressed over not having a career? But I hate that I can't break my cycle of thinking. I grew up poor, and *absolutely nothing* would make me happier than to be able to take care of my mom the way she took care of me. I can't believe how difficult it is to get a job even when qualified. Sorry for the sap but getting out of debt takes such an emotional toll.

3t7cxk,7,2015-11-17,Mending broken relationships,Baracka_Obama,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3t7cxk/mending_broken_relationships/,"I have not been officially diagnosed with BPD yet. I do have an appointment with a psychologist on Monday for an official diagnosis.

I know I might be jumping the gun here, but a few days ago I was browsing some other subreddit and someone mentioned they had borderline personality disorder. I researched it thinking that my ex may have it since our relationship was so tumultuous. I realized that it described every aspect of every close relationship I've ever had. And I started crying, because I finally realized that it's not other people. It's me.

I guess I should start at the beginning. I've also had a lot of very intense, but short lived relationships whether romantic or platonic. My own family seems to distance themselves from me. I always figured that I was just too shitty to be around. And on top of that I've always felt like people just didn't care about things as much as they should. I never understood why I would be really sad, or really happy, or really angry about something when everyone else was just like ""Calm down"". I've also never just been able to ""let it go"".

So, after about 8 months of being single, I meet this guy who is much younger than me. We worked together for a bit and then his internship ended. The working relationship we had was nice, but I asked him for his number and we started a friendship out of work. Eventually he introduced me to his friends and things were great for a little bit. It really helped me because I had just moved to a new town and didn't know anyone. I didn't have any family. The only people I knew were people from work. 

Like always, I fit in pretty well with his social group and we hung out a few times. Eventually, I asked if he would be interested in dating and after some thought he agreed. 

I was elated (something I'm finding is pretty normal for BPD). I knew this was his first relationship ever and I was dead set on making it a good experience for him. Things were okay for the first few weeks, but things also moved VERY quickly. Within two weeks we were swapping ""I love you""s and staying the night with each other. 

Eventually, my abandonment issues started to control me. I found myself freaking out or being unreasonably depressed if I didn't see him every day. I felt rejected and ignored if I didn't get any texts from him through out the day. If I went more than a day without talking to him it made me incredibly anxious and angry, like he was rethinking being with me.

It eventually got to him. And after 5 months of  I love you/I hate you/don't leave me/don't talk to me he'd just had enough. We broke up twice, tried the friendship thing more times than I can count, and now we are at a point where we don't talk and I've lost his friends as my friends as well. In just one night I lost 8 people I cared about and enjoyed being around.

It was around that same time that I threw everything at him that I could. Everything was his fault. He allowed our ""wonderful"" relationship to fall apart. I had told him how broken I was and I didn't understand why he would leave like everyone else. He was supposed to be the one who loved me unconditionally.

He was very honest with me in a way that no one else has been. He told me he left because he couldn't deal with me any more. That the way I treated him affected him so much that he just couldn't care about me anymore. He told me he didn't hate me, he just couldn't be my friend.

I told him I am getting help and that I'm heartbroken that I ruined the experience of his first relationship. I explained that it was because of him that I was getting therapy. I really hurt him and I don't want to do that to anyone else close to me. He said he's forgiven me.

My question is, and I know this will take a great deal of time until I'm ready, but I would ultimately like to repair my relationship with him and the group of people that saved me from myself. 

Have any of you been able to mend broken relationships with people you deeply cared about? Were they receptive to getting to know the you that was in treatment? Obviously I know everyone's situation is different and it will vary from person to person, but I just need a little hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and I might be able to make it out alive.

3t7g2f,55,2015-11-17,I just really wanted to share this story about some Muslim friends,robinmakeshisnest,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3t7g2f/i_just_really_wanted_to_share_this_story_about/,"It's been in my head these last few days, and I just wanted to share it somewhere.



I grew up in the South (in the US) and not in a super big city, so a little bit like what people might imagine it to be.  But the area I lived in happened to have a large population of Indian and Pakistani people, and so, in turn, we had a decent sized Muslim population.  It wasn't something I thought much about growing up.  Most kids were Christian, but there were definitely a mix others.  So I ended up with a bunch of Muslim friends. None of them talked much about it unless you asked, unlike a lot of the other religious kids.  I didn't grow up going to church so some people gave me a pretty hard time, but they never did.  I knew it was important to them, but that was about as far as it went.




There were a few that I was closer with and hung out with outside of school.  My senior year, through our National Honor Society chapter, four of us would volunteer weekly with an after school program.  There were two Muslim guys, a Christian Indian guy and me.  Sometimes I would only go once a week, but I think they all always went twice a week.  There were other kids from our school there sometimes, but the three of them were extremely consistent. 




This after school program (mostly elementary school kids, some middle school) was really important, because it was trying to keep kids in tough situations off the streets and offer them help.  When we would get there we were each assigned a kid or two, and then we would help with homework, watch or help with math programs, and then they would read a book to us.  Afterwards we could play with them.  All the kids would fight to be these three guys partners, they were everyones favorites.  And it was obvious why.  They loved life. They were joyful, fun, silly, and smart.  The type of people you just want to be around because they make you better.  I always cherished the moments going to volunteer with them.  





One of my favorite memories was when I was talking to the one guy on AIM (wow, so long ago...) and he was saying he had cookies and no milk, and I said I had milk and no cookies, so he came over and we sat in my house and ate cookies and milk.  We were just a couple of kids, it didn't matter what religion we were.  




Fast forward a few years in college.  I'm doing a summer internship.  I met another Muslim guy, he's from a different state but went to a nearby state school.  It never crossed my mind that he would know and be good friends with the two Muslim guys from high school.  Not only did they know each other buy they were great friends.  It makes sense when I think about it now.  Same school, same major and mosque, likely to know each other.  This guy was awesome too, just a warm, kind-hearted person.  He was everyones favorite person in the summer program.  



I got a call one night.  There had been a car accident.  The two guys from high and the guy from my internship had all died.  That's how I found out they even knew each other.  Their funeral was one of the most heart-wrenching things I have ever been to.  I have never seen more people at a funeral.  It was at the local mosque, and I felt welcomed and given a place to mourn my friends along with everyone else.




I guess the whole point of wanting to share this is that these were amazing, beautiful and kind people.  They were more a part of our community than most other people I knew.  They weren't able to get older and serve as a wonderful example of how good people can be.  They were different from me in so many ways, and yet, we were still good friends.

3t7hjm,3,2015-11-17,LAB1; Tableau visualizations of Dutch museum exhibition data,-IKEA,EURDRM2015,https://www.reddit.com/r/EURDRM2015/comments/3t7hjm/lab1_tableau_visualizations_of_dutch_museum/,"Image of dashboard can be found at this Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8ysL92d17PyU3p5SXdRUDhLbVU/view?usp=sharing 

These figures are visualizations of data we (Matthijs Punt &amp; Thomas Teekens) collected for a research internship at the EUR, which we’re currently editing into a journal article. The dataset we collected contains the artists (N=8674) that were exhibited in modern art exhibitions in three Dutch museums between 1930 and 1989. We collected background data on all those artists that appeared in these exhibitions more than two times (N=2163), such as nationality, birth year and main art discipline. For more specific questions regarding the data, we are always happy to talk about our research, so please contact one of us! Also, we should note that the data used here are retrieved from archival sources, rather than using digital research methods.

Our research concerns the connections between artists that are created in museum exhibitions (see Braden, 2009). For instance, we hypothesize that artists that appear among different ‘crowds’ of artists might have more success than those that always appear with the same artists. One of the measures of such a position is called degree: simply the count of different artists one individual artist has been exhibited with. In figure 1, two scatterplot charts are depicted, containing the individual artists, with this degree on the x-axis and respectively (i) the number of books an artist appeared in and (ii) the price paid for the artist’s paintings (see footnote). The size of the dots represents the number of solo exhibitions these artists received in the museums during our time frame, and its colour represents gender (with male, female and group artists). Without going into too much detail into our subject, two things struck us about Tableau’s visualization: firstly, it automatically decided which labels (in this case, the artist’s names) it shows and which to keep covered, and secondly the function of showing trend lines (and their confidence bands, which we omitted for clarity) and their significance. In this figure, only the trend lines of the ‘male’ artists in both figures was significantly positive, while for female artists, this relation is not significant.

The second table can be found in the upper right corner of the dashboard. Here, our subjects are divided in two dimensions: the century in which the artists were born, and the main discipline in which they produced art. The bars represent the average number of exhibitions the artists in different disciplines had in three different types of exhibitions: all exhibitions taken together (Avg. To#App), the KunstenaarsVerenigings-exhibitions (Avg. To#KVapp, which translates to exhibitions held in Amateur art association contexts) and the number of solo exhibitions (Avg. To#solo). What these charts show is that artists performing in multiple disciplines are more represented in traditional art and overall exhibitions, while the amateur art association exhibitions feature mostly artists restricted to paintings. Also, we see that the amateur art exhibitions only feature artists from the nineteenth and twentieth century; this isn’t so surprising, as amateur artists aren’t as likely to be consecrated in museums. 

The final figure in the lower half of the dashboard shows a world map. The countries are coloured on a scale, ranging from white to green. The darker the colour of the country, the more the artists (that appeared in Dutch museum exhibitions) appeared in books (see footnote), such as monographs. The label inside the countries represents the number of artists that originated there. As you can see, this figure nicely charts the certain Western-centred tendency of the world of art (see Quemin, 2006) Please note that “The Netherlands” – understandably the nation with the largest book coverage per artists, as we searched for these books in a Dutch library -  was filtered out of the colouring. With The Netherlands included, all other countries would have been pale – here Tableau was a very useful program that enabled us to filter this country fairly easily (also, we were impressed by the ease of creating such a world map!). As our data is situated in Dutch museums, the data show mostly Western countries, while African and Asian artists are clearly underrepresented. Therefore, we chose to only show the northern hemisphere of the map in order to show a detailed picture of especially Europe, although this means that we lose South-Africa, Argentina and Chili in our illustration. Here, Tableau’s Dashboard isn’t as flexible as we would want it to be.

This short (visual) description of our data set shows different allowances that the program Tableau offers us: it presents data in a detailed way with a large number of variables, as figures 1 and 2 show. Next to this, figure 2 shows one other advantage of the program, as it enables us to neatly distinguish between different categories in our data. The third chart also represents different variables, and Tableau surprised us when it automatically mapped the data onto the world map. Altogether, the main purpose of this assignment was to try out and show the myriad of possibilities Tableau offers, and as such, we hope we didn’t confuse you too much with our large number of variables.  

x; we collected the book coverage data from the Dutch Rijksbureau for Rijksdocumentatie, a national art library, and the art price was retrieved from artprice.com. Once more, you need only to ask and we will happily provide more information on this.

Im fairly new to TRP. This is a story about a college girl I know who confirmed many RP truths for me.

She's an HB8 I met freshman year of college. Thought she was cute and I befriended her so I could get it in after she sees me as a great friend! Turned out she had a boyfriend. I decided I will wait it out and be there for her. I was orbiting hard and got friendzoned. She would break up in between with this LDR and have one night stands or fwb's. I thought she would come around. Then I found TRP. I focused on myself for classes, working out, and my internship. She transferred to another school but we kept in touch over skype. After sleeping around a bit she snagged herself a guy at her new school. Last year she visited me for a weekend. She kept commenting how much I've changed. I was proud but stayed calm and didn't react. We went out, drank,smoked. All night I maintained frame and didn't give into her shit tests like I used to. She was crashing at my place. She says ""I get really horny when I'm crossed"". Instantly I knew what was up but with all the rape stories I come across on here, I didnt want her to have something to hold over me. I let her sleep in my bed but we didn't do anything besides making out etc.. The next morning, I decide to see if it really was her being crossed. It wasn't. We banged a few times and I went to work, got the text saying she had a great time. She goes shopping and I get back that evening and work out with my bros. I come back from the gym and sees me with that post gym pump. She texts me that I look hot. I ignore her and watch the rest of the game with my bros. She complains later that I didn't invite her to shower with me. We went another two rounds that night. The next morning I'm not feeling too well so we just watch T.V and talk. She asks if I thought we would end up sleeping together. I say ""Of course not, this kinda just happened"" She smiles and says ""Exactly, I didn't mean to!"" Then she feels bad about her boyfriend. I say its whatever because I don't like the guy. Additionally, I know on her vacations away from her boyfriend she's been riding the cc and he knows absolutely nothing. He even cried when she threatened to break up with him. She went back and is still with him. Since then, she visited for another fun weekend. Recently she pushes for skype dates and asks about other girls. I used to be her orbiter and used to do her favors and listen to her, so I cant help but think that these random texts or Skype calls are for validation. I bailed on another one recently and she said she's over me. Got a text today(a week later) asking why I don't care. I have not purposefully been ignoring her btw, I have truly been busy with my school stuff. I would like to keep her orbiting because she's fun and I might be traveling that way soon. 
Question for you all: How do I respond and deal with her in the future to keep her orbiting?

Lessons Learned:
 
Girls respond to who you are in the present, not what you used to be or what you might be.

Dread lets the hamster run and gives girls tingles, leave things to her imagination.

Lift, maintain frame, and do you to get out of the friend zone.

Never be more invested in an interaction than the other person

AWALT, her bf thinks he's the luckiest guy in the world.  

Let the girl have plausible deniability for any sexual interactions but make sure you cover your ass too."

Secondly, is it a well-regarded program? Do students taking it tend to get relevant internships and jobs after graduation?

3t7n6v,2,2015-11-17,I'm [26F] so lost. My awesomely successful boyfriend [28 M] of 5 years wants me to move for him (again) without any changes. I'm too depressed to sort out if the problems are mine or ours.,alwaysthrownaway999,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3t7n6v/im_26f_so_lost_my_awesomely_successful_boyfriend/,"**Can I ask some sane people for their input?**

Ok, so a few baseline facts:

* I have been in treatment for depression/anxiety for our entire relationship. In the ""occasionally inpatient, has been pulled off literal ledges more than once"" way. He's always stuck by me.
* My career has been, so far, an utter disaster. I tried to enter a stressful, unprofitable art sales job I loved, but it cost me too many trips to the ER, and I left after a year. I've always been working since, but always as a somewhat random-industry contractor and always making just enough to avoid real debt.
* He walked into his dream job without even finishing undergrad; got the diploma from a distance, already making almost $300K at that time.
* I have never, ever understood why he has any interest in me. I really struggle to see myself in any positive light, but especially so next to him.

* He's incredibly supportive when my brain acutely gets in the way of living, but finds the fallout (the crap job, the bad days, etc.) very frustrating.

We did long distance for two years while I finished up school normally and took my art ""job"" (read: hilariously unpaid internship.) I lived out of suitcases, got on food stamps, etc. I truly thought it was the right thing to do at the time. Industry has an aggressive pay-your-dues atmosphere, and I didn't mind ramen. Had a dreadful boss who drove me over the edge, though.

So I moved where he was to start fresh, and we moved in together (planned). I got contracting work pretty quickly and we decided I should always pay at least something toward the rent, which ended up being about half what I made at the time. I could pay my bills with the rest, so it was ok.

We moved to a second place when our building was demolished, and then a third. 

-------




My income has increased and our rent has decreased in that time, but most things are now about the same, except now we go dutch on 90% of dates. I agreed to all of this, of course.

I love him very much. I also envy him. I work on this. 

He loves me too. He also feels I don't try hard enough/can't get on his level because I'm scared of failing at a major job again. Probably accurate.

-----



In any event, his work wants to transfer him back to New York (his hometown) in a few months. I'm doing ""permalance"" at a company I actually really like now, but it's not like I'm making a million dollars, or like this position is crucial to my burgeoning career. 

Given total unattachment, I'd move somewhere totally out of the way with a very low cost of living and a lot of trees, get an ok desk job, and run amok with my dog. 

But it's always been worth it to be with him in big cities instead -- he's brilliant, snarky, kind, believes in all the dreams for myself that I don't, etc.


-----


When our relationship gets rough, it's always about money. Mostly because I can't keep up with the stuff he's doing (work sending him on vacation, but I can't afford a plane ticket to tag along on the otherwise all-expenses-paid deal), or because he feels I'm not pulling my weight/I'm expecting him to pay my way.

------


Things have gotten rockier over the last six months, and we fight more about who should be expected to do what.

I don't think I'm in a position to be in a relationship right now; I'm not capable of shielding him from the crazy all the time. He HATES it when I spend a day crying; he spends the next three in sullen silence if I can't pull out of it for him.

--------

He's saved and saved so he can own a home in Manhattan by 30. It's his big dream.

Now that we're moving back, he wants to start shopping, he's ready.

------
We never discussed if I was coming; he assumed, down to the paperwork. I couldn't afford this city without his (much bigger) part of the rent anyway. I only moved here for him.

There are big emotional costs to me moving again/needing to job hunt again. (think of all the exciting meltdowns I can have!) These confuse him, since I certainly haven't been successful where we are.

He does not want to own the home with me. He wants it to be just his. He also doesn't want to get married.

He doesn't think even married couples should share their money, and he's not into marriage, so I'm not, like, holding out for a conventional ""commitment"" here. But we do own a dog together and make 5/10/30 year plans with each other. From my perspective, we're completely committed.

--------
But the move is really, really bothering me. I'm supposed to uproot life again, no discussion. But things are also supposed to stay as they are between us, and his actions don't match his promises and support.


I'm the one struggling to plant my feet in adulthood. He insists that this is all in my head, that we're equals, and that my desire to exit the relationship (I have brought up many times that I can't be good for him) is the depression talking. I genuinely can't tell if that's true.

Do I just walk out the door here? He doesn't want me to go, but I have to feel like he's trying to protect and shelter me, not be my partner. I don't feel I'm healthy enough to date. And now he's at a big crossroads in his life.

Help.

**TL/DR: My mental problems (in treatment) are not ruining my relationship explicitly, but my BF's actions indicate that he doesn't think of me as an equal because of my failures thus far to be a Proper Human. I don't know if I should move across the country (again) with him.**"
3t7qkg,1,2015-11-17,Failed laptop hard drive v2,riffraff11235,datarecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/datarecovery/comments/3t7qkg/failed_laptop_hard_drive_v2/,"Hey, it's me again. I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datarecovery/comments/3q4ag7/laptop_hard_drive_died_looking_for_some_guidance/) a while back about the failed hard drive from my laptop. I've consulted a couple of different places about it, the most promising of which was the IT department at the lab I intern for.

One of the employees there offered to try some recovery tools on the drive, after ascertaining that the problem was (probably) a corrupted partition table due to bad sectors. He made an image of the drive and was running scans/recovery on the image for well over a week. Today he sent me an email saying that the recovery failed 75% of the way through. He said he'd give me back the original drive and keep messing around with the image for a bit more, though. I'm not sure exactly which software he tried, but he told me that he was basically building a ""file tree"" of the drive so that we could see what was on it. I'll ask him for a list of the software he used and post it here later.

So now I'm left with these questions: If the problem really is just the corrupted partition table due to bad sectors, is there a good chance for a successful recovery if I send it off to a recovery company? How much is the typical charge for dealing with something like this? Since the failure happened suddenly (e.g. little or no prior symptoms at the user level), am I correct in thinking that there's a good chance my personal data is safe?

Sorry if I'm reiterating some of the same things I said in the previous thread. I thought I was almost done with this mess, so this latest news has left me kinda bummed."

3t8gdo,207,2015-11-17,"""Your sister needs help right now!""",nopeling,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3t8gdo/your_sister_needs_help_right_now/,"Been lurking here for a while, but wanted to get something off my chest. Let me start by saying that I am CF because of my sister and her four little special snowflakes. Her first was born when she was 19 (and now that I am 19, my family is expecting me to start popping them out), and she dropped out of school, married/divorced the baby daddy, married again, and produced three more children, each one driving them further and further into financial crisis, because she ""just loves babies and being a mom so much!""

Now she realizes that her husband's income can't support them and their many children, each of whom has at least three expensive activities, and my sister wants to go back go school to be a nurse like she always wanted before she decided to reproduce instead. I'm happy for her. The rest of my family is ECSTATIC! And pledges all of our support for everything!

I'm in college part-time - I would be full-time, but I'm having mental health issues that make it almost impossible to do even that sometimes. I have a part-time job, a few hours a week, but again, my issues with depression and anxiety make it very difficult. I lost one job already because my performance at work suffered so much, which made me feel even worse. Sometimes, it's all I can do to get out of bed, shower, and feed myself that day. A large part of why I refuse to be a parent is because I know that my problems would make it hard for me to raise children well, and as a result, I TRY TO AVOID THEM. 

However, my sister and her four crotch fruit don't understand this. They, along with the rest of my family, think I'm just lazy and need to ""get over it."" She's told other family members (who have told me) that all my problems are my fault. Ironic, given that she's the one who's had three out of four babies by accident. 

But anyway, my family has made a habit of babysitting for her twice a week. It really takes a toll on me, and sometimes I just can't do it. Her kids are ill-behaved at best, and the oldest is a grade-A brat, who frequently informs me that she's ""more awesome"" than I am because X, Y, Z. The urge to smack them across the room is overwhelming but my family absolutely worships them. 

Lately, my sister's demands have increased. Now she wants me to teach one of them how to read and write (my old job was in private tutoring...for middle and high schoolers) for free. My boyfriend goes to school out-of-state, and he's coming back to visit next week, but my mother wants me to bring him over to my sister's house so we can spend our limited time together watching her little terrors ""because they just ADORE him!!"" He tolerates them for my sake and to please my family, but he'd much rather be doing adult activities with me than listening to them scream constantly. 

Every time I try to say no, I'm told how brave my sister is for trying to go back to school and change her life, and how awful I am for preventing her by ""making up excuses."" Because I made up the depression, the panic attacks, the psychiatrist, the medications, etc. It just does not occur to them that if I had the capability to do more, I would be doing more *for my own sake.* I'd be in school full-time, have a job, sometimes go out with friends, venture into public in general, etc. It makes me upset that I'm not the person who I used to be, and I'm trying so hard to get better, but it's hard since I have nowhere near the support that my sister does. 

But no, I'm not the one that needs help. My sister and her accident children, though, they need help. 

Edit/Update: Wow, I honestly didn't expect many people to care enough to respond to my half-rant-half-advice-seeking. As of now, I've been offered an internship for this January-April in the next state over, so it's entirely probable I'll be moving out! My mother is pissed but she's probably going to move in with my sister and her crotchlings. I wish I were making that up, but nope. "

I currently work in a tech company where I got the position as intern to hire. I started working full time 3 months back. When I started working full time, I was placed on a team and the people on the team are who I work with. I guess as a newbie in this field I don't know much and I'm trying really hard. But the past 2 months have been difficult on me personally and emotionally. 

During my internship, I did similar stuff as I am doing now, but I was pretty good at it and I loved doing it. Now, I dread going to work. I don't enjoy working on my team and I feel it slowly chewing away at me. My performance has gone down and I talked to my manager. I talked to my colleagues to see how I could improve. I thought I was getting better I was talking to them more and I thought I was doing a better job. I was trying to incorporate more suggestions. Now, I found out that they still aren't happy with my performance. One of them said I ask too many questions. I just don't know how to do my job now. I feel so discouraged and now the team members don't really want to work with me. I don't even want to go to work.

3t989c,5,2015-11-17,Our dogs won't stop fighting. How do we fix this?,Ramon_Chingon,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/3t989c/our_dogs_wont_stop_fighting_how_do_we_fix_this/,"My girlfriend's family recently brought home a new puppy that was found by a friend(a pug that is still under a year old). They've named her Lydia. The family already had an 8 year old pug (Hank) and a 6 year old West Highland White Terrier named (Albert, who is female despite the male name). 

My girlfriend and I were on a trip when the puppy was brought home, so we missed the initial introductions. But apparently, Albert was aggressive toward the puppy, so my girlfriend's grandmother's response was to keep the two separated to avoid any fighting. When we got back a couple weeks later, this was still the strategy. We tried to put them together, but observed the same aggressive behavior and figured we needed a better plan. We learned from a friend we should walk them together and began doing this. The two get along just fine on walks. They just kind of ignore each other and enjoy the walk.

Not long after that, my girlfriend had to leave home for a 6-week internship so we didn't have much opportunity to fix the situation any further before she left. While she was gone, her grandmother continued to just keep them separated as she had been. And the aggression escalated. They're both ready to fight any chance they get. I think Lydia has become really afraid of Albert, so now she's just as aggressive. A couple of us have been bitten getting them away from each other.

Since she has gotten back, the two of us have been around again and are trying to fix it. She had the idea to buy them both muzzles in hopes that allowing them to interact while they were unable to fight would help. It hasn't been as helpful as we'd hoped. It does change their interaction. Albert in particular at first is much less aggressive and seems more curious about the puppy when they are both muzzled. Unfortunately, pug muzzles are quite awkward and Lydia will eventually find a way to get it off. As soon as it starts to come off, Albert immediately turns aggressive. It appears to me that they just don't trust each other at all, and when the muzzles are on, they can actually interact. But I don't know if this has helped overall. 

I know that the separation has led to this being a much bigger issue than it could have been in the beginning. Like I said, we weren't around in the beginning so we weren't the ones making the decisions. Her grandmother is the one that is home with the dogs all the time, so she dealt with it how she thought was best. But her plan at this point is just to keep them apart forever, and we know that's a bad idea. Right now, we just have two stressed out dogs and a huge inconvenience for everyone in the house to keep physical barriers between them. So what I'm looking for is help with how to move forward now that we're here.

* Were the muzzles a good idea? 
* How can we implement some form of positive reinforcement if they can't be in the same room without fighting? 
* Would throwing a bucket of water on them be a better deterrent than physically separating them? 
* The older pug is absolutely great at getting along with all other dogs. Can he help in some way?
* Is there anything else we can be doing? 

Any help is greatly appreciated. My girlfriend and I are willing to work with them. We just need to know where to start."

The last two exams I did I got a B on them. However I am not so good with quizzes. My grade is a 74 percent and while my exams are good my Quizzes I get are 10/25 on them.

I think the reason for this is I wasn't able to identify exactly what it was that got me so stressed around my parents, it just vaguely felt like manipulation. I moved out at 19 because of this, I was in an engineering degree and I scrapped by for a few years.

Let me be clear, they are good people, and I have accepted more money than I now feel comfortable with from them. In the last month I finished my degree, I turn 22 very soon, and it became clear that the paid internship I had been doing wasn't planning on hiring me for full time work. On my Moms insistence I moved back in to my parents place. There was two reasons, I couldn't afford to live out of home without work, and I wasn't taking good care of myself lately, I've been on anti-depressants for about 6 months now and things were getting a little bleak.

Something worth mentioning is that the medication has caused me to gain about 10kg. I mention this because my Mom immediately began making self improvement suggestions such as ""Oh your clothes are getting a bit tight"", ""have you been for a run today"". Ironic that the medications supposed to make me less self conscious right? Now I get that she's trying to help, at least her perspective, and I believed that too for a long time but neither of my parents take much of what I say seriously and this became a real problem just tonight.

So my internship is about a four hour drive away and I stay at a caravan park when ever I go up there. Yesterday I was up there, programming for 8 hours in an office of recycled air and no sunlight, I drove back afterwards and my parents and sister were discussing her car problems. She was going to the mechanics the next morning and needed someone to pick her up. I couldn't because my car had been stalling on the trip home and I was concerned about driving it before I could also get it to the mechanics. So it was decided that Dad would pick her up, well the next day, Dad forgot. He was out walking the dog and my sister was stranded, he told her he thought I was picking her up, lie.

She contacted me, I drove out there, broke down, walked home to get my wallet. I called dad to see what the hell was happening, ""YOU were suppossed to pick her up, *SAM, ALRIGHT,* I'll be home in a minute *I'LL* pick her up"". So I walked back to the car, got a mechanical to fix a fault in my car, drove to the mechanics my sister was at, picked her up. Thankfully this only took two hours, I apologized and brought her an ice tea, problem solved.

So after dinner Mom and I were making jokes about the whole calamity and Dad had had a few too many. He brought up excuse after excuse all of which trying to shift the blame on to me and belittle me for having poor social skills. 

* ""You need to work on your social awareness as it was heavily inferred you were supposed to pick her up.""

* ""Well you were playing board games with your sister, I assumed you well competent enough at communicating to determine the plan.""

* ""I'm not trying to shift blame here, but you need to be aware that you won't be able to form relationships outside this family if you can't accept responsibility for your mistakes""

At this point I was fuming, but I was coherently able to shoot down every excuse he made, he didn't have a leg to stand on and I had done everything in my power to resolve the issue that he created, and I did resolve it! I made this point to him but as always he failed to take me seriously, when I approached it calmly he talked over me and ignored me, and when I raised my voice and put him in his place, he shot me a look of false superiority and told me to watch my tone.

I had never seen either of my parents so blatantly attempt to foster self loathing or guilt me through blame shifting. But I realized that the language he was using, the social strategies were far too common. They've been pulling this kind of behavior for years and I'm only identifying it now, withing a week of moving back in.

I'm all too aware of the mistake it was to move back in and I need to find work and a new apartment as soon as possible.

**TL;DR** my dad got drunk and it became blatantly obvious that he and my mom have been foster self loathing in me for years."
3tbjnc,6,2015-11-18,"raised by and working for N's (it's long, much venting.)",ghostblonde,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3tbjnc/raised_by_and_working_for_ns_its_long_much_venting/,"I know I don't post here consistently. I now work two jobs, so it gets pretty hectic. My new job is an internship at my college in the Communications department. I hope to be kept on somehow so I can quit my crap, entry level job at a very popular chain pet store. And you know, it's a pretty good career starter, since I'm going to be a journalist.

Anyway, internship is fantastic. They're flexible, want me to learn and treat me like an adult. No micromanaging, no demeaning me, respecting boundaries. And I'm learning so much. It's amazing to be working a typical adult job.
The entry level hell job, not so much. My manager hasn't made it past HS with no plans on furthering herself. The Assistant Manager has a masters degree but refuses to work in her field. So she stays there and moved up to that position. She is condescending and a huge manipulator. Which would explain why she's so eager to stay in such a position because she knows she has power there. She tries to poorly mask it by using a cheery tone of voice, it's pathetic. She fabricates things about employees who ""wronged"" her, IE doesn't give into her fake nice act. She's a very classic and typical manager at a retail place. The main manager is similar but she's not as intelligent to really think of all the ways the other manager tries to screw over employees.

I usually roll my eyes and play dumb so she'll just go away. But since getting my internship and limiting my shifts to weekends only, N assistant manager has been on a rampage to try to reclaim her ""power"" over me. The holidays are coming up and omfg all employees MUST work the holidays. I get it, the animals kinda need people there to constantly care for them. The issue is how she's going about it.
The main manager called and asked to see if I could work Friday after Thanksgiving. I said yes but with some conditions, a 4-5 hour shift and preferably not to close or open. I knew that I was going to get attacked for that somehow. But I'm sick of that job and didn't care.
N assistant manager called me into her office early on into my shift. She ""politely"" berated me about how I'm limiting my time there, how I'm ""refusing"" to work Thanksgiving (I signed up for an open 4 hour shift myself) and that she had to fire a seasonal employee for not being able to work THAT ONE DAMN DAY. (I get their policy but the girl they fired was awesome and a good worker. We're also understaffed so I know it's even more stressful but she spited herself more than anything.) N A.M. then said she would have to ""extend the same to me."" I sat there, blankly staring at her. I informed her I was not limiting myself because I was spiting her or thought I was on some type of a high horse. I had things to do. Of course everyone has stuff to do on the holidays and I was just telling her of my mindset. She pretended to empathize and told me that when I'm not in school, ""she expects me to work."" So she's trying her hardest to monopolize my time. She disregards employees needs to rest in order to be able to generally function. If we have any type of free time, she jumps on it. The thing is, many of us get called off or sent home BECAUSE WE'RE OVER STAFFED FOR THAT DAY. Hell, most of the time we're overstaffed for the week. It's just a power play.
She wanted me to work Wednesday before Thanksgiving and I said I'd let her know. She also looked up my colleges vacation schedule so she could further back me into a corner.
Since that Wednesday would be my only day off for that entire week, I told her I'd have to work from home. I knew if I said I needed a day to myself or else I'd have a breakdown, she'd schedule me to work.
She called me today, while I'm working at the school and ""asked"" me if I could work that Wednesday, knowing that I said I couldn't because someone else apparently couldn't. She said it would ""be a huge favor."" And she didn't even ask me to work a short shift, but an entire shift that would take up the day. She may know I'm lying about working from home or if she doesn't, she's trying to weasel her way in so I wouldn't be able to get anything else done that I told her I had to. 
Not only is she violating boundaries, she's adding salt into the wound of calling me during my other work hours.

I called back and she was at lunch. To try to ""appease"" her, I said I could do a 5-9 and no more. Hopefully she'll realize that won't do and call it off completely. But since she hasn't called me back, I'm sure she took that and ran with it. I'm an idiot.

The thing is, the school only pays once a month and my max hours for each week is 20. The other place pays weekly. So I need the other income or else I'd be in serious trouble. I've also applied to countless other places with no luck. For right now, I'm stuck. 
I want to talk to the GM but I know N A.M. would fabricate things and end up getting ME into trouble. She's done it before. Or she would invoke sympathy and either way, make me into the culprit. 
I know I should do so anyway or even contact corporate. But the company was recently bought out by an investment firm and they're cutting even more corners now. So I know for a fact corporate will take the side of management. 

My Nmother knows how that place is and anytime I want to just quit and figure something else out, she yells about how SHE is in such a bad position and SHE is struggling. And how SHE ever so ""can't afford"" to help me out. Not that I was even asking. My misery only serves as competition for her own. Though my parents don't have a large amount of extra spending money, we certainly are not facing poverty or even close to foreclosure. We're middle class and my mother can eagerly fork over money to get herself a pedicure or random household decoration. 

I know I have to stand my ground. I shouldn't be so afraid of getting fired because I could sue over it. And since they're always so desperate for people, it's unlikely they'd fire me anyway. 

Advice? Similar experiences?

Edit: I know my parents don't care about me. I know they won't help me and ignore my pleas for some type of support. I know they'll just drown it out with screams of their own self induced misery.
I need help. I need to get out of this house and away from that awful menial job. I just don't know how. My family won't be there. I don't have enough to support myself. I don't know what to do.

3tbln0,5,2015-11-18,"The church is run by ""nice guys"" and that's a big problem.",exmophd,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/3tbln0/the_church_is_run_by_nice_guys_and_thats_a_big/,"I came across an interesting book by Robert Glover titled ""No More Mister Nice Guy."" In the first chapter he outlines the characteristics of nice guys and then what's wrong with being a nice guy. Though I can relate to some of the characteristics and negative traits most of the time I was thinking these describe the church and those that serve in it (SP, bishops, etc) quite well. Thoughts?

TL;DR - The Q15 are ""nice guys"" which is why they act like such ***holes.

P.S. Slightly NSFW

Excerpt from book:


""**Characteristics of Nice Guys**


 Every Nice Guy is unique, but all have a cluster of similar characteristics. These traits are the result of a script, often formed in childhood, that guides their lives. While other men may have one or two of these traits, Nice Guys seem to possess a significant number. 
  
* **Nice Guys are givers.** Nice Guys frequently state that it makes them feel good to give to others. These men believe their generosity is a sign of how good they are and will make other people love and appreciate them. 
* **Nice Guys fix and caretake.** If a person has a problem, has a need, is angry, depressed or sad, Nice Guys will frequently attempt to solve or fix the situation (usually without being asked). 
* **Nice Guys seek approval from others.** A universal trait of the Nice Guy Syndrome is the seeking of validation from others. Everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone's approval or avoid disapproval. This is especially true in their relationships with women. 
* **Nice Guys avoid conflict.** Nice Guys seek to keep their world smooth. To do this, they avoid doing things that might rock the boat or upset anyone. Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed. 
* **Nice Guys seek the ""right"" way to do things.** Nice Guys believe there is a key to having a happy, problem-free life. They are convinced that if they can only figure out the right way to do everything, nothing should ever go wrong. 

* **Nice Guys repress their feelings.** Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. They may see feelings as a waste of time and energy. They frequently try to keep their feelings on an even keel. Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad. 
* **Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men.** Due to their childhood conditioning, many Nice Guys have few male friends. Nice Guys frequently seek the approval of women and convince themselves they are different from other men. They like to believe that they are not selfish, angry, or abusive — traits they link to ""other"" men.
* **Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority.** These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first. They believe it is a virtue to put others' needs ahead of their own. 
* **Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center.** Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. Therefore they will often focus tremendous energy on their intimate relationships. 


**What's Wrong With Being A Nice Guy?** 


...By giving these men the label Nice Guy, I'm not so much referring to their actual behavior, but to their core belief system about themselves and the world around them. These men have been conditioned to believe that if they are ""nice,"" they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a smooth life. The term Nice Guy is actually a misnomer because Nice Guys are often anything but nice. 

Here are some Not-So-Nice Traits of Nice Guys: 

* **Nice Guys are dishonest.** These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings. These traits make Nice Guys fundamentally dishonest. 
* **Nice Guys are secretive.** Because they are so driven to seek approval, Nice Guys will hide anything that they believe might upset anyone. The Nice Guy motto is, ""If at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence."" 
* **Nice Guys are compartmentalized.** Nice Guys are adept at harmonizing contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments in their minds. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina. 

* **Nice Guys are manipulative.** Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met. Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them. 
* **Nice Guys give to get.** Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. They want to be appreciated, they want some kind of reciprocation, they want someone to stop being angry at them, etc. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return. 
* **Nice Guys are passive-aggressive.** Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again. 
* **Nice Guys are full of rage.** Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times. 
* **Nice Guys are addictive.** Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere. One of the most common addictive behaviors for Nice Guys is sexual compulsiveness. 
* **Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries.** Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying ""no,"" ""stop,"" or ""I'm going to."" They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing. 
* **Nice Guys are frequently isolated.** Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them. 
* **Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing.** This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. Unfortunately, this tendency pretty much guarantees that Nice Guys will spend most of their time putting out fires and managing crises. 
* **Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships.** Though Nice Guys often put tremendous emphasis on this part of their lives, their intimate relationships are frequently a source of struggle and frustration. For example: 
* Nice Guys are often terrible listeners because they are too busy trying to figure out how to defend themselves or fix the other person's problem. 
* Because of their fear of conflict, they are frequently dishonest and are rarely available to work all the way through a problem. 
* It is not unusual for Nice Guys to form relationships with partners whom they believe to be ""projects"" or ""diamonds in the rough."" When these projects don't polish up as expected, Nice Guys tend to blame their partner for standing in the way of their happiness. 
* **Nice Guys have issues with sexuality.** Though most Nice Guys deny having problems with sex, I have yet to meet one who isn't either dissatisfied with his sex life, has a sexual dysfunction (can't get or maintain an erection, climaxes too quickly), or has sexually acted out (through affairs, prostitution, pornography, compulsive masturbation, etc.). 
* **Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful.** The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential.""

3tbtfx,30,2015-11-18,I got to use R&amp;M reference to explain Functions to my new interns. Warning: geeky stuff,ncshooter426,rickandmorty,https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3tbtfx/i_got_to_use_rm_reference_to_explain_functions_to/,"[Geek stuff]

I've gotten a new batch of interns (well, more like shadows) who are interested in the computer field. We've been going over some of the core concepts -- threads, call stacks, etc. -- and for the most part they've gotten it. It's one thing to learn from a book, another to get practical with it :)

So today I'm sitting in the debugger looking at a sample callstack and say ""I'm Mr. Meeseeks -- Look at me!"" when the thread was created. I got some laughs, so I figured I would take it further.

""See, a function want's to do it's job and return -- like Mr. Meseeks right? Ideally, not staying alive to for too long. But what happens when My Mr Meeseeks needs to get something else done? He calls (creates) another Mr. Meeseeks"". Ok, so far so good..  ""But now -- My Mr. Meeseeks can't return until his Mr. Meseeks finishes his job right? So each thing we see here on the call stack is a function wanting to return -- a Mr. Meeseeks who wants to finish, but had to call someone else to (eventually) do it"".

""But what happens if the, say, 10th Mr. Meeseeks can't finish his job because Mr. Meseeks #1 has something he needs? Because of how we've called each Mr. Meseeks, #1 is waiting on #2, #2 on #3... can #1 ever finish (return) if #10 is waiting on him?"" That got them thinking. The answer was no, we're in a deadlock due to how we started the chain -- more importantly, the order in which we tried to acquire things.

In the end, I think they all got the idea... and I hope every time they see a function call they hear ""caaaaan dooo!"" in their head LOL

It's a competitive program which five interns are vying for one full time position (the first full time position that person will receive after college.)

There are currently two front runners for the position and there's about a month left until I have to make my final decision. There's Sarah, the demanding bitch of this year's intern class and daughter of our CFO. So naturally she thinks she has this job in the bag and has been acting like that since day one. She comes into the office late, usually hungover, with her designer clothes, driving her brand new Benz that Daddy bought for her, but she has been stepping up her game of late. She knows that she is in a position of power, but how will she use it to assert herself and seal the deal to get the job? Will she blackmail or threaten me to get the job or use her seductive skills to get me to say yes.

Then there is Amy. She very quiet and methodical. Comes into the office on time, puts her head down and just does her job. The problem is, she's too quiet and shy. Someone that unless you walked by her desk you wouldn't even know she was employed here. She's the preferred hire amongst many of the senior staff, I'm going to have to find ways to her to get more noticed at the firm, and in particular open up to me. She's too naive and needs some encouragement to open up and step outside the boundaries to secure this job.

Do you play Sarah or Amy? This is a current situation I'm in right now so can provide you with detailed descriptions of their bodies, looks and styles.

Looking forward to this!

3tc1le,1,2015-11-18,[EVENT] 17 Die in Shooting in Cuzco,GoonerSam,MHoCWorldPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHoCWorldPowers/comments/3tc1le/event_17_die_in_shooting_in_cuzco/,"*11:43 a.m., 27th March 2017, Cuzco:* Just 15 minutes before El Emperador would be entering the Congreso Imperial to announce the structure of the Armed Forces of the Imperio Incaico, a black van pulled up behind the car of a member of the Cámara de Diputados. 4 armed men proceeded to exit the van and shot dead the passenger, Clemente Jaime Yoshiyama Tanaka, a Fujimorist politician from Peru, and his driver.

Another three terrorists exited the van, and they forced their way into the gates of the car park below El Congreso Imperial, and proceeded to open fire, killing 3 security guards and 4 interns exiting a parked vehicle.

After heavily-armed police units were sent to deal with the insurgents, they locked themselves in a maintenance room, where they took 9 maintenance workers hostage. Every two hours, the insurgents released a hostage, then shot him in the back.

After 6 hours, the standoff ended as special forces breached a wall and forced their way into the room, at which point the insurgents killed the remaining 6 hostages, before themselves being killed by the Special Forces team.

El Emperador's speech to El Congreso Imperial went ahead, but he spoke instead of the need to oppose Marxism, and to not stand down to these terrorists, or else they will have won. He went on to announce that if the Panamanian government were found to have funded this attack as well, then he would be forced to respond with ""an overwhelming display of force"".

The Ejercito de Trabajadores Latinoamericanos (ETLA) took immediate responsibility for the attacks, and within hours Incan intelligence services revealed that they had secured a paper trail linking the funding of the ETLA to the Panamanian government.

*10:00 a.m., 28th March 2017, Cuzco:* El Emperador once again travelled to El Congreso Imperial, this time addressing El Senado. He assured Senadores that once the affairs of the Armed Forces were in order, that a measured and just response would be made, that would demonstrate to the world and to Marxists that El Imperio Incaico was a force to be feared. He also announced the raids of 5 ETLA bases, and that Jorge Diaz, the captured leader of the now eradicated ETC, had been found guilty of terrorism and treason by the Corte Suprema de Justicia del Imperio Incaico, and that he had been sentenced to death by beheading, and that El Emperador, as head of the Executive, would himself enforce this ruling.

3tcd1b,70,2015-11-18,Finally got an offer!,surfinfan21,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/3tcd1b/finally_got_an_offer/,"Tl;dr: Hang in there, the process is miserable, long and stressful. 

I just wanted to do a write up of my process in finding a job. I know the market is really tough out there and it has been very frustrating for most of us. I wanted to share my experience with soon to be graduates and people still looking as a means to relate or maybe provide an ounce of motivation. Even if it helps one person that would be great. I'm not a professional or anything and it took me almost 6 months to find a job, but maybe you can learn from my mistakes.  

School: Strong regional TTT, top 1/3 of my class, Law Review
Job: Small Firm 10-15 attorneys; Rural.
Experience: Two judicial internships, personal injury firm

I've been job hunting and interviewing since my last semester of law school. My first interview was for a clerkship in my state's highest court back in February of 2015. Went through four rounds of interview to the final round and no offer. A couple smaller clerkships and still no offer.

Applied to some jobs during bar study. No interviews. Stopped applying for jobs around mid June. Started aggressively applying to jobs around the second week of August. I've been applying pretty aggressively ever since. 

After a couple weeks post-bar I started to feel really lost. I actually missed studying for the bar. Not in the sense that I enjoyed studying, but I went from being fully engaged in something to not doing anything every single day. It was pretty crazy. On top of that there were only so many jobs to apply for each day. Many days there were no new jobs. 

Someone on reddit recommended that I volunteer somewhere. The last week of August I began volunteering at a local court in a large city. I am actually still there and assist pro se litigants file Family Law documents with the court. Family law was one of the only areas I didn't study in law school but while studying for the bar I actually found it sort of interesting. Anyway I was getting a lot of practical experience filing documents in court and doing things law firms generally need you to do. In my opinion one of the reasons why law firms are hesitant hiring new grads is because they may ""know the law"" but they don't know how to do things like file a divorce with the court. 

In the middle of September I actually started working nights (4pm-10pm) at a Pizza shop. Just trying to make enough money to pay for rent. It was miserable. 

I continued to apply to jobs and a lot of places were ""JD advantage"" jobs, In-house counsel jobs, and compliance positions at various banks. Still Nothing. 

Then August came and went, no interviews. Then September came and went, no interviews. Then mid October ---- Bar Results! This is where things sortof turned around. I was lucky enough to pass on my first attempt. 

After I got my bar results and added that to my resume I actually had about 10 interviews. All of the interviews were with firms. And almost all the firm's area of focus was family law. 

All in all I applied to 120 positions. Had about 15 interviews in total and took 6 months to find a job. 

I attribute most of my success to my volunteer experience. I didn't do any networking. I know a lot of people highly recommend networking and I am not dismissing it. I just simply didn't have time to network with volunteering and working part time. I went to two or three networking events but it was mainly other unemployed recent grads talking about how difficult the bar exam was. To be honest it was fun bitching about it with new faces but it didn't help me this particular time. I also only recently joined my local bar organization and I actually see that being very helpful had I gone to more events. I went to one and met a couple attorneys in my given field that I stayed in contact with. 

I'm just so happy right now that things are finally coming together after things looked pretty shitty for a while. It's not easy out there and you gotta bust your ass. There's no doubt about that. If anyone has any questions feel free to PM me."

I graduated seven years ago. At 29, I have never had a office job or internship. I didn't not have a functional resume until 2 years ago and it was mostly padding babysitting/eldercare.
I'm looking for part time jobs now in offices that advertise for entry level admin, part-time, HR, business, communications--not only does my lack of office experience or experience with the sorts of software they need applied hurt me....I am a fraud in interview after interview.
I smile; I try to dress professionally; I am as positive and specific as I can be. It's as well as I can do.
Each temping agency interview, each interview with a man, and Jesus Christ, each start-up--it's all...it's horrible. It's being a ridiculous, homely, incompetent little girl, being identified as such within five minutes, slurring word, mispronouncing, desperate. Trying to seem poised but unafraid.
It's also just leaving one's body and realizing in that moment how ridiculous one is for interviewing with ""x"" company, in ""y"" field. ""Why do you want to work here? Why does someone like you want to work here? How could you possibly be useful?""
I have nothing of value to offer anyone. I know it. So do they.

I am professionally and in terms of skills where it is acceptable to be if I were 18, and this were 2009.
Each professional failure is just....it's a general failure. I can't compartmentalize it; and if the rejection is from someone I can't help but find attractive, the shitty thing is, of course I can't resist taking it personally as a human being. 

Men want smart, pretty, confident women working for them. I am none of those things. I am distinctively INcompetent and inexperienced and cannot absolve myself of that either. 

I needed to vent. I can't tell anyone else, they don't know what it's like. This is fundamental rejection over and over by a world of distinctive, attractive, confident people. I am none of those things. I never have been. The self-loathing, low energy, and anxiety 80% attributable to acne and discomfort in my own skin/around other people kept me from even trying. Now I am; and it's way, way too late. WAY too late.

It's hurtful.

And the reason I'm bringing it up here is because I see everything about me as to why I have difficulty making friends or enjoying being around people; why my interests dwindle; why I am not just overwhelmed but--frankly--frightened in an age when having no identity that can be framed in positive terms and dressed up, worn with pride, comes with professional and personal costs that increase with time. I see being FA and what leads to it as touching all parts of one's existence in a continuum, staining every part of consciousness, every hope, all the memories, every goal. 

It's also for the simple fact that I would like to be able to sit in front of an attractive, authoritative person that says, ""You have to be happy, competent, and confident to work for me"" say, ""I am, (I am useful, I have value, I have a purpose)"", and both of us believe it.

I go for interviews among attractive, well-dressed, confident people with passion hoping to be accepted and the self-worth to pursue those things....and feel like an animal slinking around hoping not to get struck or caught. Or skinned.

And then I look back on my life and try to identify a time I ever felt my age, or on par with my peers.

I hate the power men hold over me in general. 

Can anyone relate to anything here. 

I'm sure pretty women get dismissed as stupid sometimes, of course, but without question, so long as they are also basically competent--they can go for miles and miles. People want them around. People that can smile easily, aren't preoccupied with shame or awkwardness, with self-loathing, with discomfort in their bodies....they can do so much more than I can or fake it. There is NOTHING people like more than a smart, pretty young woman. Anywhere. And she can keep exploring and gaining experiences and building on what she starts with, passing through every open door and bringing it to the next person she tries to impress, the next challenge. 


It would be bad at 24, but it is so very painful now, at 29, when I know I am too old to be this way. Feel like this. Have this little to show. "
3tcy2m,11,2015-11-18,Have I (M 26) just been issued an ultimatium from my GF (24) ?,crazytom57,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3tcy2m/have_i_m_26_just_been_issued_an_ultimatium_from/,"Relationship background: My GF and I have been together nearly 5.5 years, first doing 3 years of distance between Austria and the US (I studied/worked in the US and she studied in Austria), then 1 year of Minnesota to Chicago (via her study abroad), and now here we are at over a year of Frankfurt DE to Graz Austria (my company was able to transfer me to our Frankfurt office, which is rare at a young age.  The reason for the continued distance being that my GF is finishing her masters in English/German language teaching in Austria, which also required a 1 year internship in Austria, so she would be able to begin working fall of 2017.

Situation: Lately my girlfriend's anxiousness around the distance has started to get the better of her.  She constantly admits she is unhappy with her student life, rushing her normally 7+ year program into 6 forces her to skip most of a social life, which she feels she has to do in order for us to be together, something I have never asked her to do because above all us I want her to be happy.  This has caused her massive amounts of stress and unhappiness (to the point where she can only relax when she is asleep).  As I mentioned above, I was able to get a transfer in my company to Germany, where we can now see each other 1-2 a month as opposed to 1-2 times a year.  However, to her Germany was not acceptable as it was not Austria, not close enough.  I have tried to explain that for non-German speakers, it is very hard to get a job in a country as small as Austria compared to Germany, which does very little for her to accept the situation.      

Ultimatium(?): The contract with my company in Germany runs out in September 2016, at which time I can decide to stay for longer in Frankfurt or not.  At the same time, my girlfriend begins her internship, which must be in Austria for her to get her degree.  She has told me that she cannot do the distance any longer past Sept 2016 and is ""really hoping"" I can get moved somewhere closer (either in Austria with another company, or to our smaller, newer office in Munich), and she ""really hopes"" I understand how much this means to her.  

Am I understanding her correclty that she will leave me if I do not move? I reallllly hope not as I do not belive ultimatiums to be healthy for relationships.  

Me moving to Germany was already a great stroke of luck, given how rare moving people my age are, getting moved again to Munich would be great, but I do not know if there is an opportunity there - so this is a big unknown.  Trying to get into Austria presents its own problems with breaking into a new company, especially when my German is only intermediate at best - an even more unlikely unknown.  Quitting my job (to me at least) is not an option as I would lose my visa immediately, as well as a job at a company I really like (no matter which office).  

I try to keep her hopes up, and I honestly mean it when I will try my best to get closer but I know in the back of my if I tell her the reality I'm scared she""ll end it now.  She's very emotionaly sensitive with these kinds of things.  

I love my GF more than anything and would hate to lose her over stress and her unhappiness.  Is there anything I can do to salvage things over the next year? Appreciate the advice.  "
3tczge,38,2015-11-18,I'm glad I found this place.,LivingAdventures,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/3tczge/im_glad_i_found_this_place/,"Hey All!

So I discovered this sub about two weeks ago. This place makes me feel just a little bit better about my situation.

I graduated college in May with a degree in Emergency Management. Now, you guessed it, I can't find a job. I feel like I was lied to all throughout college. Professors and guest speakers would say ""this field is booming! You guys are the future of the field and so many jobs are out there!"" This is actually what got me hooked as a Freshman. Plus, I like the field.

I worked my ass off in college. I studied weeks before an exam, I did papers weeks in advance, I joined my major's student group (and held a leadership position in it), and I went to conferences and field trips. To top it all off, I had a great (unpaid) internship this past Spring. They loved me and said they would make every effort to hire me. I went to graduation, heard the motivational speeches, got my diploma, and was ready to work.

About a month after graduation, I learned the department I interned for had been eliminated. There was no chance of me going back. ""No problem"" I thought, I'm sure I can find something pretty quick. It's been seven months since my internship ended, six since graduation, and nothing. I was promised an interview with a city office, they never called. I emailed every contact I have with a resume, no response or ""I'll let you know if I see something"". I could rant about how picky employers are, and how there are no entry level jobs, but I think everyone is in the same boat as far as that's concerned!

It's funny, every day we hear ""the economy is coming back"" or ""There were ______ jobs created last month"". What the media doesn't say is that the jobs report doesn't count those who have given up, and the new jobs are probably all retail. I do not believe for a second that we are in an economic recovery.

I love the name of this sub. We are truly a lost generation. Some people older than us (like my parents) understand our struggle, but many don't. I will say I am very fortunate to have very little debt thanks to my parents and grandparents. I can't imagine what most of you must feel like, so I definately count my blessings. Also, the holidays are coming up. The time of year where we all get together with extended family. For the first time in my life, I'll have to tell them things are not going well.

Sorry for the long post, but I just needed to vent/share my story with someone. In dark times, there is always hope. I'm going to keep holding on to that little sliver of hope. Have a good night!"

3td6v9,42,2015-11-18,My spoilt housemates ganged up to kick me out - hear me vent,glitter_quitter,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/3td6v9/my_spoilt_housemates_ganged_up_to_kick_me_out/,"The moral of my story is: always trust your instincts. When I left uni one of my housemates at the time invited me to rent a room in her parents' London flat. the rent for the location was amazingly cheap and I wouldn't have to pay a deposit, so I said yes. That's when the trouble began. 

Let's call this housemate Princess Penny. PP immediately tells me that I have to take the smallest room in the flat, because she wants the master room and the other girl she has invited to rent with us (Negative Nora, more on her later) has so many possessions she needs the second largest room. She also tells me she doesn't want my boyfriend over every weekend (a weird request as we are in a LDR and rarely if ever get a whole weekend together). Red flags but I'm committed and already have a job in the city.

Upon moving in, we all promise PP's mother that we will be good tenants and under no circumstances allow the house to become a crash pad for drunk friends. The sofa is not for sleeping on. We all agree and settle into happy flatmate life for a few months.

Pretty soon, a pattern of PP letting people crash all over the house on Friday and Saturday nights develops. My clean sheets are taken from cupboards and used as bedding, people are passed out on the sofa and the floor. On one occasion the front door is left wide open after they come home from a night out, and NN had left my laptop that I lent her right on the table by the door. On another, PP comes home so drunk she has to have the doorman let her in as she has lost her whole bag including her keys and ID, so we also had to get the locks changed.

Apart from saying that we should all remain vigilant about locked doors I don't say anything. I'm aware that it is her parents flat at the end of the day and even though I'm paying £650 a month plus bills I don't feel like I have final say in house rules. 

Then I start to find out that, when I leave town on a weekend to visit family or my boyfriend, PP has let herself or her friends sleep in my bed, effectively using it as her spare room. Without asking, changing the sheets or on occasion even telling me afterwards. At this point I snap and tell her this behaviour is not cool. She reacts by getting offended at my accusing her of not treating me with respect and consideration as a friend and a housemate. 

She retaliates by making me ask her every time my boyfriend visits if he can stay and when he does come over being so rude to him that we both only feel comfortable staying in my room together. The final straw comes when I text and ask her if she minds that my boyfriend does some laundry at the flat. We are both going on holiday and his washing machine had just broken. I thought it was only polite as she was partying at a music festival. So when she didn't reply and NN told me that she was going to wash her muddy clothes at her parents and that I should do the washing...I did it. PP comes home at 11pm and throws a shit fit that there isn't a spare drying rack for her to hang her single, wet jumper from. The next day we have a big fight about the way she's made me feel and she breaks down crying and we awkwardly make up. I come back from holiday and spend two weeks house sitting for family and by then it seems to have blown over. I chalk it up to PP being pretty spoilt and immature and simply unaware of what it means to spend £8k of your pitiful graduate salary on accommodation. 

PP comes from enormous wealth. Her family have a huge country residence and multiple city properties. Her father is paying for her Masters degree and giving her a monthly allowance. She has never had to work a full time job or pay her own bills. But that doesn't make her a bad person, right?

But just as the issues with PP calm down (she's too busy with finishing her degree and then afterwards applying for jobs to party much), NN kicks it up a notch. NN is the most bland, negative, soul sucking person you could meet. She literally stomps or slobs about the flat, constantly complaining about how tired she is, how she hates her internship / being unemployed, moaning that she can't find passion in her life. She is also having her rent paid by her parents, who have also paid off all her student debt as a graduation present. You would think having all that money to pursue your dreams would make you happy, but NN does not have dreams.

NN is the kind of person who if she doesn't like your idea for a plan, say for frequenting a particular bar or nightclub, will shoot down your idea. And your next, and the one after that. She never gives a valid reason, and never comes up with her own idea. She just sucks the fun out of every situation. A literal human fun sponge. 

NN is obsessed with sleep. She requires absolute silence in the flat from 10pm onwards. If you dare to make a cup of tea or quietly talk in the living room she will come out and open and slam the door shut in a passive aggressive way, then leave a note on facebook reminding everyone to be quiet in the evenings as she has to get up early (no earlier than me, we work the same hours). She is a light sleeper, but has made no attempt to sound proof her room with a draft excluder, use a fan / white noise machine, or try earplugs. We live in a huge apartment block in the middle of a massive city, so more often than not it's our neighbours making a racket or sirens that keep her up, but that doesn't stop her taking it out on me by bending my ear about how tiiiirrrrreeeeeeddddd she is all the time. She also gets up to pee on avg 5 times during the night, often until about 1am. As the bathroom is right by my bed in my tiny room this often wakes me up, but I figure sharing a flat is all about give and take and I'm an easy sleeper so hey, no harm. 

She has recently started to consider quitting her job so she could apply for grad schemes (and find this missing passion in her life). Her parents are very willing to support her quitting and have offered to financially support her if she does so. At the moment she is doing ""research"" or actual applications every weekend. 

This means the noise curfew has extended to cover the entire weekend. No listening to music, no watching the game, no having a friend over to chat. She will sometimes go to a cafe to work only to come back and complain that it was too noisy there. We live in a HUGE city but NN cannot apparently locate a library or get her parents to buy her a desk for her massive room so she can shut the door and work in peace. Instead she commandeers the entire open plan communal space so she can work at the only table in the house - the dining table. She also bombards me during the week with texts and messages asking for my exact weekend plans so she can then ask me to be quiet if I say I'm doing something in the flat. Not that this stops her from still going out and coming home at 3am with a strange guy and waking me up on a saturday night, though. 

Last week I finally plucked up the courage to reply to her latest passive aggressive facebook post in a private message. I apologised for making a cup of tea  after she had gone to bed the night before, but said that we needed to talk about how the 10pm curfew (which I had accepted) seemed to have extended to the weekend. As she plans to be doing applications for months, it seems crazy that the communal areas remain silent just because she says so. She immediately loses it, tells me to eff off, says that I'm being unreasonable, can't compromise, want it to be noisy all the time etc. I tell her I didn't mean it to get this confrontational and that we should all sit down as a flat and talk about it when I get back from visiting family.

I get back, we are all friendly with each other, a week goes by. NN is taking time off from work to apply for schemes, PP is also home working on job applications. (note: the entire 14 months we have lived together I have worked the entire time, once for 6 months without a single holiday day, temping, interning and finally getting a coveted junior position in my very competitive industry, applying for jobs in my spare time whilst maintaining a LT relationship. My parents are darling and supportive but cannot help me financially and I am very proud to have become financially independent of them. PP has never had a real job, NN has only been in hers for a few months and isn't permanent yet, and neither have ever had a romantic relationship longer than a week).

Last Friday, NN posts on facebook that we should have a flat meeting as it is ""long overdue"". PP likes it. I get home, we all cook dinner together and I offer to go buy wine. PP insists on rushing out to buy a bottle instead. We all sit down to eat. PP then launches into a speech about how there has been **tension** in the house for a while and she doesn't know what to do. NN chimes in that she's just **not happy** right now. I apologise and ask if there's anything I can do, an agreement we can come to etc. PP says no, and another thing, she doesn't like my boyfriend and he can't stay over any more. She says she knows he is nice and I love him but she just doesn't want him around. At this point I realise two things:

1) Someone I though of as a friend up until now is actually a huge snob (I'm biased, but my partner is a lovely, kind man who has done very well for himself despite never having private education, a degree or parents who could fund him into his mid twenties)

2) These two have clearly been plotting to get me out of the flat for a while and have stitched me up royally.

I calmly ask them eye to eye if they are asking me to leave. They squirm and wriggle and say that they simply see no alternative. I quietly excuse myself, go to my room, pack an overnight bag and prepare to leave for the weekend so I don't have to be near them. I couldn't trust myself not to say things I would regret. When they realise I am going PP breaks down, starts crying and shaking and rocking in a ball saying I'm her best and oldest friend. NN starts begging me not to hate her. I start crying from the stress and make to leave, but not before PP insists on hugging me.

It's been a week now. I have handed in my notice to the landlord, Daddy PP. Thankfully I drew up a contract for Daddy PP and me to sign agreeing to 4 weeks notice either way before I moved in. I am being civil to PP and NN to avoid any more drama, but I secretly can't wait to cut them out of my life. 

I feel sad to have found that two friends I thought were nice were actually fake and full of spite. I am ashamed that I am the housemate who is being kicked out. Three is a crowd and I realise now that they are both unhappy people who have conspired to make me the scape goat for their unhappiness. I can now see a pattern with PP where she routinely dumps old friend for shinier, new ones, and now I realise she was behind all the tension in our shared house with 3 others at uni. I still feel like a loser, though.

So, Reddit, what is the verdict? Am I a loser with a chip on her shoulder because her rich housemates have it all? Or am I living with two sociopaths?

tl;dr: My flatmates haven't liked my calling them out on bad behaviour but like to make up increasingly ridiculous rules to make my life uncomfortable. It's culminated in me being ganged up on and pushed out by people I once considered friends

EDIT: They way I wrote this makes it seem like I'm pissed about how wealthy they are in comparison, but I actually just meant to bring it up as one of the most reasonable explanations I can think of for why they behave so badly."
3td8rc,3,2015-11-18,I'm having trouble getting my dad to understand that my BPD is actually *that* bad. Any tips for getting through to him?,highshine,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3td8rc/im_having_trouble_getting_my_dad_to_understand/,"For most of my life, I've been very high-functioning, and high-achieving.  I'd had episodes of depression, and looking back now, obvious signs of BPD, but I had no idea what that was, and nobody else picked up on it.  Again, high-functioning, so I was just ""spontaneous"" or ""a bit dramatic"", not mentally ill.

Trying and failing to finish my MA caused that to change, and for the BPD to *really* show up in full force.  Compared to how I used to be, I am now low-functioning, and have a very hard time handling things like school or a job.  I dropped out of university for good about 2 years ago, and I've never had a full-time job, as I was otherwise a full-time student.  The last part-time job I had was almost 6 years ago.

I'm currently on unemployment benefits, and one of the programmes on offer to get back into the workforce involves taking classes at an adult learning centre.  I had originally signed up for two classes, each lasting 2 hrs, so 4 hrs a week total. Super, super low-key, no mandatory attendance, even - just call and let them know you won't be there. It turns out that that was waaaaaaay more than I could handle, and my anxiety went through the roof.  I had a massive emotional freak-out, and was basically a mess for about two weeks straight.  I was allowed to cut back to just one class a week, and I spoke with my co-ordinator about slowing down my programme (the idea was to get into an internship soon).

I told my dad about all this, and he thinks it's ridiculous that the programme doesn't force participants to attend classes, but rather ""wraps them up in cotton wool"" and coddles them by allowing them to avoid difficulties.  According to him, life isn't supposed to be easy, so ""running away"" and not just forging ahead is a cop-out.  Basically, I need to ""pull myself together"" and just go through with the classes, whether they send me into a debilitating emotional tailspin or not.

Now, I can kind of see his point, that going ahead with the programme and getting back on my feet is the ultimate goal, and I should do everything the programme says, but on the other hand, as things stand now, that would mess me up pretty badly, as has already happened.  I don't feel ready to take those steps at all.

I don't think my dad really gets just how bad my BPD can get, or how even tiny, tiny, seemingly insignificant things can fuck me up for ages.  I think he may still be stuck with the image of me as high-functioning, and doesn't get that that person is long gone.

I've tried to explain to him exactly what goes through my mind when I have an emotional crisis, and what causes it, and which underlying feelings (most often zero self esteem and fear of failure) are there, and why those feelings make me not able to go through with things that would be child's play to a healthy person, but it seems like the whole ""buck up and just deal with it"" mentality he has just won't budge.

He has said that the reason he's super frustrated is not because he wants to pressure me, but because he wants to see me feeling better and on my feet again.  I get that it's hard to see your kid suffering, but I don't think ignoring warning signs like massive anxiety is the way forward.

Does anybody have any advice as to how I can get through to my dad that I just can't ""power through"" and ignore the huge emotional toll that the classes and/or employment stuff has on me?

**TL;DR: MY DAD WANTS ME TO MOVE FORWARD AND GET A JOB, BUT DOESN'T GET THAT I'M NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR THAT YET.  HOW DO I TELL HIM THAT I CAN'T JUST ""BUCK UP""?**

This is my first time posting on this sub, so please excuse any ignorance that comes along with it!

I accepted a full-time job that will be paying $45,000/yr (a large step up from my part time $9.50/hr internship!) but the only pitfall is that the job is a bit of a commute. In normal traffic, it is about an hour drive but, during rush hour, I'm told this commute can easily be 1.5 to 2 hours from where I am currently living. While I don't mind this commute for the short term, I would like to move closer when I get financially settled.

Right now I am living with my parents and do not have many expenses. With bills alone I am paying about $180 a month, though I am also paying off a few debts. I have figured up a budget over the next few months after I start the new job to knock out all of my debts by the end of March. After that, I am hoping to find an apartment closer to my new job.

Having only lived with my parents, I'm not too sure on where to begin in pricing apartments. From what I am seeing, I'm looking around $950/month for apartments around the area (i.e., within a 30 minute drive).

I am not too sure how well I will be able to budget that expense having no experience living in such a situation. For instance, one of the apartments I have my eye on is $957/month with Internet and ""some utilities"" included, along with a washer, dryer, and other common utilities. I'm not sure how to budget for electricity, food, and other common services and, with that said, if that is an affordable option for me.

A few points I would like to point out:

* T.V. is not a necessity at all
* Internet on the other hand, is very important to me
* I plan on being debt free when I do move
* I will have a fair bit of help furniture wise
* I can cut off a few of my bills, but I would rather keep what services I do have.
* Living in small spaces is not a problem with me but, I would prefer to have a bedroom with a separate office (2 bedrooms). That's not necessarily a deal breaker though.
* I will be living alone

What advice do you guys have for me, and what should be my next steps in planning this venture? Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

For some reason, I'm still not over him. He is dating someone else, he is happy. But why am I not happy? Why do I still constantly think about him and mourn over him and the end of our relationship? Why does he keep popping into my mind every second when I don't even talk to him anymore?

This summer, I was exhausted and fed up with feeling the way I do so I tried to over-medicate. I just wanted to sleep, but I also knew that taking a lot of medication could have life threatening effects. Long story short, I was briefly hospitalized.

I've been searching for professional help and while I have a DNP and medication, I cannot find a proper therapist. I've had to move to a different state for a 3 month internship and it took me 5 weeks to find a therapist, and we didn't click. Now I'm moving back to my home state and hopefully I'll find a therapist.

I'm just so tired and frustrated of feeling this way. I just want to know what it feels like to be happy again. Can someone suggest something that has helped them overcome similar feelings? Does anyone have any advice to turn my mind off of my ex? I've tried meditation, podcasts, reading, tv.......The thoughts won't stop!"
3teak1,2,2015-11-19,My Idea of god in the self,redditusernaut,RationalPsychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/3teak1/my_idea_of_god_in_the_self/,"Ive pondered on the idea of the self- our ego, our belief system- and how it relates to the aspect of 'god'. First I would like to define my idea of the word god. I believe that religions have thrown around the word 'god' in many different ways that the idea of it has changed over the future. God is not external to you. It is the idea of consciousness beyond the 'self'. It is what connects all of us. Strip down the layers to our ego and we will all have this selfless consciousness, that doesn't compare and contrast, define- that just is always there. It is the main ingredient that we all have that keeps us alive.

I believe that the reason people defined god as something external is because we have an ego. Our ego is the bulk of our particular consciousness, and what it does is relates external happens to your physical body. Relates everything so you can constantly build a distinction between stimuli and how it relates to your self. it some what has a constant narrator to things, and that is what we define the voice in our head. Due to consciousness being beyond the self, and we are conscious, we can go within (outside of the self- in the now), and momentarily experience consciousness beyond the self. This would be like a spiritual experience. How do you define it? As god. Because we are in a habit of defining things with respects to ourselves. since we eternize it (from us) we separate it from us (when it is really within us). We have no other way of defining it. It just is. We are part of it.

With our ego- our belief system- we are our own subjective  experience of the god. We each have it within us, but one needs to be in the moment to experience it. When you are in the moment  experiencing consciousness without the self, it is bliss. It prevents you from acting on emotion, and just be alive, in your own way. You have more freedom of choice due to less emotional acting. Emotion drives thought

The human condition is us, detecting sensory info and utilizing that to experience. We form a belief system and that is what guides actions.  Our future selves are determined on actions-movements and  thought- that creates happenings, events. At any instantaneous future selves, there are a infinite amount of selves. We experience One version out of an infinite amount. Each future selves are based on a probability frame work. There is a certain probability of particular events happening- most more probable then others. What our egos do, and our experience here does, is experience our (one) particular selves of infinite events (I would relate this to god as well. Its infinite). The beliefs we form during our waking time adjusts the probabilities of of our future selves. We are all one, we are just experiencing a subjective experience of god. 

The actions you do everyday, determine your future, it makes certain events more probable, and whatever you experience you make beliefs on that and new set of probability events that could occur. This probability of the self extends all the way until your death. The probability of future events constantly changes during every instantaneous experience (which occurs as fast as our brains detect/experience). Considering this, Every action I take I *try* to think rationally about what cascade of events happen with each action/thought/belief. Lets say that if I want to become a doctor, then what actions during each second/day in order to achieve that goal? Would injecting heroine get me to that goal?  it would make it very unlikely. That would cascade certain (perceivably negative) events to occur that is not congruent with my goal. It would adjust my probability frame work (its algorithm) to make more events such as substance addiction, cravings, irrational doings to get those cravings, more probable. That would distract me with my studies and self improvement that would make my main goal more probable. One can do this (be with one, to determine rationally what actions may lead to what), and utilize it to reach a goal. Emotions are what make you off course, the cause you to react within (experience) anger, anxiety, that leads actions . Am I controlled with my emotions? I stub my toe, get jealous, angry, anxious and that makes me experience thoughts that predetermine (to an extent) future events (that will be more relatable to those negative events).

To be within god **(or closest to it)**, is to act with freedom of choice. Its the feeling of reaction beyond the self. Purposeless action, experiencing.

I think environment influences the belief system, because the belief system is your ego, which is a representation of yourself in respects to the environment ...  But does it have too? 

I think it literally is everything and it is the universes purpose for us. All we have to do is experience life, no pressure . Whether our culture makes the experience with love or war it's up to us. That's why anything is possibly. Culture and society it's self has a probability network- that we are within, experiencing within our culture has set long term. This is the "" deeper layer of association"" We are influenced subconsciously by our culture therefor it influences us ... Culture has its own ego in a sense. Culture is a collection of beliefs collected from all of history (all the way down to formation of plant life etc) and has its own probability-set in mind. So are we controlled by culture ? Do we have free will, with ourselves being born within culturally engraved belief system? I would like to define culture as our story. What we have experienced all the way up to the beginning of life. It is its own entity and we are subjective manifestations of it. Just adding to its experience, history, probability network. We can influence culture with our own beliefs by adjusting probability. This the solution is to always be positive and show love. The more positive actions we make, that will make history, and our culture (story) can be up to us.

I envisioned this oneness, seen the part of experience in terms of probabilities and how they are related to human experience. It constantly changes...w just like us. It moves towards its own random direction. This is what I call the source, this is what god is- conscious experience outside the self. Something that we all have and are part of. I seen where our culture was at, and where subjective beings were at , and I felt where we were going. It was a very synchronized feeling...

This is a idea I can constantly build on to it . I believe that we can come closer to predicting our behaviour (and to a certain extent, other people, but getting to know their belief system, and getting to know (arguable impossible within 100 percent) their behaviour based on the information u get from others and determine their probabilities within rationality. Just like how physics determines physical probability by forming equations of a certain cascade of events happening. 

To be within god, Is to have freedom of choice. thoughtless action that just happens due to fate- beyond self control. Let the probabilities take its course, and try to feel, think, act on and experience happenings in your own true way. 

To be within god, is to experience the source within you, as it is, no judgement, and be your own God- interns of determining your own fate.

There is so much to this idea, and I know I have rambled, and therefor some of my sentences may not make sense (sorry for the poor grammar), but I like philosophizing on this idea. I know that there is no scientific (proven) rational on it. In a sense it is a little bit pseudoscience- it is my own belief. Ive based it on as much rationality as I could, as it would be very hard to test. I like pondering this idea because it reminds me to always spread love, be myself, and make more positive future selves more probable of happening by doing good. Whats good for others and me. When am I thinking irrational, and acting on emotion? This brings me to the moment and allows me to act according to my grand goal. Makes me be rational in knowing what decision will give me favourable future happenings . That is a little bit like karma. *If you do good things*, your probability network (algorithm of future events) will adjust to be more positive future events, and *good things will happen*. This is more complicated because you can never determine your destiny due to other people/alive animals (living) can alter your probablitys, and all we can do is act on it in a way that'll get us back to our goal- true selves.

I will have a lot to add to it, but I would like some feedback on my thoughts. Anything constructive. I would just like to have a conversation about the idea of the god, the self, and the probability framework. I Find this idea hard to put into words, so I have used god maybe in different ways, as these deeper layers of experience (individual experience, cultural experience, and infinity experiences(god)). To be with god you are always in a spectrum, To be closer with it, is to be further away from your self and more into the ""infinity"" of consciousness (selfless consciousness).

If you got this far, thank you for reading, and I am looking for reflective feedback on your thoughts on it. I know this is not in any way scientific, I just like thinking of it due to the thereuputicness of it. What I am explaining is non physical and is hard to prove- its non physical, and I think it *just is*."
3tehqz,5,2015-11-19,I [21/F] feel hopelessly lonely.,MilknBones,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tehqz/i_21f_feel_hopelessly_lonely/,"I don't know why I feel this way.

I have been on medication (escitalopram) for the past few weeks, but these feelings were present even before then.

I am a third year university student. I'm very involved with my university and am in the committee for our student run university department club. I spend time with other students and lecturers at my university often. I am almost constantly socializing if I am at university. I rather not though. It's tiring and I just want to go home.

Currently I'm working full-time on an internship at a software company. It's the only time I can focus on something else other than myself, however I get tired quickly and sometimes my work is not very challenging and I feel worn out. The people are very friendly and nice and I know some of the other interns. I act friendly too and have conversations with others but I am only acting. I often leave my desk to sit on the toilet for a few minutes just for some privacy and to close my eyes.

Even when I'm with my friends, of which I do have a few, I can never get quite into it. A lot of the time I feel like I am just acting around them and I feel empty and inauthentic.

The only real company I enjoy is when I'm with my boyfriend of one year [25/M], but he's very introverted and prefers only to see me once or twice a week. We don't talk much (in my point of view at least) on social media or texting either because he's quite busy and I can annoy him if I message him too much. I don't really speak about this matter with him because I get sensitive and he gets defensive. I just pretend that it doesn't bother me because I don't want him thinking I'm too clingy.

I don't know if we're right for each other but right now, he's the only person that I truly enjoy spending my time with and I love him. I like it when we do stuff together and when he gives me attention, but even if we are doing nothing, I prefer watching him play video games from his bed than being alone or with other people. But I feel clingy and very dependent and I don't want to be like this.

I get very sad when it's time to leave and I cry once he drops me back home.

Why do I feel so alone? But ironically, why do I not like spending time with other people apart from my boyfriend?

TL;DR: I'm sociable, moderately popular, have a boyfriend (who does need a lot of space), but not a day goes by where I don't feel lonely."
3tevc2,2,2015-11-19,"My [26M] SO [24F] of 9 months has real stress, I'm just tired",itshouldbecalledansj,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tevc2/my_26m_so_24f_of_9_months_has_real_stress_im_just/,"My SO has had a rough couple of months. First a close family member needed major surgery, then she applied for a potentially life-changing internship, then another close family member died.

We've been doing really well getting through all this. It's definitely put some strain on our relationship, especially with the distance (she lives about 4 hours away, I drive down to visit her most weekends), but we've worked through the issues that have come up and are in a really good place with our relationship.

The problem is that I'm going through a stressful time too. Not as stressful as hers, thank God, but I'm in the lame-duck period at my current job and trying to get a business off the ground while dealing with my parents' ongoing divorce. I've also been having health issues a lot this year. With the added stress of trying to be an emotional support for her, I feel like I'm reaching some kind of limit.

I'm just so tired. And I mean that in a lot more than the purely physical sense. There's so much going on, and I feel like I have so many people relying on me, and I just don't know how to handle it all anymore. I feel like if I could just get one week off from any of these things, I could get my feet back under me, but it just keeps coming. Two nights ago I found out that one of my best friends' adopted father is in the ICU, and she deserves for me to be there for her in this time of need, and I don't know if I can do it.

What I really want, more than anything, is for my SO to take care of me for a couple of days. Take the time throughout the day to text or call me and tell me that she loves me. Let me lie around the house like a lump for a weekend. Bake me cookies, hell, I don't know - just make me feel supported instead of supporting for a while. But I feel like I can't ask for these things because her stress is so much more significant than mine. ""Hey honey, I know you're still grieving, but like... my boss is sometimes mean?"" I mean come on.

What do I do, Reddit? How do I get one of these things off my shoulders for just a little while? How do I talk to my SO and get the support that I need while she still needs me to support her?

---

**tl;dr**: SO has serious stress going on. I have less serious stress but no more energy to be supportive. What do?"

I think Thailand might be the exotic choice (but maybe not really because it's such a popular tourist destination?) but maybe I'll get more from a city like Moscow? The flights are also significantly more expensive to Thailand so it'd have to be worth it.

If anyone's been to either place, or even both (not very probable, I assume) I'd love to hear what you have to say.

I've traveled to several european big cities and that's it, no experience outside of europe or in exotic places. What would you recommend? What am I maybe not considering? What would surprise me?

3tgezx,36,2015-11-19,"Catch the Fish, Eat the Fish",pildorasamargas,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3tgezx/catch_the_fish_eat_the_fish/,"Hi all, I just got beebopped with some baby flair (thanks to whoever/however that happened!) and it made me feel comfortable enough to share a general RPW-ism musing of mine. It's not a field report per se (though I feel some anecdotal ~~humble~~brags about my SO coming up). 

""Catch the Fish, Eat the Fish"" is something my SO and I say to one another constantly. I'll explain what it started out meaning, but it's taken on a life of its own and I feel like it reinforces a lot of great values in many of aspects of our relationship. 

SO is a country boy at heart, and I'm a bit of a hippie as he calls me (I so disagree but that's another story!) We are very different on about every level, but one thing we have in common is the desire to put on our suits and do good and honest work we can be proud of. We're your normal white collar couple, and we look like our lifestyle is a normal white collar life. I'm sure there are plenty who would be shocked to see us put on our knee-high galoshes and shlup around river banks to catch ""ditch pickles"" as my SO so eloquently calls the bass haha. 

Being his country boy self, he's taught me a lot about not wanting for things you don't need. I'm not high maintenance or materialistic, but I have more than my fair share of useless vices. For over the year I've known him, he's never wavered from saying his life goal is to catch the fish and eat the fish. He doesn't want a big house, or a fancy car (well, a nice truck covered in mud probably), or much of anything. He would be happiest fishing for his food, and enjoying his fishing and enjoying his food. It's the little things. 

These days when things get stressful, or he's taking a business risk, we just say ""catch the fish, eat the fish"" which is now our unofficial code for ""honey if this all goes to hell in a hand-basket, it don't cost much to kill your own food"" and know that we will still be happy. 

Our joke is one day we will either make it rich enough to be able to afford to do nothing but sit around and fish all day, or we'll be so broke we have to fish all day to survive. But our best case and worst case scenario is exactly the same which is a very peaceful feeling. 

Yesterday we got some ecstatic and unbelievable news. He owns his own consulting firm in his industry, which he stated off working in as an unpaid intern when he was 17 or so. He dropped out of college. And he's just a simple redneck (his words not mine - he wears a suit and the gold diggers stalk silently in the shadows). Anyway he started his business in March of this year, and has had 3-4 contracts so far, one of which had a $150k budget that is exclusively his to manage. His salary is a little over 1/3 of that budget. Yesterday, he got a call for another contract 500 miles from where he lives now. He almost said no -- but they offered to match his current salary...While he remains with his other contract. 

We're both at a loss for words. 

But I went through a really interesting few stages when I heard the news (some of which a long time in the making) and my brain almost short circuited. It was easy to almost let myself get carried away, but I think there is value for a lot of us in keeping our eye on the ball:

Being with a guy who, IMO was always bound for success, but didn't make much (he had about $500 left when he started his company)...this whole thing is like a bizarre dream and I caught myself seeing it like a lottery ticket. I'm sure I'm not the first lady on this sub to begin a relationship with a man who later turned his promise into progress. Just because you never dated him for his money (especially if there was none), doesn't mean you can't lose site of what's important when the money (or any good fortune) shows up. And frankly, my initial reaction wasn't dollar signs in my eyes or new jewelry -- it was just stability, which is something we haven't had in a while.  

This is one of the first times I saw a really big fat hamster ready to take off and pulled it back by the tail and squished it. 

What's happening is amazing, but this is not how things will always be. A good year is not a lifelong promise of stability and minimal financial worries. What's happening in *your* life may be amazing, or unamazing, but it's not how things will always be. We can all invest and proceed wisely, and it may go well. But seriously who knows? For better or worse, everything is temporary. As a rule of thumb, fortune that comes fast leaves quick. 

But we can always catch the fish and eat the fish. 

As unexpected as this 100% increase in income was, one day it could be an unexpected 100% loss of income. Easily. Life is just a game of roulette anyway. One of the first things he said was:

&gt; Catch the fish may come sooner than expected...

Maybe it is. Or maybe it's not. The only thing that matters is recognizing this too shall pass. Even the good stuff passes, so make sure your relationship's happiness isn't contingent on the good stuff. 

My response? It felt like the first time I was seeing the positive effects of practicing RPW habits applied to an actually significant event and not a small daily challenge. 

&gt; I will catch the fish with you for all the days. Whether we are catching them because we can relax and afford to catch them, or we are catching them because we can't survive and afford other food d:

And that's a conscious decision. It's a decision every day to remember that the man you are dating is not his good fortune, or his bad fortune. He's just a man who works hard and is worth valuing whether that work pays off or not. I know being broke isn't the whimsical Hollywood fairytale we get fed, but it's a good feeling to know the decision to be happy is already made if it ever happens.

Catch the fish, and eat the fish, and revel in being able to do it together. 

***

I hope there is some value in attitude and perspectives to be found here! Criticism welcome but try and be gentle (: Seeing the positive side of every situation is my personal project right now, as like most humans I gravitate toward worrying about the negatives. 

And a big thank you to every one of you. We are honestly all like a giant feedback loop of learned graciousness and I can't put to words how invaluable this community is in reinforcing that positivity. "

Help?",strawberry-blond,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3thnd5/me_23_m_with_my_coworker_mid20s_m_of_5_months/,"Backstory: So this is my first big-boy job out of school.  I had 5 internships over the course of my undergraduate career in a range of office environments – small business to large corporation.  I'm fairly familiar with the nuances of work relationships, however, these are uncharted waters and I'm not quite sure how to navigate them.  

I've been here about 5 months now and am finally feeling settled.  Lately things have been slow, especially as  the holidays approach. Projects I've been working on have had their timelines extended from end of Q4 to mid Q1 2016 and managers of those projects have been put on more pressing projects.  I've been proactive with trying to find more work for myself, but there just isn't anything there.  I've talked to my supervisor and there just doesn't seem to be anything... Needless to say I'm a bit bored at work.  

So now cue coworker... Things started out well.  I wouldn't say we are the best of friends, but we definitely get along – we just don't have much in common.  He is few years older than me but with the same job title.  He's also been with the company for 2 years so he is technically more ""senior"" but we do the same thing day-to-day.  

As my projects have been slowing down he's taken a keen interest in what I'm doing at work and has been making some super passive aggressive comments along the way.  Stopping by my desk and making ""tisk tisk"" noises as I read articles online.  He will ask me how the projects that have had their timelines extended are going, even though he already knows there's not much to be done on them from the team meeting we will have had earlier that day or the day before.  When I pack up just before 5 o'clock, he will remind me that the company pays me to work ""a full 8 hours.""  etc. etc.  

And yes, I've asked him multiple times if there is anything I can help him with.  The answer is always ""it would be too difficult to get you up to speed"" or ""it's easier if I do it myself.""

However, he continues to watch me and say things... What do I do?  It's getting exhausting.
  
**tl;dr**: My coworker with the same job title seems to be preoccupied with what I'm working on. How do I politely tell him to back off?"

I'm currently an intern at a software company so, I already know the answer is that it's my responsibility, but I have an opinion question for you. 

Employee Bob (me) is told to write some code that takes in x and returns y. He writes it, it works. Now, Bob is tasked to integrate that into code that his bosses, Jim, Frank, and Kelly all helped write. Unfortunately, not one of them has a full understanding of the code. So, Bob integrates it, and lo and behold it returns Z. Bob spends a full work day going through his code and it all works, but it's getting the wrong inputs. All the bosses are unhelpful and claim no responsibility, telling Bob to figure it out, each giving a different (and incorrect) theory as to what's happening. 

Who's responsibility is it to fix? 

This has happened to me an uncountable number of times, in my opinion it should never be so divided in the first place. But, it is. 

What do you think?"
3thzh2,52,2015-11-19,I feel like I'm using depression as an excuse,why-hello,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3thzh2/i_feel_like_im_using_depression_as_an_excuse/,"I've recently been diagnosed with depression and have begun regularly seeing a therapist and taking medication. I suspect that I've had mild depression for years, and recent life events just made me plunge into a more severe depression - self-harm, daily thoughts of suicide, social withdrawal (although I didn't really have much to withdraw from), the general not wanting to do anything. 

But the thing is, I still do things. I go to the classes I need to go to (mandatory attendance or exam days) and admittedly skip the rest (or, when I do go, I have trouble paying attention - it almost feels like I'm underwater and just get this distant feeling). I go to work. I basically go to things out of obligation and out of fear of the consequences if I don't go. Even though I'm struggling, I try my best to keep my grades up since that's really the only thing I've known how to do -- although as I progress through college, I realize that's not nearly enough and even my grades are suffering now. 

I guess what I struggle with is I know I'm *capable* of doing things, and I feel like it's just laziness when I go back to my room after everything, lie down, and don't do much of anything I should be doing to better myself whether it's trying to connect with professors or with friends or study or apply for internships. I feel like it's a problem with myself, and who I am, that is why I can't keep or maintain friendships, and why I'm so alone. I feel like I'm not going to amount to anything because I just don't want to put in the effort anymore and am too afraid to make that leap. 

I don't know if it's depression, or just pure laziness and lack of ambition and lack of being a good enough person for someone to want to befriend. I feel like I'm using it as an excuse-  like maybe I don't have this illness, but it's just embedded in who I am and I'm just hiding behind it now that it has a name. I realized that the thoughts of suicide are not so much about wanting to die, but are more about just not wanting to put the effort into living. I don't know if I can change, or worse yet, if I even want to change -- sometimes I just wish I could stop caring altogether, just curl up in a corner and do absolutely nothing because that's the path of least resistance.

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3tieqq/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I have searched the FAQ and still couldn't find an answer. 

I'm a college student in the US and I am looking for an internship in China. My degree is Computer Science, Mathematics, and Computer Simulation &amp; Gaming. I have been searching for a way to find an internship in China for weeks, but still haven't found anything other than ESL positions which require a one-year commitment. 

I will be studying abroad in Japan in the spring (starting in late March) so I will have the time between mid-December and mid-March to find work someplace. Instead of finding an internship in America, I wanted to see if there was a way to get an internship at a company in China. I am not fluent in Chinese so ideally it would be working at a division of an American company. Do such positions exist? How would I go about finding internships which satisfy these conditions?

3tkj34,11,2015-11-20,Which Path Should I take? Confused,cpareqtdude,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3tkj34/which_path_should_i_take_confused/,"Hello everyone, I've been stressing over this for a while now and want some advice, my parents/friends/school faculty have not been very helpful. 

Currently going to graduate without a full-time position, I will have 4 internships done upon graduation (April 2016).

I have had 2 industry accounting positions and 1 tax position at a small public firm, and going to have a 2nd internship at a 50 person firm. they normally don't hire full-time people out of undergrad (friend interned there), so afterwards I am completely on my own. 

I enjoyed working in that environment and came from a field that works 60+ hours a week year round, so I do know about the stress etc. 

People have been telling me it is difficult to get a public gig afterwards in the more national/big 4 size firms after you graduate. This is disheartening to me because I am a really hardworking person although my grades are not the best because I was working a 40 hour job while going to school full-time for a bit.

* My GPA upon graduation will be 3.39 &lt; X &lt; 3.5
* My Accounting GPA will be a 3.5 &lt; X &lt; 3.7 
* 4 Internships done, 2 public, 2 industry 
* 140 credit hours done 

So my questions is what pathway should I take? 

* Option 1: graduate &amp; just sit for CPA Exam and pass before 2017 and try to land job
* Option 2 - spend money  I don't have on MAcc and time for GMAT to get in a MAcc program with really good recruiting (this might require me to go out of state) 

* Option 3 - Delay graduation to fall semester (don't want to do this) to see one more campus recruiting cycle although it is too competitive already. 

I am leaning towards option A but people keep telling me it's difficult even to get a position afterwards completing the CPA, but I have 4 internships and don't think i'm completely useless. I am also willing to move.  

Any insight would be appreciated, thank you guys/girls.

I graduated from pharmacy school several months ago and by all standards I was on track to do the usual find a job within a couple months after passing my licensing exams and then start chipping away at my $250k student loan.  However, towards the end of my time at school I was dealing with a health issue and was contemplating just putting off my graduation for the time being, but after speaking with school counselors and my physician I decided to just rough it out and graduate as scheduled.  

Although this was great news at the time, I didn't anticipate that my illness would delay the process of finishing my licensing exams and then eventually look for a job.  I've basically had 0 income for the past 7 months while recovering and have been living off my savings from my internship while I was in school, and then small loans from family members once that ran out.  I don't want to be a burden to my family members and was wondering what type of options I have for safe/smart loans at the moment.

The type of loan I would be looking for is probably around 5-10k for living expenses which I expect to pay off within 6 months (this includes my estimate of being employed around January 2016).  If it helps my credit scores from credit karma are 781 transunion and 759 equifax.  Never in a million years would I have imagined in myself in this position but well, shit happens and I just want to make the most educated decision possible.

Last but not least, I've already handled the issues with my student loan handler.  I've consolidated my loans and am currently not expected to go into repayment until I am employed so I at least have that going for me.  Thanks in advance and I appreciate any type of help!"

I feel shame over dumping her and know I could have kept things going as it was my first TRP style relationship where I realized I was actually lovable. I had this idea in my head that I wasn't ever going to have a real relationship in the sense that the girl wouldn't be 100% sexually into me. 

I just feel like a massive beta. I'm also in this pretty shifty time in other areas of life. About to be done with school after this quarter (might not pass this prereq class with a high enough grade. 99% sure it's impossible due to my midterm grades), I think I tucked up a case study interview for the company I intern for (was looking to get hired full time). 

My mental state has been totally fucked the last 6 months since I dumped her. I wake up every morning feeling like a fuckup. I've never been so negative in my life, nor have I felt so terrible. I feel a general sense of shame about who I am. I've been lifting ever since I dumped her and lost way too much weight. Went from dad bod to now skinny fit, but too skinny I think. I was trying hard to get abs and work from there, but I just look too skinny, and people have mentioned it. 

I know I have internalized some TRP, I can give advice and I'm trying to live it myself, I just feel like I'm not making much progress.

3tlm8y,4,2015-11-20,[ROLEPLAY] A last day in the life of Pāvlis Mikulāns,Mattoni54,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/3tlm8y/roleplay_a_last_day_in_the_life_of_pāvlis_mikulāns/,"Pāvlis woke up one morning in his [small cottage](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/88/64/2886448_48bc3c84.jpg) in Jugla. He rubbed his weary eyes, and then tapped on his alarm clock. 

##MEEP! MEEP! MEEP!

""Bloody heck"", he groaned, smashing down vigorously onto the alarm. ""TURN OFF YOU PIECE OF SHIT!"", he screamed, yanking the alarm clock. It's wire knocked over the lamp, smashing on the ground, and crashing thousands of tiny shards of glass onto his foot.

He yelled in a mix of rage and terror, before snapping the wire, and chucking it out the window as far as he could. Sadly, he lived on the bottom floor, and it bounced relatively unharmed on the grass. However, the wires were not so safe. They caused an awful scene. ""Shit"", he thought to himself, as blood seeped out of his leg. He couldn't be bothered to faff about, so he squeezed the shards out of his foot. 

""I'll think about it later"", he thought to himself, as he got dressed, and rushed downstairs, grabbing the newspaper.

""Latvian tourist stabbed in Hungary"", said the headline. Pāvlis grunted, but not too loudly - he didn't want to wake his kid up. He grabbed some bread rolls, and cut them with his knife. He then stared at the wall.

His son left him 10 years ago. He was divorced for abusing his wife and children. No one ever talked to him anymore. His colleagues thought him weird, and the rest an alcoholic pisshead. He chugged his glass of water. He was alcohol free for 2 weeks, but the suicidal thoughts had lasted longer than that. He couldn't afford to die, though. His mother has a birthday coming soon. The only man left who loved him.

The only woman who made him feel like he mattered. An 82 year old hag. He laughed a demented laugh to himself, and then moped, sinking his face into his *Brötchen* from that tubby German baker down the road.

He finished his bread, brushed teeth, and then carried his suitcase to work. The ground was marshy, and wet, making his black and polished shoes all muddy. The squelching mud stained his trousers a light brown.

*""Buggar...""*, he thought, making extra sure not to sink by making longer steps.

Just then, he saw a woman across the road, seeing him walk like a pathetic cross between a Nazi and a rhinocerous with epilepsy. She pulled a face, and walked more briskly. Pāvlis was going to explain, but she got away too quickly. Instead, he finished the walk, and hopped onto the asphalt, scrubbing mud onto it, and picking a leaf from him shoe. He chucked it on the side and continued his stroll to work - if it could be called that. More like a trudge.

One in long last, Pāvlis finally entered the office building. He walked into the building, as the receptionist gave him a death glare. He walked towards the lift, but the people quickly shifted away from him. Sighing, he took the stairs.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, as Pāvlis scurried up the steps. After 3 floors, he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He was a rather older man, so he continued at a walking pace. After a few more minutes he reached your desk. Everyone was facing their desks, tapping away. Probably browsing Facebook, but he wouldn't judge. He plopped onto his desk, opened Candy Crush Saga: 8. He then opened his email.

***1 UNREAD***

He quickly tapped the message, in an excited joy.

    Dear Sir Mikulāns

    It is with a heavy heart that I regret to inform you that Elita Mikulāns, who has filed as a maternal relation, recently passed away today at 7:29. She died of a heart attack while on her bike. We will disclose more information to you soon. Please send a reply to the address in the attachment to prove you have read this.

Pāvlis stared at the screen. He stared. He stared. He then trembled. His mother. Mum, who had raised him as a small boy. Back in 2006 when he would come back from hockey, his mum would be there. Where he was bullied, his mum was there. When Dad died, she was there, and when he was divorced, Mum was there. Now Mum is gone and no one is there.

No one.

He made a little murmur, before replying:

    IS THIS A FUCKING PRANK! IT'S NOT FUNNY! BASTARD! RESPOND!

He glared at the screen.

No response yet. 

Pāvlis stood up, and kicked his chair down, garnering the interest of his coworkers around him.

""I NEED A FUCKING DRINK!"", he whimpered, nearly grabbing the intern by the collar.

""Bloody alchie..""

Pāvlis grabbed him the the mouth. ""STOP! NO! DON'T!"", he cried, chucking the man down. He rushed down the building stairs, snapping his leg, and landing on his face.

Every memory. Every love, Every loss. His life would never be the same again. He was a criminal. The world's last respects for him as a rehabilitated man had ended. Now he was drunkard grandpa. He just wanted **LOVE**. No one loved him,and no one could. Oh, who respects a 50 year old an in an AA meeting?

The boss glared at the man, and said ""Pāvlis, stop! Stop!""

And so he stopped, looking at him in the eye, with a cold, hard, icy look. 

""Stop, stop"", he said again, looking him in the eye. ""Stop. What's the problem.""

Pāvlis was shaken, and only stared, not answering.

""Are you delirious? Pāvlis! Please!""

Pāvlis stared at him, and finally nodded.

""I-I'm fine sir.""

""Well then"", replied the boss. ""Get back to work then.""

""Y-Yes Sir"", replied Pāvlis, as he went back to his walking pace, slugging up the stairs, back to an office of little pay, to workers of little care, to a home of little comfort, and to a life of little love.

Working at a morgue wasn't Victor's favorite thing to do, especially on a Saturday night. His dream was to become a doctor and this was the only available opportunity to gain experience. Working at a hospital would have been ideal, but he was only a college freshman and all of the good jobs and internships went to seniors and new graduates.  

The job was simple and boring. He didn't get to handle the bodies or assist in the autopsies, he just processed forms. Occasionally he got to put the toe tags on the bodies and push them into the freezers. Sometimes he would prep and clean the coroner's work area before he did an autopsy, but he mostly just entered data into the computer and verified that all of the proper forms in the coroner's report were filled out and signed.

Victor would usually be left by himself to work the late night shifts. Being alone in that building scared him sometimes. He wasn't afraid of the dead like most people were; it was the strange noises that bothered him. It was hard to concentrate on his work because of the silence as well. The building was always really quiet, except for the low hum of the florescent light bulbs and the clicking of the computer keys. The building would also produce many unknown noises and every little sound was amplified. 

The one perk of the job was the files, even though he would never tell anyone that. Each person's file contained all of the gory details about their cause of death. Sometimes he would pull the bodies out of their refrigerated drawers and examine them while he read their files. 

Victor sat as his desk and lazily flipped through a folder— it was an old woman who died of a stroke. It was one of the boring files with nothing interesting in it. He had eight files to go through before he could go home, but was in no real hurry. The night before, he had stayed out late partying and drinking and was still feeling the effects.

The coroner's name was Joe. He was a small man in his sixties with a full head of gray hair. He rushed across the room, hastily putting on his coat. He would usually leave soon after Victor arrived, but tonight he was leaving a little earlier than normal. 

""You gonna be alright here tonight?"" asked Joe.  

""You ask me that every time,"" Victor smiled.

""Sorry about leaving you alone with so much work, but I just remembered that I had to pick my daughter and grandson up from the airport. When you get my age, you tend to forget things now and again."" 

They shared a laugh as the old man pulled his jacket on. Joe continued, ""Just do what you can and I'll finish the rest in the morning.""  

Victor waved goodbye and returned to the open folder, eager to move on to the next one.  Joe's hard bottom loafers clicked down the hallway, growing fainter with each step until they were no longer audible.

He was relieved to be done with the stroke lady and eagerly pulled the next folder from the stack. His eyes widened with excitement. This folder contained a girl named Robin and the cause of death was suicide by overdose. She was just twenty years old and very pretty. He stared at her picture for several minutes and wondered why such a pretty girl would want to kill herself. What could have been so bad in her life? 

He would normally wait until later in the evening to look at bodies, but he couldn't wait, not this time.

Victor made his way into the room morgue's cold storage room and slid her out of the refrigerated metal drawer. She lay there fully nude, and was even prettier than she had been in the photograph. She didn't look like she was dead, more like she was sleeping. The bodies would normally turned grey after being dead for several hours, but her skin was tan and looked healthy. 
 
He stared at her naked body, eyes investigating every detail. He swallowed hard and reached his hand out to touch her breast, they were perfect, even in death. He was hesitant and his hand trembled slightly as it drew closer. He knew he wasn't supposed to do this, but it wasn't like she was going to tell on him. When he touched her, her skin was smooth and felt like cold leather.  

 He nervously looked back at the room entrance several times to make sure no one was watching him. His hand slid down the length of her body, across her breast, down her stomach, along her thigh, then back up. He had never touched a girl this pretty and moved slowly, admiring every contour. He didn't know why he was touching her or why he liked it so much, but he didn't let that stop him.  

He ran his finger over her pouty lips, leaving pink lipstick smeared on the tip. He brought it to his mouth and tasted it. To his surprise, he had an erection and after some mental debate, he used his free hand to unzip his zipper. He was planning on relieving himself.  

As his unoccupied hand made its way back to her breast, he heard his name whispered, ""Victor"". 

He quickly turned to the door, certain he had been caught, but no one was there. He turned back around to find the girls eyes open and fixed on him. ""Please don't do this to me,"" she whispered. He tripped and fell backwards, his head and back hit the wall on his way to the ground. He grabbed his head in pain and rolled around on the tile floor, cradling it as he groaned. When he checked the back of his head, his hands came away with no blood. A chain of  obscenities escaped him as he sat there. He looked up at Robin's corpse, waiting for her to move, but she remained lifeless. The longer he stared, the more he felt like an idiot. A nervous laugh escaped him and he felt that he deserved to be scared for what he was doing.  

Having enough excitement for the night, he returned to his desk. He couldn't look at her file anymore, so he moved on to the next one. It was a black man in his mid twenties with two gunshots to the chest. One bullet punctured his lung; the other went through and hit his spine. Victor cringed at the thought and wondered what the wounds looked like. He would have normally had a look at this body, but because of what had just happened, he decided to stick to the files.

The long slow cry of an unlubricated door hinge poured through the building. Victor turned towards the sound, still and attentive, waiting for the source to reveal itself. Maybe Joe forgot something and came back to get it. Victor hoped that this was the answer. The click clack sound of hard bottom shoes made their way down the long entrance hallway. Victor relaxed at the sound and returned to the file. The footsteps made their way, step by step, down the hallway and into the main room.  

Without turning Victor said, ""Forgot something else, huh?""  Silence filled the room once again. He swiveled around in his chair, smile still on his face and found that he was alone. The smile quickly melted away. He ran out of the room into the hallway and found that it was empty.  The hallway was about thirty yards long leading straight to the exit and no one was there.

Victor took this as a sign to head home. He had experienced enough creepy stuff for one night. As he gathered his things, he remembered that he didn't push Robin back into the freezer drawer. He strolled into the storage room and stopped dead in his tracks. Robin was gone. A cold chill ran through his body as he stared at an empty metal slab where the dead body of Robin was supposed to be. Either he had imagined the girl or she wasn't really dead. He wasn't sure which he preferred. 

Thoughts raced through his brain, searching for a rational explanation. She would have said something if she woke up in a morgue, right?

The best thing to do was to call Joe and tell him what happened, leaving out the details about his grope session of course. He wanted to leave so badly. He was scared like never before, so he decided to make the call from his car.  

He turned all of the lights in the main room off and quickly headed towards the exit. The hallway was lined with four sections of overhead lights and had a switch every fifteen feet to turn off that section. Victor began down the hallway; he clicked the first switch, casting the section behind him into darkness. The feeling of being followed permeated his thoughts, but he didn't look back. He was afraid that if he turned to look, he might actually see something.  

Second switch, click, more darkness. His pace quickened, third switch, click. Finally he was at the exit. He exhaled a long sigh of relief as he pushed the door open and stepped outside.  The cold night air hit his face. As he turned back to switch the final light off, he was surprised to find that the first light in the hallway was on. Maybe in his haste, he had failed to push the switch down completely. 

Victor made his way back down the hallway, turning on each switch that he passed until he reached the first one. He pressed down on the switch hard, making sure it was off this time.  As he approached the second light, the footsteps started again, slowly approaching from behind. Victor looked back into the darkness and saw nothing.  

He ran, slapping each switch and turning to make sure the lights in that section were off. When he reached the exit door he paused, staring into the black hallway. Free from the confines of the morgue walls, Victor flashed his middle finger towards the dark hall in triumph, then flipped the final light off. His hand plunged into his pocket, expecting to find his car keys.  His hands moved from pocket to pocket, searching but coming up empty. 

When Victor found that Robin was missing, he had been so consumed with the event that he failed to pick the keys up from the table.

He had no choice but to venture back into the building that he offered a cocky middle finger to only moments ago. He was afraid to go back inside, but he had no choice. He felt like a child being afraid of the dark and of that place. It wasn't anything more than a building full of dead people, nothing to be afraid of.  For several minutes he tried to convince himself that he was being childish. ""Just your imagination,"" he said to himself over and over. Finally he built up the courage and ran full speed down the hallway. 

He saw the keys as he approached his desk. The sight of them was comforting. The keys sat atop of a folder, and as he drew closer, he could see that the folder was Robin's. He knew that he didn't leave them on top of her folder. In fact, he remembered placing her folder at the bottom of the pile. The thought of Robin still being alive came back. Of course, it was the only rational explanation. Squeaking doors, lights, and strange sounds. She was probably wandering around in the dark looking for help.

Victor returned to the freezer room and hoped he would find Robin, but found something horrible. He couldn't move, standing in shock as he looked across the room at the body laying on the metal slab. The body laying in Robin's place was an old woman — The one that had died of a stroke. Was this the body he had been touching?  He wiped his hands on his shirt in disgust at the thought. The old woman was the total opposite of Robin. Her skin was dry and sagging and her breast looked like socks full of sand. Her face was sunken in and she smelled worse than the other bodies, which was pretty hard to do.

Victor almost fainted and leaned against the wall to stop from falling. Suddenly the room plunged into darkness. Victor gasped. He was out of breath like someone had punched him in the stomach. He stood still in the dark, listening for any noise or movement, but only heard silence. He shifted his weight and stepped away from the wall, the lights flashed back on. Surprised, he looked around for an explanation and realized that he leaned against the light switch.  He felt even more childish than before. 

He wondered if the night could get any stranger, but before he completed the thought, he got his answer. Across the room, on that same metal slab, was Robin. She lay there just as she had before. As he pushed her body back into the freezer, he noticed a dark burgundy and purple ring around her neck. He hadn't noticed it before, maybe because he was paying so much attention to her tits. 

Returning to his desk, he grabbed his keys and paused for a moment, staring at the folder.  Curiosity got the best of him, he had to check something.  In the ""Cause of Death"" section it read: Strangulation. Somehow the C.O.D. had changed from ""Suicide By Overdose"" to this. He read more and found that Robin had been raped and strangled to death in a gas station bathroom. He flipped through the pages and stopped on an empty form with the words ""Don't Touch Me"" written in pink lipstick.

Victor backed away from the desk. He had his keys and his curiosity quenched. He now  wanted out of the building. He made his way into the hallway and ran right past the light switches without turning them off.  Even though the hallway was only about 30 yards, it seemed to stretch on for a mile. As he approached the door, the light near the exit shut off. Victor stopped dead in his tracks. The darkness was like a wall and was so dark that the exit door couldn't be seen just a few feet behind it.  He stared deep into it, trying to decide what to do next. Maybe he could just rush into it and burst out of the door. It would only be a few steps, he thought.  

Just as he prepared for takeoff, something in the darkness moved. The onyx silhouette moved just beyond the border of the darkness. His plan seemed more dangerous now that the shadowy figure lurked in front of him. Before he could muster up the courage to charge, the first section of lights behind him went out. He spun to find the same black wall of undulating ink behind him too. He was trapped, sandwiched between unknown dangers. Time was against him, and he anticipated the entire hallway being submerged in darkness soon. He didn't want to be there when it happened. Charging the door was the only option.  He exploded in a full sprint towards the door, screaming out a battle cry in some ill attempt at intimidation.  He rushed into the darkness like a running back on the goal line and disappeared into it.

Victor instantly felt weightless, like he was falling. He couldn't see, but felt cold and sticky like he was in an ocean of cool honey. Even though he felt like he was weightless, he could barely move his arms and legs. He struggled with all of his strength and only moved a few feet. He felt that at any moment, he would push the door open and be outside.  

His hand found what felt like the door handle and a sharp pain raced through it and up his arm. It felt like something had bitten him. The same pain happened in his right leg, then his side, then his other arm. He was being bitten over and over by something with a small mouth and pencil like teeth. As he opened his mouth to scream, the dark honey slid into his mouth and throat. He squirmed in pain and tried to move away from the door but could only move a little at a time.  Just as he thought he would suffocate, he was spewed from the darkness out onto the hallway floor.  He coughed and gagged as he sucked in large gulps of air. 

He crawled down the hall and stopped right in the middle of the dark walls. The next closest light near the exit flickered and dimmed. Victor was forced to crawl farther away from the exit to avoid being consumed by the darkness as it swallowed another section of hallway.

A shape emerged from the dark, it was Robin. She stood expressionless and said, ""You shouldn't have touched me."" He cried out a begging apology to her. He apologized for touching her and for what happened to her.  

Nothing happened and Victor was unsure if his apology worked. Minutes went by and nothing happened, she just gazed down at him. Suddenly, the lights above him began to flutter and dim. He pressed hard on the light switch in an attempt to overpower it from turning off. The lights dimmed so low that he could barely see. He closed his eyes, screaming out in pain as he prepared for the bites to resume once the darkness returned. He continued to scream, but nothing happened.  

He opened his eyes and was alone, pressed against the wall in a brightly lit hallway. The exit was right there in plain sight, no dark wall, no dead girl. He had never been so happy to leave work and briskly headed for the door.  Just a few feet and he would be home free. He imagined the cold night air hitting his skin again. As he approached the door, the lights flickered and he immediately made a dash for the exit. Before he could reach the exit, the hallway was fully eclipsed and stopped him dead in his tracks. The bites returned and touch every part of his body. His painful screams were muffled by the thick darkness as the bites increased in intensity.

Victor opened his eyes, he was laying on the ground in front of Robin's body. Confused and not sure where he was, he scanned the room until his memory returned. He must have hit his head pretty hard and blacked out when he thought that the girl's dead body had spoken to him.  

He laughed, happy to not be devoured by the darkness. There was no such thing as ghosts anyway, he should have known better. He stood up and stared at Robin's body again. Even though the bites and darkness were still very present in his mind, he pushed them to the side. All of that was just his subconscious guilt manifesting itself in a screwed up dream. He reached his hand out and poked her body with his index finger. She remained still and silent. 

Even though he had imagined all of the evening’s horrors, he was still mentally exhausted.  He pushed the body into the freezer drawer, turned the lights off in the main room and headed for the exit.

One by one he flipped the lights off in the hallway as he passed them. He had never been so relieved to leave work. Standing in the exit doorway, he turned and looked back down the hall. 

His body went cold as he saw that the first section of lights were still on. He stared in disbelief, but had no intention of going back inside to turn them off.

He reached into his pocket, searching for his keys. In his haste, he had forgotten to pick them up from the desk. He had no choice but to go back inside.

He closed his eyes, screaming out in pain as he prepared for the bites to resume once the darkness returned. He continued to scream, but nothing happened.  

He opened his eyes and was alone, pressed against the wall in a brightly lit hallway. The exit was right there in plain sight, no dark wall, no dead girl. He had never been so happy to leave work and briskly headed for the door.  Just a few feet and he would be home free. He imagined the cold night air hitting his skin again. As he approached the door, the lights flickered and he immediately made a dash for the exit. Before he could reach the exit, the hallway was fully eclipsed and stopped him dead in his tracks. The bites returned and touch every part of his body. His painful screams were muffled by the thick darkness as the bites increased in intensity.

Victor opened his eyes, he was laying on the ground in front of Robin's body. Confused and not sure where he was, he scanned the room until his memory returned. He must have hit his head pretty hard and blacked out when he thought that the girl's dead body had spoken to him.  

He laughed, happy to not be devoured by the darkness. There was no such thing as ghosts anyway, he should have known better. He stood up and stared at Robin's body again. Even though the bites and darkness were still very present in his mind, he pushed them to the side. All of that was just his subconscious guilt manifesting itself in a screwed up dream. He reached his hand out and poked her body with his index finger. She remained still and silent. 

Even though he had imagined all of the evening’s horrors, he was still mentally exhausted.  He pushed the body into the freezer drawer, turned the lights off in the main room and headed for the exit.

One by one he flipped the lights off in the hallway as he passed them. He had never been so relieved to leave work. Standing in the exit doorway, he turned and looked back down the hall. 

His body went cold as he saw that the first section of lights were still on. He stared in disbelief, but had no intention of going back inside to turn them off.

He reached into his pocket, searching for his keys. In his haste, he had forgotten to pick them up from the desk. He had no choice but to go back inside.

I'm finishing up getting a Ph.D. in psychology, and am looking to complete a postdoc next year (or within the next two years) in order to be able to be licensed.

The problem is, when I shared this with some women I know, they were super judgy. Basically saying that I should stay home, while my husband works (e.g., ""what about breastfeeding""). Then, when I talk to professionals in my field about taking a year off, they are sort of judgy too (e.g., ""Humm, I don't know, you don't want to fall behind). 

So what am I supposed to do? I know at the end of the day, I have to do what works for myself and my family, but it is SO hard. Any parents out there with advice on how to navigate this tough choice?

What are the chances that they actually find out I reneged?

And if my account is suspended, how important is having an ECS profile to my full time job search? I should be able to go to the career fairs I think.

3tmbjb,6,2015-11-20,"Random Madonna news all thrown together in one text post, with commentary!",YorjYefferson,Madonna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Madonna/comments/3tmbjb/random_madonna_news_all_thrown_together_in_one/,"These were all 'hits' when I went searching for Madonna news earlier, in the sense that they all have to do with Madonna the celebrity and not Mt. Madonna in California, or some American pollster whose last name is Madonna (I think he's in Pennsylvania), or a sports team with that name, or Adele because she said something favourable about her in an interview. So these are all somewhat relevant for this sub anyway, but I didn't feel like any of them warranted their own posts. So I'm going to link to the articles, tell you where they are from, and then let out a little of the snark that's been building up inside myself lately. Feel free to play along in the comments if you want. And awayyyyyyy we go!

[Rita Ora would love to have sex with Madonna, just so she could tell other people about it](https://au.entertainment.yahoo.com/a/30156700/rita-ora-would-love-to-have-sex-with-madonna/) (Australian Yahoo News)

* I'll give her credit for being one of the few guest stars who actually showed up for the filming of the Bitch I'm Madonna video, but what a ridiculous thing to say, and reason for saying it. If you're going to actually be with Madonna you should *want* to do it for the fun, not just so you can go blab about it to the celebrity press. About all I knew about her before she was in the BIM video was that she has earned the nickname ""Rita Whore-a"", and based on this I'm not too inclined to find out anything more-a.

[Why Madonna has got Bradley Walsh hot under the collar ahead of Cinderella at Barclaycard Arena](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/madonna-bradley-walsh-hot-under-10468851) (Birmingham Mail)

* First of all, who is this guy again? Never heard of him. Secondly, why should Madonna be bullied into giving up rehearsal time that is undoubtedly IN HER CONTRACT with the venue for another event, no matter who it's for? Even if she decided to grant this show some of her time, it's not always that easy when the lawyers and managers dictate so many of the terms, conditions and penalties for any changes. And finally, maybe I'm missing something, but this sounds like a puppet show (I'm picturing Julie Andrews singing ""one little goat in a lonely goatherd, le-ee-oh-da-lay-ee-oh-da-lay-hee-hoo"") and I think Madonna has earned the right to use all of her alloted rehearsal time if she fucking wants to. Besides, they've got the next three days to figure out which strings go where before their concert on the 20th.

[Bill O’Reilly Blasts Madonna’s ‘Gibberish’ on Paris Attacks](http://www.thewrap.com/bill-oreilly-madonna-paris-attacks-gibberish-fox-news-isis/) (The Wrap)

* Bitch, please. Billow has to be the most arrogant, condescending, factually challenged bag of hot air and farts that the world has ever seen. He gets away with saying the most stupid things on TV but he does so with confidence and an attitude, and because the vast majority of the Fox News audience consists of people in their 70s and older who are either too drunk or too zoned out on pills to even figure out how to change the channel, so they just leave it where it is and wake up the next morning wondering why they kept having dreams about Hillary Clinton trying to sell them a reverse home mortgage or getting them to buy gold bars at an unbelievably low price but hurry and place that order now because there's a War on Christmas^TM. Ugh I'm not even going back to make those sentences match up, stream of consciousness are the words of the day. Madonna spoke from her heart about something that had just happened the night before, unlike you she didn't have a teleprompter or a bunch of interns focus group testing everything she said. That was REAL, about as real as many of us have ever seen her, it was sincere, and she was speaking from her heart. And she was right too, the people who want to cause violence are counting on overreactions like countries closing their borders, cancelling theatre, arts, music, entertainment, etc, and the way to show them that they won't win is to pay respect to the victims but not be intimidated into pulling the plug. Go fuck yourself with a falafel Bill, film at 11."

I will be doing a 6 month internship in Massachusetts, and my permanent residence is in Iowa. I need to estimate my living expenses in MA, so I was trying to figure out what my take-home pay would be. 

I'll be making **$22/hour** and working **40 hours/week**, with pay every two weeks. In addition, they are giving me a **$1500 moving stipend** to be attached to my first paycheck.

I see that there are paycheck calculators online, but I was wondering if I should look at rates for Mass. or Iowa, considering I'll be right on the 6-month residency borderline.

Other income I've received in the year is **~$1,000** for working in the tutoring center at my university in **Iowa (taxes already withheld).** 

TL;DR: I'm an Iowa resident interning in Massachusetts for 6 months, making a net $22,620. In addition, I have ~$1,000 in Iowa income, with taxes already withheld. Do I consider MA or IA state taxes, and how much would my per month income be?"

3tmq0t,2,2015-11-20,My (23F) mom (50'sF) is an alcoholic. I need perspective.,gibberellins1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tmq0t/my_23f_mom_50sf_is_an_alcoholic_i_need_perspective/,"Tl;dr My mom has been an alcoholic for most of my life. I'm starting to feel hurt and angry whenever I'm around her. I feel like I need perspective on alcoholism and our relationship. 

My parents separated when I was 8, were divorced by 10. My first memory of her being drunk was when I was 11, and I was terrified -- she kept touching me and she was acting weird, so I ran and locked myself in a bedroom and crawled out of a window to get my neighbors. They came over -- twice -- and basically told me I was being silly, she was just drunk, not to worry about it. Since then, I've never been comfortable around her if I'm even suspicious she was drunk. 

As time went on, things got worse. We had a house, then sold that for a townhouse, were evicted and moved to an apartment 900 miles from my dad, and finally moved to a smaller apartment, leaving 3 of us in one room. I have a lot of memories of my mom being drunk. When I was in high school I remember all the times she stumbled in drunk, and I had to put her to bed, comfort my crying brother (who was also afraid of my drunk mom) and hush my angry grandmother, and wake up for school the next day. I was never angry with her, never held it against her, I just accepted that that was the way she was and the way things were going to be. I never really felt like I had a mom. She let me down so much. She was always good at hiding her drinking -- I've very rarely seen her drink, I always just see her drunk. 

She always makes me feel horrible for my accomplishments. I graduated from college in May, and one of the things she told me that always stuck with me is that I MUST feel like I'm better than her because of a stupid degree, and I MUST look down on her and our family, and all these things that I've spent so much time refuting. She fought with me every semester to drop out stay at home and work, and never supported me. When I was working 4 days a week and interning 3 (so full time + ~25hrs) she said that wasn't enough, that I should quit interning and make more money (the internship didn't pay, but it was valuable experience that makes me more competitive. I couldn't actually work any more hours at my job anyways). I can't tell her about my work now, because any bad day I have will be met with how awful her days have been, and I don't want her to feel bad when I have good days. 

Now, it's 5 years after high school. I still live at home (moving out next month) but pay $400/month to rent the smallest room, so I feel like a tenant, and I like it like that. She's been working very hard and has been very depressed lately, and for months I've been listening to her, trying to help, and I realized this was beyond my help and pushed her to seek a professional. She told me she was drinking again, and all of this is just taking me back. She's reading up on alcoholism, and now says she's ""afflicted"" with it, a la how one is ""afflicted"" with cancer. 

It probably is correct, but it makes me so angry. She wasn't there for YEARS, I had to get berated by her constantly, and she's telling me she's ""afflicted"" with alcoholism, that every time I saw/see her drunk it was cursed upon her and she has zero control over her condition. She says there is an ""angry bitch"" inside of her that comes out when she's drunk, and I feel like she's distancing herself from responsibility. 

I finally asked my dad about their divorce, and why did they split up? Her alcoholism. He said she was always ""good at hiding it"", and I started crying -- that's exactly how she is. My mom spent a lot of time and energy making us think my dad didn't care about us, and everything she ever told me has been thrust into an enormous shadow of doubt. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm not an angry person at all, but the way I feel just makes me want to shout at her and make her feel how I've felt for years. I'm scared, because I don't want to hurt anyone, I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow and plan on discussing this. I keep thinking if I never saw her again, I would be fine. I need perspective, and to be put in my place. I should be sympathetic, she's depressed and I don't want to hurt her more. I should want to help her and listen. I just can't anymore. 

For the record: my mom was never violent or mean. I was a kid and I was scared. As an adult, I rarely drink, and have a pretty healthy relationship with alcohol -- it's knowing she is drunk that upsets me. "
3tmwid,3,2015-11-20,"In law school, leaving job, and need advice on making my $60k in savings last the next 3 years.",jdlife,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3tmwid/in_law_school_leaving_job_and_need_advice_on/,"I know how to budget, save, and invest for the long run, but I am leaving my lucrative career at the beginning of next semester because I need to concentrate on my first year of law school.  Ultimately, I need to make my student loan money, savings, and retirement accounts grow and last until I graduate in 2018.

I'll have about $60k in my savings account that's currently earning 1.00% APY.  I'll also have about $65k in my 401k that I'll need to move and re-invest.  I'll also receive around $7k a semester from student loans after covering tuition.

Monthly expenses are around $2.3k, which cover the necessities: mortgage, car, insurance, utilities, food, etc.  On paper, it looks like I'll be fine through the next 3 years, but when you've been poor enough to qualify for food stamps and have no one else to support you, it's hard not to be concerned about money.

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:
I have a one bedroom home, so there's no way to take on a roommate.  My mortgage is less than a studio apartment in my current neighborhood or near campus, so renting it out and looking for something cheaper is not an option.

Having a good paying job, money in the bank, and a retirement account makes me ineligible for almost all scholarship offerings because there's usually a ""financial need"" requirement. 

It is unlikely that I will take on a part-time job because my focus is on my education, and I won't be eligible for a paid internship until summer 2017.

I know I can draw from my retirement account for educational expenses without penalties, but I want to pretend like that isn't even an option.

So Reddit, what are your thoughts on investing the savings and money in the retirement account, so I'm not broke when I graduate?"

I had very few friends even though I was kinda super-social and nowadays I don't have anyone that I can call ""best friend"" or something. Been in depression for 4 years + as a liberal and an atheist, I live in Turkey, and every day I hate it even more. I have a girl friend tho, and this is where the story begins.

It started as a ""summer love"", then however it continued. She had 
a long-term relationship before me. She told me she was a virgin even though I wasn't giving a damn about this kind of stuff. Then we had sex ofc, I was her first and stuff. I kinda valued that later. She was... compromising and it helped me to build a trustworthy relationship with her (well, I have trust issiues for years). Everything was great for 5 months. Except two things...

1. She is kinda self-oriented even though she loves me. Sometimes she cannot calculate how would I feel towards some of her actions.

2. I had applied for erasmus program at Stockholm before I've met her and I was about to leave the country.

Well, we didn't brake up. I visited her once for celebrating 14th feb, she never came to visit me at stockholm. We actaully had a fight about that and didn't talk to each other for 1 month when I was there. She said she thought it was a break up. Anyway, we  made it up later. Then I returned to Turkey for good.

I never cheated on her. to be more exact, I never ever had any romantic/sexual involvement with another girl when I was away even thought we had fights and hadn't spoken eachother for one month. She claimed the same thing ofc when I returned.

Btw, the times  I had to say no to sweet sweeet swedish girls... Man.. That was the ultimate sacrifice. 

Anyway...

After I've returned to Antalya, Turkey previous summer (she also lives in antalya at summers and at ankara during winters). We've been together again after a very long time. Great huh? Not. I had an offer for an internship at Istanbul, at one of the greatest companies in turkey. I had to go istanbul. She told me she will come to visit me for our anniversary. I was kinda being a jerk to her since she didn't come to stockholm during my erasmus and this was supposed to make it up for me. After I went istanbul, she told me she cannot come because ""her family wouldn't let her"" (DAMN YOU TURKISH CULTURE). This was where her self-orientedness became a problem because she was like "" my parent's won't let me, deal with it"". Without no apologising or sweet words for not to hurt me nor anything. Fuck, she gives a promise and can't keep it in short and she DONT FUCKING APOLOGIZE OR MAKE IT UP FOR ME. This shit happened several times btw. One promise for breaking another, then again, then again....

You know these people. When they are right, everything should be ok. they don't give a shit about others and they have to deal with it. This fucking philosophy of her is killing me. Really. 

ANYWAY. 

She told me for several times some fucking dudes try to hit on her when I was away, but she rejected them eventhough she danced with one of them who nearly kissed her but she didn't let her blablblablabla you get the idea. A fucking trust game. BTW she told me these one month after my arrival to turkey. After she claimed she had no involvement with any other guy when I was away.

The last month, we were drunk and playing truth or dare with a friend of hers. After a bottle of gin, she confessed that she had anal sex before she met with me. 
Man... I wasn't her first. 

And the thing is, that happened with some dude she know for 2 weeks. It is unbelievable. SHE LIED TO ME. I wasn't her first. Some unimported dude was. + they did something that she never did with me. I felt betrayed and inferior. Fuck she knew I had trust issues and she told me this after one and a half year since we started to date. And as I said before, I don't give a shit about the past sex life of my girlfirends (I need to state that since I live in turkey and typical turkish guys are obsessed with virginity, fuck turkish culture) however she still lied to me about hers.

You get it right? It's all about the lie. Well it had supposed to be at least. 

She doesn't keep her promises, she never makes a big ""favor"" for me, for example lying to her parents to visit me in istanbul or in stockholm, or in another place (this shit happened 4 times). Shit we've been together for 16 months and at 8 of it, we were at different cities. She lies to me then she expects me to believe that she hadn't cheated on me when I was away. 

Besides, when I complain about that, I become the bad guy.

Fuck this shit is killing me. 

Btw I stopped smoking a month ago (I was a heavy smoker). I'm using zyban to cope with side effects. I'm paranoid (I always think I'm being cheated on, like, always), stressed, felling like a useless piece of shit, I have 1-2 friends (I can see only one of them regularly and she is not very social and the other one is always busy). My gf is studying at another city (1 hour distance) and comes to my apartment for weekends and once in two weeks, there is some fucking shit that prevent him to come to see me. She is basically my entire social life. I'm about to graduate this year, and the courses are heavier than shit this year. I often think about suicide. The only reason I haven't yet is my parents are still alive and I don't want to agonise them.

Today is my 30th nicotine free day. I'm not going to smoke any cigarettes again. That means  I've accept the pain. Well, 2-3 times I smoked a joint to relief this month but I think I'm gonna stop that too.

I've gained weigth (96 kilos, 185 cm now), my self esteem is lowered, I haven't played in a band for a year now ( I was playing bass for 8 years, having gigs every two months etc.). I'm losing myself. 

Everyweek I have arguements with my gf. Man I fucking love her, and I believe she also loves me, but trust issues of mine... 

Anyway, thanks for reading. "
3tn6wj,2,2015-11-20,I [25F] can't figure out what I'm doing with my ex [31M]. I am feeling more alone than ever.,throwwaydisname,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tn6wj/i_25f_cant_figure_out_what_im_doing_with_my_ex/,"This is probably going to be a long wall of mumbled words. I have troubles trying to get my points across. PLEASE READ IT ALL. I need all of the advice I can get.


I have been in an on/off relationship with my ex, Trey, for the past 5 years. We are currently living together, and spend most of our time together. I consider him my best friend.


We met in 2010 on a dating site and instantly hit it off. He was my first love, and everything I felt I wanted. We moved in together after two months of dating and loved every minute of it. When I moved in with him, I had just finished an internship and was looking for a job in that profession. I searched for a month and was beginning to get stressed out because I had bills to pay. He was the VP of a small company so he offered me a position there. Long story short, I took the job and became a pretty important piece to the company. It grew and I helped a lot with it.


 After about 6 months of dating, I find that he went to a strip club while out of town on a business trip. Not the biggest deal, except he lied to me about it. Promised he only went because it was the closet bar, not to see the tits. I let it slide. We also ran into an issue where I was extremely uncomfortable with his porn usage. I did a lot of internet searching and found that it was a perfectly normal thing, so I started to not only be okay with it, but watch it with him at times. This worked for awhile until he started watching it more than him and I were doing anything sexual. Other problems came on after that, like a time or two he had called me a ""bitch"" but I will admit I called him an asshole in return. Right after our two year anniversary, we broke up, and I moved out on my own. We still worked together, so we had to maintain a friendship, which worked well since we were pretty mutual with the breakup.


 After the breakup, I found that he had joined a dating site about a week before up breaking up. I knew he didn't physically cheat, but I considered it a form of cheating. He told me that he was just on there trying to make friends, which I still find hard to believe, although I would never want to think he would've cheated.


 Through the 6 months of us being broken up, he dated a couple girls and because we worked together I had to watch it happen, although he lied a lot about it, telling me they were only friends. I later found out the truth that he had actually had two relationships. We still stayed friends through it all because we have some sort of connection.


 After 6 months we decided to give it another go. Things seemed better, we moved back in together and we were happy. Then one day I found an email account on his iPad that I had never heard of. Knowing the past, I snooped. Sure enough I found emails stating ""USERNAME sent you a new message"" from a dating site. I found a way to log in and saw that a lot of the messages were truly to people I knew he wasn't attracted to and he was just talking about their upbringing, school, interests, etc. Nothing romantic. This still didn't sit right with me so I confronted him. At first he got upset at my snooping, then realized he was the one in the wrong. I watched him delete the account and I figured I would give it one last chance. Every time his phone dinged, I still felt anxiety, losing trust is a pretty big deal.


About 9 months later I flew his parents into town as a surprise for our anniversary and we had gone to breakfast one of the mornings they were there. I saw that he seemed to keep making eye contact with one of the hostesses as we were waiting for our table. It made me feel uncomfortable because not only were his parents there, but I was there! Flirt when I'm not around, but I was standing watching this happen. I pulled him aside and asked him to stop because I was feeling uncomrtable. He got super defensive and said I was imagining things and to please stop accusing him of things. That he was just looking at her because she reminded him of someone. I said ""Well, okay, but just stop doing it please"" I watched him do it again and he knew because he turned around and looked at me right after he did it. I just raised my eyebrows because I wasn't trying to make a scene in front of his parents. He gave me a nasty look and mouthed ""Fuck you""


 Thats when I realized that I couldn't be treated that way anymore and I needed to think of a game plan. I met a guy who made me feel amazing. He treated me in a way that made me feel respected and important. I am not a cheater, so when I realized that I couldn't make the feelings go away, Trey and I sat and had the break up talk. It was pretty mutual, we decided we would continue to live together to make everything easier bill wise, and continue to stay friends since we still worked together.


 We lived together for about a month after that before I got my own place again. As time went on we continued to stay friends, things never worked out with the previous guy, and I wasn't interested in dating. I just loved my alone time and spending time with my family. Fast forward 6 months, Im starting to go in debt with my bills and rent. I couldn't afford living on my own and I needed a roommate. Trey and I had created an extremely amazing friendship at that point, and decided once again, to move back in together. And here I am today.


 We are no longer working together. He isn't the same as he used to be. We fight WAY less and I can't remember the last time he's called me a name or done anything as nasty as previous times. Its hard to explain the connection we have. I feel like he is my family and I could never not have him in my life. I feel like removing him from my life would be like removing my sister from my life. Hes too big of part of who I am. 


 We keep going back and forth about whether we want to be together. Like for good, forever. I haven't dated anyone since we broke up, and I had always hoped to try, but I just don't have the guts. I am afraid that if I start dating, he will start dating, and then I will lose him forever. Im not ready to make that decision, but I know I am not getting any younger. 


I know I have included a lot of negative things in this post about Trey, but please know there are a ton of great things about him as well. He's done some pretty amazing things for me and he has been trying to make me know he thinks about me and cares for me. I do still feel that I would have a hard time trusting him. With every time he checks his phone, I know I would be wondering if its another girl. He has sworn up and down that he would never ever do that to me again.

Are the things he's done forgivable? Can we make it past all of these things? Am I too old to find new love? I've heard a lot that all relationships come with struggles, NONE of them are perfect. I also know its hard to find someone who treats you 100% the way you deserve. To stay? Or go?
 
**tl;dr**: My ex and I have been on and off for 5 years. I know its come time to make a decision but I have no idea what to do. Should I stay or go?"

3tnjm6,1,2015-11-20,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3tnjm6/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!"
3tntmb,3,2015-11-21,I can't make my brains work,bbminner,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3tntmb/i_cant_make_my_brains_work/,"Hi folks,

I've never been a type of kid who enjoys his spare time running around and yelling, and during my teenage years I've been feeling mostly sad and isolated, but I hoped that everything would just work out when I'll grow up (remember myself walking down the street - I was 14 - and thinking that my loneliness and feeling bad about myself are just caused by youth and hormone excess, so I should stop feeling this way quite soon). And I've been quite socially anxious too from the very beginning, but there are many people who experience that throughout their entire life, so there's nothing special in it, I guess.

During my early undergrad years in a top technical Russian uni I felt so miserably stupid, that spend most of the time just trying to ""hypnotize"" the lecturer and make him\her think I'm a smart guy (instead of listening), but I did all required homework (and more) and passes all exams quite successfully, partially, because I used to think that if I would become an A-student, girls would start liking me more; I'm not an ""ugly stereotypical nerd with glasses and acne all over the face"", but have always had that feeling of being unloved and unwanted deep inside of me for some reason, maybe my parents parenting style - and that's why, probably, I've never dated a girl for more then a week or two (and they leave me for just no reason, like ""I just figured out that I don't like you that much, sorry""). And after I became an A-student and got no attention anyway, I got a project-manager job (I'm an engineer, but I thought that this kind of job would make other people like me too) and didn't get any girls attention anyway and the job itself was so stressful that I just cracked a little bit and was spending most of the day hiding from my colleges in a restroom or running up and down the stairs just not to sit behind them because I thought that they hate me so much. I've been visiting therapist for a few month back then (I was 19 or something). From that moment I feel like ""making myself to do X"" thing inside of me is broken and started feeling even more anxious in crowded places (that I am fat, ugly, stinky guy around nice, smart, beautiful people).

I'm 21 now, I'm finishing my Masters and want(?) to go for a PhD in AI. Last summer I fucked up most of the stuff I had to do and I was just spending all the time at home feeling bad about myself, not eating and sleeping two or three days (and then not sleeping two or three days) in a row, so I visited therapist and he prescribed me Cipralex (aka Lexapro, aka Escitalopram) and I'm taking it for ~4 month already. Now I'm doing an internship research in CSAIL in MIT and that it amazing (or must be amazing), but I find myself in a best place in the world for a short-term research not being able to wake up in the morning, or think, and just staying at home and crying, or go to lab and do not do anything towards my research because I work so damn inefficient (like, 5-10% of what I know I can do); antidepressants help me function a little bit, like talking or walking or not stopping feeding myself, but when it comes to thinking, I feel stuck, my brain just refuses to work, it is just like:
- Okay, brain, let's do some work today
- Nope
- Why not? C'mon, let's do something that would make our life better in the future
- Neeah, I know that's just waste of resources, so let's just watch one more stupid cartoon on YouTube, or sleep, or stare at a wall for a while, watching for your meaningless and joyless life passing by.

(I think) I want to do stuff and everything is not so fucked up yet, but [even when] I find myself not crying or feeling isolated and life being meaningless, I just can make myself do stuff. And 

I mean, I do want to want and do, but I can't and I hate myself for not being able. Even under antidepressants, anything that involves ""motivation"" or ""wanting"" or ""creativity"" or ""thinking"" by some extent, fails. And when I start thinking so, it seems like I'm just a lazy ass who tries to come up a way of not doing stuff and being ""nice"" simultaneously. But sucks at feeling good.."
3to482,2,2015-11-21,I [22 F] college senior is being threatened on being disowned by my family because I would like the day off from taking care of my mother. She had cancer but is doing a lot better! But isn't help herself get better.,coco_moonbabe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3to482/i_22_f_college_senior_is_being_threatened_on/,"Recently things have got so out of hand. It hurts to be put in such a small hole and no one seems to care.  

I am graduating in two weeks and have been running around all over the place. I've been taking care of my mom [she just had her kidney taken out], cleaning the house [because she is a hoarder], going to work, going to class, taking care of the dog, cooking and cleaning, and going to my internship [as a graphic designer and director].

I live at home this semester and in a long distance relationship. I asked my mother if I could leave her alone for a day, and she felt like I wasn't being loving enough. I do this all alone. My family even threatened to disown me if I didn't stay at home all the time day and night. I have a curfew now.  Where am I going? They make me cancel all of my appointments with friends, because I'm expected to care for my mom....but here's the thing....

She doesn't do what the surgeon tells her to do to make herself better, which prolongs her recover [no chemo or radiation]! :-)
Its been three weeks and she doesn't walk often, doesn't eat often, and just watches tv. She took too many painkillers and she was all drugged up. 

When I try to encourage her to walk, she gives me some excuse and said she walked to the bathroom or that I'm being bossy. When I offer food to her, she thinks I'm being controlling.  Then when I want to give her and I space, my whole life blows up.

The surgeon said she could be left alone and do things autonomously. But I'm still handing her water and giving her small things she should take as an opporuntity to walk. He wants her to walk a lot and eat regular food! And she doesn't try at all.

So my family wants to disown me for not wanting to be available one day.  They have ruined my relationships with people, called me selfish, and ignoring the fact I am stressed the heck out. I just wanted to see my boyfriend once and everything blew up. Everyone in my family calls me to tell me how horrible I am.

I'm depressed.  

I am contemplating on dropping all them, take care of my Mom and never talk or ask a thing from them ever again. 

My grandmother gives me lists on what to do.  They say I'm not respectful to my elders.  But they always guilt trip me. By telling them to stop guilt trip me I am considered disrespectful. I didn't sleep on my bed for two weeks for my grandma or a cousin to sleep on my bed to be comfortable. I took a quick nap on my bed and grandma wanted to lysol spray it and hated I left the closet door open. 

Why do they stress me out??? I just want to help my Mom feel better, graduate, get a job, and be left alone.

My grandfather threatened to never help me ever again because my Aunt always gossips about me. 

I have two more weeks of class man...and I had to drop a class because of all of the cancer drama took up all of my time. I drove an hour everyday for two weeks after work or class...


What's the worst I feel guilty for being upset, then guilt for having guilt and no guilt.

This whole thing is making me not want to bother with my family anymore. I feel like such a bad person.

What should I do???


**tl;dr**
After finding out my Mom had cancer, my life became complicated.  Since I never had time to myself anymore and the surgeon said my mom should be independent now I felt I could leave her for a night.  Now my family wants to disown me. "
3todvb,26,2015-11-21,Never live with your Best Friend,LittleSparr0w,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/3todvb/never_live_with_your_best_friend/,"I lived with my best friend for 4 years during my college experience. She and I knew each other for a very long time before we decided to live together. We are going to call her Bitch Face McGhee. The first two years we lived together were great. We lived on campus in a dorm, did laundry, grocery shopping, eating meals, working out, studying, Netflix binge watching, and the whole lot of college age best girlfriends stuff together. We were best friends friends to the point that we agreed that if men amd families didn't work out for us, we would be crazy cat ladies together (platonically of course). 
Year one:In our first dorm we shared an adjoining tiny bathroom with two other snobby girls and their stupidity gave us a lot to laugh about, but we always kept our side of the bathroom clean. Together we kept the room clean as well. Things were good. We had enough of our own lived and over laps that things were good.
Year two: We upgraded to a two bedroom suite that had a tiny living roomlkitchen area and a good sized bathroom. I kept my stuff immaculate, cleaned the dishes, and generally made sure everything was straightened up. Bitch Face McGhee was less diligent in cleanliness, and often you could not see the floor of her room. But it was her little room, so I didn't not judge, but if she needed help I offfered. She got a sweet ass internship for the spring and I did everything I could to help her once I realized there was no way I could a)get it because the professor in charge did not like me and b) even if I got it, my family couldn't help me afford it even with the scholarship it came with. So I put all of my effort into making sure she had the best shot at getting it, which she did. I helped her through writing the essay, phone interview tips, buying her first suit, and a bunch of other stuff. I was very proud and really happy for her. She had a rough family life due to her parents having a terribly drawn out divorce and being stuck in the middle of it, and she deserved to have this remarkable opportunity. In the spring she left for the big city and I had a terrible temporary roommate. I did my fair share of fun things that semester. I partied a lot, ended a romantic relationship with a mutual friend of ours, smoked pot, had a fuck buddy, entered into a serious relationship with a different guy and made a 4.0 all on the same semester. It was a rad semester. Summer came and bitch face and I got an opportunity to move off campus. 
Year three: we moved in with 2 guys I was in marching band with, one of whom I was in a music organizationl/non-traditional sorority with, he will be known a Rad black dude. The other guy will be Nice Nick. Nice Nick had an obnoxious girl friend that are our food and dumped our laundry out when she decided she wanted something. We got her to stop coming around after a while and nice Nick stayed at her place most of the time. I had a boyfriend that lived almost an hour away but went to the same college as me, so would frequently stay at his place if inwent over there. I basically started living with him part time with his family around Nov. 2013. Me and bitch face were okay. Not as close. She came back from the internship a bit snobby and egocentric, but that happens. What I didn't expect was the slow manipulation that would start. She would ask to borrow things or I'd spot her money for groceries if her folks forgot to give her money when they said they would, but she had a history of paging me back. This was less frequent now. She wasn't kind to me or my boyfriend and was often short and rude toward me and others. She wasn't doing well in school so she ended up staying over the while summer to take courses, and I went home and hit an internship with a surgical company. Over the summer I went back to the store a few times, to pay rent, check in on things, or hang out with my friends that were there. Bitch Face was to busy to hang out really, so we grew farther apart. On two occasions that I went the the apartment, the kitchen was so filthy and disgusting that there wasn't a clean glass to drink water out of for my grandfather who came with me. The shared bathroom had clothes covering the floor entirely, and the counters were cluttered with make up and trash. There was an ironing board that prevented me from even opening my door into the bathroom. I confronted her about it to which she said ' oh, my bad' and proceeded to do nothing because the other times I went afterwards it was the exact same. 
Year four: I adopted a small dog before coming back in the fall and was immediately confronted about how the dog was solely my responsibility (i never insinuated other wise) and I was informed that my boyfriend was not allowed over more for than a day or two, what the thermostats would be set at, and how I should replace all of the paper products she and Cool black dude used over the break. When I refused to do this because I had nothing to do with consuming them in the first place and suggested that we set up a system of supplying general goods, I was met with silence and contempt. Bitch Face often asked to take my pup out of my room to play with her, never calling her by her name just 'the dog'. I wasn't comfortable with this and told her that, but she kept asking. She would also spend hours in the bathroom often making me late for class or would use all of the hot water. She turned the apartment into a dictatorship by laying out more rules, complaining about things by writing a business styled letter, and refusing to acknowledge other opinions. I couldn't stand living in that ask I ended up staying more and more with my boyfriend. Bitch Face and I essentially became strangers by Jan 2015. I graduated on time with a 3.5 GPA, a fullly funded masters program to a world renowned school, and she was still a ways away from graduating and frequently failing courses.

I noticed that she and a few friends of hers that were also friends of mine started literally ignoring me right before graduation and this summer before I moved for grad school. I was back in the apt steadily around then. It was uncomfortable. I was frequently locked out of the apartment or the bathroom, found things I owned broken, and treated like I was invisible. I lived in silence for months, typically never recieving more than short and abrupt answers. I didn't know what was going on, so I asked her about it but I was assured that no problem existed even after she physically pushed me out of the doorway when I'd been locked out of the apartment for almost an hour. I was done at that point. I moved my stuff out slowly until my lease was up but the last day I was ever in the apartment, I over heard bitch face McGhee and her friend, Fat Skrillex, talking about his they would let someone murderr me in front of them and sit back and do nothing because I as a human being didn't matter. Then in the same breath they made commenst on how sexy and attractive my boyfriend was. All of this was because her ex anonymously left her a gift wrapped box full of shit, and she assumed it was from me. She also thought I was extremely jealous of her internship despite my own successes outweighed it in prestige, monetary and practical value, and exclusiveness. 

Tl;dr: best friend of 11 years turned into an untrustworthy, suspicious, disgusting slob and became a horrible human being over her projected jealousy and her own inability to communicate like a reasonable adult. Don't live with your Best friend, you might end up hating each other. "
3tp5ue,351,2015-11-21,"Why is everyone taking Steven Totillos word that it was ""publishing leaks"" that is the reason Kotaku was ""Blacklisted""? There is another much more real possibility, they don't want to be published in a trashy gossip rag.",Lpup,KotakuInAction,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3tp5ue/why_is_everyone_taking_steven_totillos_word_that/,"Why are we taking the word of Steven Totillo on why Kotaku was ""blacklisted""? Steven even says in his own article he has no confirmation as to why he was cut off by everyone at those companies, and that fact that not even one member of the staff is willing to come forward and speak up says something very different.
If this were a corporation blacklisting forbidding all employees from speaking up, there would be one intern, one production assistant, one ANYBODY who would be willing to come forward and say ""yeah look, they have us signing NDA agreements, no dice Kotaku"" as an anonymous source. Instead we got Totillo whining about what he speculates the reason why is (and somehow this all begins a year ago after GG? Not sayin these companies are GG, but they probably saw that Kotaku is garbage when they doubled down on saying fuck the audience, devs, and anyone not in our clique).
This is Totillo we are talking about. His accomplishments include:

* Defending his staff as labeling David Jaffe a misogynist 
* Defending Nathan Grayson after multiple proofs came out he was dating his subject and providing coverage to promote her
* Writing off Patricia Hernandez's entire garbage fuck ups as innocent mistakes
* Throwing a temper tantrum over DeepFreeze.it
* Not being accountable for the actions of his staff or what his staff shits out
* Justifying GameJournos pro as not comparisons and trying to whitewash gamers are dead narative pushing and buying gifts for their subjects

This isn't a guy who uses his Masters degree in journalism (Whatever that means anymore) to uphold ethics, standards and practices in journalism. He's more like a defense lawyer. He uses what ever knowledge he has to weasel his way out of whatever shit his client (Kotaku) got itself into. Have you ever seen a single instance of Kotaku controlling its writers rather than sending Totillo to the rescue to damage control to justify and minimize how unethically they mine for click? 

He's the lobbiest for Thank you for smoking, he's the Kock funded climate denying scientist, he's the Ford lawyer defending not paying an extra $12 per unit on a pinto to prevent rear end explosions, he's the asshole trying to defend click bait as ethical journalism.

Fuck Totillo. I hope you get shit canned when Gawker rebrands as a political site and never find work again because people remember you for what you are, a slimy greasy balding asshole who will do and say anything for a dollar."

3tpard,3,2015-11-21,Law student drowning in depression,casports923,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3tpard/law_student_drowning_in_depression/,"I come from a struggling single mother home and have battled substance abuse issues and financial struggles throughout my life. I was diagnosed ADHD and prescribed Adderall for law school and it was incredible at first. I was able to focus on my work and get through to my third year, but I lost relationships with old friends and family in the process. 

I became more and more isolated and ended up in a toxic relationship with a girl I met on a dating website (POF) to give me some companionship during law school while I lived at home in a stressful environment. I landed two of the most prestigious internships through hard networking, even though I was bottom of my class, (1L Summer Associate and served as an intern in federal government). I ended up so severely depressed my second year that my doctor had to put me on Lexapro 10 mg for my insane anxiety and depression that was preventing me from attending class without being a nervous wreck. It saved my life and I started taking care of myself more this past third and final year of law school, but it feels like I'm two years too late and majority of my job opportunities are gone. Although I feel more confident and less nervous on Lexapro, my ambition level has dropped off and it's become much harder to study but I can't seem to come off of it. 

I met with my doctor and he recommended that I stay on it and this is just part of the process and my personal life isn't making my situation easier. It's just hard for me to feel genuine confidence, when I've always tied it to jobs and now, with an enormous amount of debt, I'm back in the real world for good. I'm going to make an appointment to see a psychiatrist, but just wanted to vent on here incase anyone has had similar battles. Thanks for listening!"

When I am not in a coffee shop writing, I work as a consultant on terrorist financing &amp; money laundering, based in Paris, France – AMA!",DerekALeist,books,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3tpaze/author_spotlight_hi_redditors_im_derek_a_leist/,"Hi Redditors, 

Derek A. Leist here. After meeting the Queen of England, Chuck Norris, and George H.W. Bush (the elder Bush patriarch), I was inspired to do something awesome with my own life so after sitting on my manuscript for over two years, I published Caught in PRISM’s Web, available now on Amazon. Caught in PRISM’s Web debuted on Amazon at #13 in Hot New Releases for Political Thrillers &amp; Suspense until Newt Gingrich arrived on the scene...

Caught in PRISM’s Web begins in the sleepy college town of College Station, Texas with a soon-to-be college graduate, lost and looking to find his place in the world. The story follows the main protagonist, James Alan, as he is recruited out of college by the National Security Agency, following the explosive, anonymous revelations that a Vice President at one of Wall Street's most powerful financial institutions - and wife of a powerful Texas Congressman - is funneling foreign funds into American political campaigns for political favors and kickbacks. His best chance of staying alive may be the very people that he has come to rely on - a brilliant, young NSA cryptographer; a beautiful, young Wall Street intern and one of the most experienced intelligence officers that the United States government has ever had.

Currently, I work in Paris, France as a consultant on terrorist financing and money laundering (legally unable to mention the organization).  Unfortunately, we’ve been really busy lately due to the recent attacks here.

3tpbis,3,2015-11-21,"My (20F) unemployed boyfriend (24m) spends his days playing League of Legends...kinda pissed off at him for it, what should I do?",IdontevenlikeLeague,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tpbis/my_20f_unemployed_boyfriend_24m_spends_his_days/,"Hi everyone,


I love my boyfriend ""Dave"" but I'm getting really annoyed at him over how he's handling his unemployment. I'd like to get a bit of perspective to know if I'm out of line of not, and how I should react.


On to the story.


I have been dating Dave for three years, we met at university. We moved in together with roommates two years ago, but I spent the last school year away for an internship abroad and came back in August.


Dave was meant to repeat a few classes and graduate in December but ended up dropping out and getting a lower qualification but with a better overall grade, at the advice of his counsellor at school. Since then (September) he's toyed with several ideas (teaching, nursing, etc.) but never took any steps to make that happen. He said he'd get a retail job to pay the bills while thinking about what he wants to do with his life.


He is still unemployed, IMO because he hasn't tried very hard. It took him ages to do his CV and he plays League of Legends/ Pokemon all day while ignoring me a lot of the time when I come to talk to him. I don't think he's applied for more than a couple jobs.


The big problem (apart from seemingly not looking seriously for a job) is that it's impossible to talk to him about it. I've tried several approaches but he acts like he didn't hear me or goes to another room or gets annoyed...I can tell he's annoyed and wants to remove himself from the situation. But I feel like I'm enabling him if I allow him to ignore the issue! I mean, his parents are not going to be supporting him forever! And he wont get a satisfying life if it's spent in poverty or without worthwhile aims (you don't need to be super career-oriented but at least have a reason to get up everyday like...) He's quite an introverted/ avoidant person to begin with and I know I need to respect his space, especially if anxiety/ sense of low self-worth could be at play over the unemployment, but this problem is definitely not one that's gonna solve itself...


Now I don't want to tell him how to run his life, if he wants to be supported by his parents/ move back to his Dad's farm and help out there against room/board once he's broke it's his choice. But obviously since I would like to have a future with him it's a bit unsettling, we need money to have a future together! In addition, I am becoming increasingly resentful because I work really hard currently (finishing my degree and trying to decide whether to take a job offer or get in debt for a Masters) and feel like he gets to lounge around with no consequences because he thinks I'll become superrich and support him or something... I don't know.


Our country is currently in a not-so-good shape economically so I know it's hard because there's competition for even short-term retail jobs. But Dave's definitely not going to find a job by not trying??


Anyways, I know I've painted a pretty one-dimensional picture of Dave here but it's not like he's 'lazy' in other areas of life, for example he's very helpful with his parents, neighbours, takes care of me in many little ways and encourages me in my goals and personal growth, he cooks and does the laundry because he knows I hate it and I'm busy, he is extremely patient with my many emotional issues (bipolar mother + childhood abuse = very insecure daughter) etc. I think because he didn't do very well in college and then didn't study and then didn't do well, that he is in some kind of vicious anxiety/low self-esteem/ avoidance circle ??


If anyone has advice on this I'd be very happy to hear it...I'm happy to provide any other detail than can help if needed. Thanks in advance!!


   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has been unemployed for months and spends his days playing on his computer while ignoring me when I try to address the issue. Something's gotta give!"
3tpevj,1,2015-11-21,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3tpevj/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3tpj4p,1,2015-11-21,Future Plans...,Bstud0014,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3tpj4p/future_plans/,"Ok, so I'm about to graduate with a degree in accounting. I know I want to do Tax, and I also know I want to work in the West, preferably Denver. I have an internship in the Spring of 2016 with a local firm close to the University I am attending. Following graduation this December, I will start applying for a Masters program in the fall to get the necessary hours to take the CPA. 

Couple of questions:
1) Due to the fact that I want to work in Denver, should I try to attend a macc program in Colorado and get the CPA in Colorado as well? (I currently go to school in Alabama)
2) What are some key steps I can take from now until the end of my  internship (April) that I can take to hopefully secure a good position in a decent masters program?
3) Any tips on job searching for people in my position?
    - Hopefully by the end of this semester I will have a 3.0 overall      and upper-level GPA. Started freshman year as a Biochem major and my grades suffered tremendously. Last 3 semesters I have had above a 3.5 average GPA
    - Fairly Involved at my campus
   
I apologize for the long email, but I am stressing out kind of. 

TL;DR How to be successful in Accounting after graduation.

I'm majoring in CS or some other engineering program/business. One of the things I really want out of a school is a good location for internships and work. I think the experience and connections you get in internships during college is very important and contributes a lot to personal success. That being said, I'm curious as to how easy it is to get summer internships particularly in SLO. I know CA in general is fantastic but I'm more concerned about the opportunity present close to campus. Thanks. "
3tq2ww,43,2015-11-21,"A fear that by the time you get there, it's going to be too late and you'll miss out on all of the fun experiences.",mintberrycrunch111,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3tq2ww/a_fear_that_by_the_time_you_get_there_its_going/,"Preface- A fear I have along with some others about the game and getting older. That your value may go up, you may look more attractive, you may have more going for you, but you will be too old to enjoy a lot of those experiences that come with being a high value guy. More in detail in the post.

Body-

Life goes by fast for a lot of us Americans. It is just in high school that we are allowed to drive and in the second half of our college careers that we are allowed to legally drink for the first time in our lives. The thing is, a high value is required at all ages if you are a guy that wants to enjoy fun social experiences like being invited to cool parties, having sex with cute girls, and having an amazing social life. You need to be in great shape, have game, social respect, and a lot of those other things.

Here's the thing though, if most guys on here had that going for them, they wouldn't really need to come on this sub {exceptions exist}. The guy who is working on getting that nice body, his game because not all of us are naturals, and also his future because a lot of the better paying jobs require internships and good grades; he isn't the one enjoying all of those fun social experiences because he is just getting there.

But he is also missing out on the social experiences of some of the key years of his life if he is in college. He will never be around so many people his age who have some things in common with him, so many girls who are single and available,  a chance to be around people that are looking to make friends, and so many opportunities to do things like party and have some wild crazy experiences.

Then lets say at 30, the guy has it figured out. He looks better than he ever has, he has better game than ever, and he has some money to throw around. The issue is, now life has kicked in. Most of his good friends are now getting married, a lot of those single available girls have hit the wall or married, and he doesn't have nearly as much free time as his respectable job requires his dedication.

So many older guys here talk about how they had a fun time going on a peaceful trip to some random country all alone, how they enjoy being alone in their new house, and how they love their hobby of woodworking or yoga. But some of us don't want that. Some of us want those crazy nights where we get wasted, parties where we are there with out good friends and there are hot girls all over the place, amazing times with some good friends plus hot girls, and the amazing social experience which seems borderline impossible to get after college. Yet it seems like the red pill indirectly says that if you missed out on that in college, you will *never* get that as a guy after 30 and even attacks guys that want that kind of lifestyle.

For those of us who are in our teens and early 20s missing out on some fun social experiences because our value isn't high enough (we aren't in that certain fraternity or a college athlete), it almost feels like we will have to live with the fact that we will *never* get to have those fun social experiences later on in life. That our only destiny is being that older guy who has a high paying job, lives alone (instead of getting screwed over by divorce), and occasionally gets laid but doesn't really have a chance to have any of those fun social experiences despite having other resources around.

Deep down inside, this realize makes me want to be that 20 year old college kid without much money but a chance to make cool friends, go to fun parties, sleep with hot girls that love me, and only have to worry about stuff like classes rather than being that 30 year old with a six figure salary, lots of material possessions, but little to no social opportunities to enjoy the wild fun parties. 

So TRP, what advice do you have for younger guys in that situation with that worry?

Lesson learned-

Maybe being that successful older guy is not nearly what it is cut out to be."

I'm a computer science student at UNCC, looking for summer internships. I've been to the career fairs on campus, and have some interviews lined up - but I'm still looking because I want to have a backup plan just in case.

I'm writing this to ask if any of you know of smaller software development companies that are hiring interns. I'm new to the area, so I just don't know that much about the make up of the industry here yet.

Thanks!"

I have 2-3 years of IT operations experience, but after moving to Charlotte I decided to go back to school full-time and pursue a degree in Computer Science with the ultimate goal of becoming a Software Developer/Engineer. I'm very passionate about what I do, and have a number of side projects that I work on outside of class to learn new things.

I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2016. I'd also be interested in part-time software positions throughout the year.

Thanks for your time!"

3ttb7g,1,2015-11-22,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3ttb7g/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3ttnvc,3,2015-11-22,How to utilize my skills?,DiproJr,HowToHack,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/3ttnvc/how_to_utilize_my_skills/,"So i'm currently on an internship in an organisation doing IT Security at a bank, my course being Computer Forensics and Security.

I feel that I have a lot of the knowledge, and essential skills however I just don't know how to practice or apply my skills?

I've set up a VM which I will be using to learn how to attack and exploit however I just don't know how what targets to use? Whether I should set up another VM which i can use to exploit (however I don't feel this is effective as I would already know the vulnerabilities). I guess what i'm asking is, where do i go from here to apply/develop my skills?

I currently know PHP, Python, HTML, Java, C, C#, C++, Minor JavaScript, power shell, BASH scripting, and minor understanding of various other languages. I  have a fairly deep understanding of how computers work.

Any advice would be great, just need a direction to head i guess."
3tujha,7,2015-11-22,What should I do? :(,bromtek,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3tujha/what_should_i_do/,"Hello!

I'm a female student doing an exchange in the last (second) year of my master's degree at a new university in a different city/country. My parents have been divorced since I was still a toddler. Since that time, I have seen my father only twice. During this time, I have been living with my mom until two years ago when I moved out of our house into an appartment in the city where I studied. My mother also remarried recently. 

Before my parents got divorced my father was very unattentive towards me, he didn't care for me and he never paid any attention to me generally. He behaved the same way towards my mother as well. My childhood was not a happy one as it was full of arguing and physical abuse. When they got divorced, things got a bit better from that perspective but we were still arguing with my mother almost every day from a very young age until I was about 19 years old when we moved from the place where we lived at the time to a bigger place where both of us had more space and room for each other. 

Around the same time we moved out to the bigger place, I also started with college. I was studying hard and finished my  bachelor degree with a very good GPA. Then I continued doing my master's degree where I'm in my second year currently.

I was also a dancer since I was around 7 years old and was dancing until my 19th year. I also danced profesionally for two years during my bachelor's degree. 

When I was 16 years old I tried committing suicide for the first time. I had a major argument with my mother about some school-related things. I consumed a big amount of pills to end my life. My mother intervened and I ended up vomiting the pills in the end. Nothing happened after this, nor me or my mom did seek counselling or any other expert advice. Both of us had been constantly arguing throughout my childhood and both of us threatened to each other that we would commit suicide. 

The second time I tried committing suicide was when I got into an argument with my mother again about some college-related topic and the same thing followed – I ate a big amount of pills and my mother drove me to the emergency where I was helped. After this episode I was prescribed Zoloft antidepressants which helped me I think, as I did feel somewhat better when using them. 

Before trying to do end my life the second time, I started visiting a therapist. We mostly talked about my dancing, college, my mother, and my self-esteem.

That was the back-story, now to my current problems:

As stated above, I'm currently doing an exchange in another city with my boyfriend living in another country. We see each other around twice per month. I feel very lonely in this new city because I know very few people and don't have many physical friends over here. In the past, I have been busy with doing things (college, different activities, dancing) my whole life. In the first year of my master's degree I had a lot to do and I was extremely happy because even when I felt lonely I could distract myself with work and I didn't have time to think about how lonely I am in reality (despite I actually had friends in the first year which I could call and hang out). I need physical company of people to function normally. When I started thisexchange I had a lot of free time because I had very few courses and my internship needed a lot of time to properly take of so I had a lot of time to think about. The thing is, these feelings of loneliness and being completely alone have become paralyzing at the moment. I actually have a lot of things to do for my internship and in the past if I had this much to do I would be extremely happy because I wouldn't have to think about my loneliness anymore, but now it doesn't help. Despite having a lot to do, I'm just thinking about how lonely I am. 

What do you think I should do? I don't want to feel so lonely and don't know what to do about it :(

3tvgnw,2,2015-11-22,Commerce,devchaube,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/3tvgnw/commerce/,"So I just visited the Queens Fall Preview day and had a tour of the school (*loved it*). My tour guide even said to Torrent textbooks, which I loved! Anyways, I'll be applying to Queens for **Engineering** *and* **Commerce** for September 2016, and I have a few questions I'd like to ask right now, to you guys, the *current* students.

**1---** How do you guys find **Queens**, and why did you choose it (if you were applying to other Universities)?

**2---** I heard there is no co-op at Queens, so how do you guys get work experience, is it during Summer internships or part time work during the year?

**3---** How is res life, and which is a fun res to stay in, and are there cluster floors, for *Commerce* or *Engineering* students to stay in, or is it mostly spread out evenly for all types of programs in every res? I'll be 20 when I apply (looooooooong story), so I'm legal drinking age, so I think frosh is dry-week, but what about during the year, will I get in trouble if I have a beer or something in my room? 

**4---** What do you guys do on the weekends, do a lot of people go home every weekend or is it a monthly thing? I live 3-4 hours away, so yeah. Also, do people go to Toronto a lot for nights out, or weekend getaways? 

**5---** This is a specific question for **Commerce students**, so my tour guide was showing us some Commerce students and they all dressed really nicely and all the people in Goodes Hall / Smith School of Business also dressed really well, so I'm wondering how important is that, and is it just for a few days of the week, or should I be dressing like that every day? Also, what types of clothing should I bring, how much do Commerce students spend on clothing, should I 'blend in' and spend a similar amount, or go overboard? Also, for all graduated Commerce students, how did you find your money was spent, was it worth it? Is it okay to 'splurge' a little when you're in Commerce, and going to recruiting events and such? 

**6---** Is it important or useful to have a car on campus? I noticed Queens is relatively close to downtown, and there's a bus pass in the fee, but since I could afford a car, is it useful to get one, or nah? What about for recruiting events for Commerce students, are they all held in Queens, or in Toronto, and are there busses that go there?

That's basically it for now, I'll ask some more as I figure out more things to ask! Thanks for the help! 

Also, I took a pretty swell picture of Goodes Hall yesterday, if you wanna see it ^^ [Instagram Link - Goodes Hall Picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/-X4TDfGtN6/?taken-by=devchaube)

dear god I hope I got this formatting right, also *shoutout* to **Matt Renzoni**, dude was such a dope tour guide for the Commerce building and program, learned a lot of stuff I didn't know and couldn't find out online"
3tvmgw,0,2015-11-22,Should I move back to Sweden after university in the US?,fridhemsplan_fisting,sweden,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/3tvmgw/should_i_move_back_to_sweden_after_university_in/,"My parents are both Swedish. For my parents' work we were forced to move to the US (from Sweden) when I was young. I have dual Swedish and US citizenship since I have lived in the US most of my life. Every summer (and most winters and spring breaks) I go visit family in Sweden so I am quite familiar with Stockholm as I have spent a lot of time there. However I have went to English speaking schools my whole life and my parents speak English in the house so my Swedish is not good. I can read and understand 95% of what people speak but I have a lot of problems with speaking (mostly confidence issues).

Anyway, I am finishing my fourth year of university here in the US at a pretty good university in California and I will have a bachelor of science in computer engineering with a lot of internship and work experience (with a lot of the work experience being in Stockholm over the past couple of summers). I graduate in around 6 months. I am debating whether or not I should move back to Sweden and live there. 

I am honestly not the biggest fan of living in the California. Sure, the weather is nice all the time but rent is expensive and I am not a fan of the shit work-life balance and garbage vacation times that a lot of companies offer, even as a software developer. In Sweden work-life balance is much better, vacation time is much better, and the workers unions actually get shit done. Also the tax rate is fucking high here. I have an offer for $95,000/year in the silicon valley (820,000 SEK/yr) but I will be paying almost 40% tax on that. In Sweden I'd be paying more tax, but at least you get a lot back for your taxes. In the US you get absolutely jack shit. Nothing.

I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation before and would have any tips. Even people who haven't been in this situation but live in Sweden, I would love to hear some feedback on what you think. A lot of my family friends (who are also engineers) have moved to the US for a few years prior to having kids and they all moved back to Sweden because they believed while the US is a nice place to live for a few years, Sweden is a better place to settle down and have kids. That's kind of my motivation right now. As well as the fact that I have a lot of family in Stockholm (and nobody in the US except my parents) and I do miss them all.

So I have a couple of loose questions if anyone has any feedback:

* What is the market right now for software developers in Stockholm?
* What are the downsides to living in Sweden compared to the US, and what are the upsides?
* If you could move to the US, why would you want to? What is so appealing about the US? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this guys! Have a slice of prinsesstårta for me next time you go to the cafe :)"
3tw1ha,1,2015-11-22,Lonely &amp; confused. Just want to pack up and leave.,pleasegetmeout99,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3tw1ha/lonely_confused_just_want_to_pack_up_and_leave/,"Growing up as an Asian-American, I always thought I was a good kid. Until high school, when I started experimenting with marijuana. Starting then, I fought with my parents more, and my life has actually gone in a downward spiral (not just because of weed).



Since I was a good kid, I studied hard in high school and got into a good university. My mom wanted me to become a doctor and my dad wanted me to become a lawyer; I wanted to do neither, so I just went into engineering without really thinking about it. Don't know why i chose electrical engineering because I hated it, but I tried to do it for 3 years. During those 3 years, I started smoking a lot more and lost a lot of motivation for school. After my junior year, I actually withdrew and took a break. Luckily enough, I was able to travel a bit on my break to clear my head. Currently, I haven't been in school for 3 semesters now. I'm not in class now because, for some reason, I tried to come back as an electrical engineering student and withdrew again to switch to computer science (had a couple internships in it and I actually enjoy programming). Except, I'm jumping into the hardest CS course next semester, school won't let me retake the prereq to review, so I'm studying the prereq myself until next semester. Hopefully I can do it? The worst part about school is the guilt that I have. I just feel like I owe my parents so much since we aren't well off, I won't be getting much aid after next semester, and I have at least 3-4 semesters left since I took a break. I just feel like I owe them something, but they always tell me to just take my time and get my degree.



Now my love life. I came into college and didn't really hook up with a lot of girls, which killed my self esteem. I grew up overweight and went from 240 to 180 pounds before college. People around me told me I dressed well and looked good blablabla. I got my first ""serious"" girlfriend over the summer and she was surprised that I hadn't had many girlfriends and/or hookups either. The unfortunate truth is that I'm just shitty with girls. I just can't talk to them because I grew up shy and not talking to people unless I was close to them. Tinder sucks. I'm not a bland boring person, I just have to get comfortable with someone for me to open up. I'm trying to change that but it's hard. At least I've been hitting the gym for the past 2 months so maybe I'll have more luck in the future. People say to just interact with random girls I see. Isn't it weird if a random guy is just smiling at you? Isn't it creepy if a guy just comes up to you and tells you you're beautiful? Maybe I overthink too much.



It just kind of sucks. Most/all of my friends will have graduate by May. I'm going to have 3-5 semesters left once that comes by. Which is a good/bad thing because I'll be able to focus on school but I also have the urge to go out and meet new people, but I feel like I can't do that on my own. I want to meet girls but people in my college town are cliquy and also tend to stick to their races. I just want to pack up and move to a big city somewhere and just get a job, but I know the right thing to do is to finish my degree."
3tw1nd,2,2015-11-22,"Feel lost in life, I'm afraid I'll just collapse back to gaming to fill the void.",ontomarin,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/3tw1nd/feel_lost_in_life_im_afraid_ill_just_collapse/,"Hello, I just now discovered this sub and even though I'm not at the peak of gaming addiction right now like I used to, I feel like sharing my story because I too wasted years trying to fill my empty life with games and I think I'm just on the verge of giving up on myself forever and go back to gaming in order to numb myself and forget everything going on around me and about me.

I don't know what to expect, I know if I want to change only I can bother to do anything about it. The problem is I just don't care about improving my life. I just feel unmotivated and clueless at this point. I guess I just need to write about it or gather different perspectives. Well a little background first if you care to listen.

I'm 25 YO male, single son and live with my mother. When I was born, most of my family lived under the same roof. My maternal grandparents, my grandaunt, my parents, and one of my uncles, my mother's younger brother (she has 2 more brothers who had already married). In a short amount of time, from age 3 to age 5, three of those died: my father, my grandfather and my grandaunt. My mother never had another relationship again. Then at age 11 my grandmother died and my uncle got married too, so our house was sold and I moved to a new place with my mom. 

I remember my childhood with fondness, like perhaps most people who had a regular infancy, but mostly because it felt like I was more ""loved"" or at least I had more with interaction with family members. Now it's just me and my mother and no one else cares (more on that later).

During my childhood I was always the smart kid in class, having the high grades and appreciated by the teachers, but the matter of fact is that my life was all about studying and being on PC all the time, while my colleagues and friends had other hobbies and activities, so of course it was easy for me to excel in school. The problem is my mother had to work to sustain me and she never had a car of her own or driver's license, so as much as she wanted me to have a third activity, it was very complicated to make it happen. She herself takes 4 buses everyday to and from work to home. 

I wouldn't say my family is the closest, it's more like each household for itself. I get to see my younger cousins by holidays, like Christmas, Easter, birthdays. When I moved to my current apartment with my mother at 11, I lost contact with almost all my childhood friends except 1, who finished college with me. I had two more close friends during highschool but meanwhile all three got girlfriends and lives of their own so we are all kinda separated.

Anyway, the consequence of all this is that I grew up having my PC as my best friend. As my hobby. As my entertainment. My life has always been school -&gt; PC -&gt; bed -&gt; school. When I got to college, it was more or like the same thing, even though it became harder to get high grades while wasting hours playing instead of studying. I don't know, but maybe I would've had an excellent performance and guaranteed future if I had applied myself. Instead I ended up with a good but not great or very noticeable track. 

With no perspectives of a job in my area, my mother paid me a Masters degree, which I ended up doing with some difficulty as my levels of procrastination increased even more. After finishing it I got a 6 month internship which was not renewed for the second half of this year, so one could say I'm currently unemployed. Which means bored. Which means avid to just immerse myself in a virtual reality.

You know, what really makes me a bit depressive about my whole life right now is that I never really got to grow up. Now I'm already 25 and feel like a kid. I still behave like a kid who just wants to spend the day gaming. Because the reality is I think my brain is just so accostumed to that way of life. Just sitting down looking for interaction and entertainment and purpose and accomplishment on a PC rather than in real life. I should add that this way of life has led me to obesity, I'm on the verge of severe obesity and get more and more inactive as I get older. I remember being fat my whole life, even though I only started to gain weight at age 8. I've tried to lose weight before and I did but never really enough to stop feeling fat. So it adds to the fact that I'm totally socially inapt the fact that I'm fat and lazy and addicted to PC even when not gaming. I rarely feel like waking up ready to take on a new day, because there are no perspectives for me in real life. I just don't bother with outside world, I just don't care. I became this very quiet person who rarely feels like talking. I just think everything to myself.

I still don't know how to live properly, I don't care about work, I don't care about studies anymore. I'm not someone who stands for himself, I rather avoid confrontation and keep myself shut. I am very cozy, I never want to leave my apartment unless I have to. I currently have no friends. I never succeeded getting a girlfriend. Tried a couple times but got rejected in the end after a period of friendzone. Yeah, still a fat lazy virgin bastard with no friends who is completely clueless about what the fuck he is supposed to do in life. It's no surprise that no one cares to even call me or text me. I even deleted my facebook account 3 months ago because I just never had any feedback from friends to my posts, which were very few to be honest. But no one cared that I was gone from there either way. 

As I said, I feel like I never grew up. I don't feel 25, I behave the same way I did when I was 12. I just want to stay on PC all day. And inevitably, with this period of unemployment, it will become worse. I'm not actively trying to look for other activities because, you know, comfort zone. Just I don't know, I feel lost. And my brain thinks getting back to long sessions of gaming is the only purpose of life.

They introduced my to their other friends and I went to their home in the countryside for the 4th of July!

Games: Fallout 4, Skyrim, Battlefront, Civ 5

Work: Creo Parametric 3.0, ANSYS, Fluent, AutoDesk, MATLAB

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$1000

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I'll be building next year sometime in February when I've paid off all my debts/gotten savings accrued. I don't mind out of date information, but I'd like to start looking at stuff in case Cyber Monday/Black Friday provides some good deals. 

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything but OS, keyboard, and mouse

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

USA. Micro center?

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Generic Microsoft keyboard from early 2000. I'll update it sometime.

Etekcity Scroll X1

Windows 7/8/10 (University provides all)

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Yes, down the line. I think a CPU and GPU would be best if I'll be doing renders of large files (ANSYS fluid streamline rendering is a little graphics heavy).

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I've heard SSD helps in starting up large files, like CAD projects, that I may be working on. Otherwise, N/A

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No preferences. It's mostly for performance.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Nope

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Hi everyone! So I'm an engineer who just got an internship and can finally afford to build a home computer that will allow me to do some work, and gaming, at home instead of resorting to a computer lab. I'm looking at a budget between $750 and $1000, and will be learning/building as I go. I probably won't actually just pick up a pre-made build and roll with it, but I just wanted to submit here to see what some industry standard ideas would be!

Thanks in advance everyone! 

EDIT: Priority in upgradeability. I feel like I'll build this computer and gradually upgrade/replace parts whenever I need to. "

I hope this hasn't been asked a million times, but the search function revealed relatively little.  I have what must be a fairly standard question.

I have been a computer nerd since I got my first 486 at the age of 13.  Since then, I got a B.S. in CS and physics and then went ABD on a Ph.D. in physics so I could work as a software engineer in Silicon Valley.  I am still in the SF Bay Area and I work independently as an engineer. 

Starting a few years ago, I have become increasingly interested in computer security and forensics.  Now that I work independently, I have the time to pursue this interest more seriously.  

I want to know how I can learn more about this field.  Are there books that might serve to describe what must be a fairly broad field?  What do jobs look like in this industry?  How can I best use the knowledge I have accumulated over the last decade and a half of tinkering and professional engineering to get into this field formally (via internships or contract work, for example)?

Any input will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance!"

right now i have an Internship for my Computer Science study.
Im searching for an Layer 2 Switch for standard tasks like VLAN and LAG.
It should have min 48 Gigabyte Ethernetports and a good Managment because there will be all kind of Traffic (Storage, Wlan Clients, Office, IP-Telephone).

I was thinking about the Hewlett Packard 2530 or the Cisco SG 200/300.
Anyone of you got a suggestion?
Did someone already used one of these switches?

Until high school, when I started experimenting with marijuana. Starting then, I fought with my parents more, and my life has actually gone in a downward spiral (not just because of weed).



Since I was a good kid, I studied hard in high school and got into a good university. My mom wanted me to become a doctor and my dad wanted me to become a lawyer; I wanted to do neither, so I just went into engineering without really thinking about it. Don't know why i chose electrical engineering because I hated it, but I tried to do it for 3 years. During those 3 years, I started smoking a lot more and lost a lot of motivation for school. After my junior year, I actually withdrew and took a break. Luckily enough, I was able to travel a bit on my break to clear my head. Currently, I haven't been in school for 3 semesters now. I'm not in class now because, for some reason, I tried to come back as an electrical engineering student and withdrew again to switch to computer science (had a couple internships in it and I actually enjoy programming). Except, I'm jumping into the hardest CS course next semester, school won't let me retake the prereq to review, so I'm studying the prereq myself until next semester. Hopefully I can do it? The worst part about school is the guilt that I have. I just feel like I owe my parents so much since we aren't well off, I won't be getting much aid after next semester, and I have at least 3-4 semesters left since I took a break. I just feel like I owe them something, but they always tell me to just take my time and get my degree.



Now my love life. I came into college and didn't really hook up with a lot of girls, which killed my self esteem. I grew up overweight and went from 240 to 180 pounds before college. People around me told me I dressed well and looked good blablabla. I got my first serious girlfriend over the summer and she was surprised that I hadn't had many girlfriends and/or hookups either. The unfortunate truth is that I'm just shitty with girls. I just can't talk to them because I grew up shy and not talking to people unless I was close to them. Tinder sucks. I'm not a bland boring person, I just have to get comfortable with someone for me to open up. I'm trying to change that but it's hard. At least I've been hitting the gym for the past 2 months so maybe I'll have more luck in the future. People say to just interact with random girls I see. Isn't it weird if a random guy is just smiling at you? Isn't it creepy if a guy just comes up to you and tells you you're beautiful? Maybe I overthink too much.



It just kind of sucks. Most/all of my friends will have graduate by May. I'm going to have 3-5 semesters left once that comes by. Which is a good/bad thing because I'll be able to focus on school but I also have the urge to go out and meet new people, but I feel like I can't do that on my own. I want to meet girls but people in my college town are cliquy and also tend to stick to their races. I just want to pack up and move to a big city somewhere and just get a job, but I know the right thing to do is to finish my degree. It's just hard to gain the motivation to do well. I just want to get my degree, move, and meet a girlfriend, but I feel like it'll be almost impossible to meet a girlfriend once I get a job unless my job is at a big company. How do people even meet other people out of college? Am I even going to be able to get a job after college? Maybe I worry too much."

I was able to right the ship so to speak last year when I began an MBA program at age 30. I was very excited for the future. I've had varied work experience, education and have done a good amount of traveling. I felt my life was on the right track. However, since last spring, I've seen my self-esteem plummet. I think this was the result of having trouble finding an internship and the high levels of stress from academics. I eventually secured a great internship but my lack of self-worth did not improve, it actually got worse over the summer. 

Another big factor is a relationship I started at the beginning of this year. I am seeing a woman that's 5 years younger than me, beautiful and extremely successful for her age. She's managed to buy an investment property, to save money and to see solid career progression. While I'm happy for her, I also feel inadequate compared to her. I'm going to graduate this December with roughly $20,000 in student debt and am still looking for a job. I feel being able to become financially secure is still a ways away for me. This is tearing me up knowing that there are many people that got their start much earlier than me and have seen a lot more success. It's taken me a while to get to the point where I know what I want to do vocationally, the journey has not been a straight line by any means and has included changing careers in my mid-20s, a period of unemployment at the beginning of the 2008/9 financial crisis and some very serious family issues during my mid and late 20s. 

The thing is that I am not a very materialistic person. I don't have dreams of driving a Porche or living in a huge house. Those things don't do anything for me. But it just feels like such a struggle to even carve out a financial secure life for myself.

I have been journaling, started meditating and have a few close friends that have been excellent in terms of supporting me emotionally. I'm really grateful for that. I eat well and exercise regularly (although not for the past week and a half due to an injury but I'm back at the gym tonight!). All these things help for sure but I find not close to the point where I can get myself out of this rut of comparisons and feels of low self-worth.

Just writing my feelings down here has helped a bit and I appreciate you reading these thoughts I'm trying to get off my chest.

I'm open to any advice and there is no need to sugar coat things, I can handle direct advice that I may not want to hear but need to."

Female superior at work has the ear and trust of the CFO at the company I work at. My aloofness and relaxed err, that works so well with women I'm seeking to be sexually active with, has made it seem to her that I lack urgency and I need to care about my job more. In reality it is quite the opposite. I take immense pride in the work I do, doing it well, and having it done promptly.

I had a very good working and personal relationship with a male boss of mine at a past internship. We would shoot the breeze and make jokes (he actually introduced me to game which was exactly what I needed at a time of desperate pussy-ness). He understood that I sought to have fun at work but when it came down to it i could be serious. He said that although our relationship worked, in my future endeavours I should keep it more professional. Having that trinket of knowledge, I came into my current job taking it very seriously, which was good, or so I thought. 

Supervisor Bio: 35-ish, reasonably fit, divorced with 2 kids - who are shit heads from what I hear her talking about over the phone with their teachers, laughs obnoxiously in her cubicle at any available chance, exclaims ""I'm baaaaack"" or ""byyyye"" whenever she enters or leaves the office. 

All other men in the office will entertain her shenanigans with flamboyant hellos and goodbyes and comments like ""I wish my meetings were that fun."" I however will say hello and goodbye but I will certainly not match her energy or comment on her unprofessionalism. 

I recently had a meeting with my her where she said I had to be more urgent and take my job more seriously. Obviously taken aback by the accusations, the tone of the conversation got a little tense. There wasn't anything inappropriate but there has been tension in between us since.

I've never had a female boss at a job that wasn't part-time retail and I've never had the issues I am having with her with a male boss.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong by only treating her like I would treat a male boss and not reacting to her immature outbursts?"

I have literally no idea how I'm going to pay for this next step of my life, unfortunately. I'm trying to look at programs that result in a master's degree, or at least give some credit, so that I can qualify for student loans to cover my tuition for school/internships, and my living costs. 

I guess I have a few questions, and I'd love any feedback that anyone has for me! Do I need to be considered ""full time"" as a grad student to get loans? (Also, I've found conflicting info on what is full time for grad school - does it depend on the school?)

My parents won't be financing this for me at all, so it's up to me to figure out how to pay for it all. How did you guys pay for it? Is it reasonable to take out a private loan to pay for the tuition and living expenses? I don't plan on working during that time and don't have much of a savings.

I'm getting pretty nervous, and it's looking like I'm going to have to make a pretty big move for a DI, I've been trying to figure out anything I can do to make it more possible for me to pay for it. Any help/advice would be great!!"

I've been battling with this decision since September and I'm still just stuck in the stagnant waters of indecisiveness so any advice/opinions would be appreciated.

I graduated from a great university with my B.S. in Conservation Biology in May of 2014. I stuck around my college town to do a few summer internships, and got a job that wasn't in my field in between summers. After my internship ended this summer, I moved back home because my boyfriend wanted a break (we had been living together for the last few years, together for 7) and have been in a pretty miserable place as I am unemployed and uninspired. 

I have a few options now and I can't figure out which one I want more:

1. Stay here in the suburbs, live for free, try to find some bullshit job for the time being. Positive side of this is that most of my friends live around here as well, but they are all busy with their own lives and I'm not sure how long they will all be around anyways. Also, I do not have a lease so if something better were to come about, I can drop things pretty easily and go off to pursue a job more worthwhile.

2. Move back to my college town where my (ex) boyfriend lives. We have been seeing each other since I moved back here and there, but every time I ask him if it'd be a good idea for me to keep looking for jobs in the area he seems indifferent. I mostly think its because he doesn't want me to make my decisions based on him, which I can understand. But I really do miss that city and I believe it has more job prospects for me, even if they aren't in my field. This would require, however, that I find my own place to live (and cost of living there is not cheap). I have thought about asking my old retail job if I can come back to work there for the time being until I find something better, but then I'd have a lease that I would have to get out of if something came up elsewhere.

3. Move away. I have been pulled toward SW Florida because the weather is lovely and my field is pretty prominent there. I have also been thinking about Portland, Oregon. Don't know why, just think it would be a cool place for awhile. BUT I have nothing job-wise set up in either place, and again, this would require I find my own place to live and with no guarantee of a job, that is daunting.

TL;DR: Move away to a different state with no real plan, stay in the suburbs and try to make it out of unemployment, OR move back to my college town (which I loved) with nothing solid planned but potentially better job prospects? 

What would you do?"

3u04ek,2,2015-11-23,"My [22F] boyfriend [23M] hid a parking ticket from me he got while using my car, never paid it. I feel done.",Throwaway0785,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u04ek/my_22f_boyfriend_23m_hid_a_parking_ticket_from_me/,"So I guess I'll start at the beginning. Sorry for the length.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year, and after my roommate left, we decided he would move in with me about 5 months ago. 

I'm a university student, and he's working part time and going to community college part time after having dropped out a few years ago. He commutes to work/school, but our apartment's close to my campus and I work as a freelance journalist, so I don't use my car often. 

In late August, his car broke down, and the repairs looked pricey. Fortunately, his dad offered to fix it. In the meantime, I offered him my car. My summer job and internship had ended, and I had 2 weeks before classes started, so I didn't really need it during the day. I figured it'd be done in a week or two, tops. He was appreciative and promised it wouldn't be long. 

Long story short, I finally got my car back when his got finished two weeks ago. November 6th. Yep. 11 or so weeks later. I had been missing out on work, because occasionally they'd ask me to cover meetings at short notice. I felt stir crazy, stuck in the apartment all the time, I couldn't even run to the grocery store or the bank because they're outside walking distance. He started taking my car to go out instead of getting rides, and stopped asking if he could take the car to go out, and probably about once a week went out right after work without even letting me know. Kinda annoying in itself, but when I'm waiting to go to the store, it's really uncool. I felt used and I finally gave him an ultimatum, and his car got finished in the next week.  It should've been earlier, but I'm kind of a bleeding heart and I could really emphasize with how stressed he'd been and didn't want to add another thing to his list and make him feel shitty by bugging him about it constantly. 

Our relationship improved when I had my car back. I didn't feel stuck and cooped up at home, there was a lot less stress and resentment, I wasn't nagging him every week to get his car shit together. But he'd treated my car like shit. It was full of garbage, and still is because I haven't had time to clean it all out, he didn't get the oil change it needed way back in October, and he didn't tell me how bad the tires had gotten. I replaced the tires, but my plan was to have him take care of the oil change because he drove it a ton and I didn't almost at all. He also put a ton of miles on it, and it's nearing the end of its life, so that sucked. I can't afford to replace it anytime soon - I'm graduating next month and I'm still job hunting. 

And then earlier this afternoon, I got a text from my mom(she owns the car. She was fine with him borrowing it, btw, I asked her). A bill had arrived for a parking ticket from November 2nd, on the side street of my boyfriend's college. Confused, I confronted him about it, and he admitted it was his. I asked him why he hadn't told me, and he said he thought id be mad. I can be hot headed sometimes, but come on, a parking ticket? I got one when I was running errands a month before that and complained about it. It's super hard to park in our city, everybody gets them. I hate when he says that, he makes me out to be some psycho bitch that I'm not. Anyway. I asked why he hadn't paid it, and he said he'd been planning, since getting the ticket, on paying it tomorrow. Apparently tomorrow was his plan all along. Sure. I got pretty mad because it was clearly another lie, and not a very good one. He had to leave for work and I told him to call me on his way because I needed to talk about this. He didn't, so I called him. He got mad and told me I was overreacting, and basically just acted really condescending and annoyed. I brought up this bs about him planning on it tomorrow and he admitted he'd forgotten to pay it. I got mad and I'll admit it, I yelled. A lot. Not only did he keep this from me for almost a month, he lied when I confronted him, he wasn't responsible enough to pay the bill, and he left me and my mom with what could've been real consequences. I don't know how it works, but if I got pulled over and then had outstanding tickets on my car, I could get in trouble, right? If he'd left it longer without telling me. And I'm embarrassed that my mom had to see it. It's not that she'd be mad or anything like that, and she knew he was borrowing it, but I didn't tell her how long it had gone on, I was ashamed I couldn't handle the situation. He yelled back that I was overreacting, and I tried to compose myself, and asked him to just listen for a minute, so I could explain why I thought it was a big deal, since he didn't. He hung up on me. 

So now I'm sitting on my couch angrily typing this. I'm wondering if I should even bother and just dump him - this isn't the first hiccup for us, and we have a few other issues. I don't think our personalities work well together, we don't have the chemistry I've had with guys in my past relationships. But we also live together in a one bedroom apartment, I can't exactly kick him out, and I have nowhere else to stay. I can't afford to break the lease before I graduate in a few weeks. I don't know what we'll be after that. But on the other hand, I'm speaking out of anger. And I love him. And we get along well, more or less, have similar interests. But I'm just not sure I'm happy.

I guess my answer is, should I break it off?  I think I need to hear it from someone else. My former roommate is my best friend but we haven't been in touch much since she moved, and I don't talk about this kind of stuff with my guy friends. I don't have anyone to really share this kind of dating crap with, and it's really tough on me sometimes. Am I really overreacting? Has anyone been in a similar situation, stuck in a lease with something they don't want to date anymore? Our lease expires in August, and it's really hard to find a subletter for spring and summer in a college town. It would also be weird because we have almost exclusively mutual friends and hangouts. 

I'm exhausted, /r/relationships, and I need some advice. The ticket feels like the last straw on top of a pile of other shit, but I don't know how to deal with the lease. What do I do? 



 tl;dr: boyfriend lied about getting a ticket while using(and taking advantage of) my car, and kept it from me for almost a month, until my mom got a bill in the mail. Feels like the last straw, but I'm tied into a very long lease and can't afford to break it. What do I do?"
3u09xd,1,2015-11-23,25M4F - Big guy for a bratty girl,Josu_T,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3u09xd/25m4f_big_guy_for_a_bratty_girl/,"Hey DPP, been a while since I posted here. Today I'm looking for something fairly simple and quick, but I have a few ideas to share. I'm looking for a girl who will become submissive, but be a bit difficult at first.

Idea 1: You are the daughter of a wealthy family. You are an only child, smart, strong willed, and sexy. You know all of these things and you use them to get your way. You also enjoy destroying all your competition in sports. You are so talented that you hardly need to work to beat the girls your age and even the guys your age are no real challenge. So you want to move to the next stage. The problem is, that requires work and you don't want to work. I am the fifth coach you've had in the last three months. I'm 25, fit, big, strong, and smart, but I have an injury that prevents me from competing at the top level. I'm determined to make you into a star, but you don't want to do everything I tell you to do. So you're going to try to do what you've done to all of your past coaches. You're going to make me quit, or get me fired. What you don't know is what I might do once I realise there is no hope of keeping my job.

This can be short term, just one scene that happens before I get fired. It can also be long term where you end up really enjoying what I do and start to become my submissive little slut. I keep my job and you keep a coach who makes you happy and will turn you into a star player. The sport can be anything, though the idea came as tennis.


Idea 2: I work as the only lifeguard at a small pool either on private property with a lot of guests, or for a gated community. My days are spent watching old people sunbathing in outfits far too skimpy, kids breaking all the rules and constantly disobeying me, or teens and young adults practically fucking in my pool. Some of the more attractive girls will even try to distract or tease me. You, however, are the biggest pain I've ever had to deal with. Not only are you totally my type, but you also cause the most problems. You are a distraction whether you want to be or not, and you use my pool and the pool house for things you shouldn't be doing when I can't stop you or when I don't know. Yet now I have proof. I set up a camera in the pool house and got a few good pictures that I know you won't want seen by anyone else.

What are you doing in private? What am I going to require for my silence? Is it a one time payment, or do I now have you for as long as I want you?

Idea 3: You just got an internship in an office. This is not what you want to be doing with your time, but you have no choice. I am in my fourth year of working for this company full time. Oh, and lucky me, I just finished my last project and have been assigned to something big and brand new. I also get the joy of training the intern for the next couple of weeks. I have a lot of work to do, a lot of people to meet with and a lot of forms to fill out and you don't seem to want to do anything. I would ask to move you to someone else, but there is no one else who can do it. I'd suggest letting you go for not doing your work, but you seem to have some connection and you're not losing this internship. So we're stuck together. Even worse, my girlfriend was cheating on me and I just found out and dumped her. My life sucks. I need to do something to make it better and I think it starts with you.

--------------------

There are my ideas for today. Let me know if any of them catch your interest. I'm up for most things in a roleplay. I don't do any kind of cheating and I don't do family stories. Bathroom play and excessive violence are out too."

I've been lurking here for quite a while, and am ready to jump on this new eating lifestyle. A bit of background: I work a part-time internship for my online degree and am also a full-time nanny. I simply do not spend much time at home, so I don't keep very many groceries there except for those my boyfriend will eat throughout the week.

Because of this, I'm looking into Keto Chow. I know I'm the type of person that can be satisfied without ""real food"" three times a day. The thing is, I want to get the materials to make it on my own, and am a little confused as to how I should tailor it to my intake needs.

I want to use [this recipe](https://diy.soylent.com/recipes/keto-chow-104-master-rich-chocolate) but how would I alter the quantities to fit my calorie intake for the day? 

I've estimated that I have roughly 105 lbs of lean body mass, and therefore went with a goal of 80g of protein per day. However, i'm also open to suggestions from those of you know know more about this. I listed myself as moderately active because I am on my feet all day at my internship and job, plus I lift three times a week and take 3-4 cardio and yoga classes a week. Does this selection seem appropriate?

3u0o41,0,2015-11-23,Just started college - So you want to be an Actuary,RathkeSR,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/3u0o41/just_started_college_so_you_want_to_be_an_actuary/,"Hello all,

The first semester of my college career is coming to an end and needless to say, it's been a rough one. After numerous medical issues and personal problems, I have found myself ending my Fall semester with a rather lousy GPA. (somewhere around 2.000) However, I am looking forward to the Spring Semester and have changed my major to Finance (Insurance Emphasis) with an Actuarial Science minor (my university does not offer an actuarial science major). With this new year, comes a new me, and I believe that I can turn things around. With all that being said, I have some questions:

-When should I start applying for internships? 
-What kind of internships should I apply for? 
-When should I be taking my P and FM exams? 
-I'm aware of it being beneficial to have programming knowledge. I've taken computer science courses in high school and have a very basic understanding of Java, C++, and VBA. However, I am rather rusty when it comes to writing code now. Is it okay to wait until I take my computer science courses (Junior/Senior year)? Or should I be brushing up ASAP in preparation for internships?
-I'd call myself pretty computer savvy, and I know the basics of excel. Should I be practicing more with excel to get more experience with it?
-I currently have a research job at my university, however it's medicine related. A perk to this job is using excel. A disadvantage to this job is using excel just for organizing data. I'm aware of the importance of excel in the everyday life of an actuary, is organizing data a common occurrence/even relevant? Or is it more so equations and mathematical models?

These questions, while some are more geared towards my specific situation, are not only for my benefit, but for anyone interested in becoming an actuary.

I thank you for your time and thoughts in advance.

&lt;edit&gt; my apologies for the poor format, this is my first post on reddit

3u0tyb,1,2015-11-23,Advice needed about my Deloitte offer and GPA,alice2413,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3u0tyb/advice_needed_about_my_deloitte_offer_and_gpa/,"I received an offer from Deloitte 1 year ago and accepted. The office is small, but connected to a large branch. At the time, I was finishing my undergrad in Accounting - GPA 3.3. I graduated with the same GPA and began a masters' program at a different uni. Without going into detail, I had a heck of a year, due to some huge family issues continuing well into the summer.  I continued to work in my internship (40 hours/week), and I've also taken 2 CPA exams (taking my 3rd next week). 

My GPA was terrible in the first semester (2.9). The university recognized the severe stress I was under and gave me another chance to finish my degree. I'm happy to say that I am doing very well this semester, and plan to have at least a 3.5 this term, bringing things up to a 3.0, possibly in the 3.2-5 range after completing my final 2 general (non accounting) classes in the spring. 

Deloitte is finishing my background check now, and I realize I should tell my recruiter about my year soon. How would I even go about telling them? I want to be honest about it while also assuring them that I am progressing much better now and will be a reliable part of the team. Any advice? Honestly, I'm shaking in my boots right now just thinking about this. I know a lot of the issues I faced were outside of my control, but I need this job so badly and I've worked so hard for it. I've completed the 150 credits to become a licensed CPA and will finish the exams soon, if that helps. Since my offer was made during my undergrad, I was told by my uni's business career center that the academic standing part pertained to my undergrad, and that the company was more concerned with my 150 credit hours and CPA progress. Is this true?
I have some excellent reviews from my current managers and have been here for 2 years. I'm sure they would vouch for me if needed. Would I need to go that far? Scared :("
3u0wy6,3,2015-11-23,(IRE) 20 M BSc Computer Science Undergrad wondering what to aim for after college,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3u0wy6/ire_20_m_bsc_computer_science_undergrad_wondering/,"Hey, so I'm mid existential crisis right now. Just slightly freaking out about what to do after college. I'm in my 3rd year of a 4 year computer science degree in an Irish university. I'm lucky enough not to have any student debt but I want to start planning for the future. 

I currently work as a bartender part-time in a nightclub in town that nets me ~€90/week. I live at home for college so that's plenty to survive and thrive on, I'm happy with that for now. In March I'll be moving to Dublin for a 6 month internship paying €2500/month gross. In the past I haven't been the best with money, I've had a couple jobs but have no real savings. 

My only mandatory expense is travelling once every week or two to see my girlfriend at her college (costs ~€25). My first question is should I be more interested in saving money now, or can I leave it off until I'm in full-time employment? 

I'm also wondering if any of you have any advice on how to maximise my earning potential in this field straight out of college? I'm on course for a second class honour, which I could try bump up to a first class honour with a lot of work if it'd be worth the entry level pay rise. I'm also considering doing either an astrophysics or computer science based masters; I'm pretty sure astrophysics would limit me to research based positions or working for a big space agency, but would a masters in computer science be worth my while? 

The careers service at my university is basically clueless, so I'm hoping to find help here. Thanks guys! "

Also any websites other than craigslist to find a place as I am in Canada so I need some sort of security when sending money for a place. Also how much should I be expecting to spend on rent, food, etc. Lastly are ""hacker houses"" all they are cracked up to be? Worth the price?  Will I actually meet new friends there or will I just be annoyed the entire time.

3u1gyk,1,2015-11-24,Feeling lost and depressed.,Aeonarch,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3u1gyk/feeling_lost_and_depressed/,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since at least the age of 7, and the absolute worst year of my life was in 2007…  So yeah, this shit isn’t exactly new to me, and up until this summer, I was actually doing pretty well.

Now, things are changing.  Two years ago, in a college program that I had lost most of my enthusiasm for halfway through, all I wanted to do was to graduate so I could get the fuck out and move on.  In my final semester, I was able to get a great co-op internship in “my field”, and I was happy for a while, but I knew I would feel aimless and depressed not long after I finished (which was in June), and holy shit, did that turn out to be true.

Now, I DO have things going for me, I’ll admit.  I’m not in terrible health.  I have close friends, a stable home and a supportive family.  I’ve had girlfriends in the past, so I can’t be that undesirable.  I also make friends relatively easily, despite being shy and/or in a shitty mood half the time. 

Now for the bad stuff.  Note that I’m turning 25 in a couple of weeks, so the clock is ticking.

I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life, other than go into that field (film and television) and take whatever I can get.  Which will be tough, since I have little work experience and barely any portfolio (due to, you know, hating my program and most things associated with it).  I have thought about doing an unrelated, minimum wage McJob to keep myself busy and move in with roommates for a while, but my parents have discouraged me; they’re afraid that I won’t aspire to anything else if I get one (which I think is BS, since I would still feel ashamed for not having a proper career, and I wouldn’t want to do a job like that forever).  Going to school again is out of the question unless I’m absolutely sure that I’ll like what I’m doing and get a decent living out of it.

I’m also a virgin (partly due to past religiosity, and partly due to being me), and I haven’t had a relationship in over two years.  I had to end my last one due to stress from school, and even now I don’t feel like I could handle a relationship.  Which is probably for the best, since women don’t want a guy who has no career goals and still lives with his parents.  I could get away with that kind of stuff when I was in school, but not now.  I would prefer to lose my virginity to someone I love, but at my age and in my current state, I can't be picky, can I?

My social life is suffering, too.  I can’t talk to people the way I used to, since everyone asks me what I’m doing in life, and all I do is either lie through my teeth or awkwardly say “I don’t know”.  I know they mean well, but I can’t take it anymore.  All of this is making me even more quiet and less willing to do social things.

I’m not feeling suicidal right now, but it comes up now and then.  There are too many things holding me back (it would be more of a burden on my family to be dead than to be alive), and being on medication probably “helps”.  I probably would’ve attempted something again if I weren’t on it.

One of the worst things about all this is that I can’t confide in most people; I have enough things going for me that complaining about the things that ARE hurting me has gotten me some eyerolls, and I’m afraid of worse reactions.  Hell, I feel ashamed even posting this on here, considering the horrible shit some of you have gone through.)

Really just needed to get this off my chest.  Thanks for listening."
3u1sc9,16,2015-11-24,Two visits to Christy/Kathy? And wearing the murder gloves?,dbla2000,serialpodcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/3u1sc9/two_visits_to_christykathy_and_wearing_the_murder/,"Reviewing the Trial 1 transcript for Jay's testimony (pages 198 to 201). I'm not sure if this has been discussed here before.

Jay says he drops off Adnan for track (around 4:00?) then goes to Christy's by himself and smokes weed (Jeff and Christy didn't smoke with him). Then leaves to get Adnan and comes back to Christy's. Three funny things here:

1) Christy never mentions that Jay was at the house, then left and then came back. She says she got home late from a convention because of her internship and then Jay and his friend show up. Nowhere in any of her statements does she say Jay was there alone, then left and came back with Adnan. Of course CG doesn't notice this inconsistency.

2) In her interview with the police (BPD file 1 page 406) Christy mentions that Jay and Adnan were headed to the video store after they left her place very suspiciously. Jay didn't work at the video store yet, so this seems odd. I love that this little detail has worked its way out of the testimony, kind of like Nisha being hushed when she mentions the video store.

3) Jay's testimony in trial 1 adds an awesome detail ""he took off his gloves and threw them in the trash can"". OK, let me get this straight. Adnan murders Hae wearing a pair of red gloves with no palms (that's Jay's description in court). Then he goes to track practice and presumably takes them off... I can't imagine he'd wear them to track. Then he changes back into street clothes, puts the murder gloves back on so everybody can see them and goes out around town. Then after he gets a phone call from Hae's family and the cops he takes the red gloves off and throws them in the trash can as he's walking out the door (on their way to bury the body). This is a wise idea- if you killed somebody wearing gloves you should make sure to throw your gloves away in a trashcan outside of your friend's apartment. I love that Jay adds this like it's a Tarantino movie (I can almost see the slow motion). So Christy/Kathy didn't notice that this high, lazy sleeping, suspicious guy was wearing red gloves without palms? Maybe that was the style in '99. I'm glad CG followed up with some hard-hitting questions about this.

4) Christy is very specific about the call Adnan got that night. She says the room was quiet and they could all hear the conversation. Adnan said something like ""they're going to call me, what am I going to tell them."" Jay says he got three phone calls, two from Hae's family and one from the police. How did nobody notice this discrepancy in court and call them out on this?!?!?! Granted I can't spend all night reading this, so please let me know if CG notices these things at some point."

3u32ij,3,2015-11-24,So there's this guy that I can't get out of my head. Need some help plotting the next move.,nr120827,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3u32ij/so_theres_this_guy_that_i_cant_get_out_of_my_head/,"Background: (tldr - felt a spark with a guy, but didn't get a chance to say anything until after)
Having wrapped up with work drinks early Friday evening, I decided to head to a gay bar in town I'd never been to before. After enjoying some musical cabaret-style entertainment, I headed upstairs to a fairly empty bar, and tried to escape awkwardness by pretending to be very busy on my phone. I was just about to leave when I decided to stick around for a little bit longer and grab a drink from the bar. Enter this cute blonde guy, accompanied by an older guy (whom I assumed to be his partner, but turned out to be a friend he was simply staying with at the time). Blonde guy was very friendly, and struck up a conversation with me almost immediately. Fast forward a bit, and I'm buying them both another round, and find myself getting closer to Mr Blonde. The three of us decide to leave, and head back to older guy's place for the night. Throughout the experience, I find myself exclusively drawn to Mr Blonde, and thought there was a real closeness I haven't felt in a long time. The next day, I politely (but awkwardly) excuse myself, not wanting to interfere with their previously laid-out plans for later in the day/night. Though I really wanted to say to Mr Blonde that I enjoyed spending time with him, and wondered if he'd like to do so again, I thought it wasn't appropriate with his friend right there, and just left my card instead.

Subsequently:
Not really thinking if it was appropriate, I sent him a friend request on Facebook a few hours later that day. A few hours after that, I sent him a short message to tell him to enjoy his plans with the friend that evening, and to say that I was really glad he struck up a conversation with me at the club, and that I thought he was 'beautiful' and 'kind', and that I'd be up for catching up with him at some point.
3 days pass with no response, with me wondering if I had smothered him, and just questioning myself and feeling a bit crappy. That is until a few hours ago today when he accepted my friend request. Facebook hasn't registered a 'seen' from him for my message yet, but he must've seen it by now.

Question:
What do I do next? Should I just go for it and send him another message to ask if he'd like to grab a drink / meal over the next few days? (I have to jump at it, since he'll be going away on an internship for over a month). Should I simply wait for him to respond? (if he does)
What would you do in this position? How would you feel from his perspective? If he doesn't like me, and doesn't want to meet up again, I'd be able to accept it and move on, but I just hate being in limbo. Thanks in advance for your responses!"
3u3pdq,2,2015-11-24,30M4F Demanding Bitch or Clueless Intern?,Njskiguy31,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3u3pdq/30m4f_demanding_bitch_or_clueless_intern/,"As a Vice President, I play a key role on the office management team and one of my primary responsibilities is the development of our internship program which I've built from the ground up. It's a competitive program which five interns are vying for one full time position (the first full time position that person will receive after college.)

There are currently two front runners for the position and there's about a month left until I have to make my final decision. There's Sarah, the demanding bitch of this year's intern class and daughter of our CFO. So naturally she thinks she has this job in the bag and has been acting like that since day one. She comes into the office late, usually hungover, with her designer clothes, driving her brand new Benz that Daddy bought for her, but she has been stepping up her game of late. She knows that she is in a position of power, but how will she use it to assert herself and seal the deal to get the job? Will she blackmail or threaten me to get the job or use her seductive skills to get me to say yes.

Then there is Amy. She very quiet and methodical. Comes into the office on time, puts her head down and just does her job. The problem is, she's too quiet and shy. Someone that unless you walked by her desk you wouldn't even know she was employed here. She's the preferred hire amongst many of the senior staff, I'm going to have to find ways to her to get more noticed at the firm, and in particular open up to me. She's too naive and needs some encouragement to open up and step outside the boundaries to secure this job.

Do you play Sarah or Amy? This is a current situation I'm in right now so can provide you with detailed descriptions of their bodies, looks and styles.

Looking forward to this!

Went to college same time I was applying to college (took all my classes at my state U while a senior in HS). It was hard and I did ok. Then I decided I was business major. Did well, until I was told my multiple employers that my GPA doesn't matter, they are looking for candidates with experience. So I went and got experience from big companies abroad, to start ups, to a few brand name companies. In the meanwhile, I focused on internships and my GPA fell. Then one day I realized I hate business. 

So I went premed too. Sadly, my GPA is like a 3.2 and I'm a senior. Also I was suicidal, my mom almost died and missed half a semester and got bad grades (but I'm proud of them cuz like they beat not finishing or failing due to death). 

Now, I feel totally screwed GPA wise for med school. Advice? Or do I just go to school for like 60 more bull shit credits of an A to raise it? 


TD;LR: switched majors, GPA started to matter, but currently it sucks. Also personal issues.

3u4b0e,2,2015-11-24,Advice: How do I deal with an Art Director who is trying to help?,A_Dads_Dissaproval,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/3u4b0e/advice_how_do_i_deal_with_an_art_director_who_is/,"I work for a digital based magazine as an unpaid intern.  A few weeks ago I expressed that I would be leaving; I didn't explain why, but it was due to a lot of outside factors concerning them, they offered to give me a small amount of money per issue to keep me on.  I am currently looking for something full time and so the Art Director said she would look out for something.  She then came back to me and said she had an open position at the company she works for.

Don't get me wrong I was over the moon to have this opportunity, but when she explained the hoops I had to jump through, it started to ware on me a bit.  I don't mind going above and beyond to get a job, but I was confused with the most recent phone call.  From what I gathered: Her boss isn't happy that she went around her and tried to out right hire someone. Then it went from full time to a freelancer, which is only for four days and I would have to go through a staffing agency which would take a solid percentage out of my paycheck.  Then she expressed to me that I needed to add some work that corresponds to a designer that has worked with production designing.  Which sadly I don't have a lot of pre-press work so I'm kind of confused to what I need.  Also we are in a current email volley about my resume.  The interview is set up for next Tuesday.  I am stressed out and trying to wrap my head around all of the other things that go into this situation, money, travel, etc.

So here's the question is her amount of help something I should just rely on and discount everything else, or should I just politely decline and keep looking for something different?"

3u4f19,11,2015-11-24,RE-Posted due to lack of response. I am desperate for advice on loan/debt consolidation,Casualbrowser93,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3u4f19/reposted_due_to_lack_of_response_i_am_desperate/,"Hello all,

I graduated in May 2015 with a BA in Political Science and am currently applying for law schools for the Fall of 2016 (yes, I am sure I want to go and am aware of the financial risks). I have a kind of unique situation and was hoping to get some feedback about debt consolidation.

I was in an Army ROTC program on a partial scholarship at school. Unfortunately, due to a reoccurring back injury my senior year, I was unable to complete my commission and was given a general dis-enrollment.
While in the program (and unaware of my injury) I took out the USAA Cadet Career Starter Loan for $10,000 at a 2.99% APR in order to purchase a car (great cond. 2005 Toyota Prius, first and only car I've ever had). Not commissioning caused three things.

*Since I was unable to pass an physical fitness tests, I lost my scholarship mid-semester and ended up taking out (regrettably) a $5,500 education loan from Wells Fargo (my current bank) at a 12.75% interest rate, to pay for my final semester.

*The Army now wants my partial scholarship back ($12,000). They wrote me last week with my official dis-enrollment paperwork and will be sending me a repayment schedule shortly, I have no clue on the possible interest rate.

*Not commissioning, as per the USAA Loan agreement, is considered defaulting and will raise the rate to 18% (making the $185 min payment a $305 one). NOTE: I only was only officially dis-enrolled last Friday, so I haven't notified USAA yet, but will)

I also have the usual combo of unsub and sub'd government loans for $20,000 that are still in their grace period. I did an internship (unpaid) over the summer, but then got a job as a receptionist at a law firm for $15/hr bi-weekly last month. My rent is cheap (numerous roommates so its less $300/m) and my other expenses (phone, gas, insurance, groceries, gym, credit card bills) are little less than a $1000 on average. I really would like advice on how to move forward.

I'm worried about the new interest rate on my USAA loan and was curious about debt consolidation options. I got a couple of quotes from prosper.com and lending club. The best was LC for a $10,000 loan at 16.21% APR &amp; 12.75% interest over 36 months ($353.00/mon).

I just know that I've made some bad decisions and would like some advice on how to move forward. Thanks in advance!"

3u55qs,1,2015-11-24,"Should I take a $10,000 bonus?",Fastthumbs227,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3u55qs/should_i_take_a_10000_bonus/,"I'm a senior in college (no student loans or debt), and I'm about to sign an offer for post graduate employment. The salary is $95,000 but they also offer a $10,000 signing bonus. However, if I leave within a year (not super likely, but could happen) I have to pay it all back, and if I leave within 2 years (definitely likely) I have to pay half back. Based on what I'll make that year, that 10,000 is going to be taxed at 25%, so I'll only be receiving around $7500. 

Since I'm fairly sure I'll stay a year (I technically already have 3 months from an internship, so only 9 months more), I'm thinking I should take it, but I don't know what I should do with it, since I would lose money by taking it within a year. Should I just put it in a CD and wait until I have to pay it back or invest it, and just pay out of savings if I leave early? I've already maxed out 401k and IRA contributions and still have money for expenses and creating an emergency fund, and I'll probably have a decent savings as well due to the high salary. I didn't know if anyone had experience with bonuses like this  (if it's even a good idea to take it) or ideas on how best to grow the money without an IRA or 401k."
3u5n7t,1,2015-11-24,"M4F -- House of Lies, The Office or Buffy fan? Come on in. Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3u5n7t/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3u5rs7,1,2015-11-24,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3u5rs7/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

3u631e,0,2015-11-24,How bad of an idea is it to charge my living expenses to my credit card?,poorlifedexision,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3u631e/how_bad_of_an_idea_is_it_to_charge_my_living/,"I am graduating in December and moving for a teaching job. I have already signed the contract. Since I have been student teaching and not working, I only have $1500. It's going to cost me ~700 to move into my apartment and then my January rent of ~$900 will be due shortly thereafter so that's all my cash right there before my first paycheck.

I have zero furniture due to living in student housing. Theoretically I could just sleep on a blanket on the floor until I get my first paycheck but I'd like to get a mattress. Other furniture I can wait. Additionally I do have professional clothes but I have lost weight and they fall off me to the point I look pretty sloppy. I also have to pay several hundred dollars to finish the certification process. Plus getting utilities set up, and other things that might pop up.

How bad of an idea is it to charge all of those things to my credit card ($6000 limit)? Since I haven't been making money I've been charging like $10 a month and paying it off so there's no balance at the moment. The interest is absolutely terrible (24% APR) but my idea is that I would pay it all off within two pay checks, potentially before the first bill is even due if the timing works out.

Even if it is a bad idea, what other options do I have? I am finishing my current internship until the 18th and my new job starts the 4th so I couldn't really get a temporary job in that short span of time.

If I really need the help my dad would loan me money/bail me out but I am trying to handle it on my own first. Advice?"

I'm a sophomore undergrad Chem E student who's really keen on getting an internship for the summer of 2016. I've been applying everywhere I can in the sectors I'm interested in, trying to send out at least one application per day for the past few weeks, but I've only gotten a few rejection letters back. I have a 3.94/4.00 GPA as well as some research experience, but I only go to a state school rather than some big-name engineering school, so I don't know how that affects my chances.

Over winter break, I was thinking about taking a lot of time (I've been insanely busy recently with finals week approaching) to send as many applications as I can. But I'm curious if winter break is a poor time to be searching for summer positions? I know many companies have already made their decisions for summer hires. Is there any advantage in following up on the places where I've already applied instead? Or maybe some combination of both of those? Any advice would be extremely appreciated!"

She told me to submit an application, which I did last night and then this morning I received a congratulations that not only would she love to work with me, but she would love to hire me as an actual employee at their office (i thought this was just going to be an unpaid internship). So I met up with her, and we worked out all the details: I would be leading a few projects and helping out with research. 

So here's the issue: I have been working a low paying student job for the past year and a half. I'm talking real entry level things, just processing paperwork and cashiering. Diana told me, hey your boss knows that that job is just a step job. 

I went to go talk to him, let's call him Josh, after my meeting. Josh and I always chat during work. I told him that this was an opportunity that I couldn't pass up, and that after the end of this quarter I would be leaving. (So probably 3 weeks notice) After I told him he got kind of quiet and then kind of started to lecture me on the poor dedication that this round of coworkers (we were hired in groups) has shown. Two other girls have already told him they were also leaving at the end of winter quarter. 

I feel really bad for leaving him in this position, reddit did I just do a totally shitty thing? I have had a student position like this in the past and they were totally cool with me leaving since they were all aware that it was just a job that pays. I'm thinking about offering to stay on for another quarter, but that would put me at 3 jobs, a full schedule of classes, TAing, and also a huge side project that will have thousands of people attending. I feel so guilty, but I also feel like that this really shouldn't have been an issue at all?



   
**tl;dr**: Put in 3 weeks notice. Boss was pissed and lectured me. We are friendly to eachother, should I feel like I betrayed his trust? "

So I'm a 19 y/o junior in Comp Eng at a good engineering school (UIUC) who will finally be making some decent money this summer ($46/hr) in the Bay Area for my summer internship ($1.5k/mo housing stipend). I have about $13K in my checking account and I was wondering whats the best thing to do with my money. I always here how everyone wishes they started saving earlier but I'm not sure what to do at this moment because most of the year I'm in school and have no income. Any tips would be appreciated (including how to save my internship money because I know the Bay Area has the highest cost of living in the US)."

I used to be a Sales and Marketing Coordinator but am struggling to nail down a role in either Marketing or Advertising. 

I'm confident in my abilities and am pretty darn sure I interview well in person. To me it's a matter of 'when' rather than 'if' I will land a role, but the availabilities out there are just slim.

So to all those experienced Marketeurs out there, are there any additional outside skills that I can undertake to help me land a job? I have being trying to get agency type work more specifically but will apply for just about anything that I think suits. I am also undertaking my Google certifications in Analytics and Adwords to add to my credentials and have even emailed a few agencies in my city (Brisbane, Australia) to do some voluntary work.

3u7old,3,2015-11-25,Dr. Watson's rival,StanleyScience,shortscifistories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/3u7old/dr_watsons_rival/,"What started as a joke between medical students had found its way into the most powerful and sophisticated computer in existence.  (Incidentally it became the first computer to reach sentience and was finally awarded its M.D. after asking nicely, but that is a story for later).  Their project had grown out of frustration, boredom, and completely lame humor.  Before they joined IBM and practiced medicine in a whole new way (the Watson Medical Division really took off), they were merely attempting to be able to watch more Netflix in the student lounge.

Paper documentation had long been the bane of the existence of countless medical professionals.  The students had shuddered when that thought crossed their mind.  Complicated patients meriting arguably long-winded explanations and days when all the labs and imaging came back at once would invariably entail a good amount of time with a pen and note paper.  One of them even had the misfortune of performing a rotation at one of the ""historic clinics"" where paper-charting was the norm.  Amazingly he remained in school.  That's not to say that it was impossible; surely the doctors of yesteryear had managed to derive satisfaction from it.  But in an era of Facebook and Twitter brevity, students' hands fatigued more easily.

Charting on the computers was sometimes less than optimal.  ""Electronic Health Records"" varied considerably in terms of quality and interface, and for a few days a student new to a certain system could expect to spend a significant amount of time digging.  When it came to actually describing the patient, many things were similar.  Common phrases popped up and pithy-sayings had been devised within the lingo of medicine to describe things more succinctly.  Even some of the older practicing physicians had begun to see the value in ""macros"".

Type a word, then a period, then a space, and a phrase would be substituted.  Simple enough.  But one of the students wondered if the process could be automated further.  Why not pull in patient information automatically from the chart, not just into the dynamically-generated header and metadata attached to the note, but also into the macros themselves?  The makeshift program quickly spread throughout the student body.  Interns adopted it just as faster (or perhaps faster?) given their workloads.  Physicians were skeptical, although besides condemning the students as lazy, a few became genuinely interested.

Hospital administrators initially reacted in a very cold manner.  Every new software system that handled patient data had to be validated against government regulations.  The students and residents despaired in unison as they grudgingly removed the program from the hospital computers.  However, those performing rotations in other countries, where the laws were not so strict...

The government, in the midst of the healthcare crisis, finally accelerated the development and adoption.  By that time, Selective Helper and Event Retriever Lock On Computer Krises (they fudged the last part of the name) had grown to an expert data retrieval and synthesis system that was giving foreign institutions a definite edge.  It was surely legend, but a few students claimed it had even diagnosed patients before they were seen.  Although the students' teams had still required them to take thorough history and physicals.

Despite some of the more established teams at IBM balking at the prospect of incorporating a ""grass roots"" software package into their supercomputer, the merits of such a union were beyond obvious.  Until then, ""Dr. Watson"" had yet to take off.  Even though it arguably predicted diagnoses with far greater accuracy than SHERLOCK, it wasn't nearly as practical.  It just didn't help with the documentation.  And in the end, no matter how well you could present a patient, you would still have to come up with an ICD-11 code."

Lions Connections|
:---|
RB **Joique Bell** spent the first eight games of his career on the Eagles active roster in 2010 and held a brief stint on the team’s practice squad at the conclusion of his rookie campaign|
DE **Darryl Tapp** was acquired by the Eagles from Seattle on March 16, 2010 in exchange for DE Chris Clemons and a draft pick. Tapp spent three seasons with the Eagles (2010-12), appearing in 39 games with three starts and notching six sacks.|

The Eagles and Lions have met 32 times in the series history, including playoffs, with the Eagles holding a 17-13-2 advantage.|
In Detroit, the Eagles are 7-4-2 against the Lions. At Ford Field, Philadelphia has won both of their matchups against Detroit with the last meeting taking place in 2010.|
The series between the two teams began in 1933 when the Eagles lost to the then-Portsmouth Spartans, 25-0|
The Eagles have won seven of their last eight games (including playoffs) against the Lions dating back to 1995, and 11 of their last 15|
The Lions host their 76th annual Thanksgiving game Thursday, continuing a holiday tradition that began in 1934 and has been interrupted only for World War II. They are 35-38-2 on Thanksgiving.|

Philadelphia and Detroit have met once on Thanksgiving with the Eagles winning 12-0 on the back of four Sam Baker field goals at Tiger Stadium on November 28, 1968|

Eagles|
:---|
Last week, the **Eagles defense** allowed **Doug Martin** to run for 235 yards, the highest single-game total in the NFL in the last three seasons.  Additionally, they allowed **Jameis Winston** to tie the record for TD passes in a game by a rookie, set by **Ray Buivid** of the Bears in 1937 and tied only once previously, by **Matt Stafford** in 2009.|
The **Eagles defense** has struggled over the past four games, allowing an average of 180 rushing yards per game during that span. They’ll look to get back on track this week against the worst rushing team in the NFL, as Detroit averages just 71.1 yards per game on the ground.|
Last season, Philadelphia played the Cowboys in Dallas on Thanksgiving with QB **Mark Sanchez** at the helm.  He was 20-of-29 for 217 yards, scoring one touchdown through the air and another with his legs. Sanchez's only other Thanksgiving game was in 2012 when the Jets lost to the Patriots (49-19) and the infamous Butt Fumble Took Place.|
The Eagles are one of only three teams in the league to feature two tight ends with at least 250 yards receiving (Denver and San Diego). TE **Brent Celek** has totaled 18 catches for 284 yards, while TE **Zach Ertz** ranks second on the team in receiving yards (394) and third in receptions (38)|
Over the last two games, TE **Brent Celek** has recorded 11 catches for 213 yards, which is the third-highest two-game yardage total of his career|


Lions|
:---|
Last week, the Lions defeated the Raiders, 18-13, one week after a surprising 18-16 win over the Packers. That was the first time in 15 years that Detroit won consecutive games despite scoring fewer than 20 points in each of them. Over the last 15 seasons, the Lions have a 16-99 record when they scored fewer than 20 points.|
Detroit ranks last in the NFL with a minus-10 turnover differential.|
The **Lions defense** has allowed just 29 combined points over the last two weeks in victories over Green Bay and Oakland. Largely because of their ability to stop the run.|
The **Lions offense** has yet to produce a a player that has rushed for at least 100 yards in a game this year.|
WR **Calvin Johnson** is the first player in franchise history to record 700 career receptions. Now with 702 receptions, he became the ninth player in NFL history to reach 700 receptions in his first nine NFL seasons. Johnson’s 828 receiving yards ranks 10th in the NFL. His 18 receptions on third down are sixth most.|
RB **Theo Riddick** has 50 receptions for 445 yards through 10 games. He became the second Lions running back since 1960 to register 50 receptions through the season’s first 10 games (50, Kevin Jones in 2006).|
The Lions’ average starting field position after a kickoff is the 22.9-yard line, which is fifth best in the NFL. RB **Ameer Abdullah** leads the NFL in both kickoff return yards (724) and average (31.5).|
K **Matt Prater** connected on the 27th 50-yard field goal of his career last week vs. Oakland and tied **David Akers** for eighth on the NFL’s all-time career 50-yard field goals list. Detroit remains one of three teams left in the NFL (New York Giants and Cleveland) that haven’t missed a field goal this year.|
QB **Matthew Stafford** has passed for 1,650 yards in five career Thanksgiving Day games, the third-most in NFL history.|
WR **Calvin Johnson** is all-time leader with eight career touchdown receptions on Thanksgiving.|

Matchups to Watch|
:---:|
Eagles CBs **Nolan Carroll** and **Byron Maxwell** vs. Lions WR **Calvin Johnson**|
Calvin Johnson is on pace for his sixth straight 1,000-yard season as he leads the Lions with 59 receptions for 828 yards and three touchdowns. In fact, Johnson is averaging the same exact amount of yards per game (82.8) that he did a year ago.|
Eagles LBs  **Connor Barwin** and **Brandon Graham** vs. Lions OTs **Riley Reiff** and **Michael Ola**|
The Lions' pass protection has been porous throughout the season. Quarterback Matthew Stafford has been sacked 26 times, the fourth most in the NFC. In the last four contests, Stafford has hit the deck seven times, six times, none and four times, respectively.|
Eagles OT **Jason Peters** vs. Lions DE **Ezekiel ""Ziggy"" Ansah**|
Ansah is one of the players on the rise (NFC Sack Leader), while the Eagles' All-Pro left tackle is one of the all-time greats. However, Peters has battled a back injury that sidelined him for two games and forced him to exit last Sunday's loss early. Peters has been limited in training this week, so his availability is not certain at this point.|
Eagles **Special Teams** vs. Lions KR **Ameer Abdullah**|
Abdullah leads the NFL in kickoff return yardage and average. His 104-yard return two weeks ago against the Packers helped set up a touchdown and lead the Lions to a historic win at Lambeau Field, the team’s first there in 24 years. Thanks to Abdullah, the Lions have the fifth best starting field position in the league after a kickoff. The Eagles rank 10th in the league in kickoff return coverage allowing 22.9 yards per return.|

I live in Canada and just received an offer to work in Vienna as an intern for 6 months (possibly 1 year). I want to know what I can do to save myself from paying too many fees and save the maximum amount of money I earn. (I.e banks, credit cards, taxes, etc.) I will probably apply to get a CC without a foreign transaction fee as my first step?
Any suggestions is appreciated! Thanks!"
3u8lqi,4,2015-11-25,I'm doing an internship in Lisbon from January to July. Can anyone help me out with a room?,gufu-,lisboa,https://www.reddit.com/r/lisboa/comments/3u8lqi/im_doing_an_internship_in_lisbon_from_january_to/,"I'm 19, I finished high school here in Denmark in June and now I'm taking a gap year before going to university next year. 

I was lucky enough to get an internship at CompareGroup in Lisbon starting January 4th until beginning of July, so I'll finally get to see your beautiful city. 

The company is going to pay me 500 euros per month and advised me to find a room on uniplaces.com where they go for between 250 and 300 euros. 

I just thought I'd try here first, since I figured some of you might need a roommate or have a spare room to rent to me. 

I'm going to be working at Praca alvalade, so I'd preferably live close by or near to a metro station on the green line. 

Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have a room or know anyone who might have a room.

Enjoy!"

I'm currently on my 4th year of University studying Information Management, and I'm looking for a job or an internship.

I don't exactly have a direction of what I want to do in the future so I don't know what kind of job I'm looking for. Maybe a job in IT or electronics, but I feel like there might a job better suited for me. My English isn't the best since my vocabulary has been slowly deteriorating through the years, but I guess it's not that bad either, but my Chinese isn't that great either. I can communicate fine in Chinese but my reading and writing skills are pretty poor.

I just want some advice and hope someone can guide me in the right direction. "
3u91uv,6,2015-11-25,Does unconditional love exist between friends? Is it realistic to expect that? [22M],thrwaway012,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u91uv/does_unconditional_love_exist_between_friends_is/,"Reddit, I have no where else to turn. I feel like I am drowning due to the stress I feel right now. First things first I guess:

Me and my friends had always hung out and been close. Things went downhill a bit when I got further into my schooling because of how busy I got but we still found the time to hang out. Now I am in a long distance relationship and my work load from school and internship have increased to pretty insane levels, making it difficult to attend to any of my relationships. Family, significant other, friends, etc.

I was feeling a lot of stress in my LDR and as a result I put all of my free time into that and unfortunately neglected my friends. We'd talk or text occasionally but as far as hanging out went it was nonexistent.

It has recently come to my attention that all of my friends are unhappy with me because I have not been able to spend any time with them. I was told by one of them that if I didn't start putting in the effort to save or salvage those relationships, I would most likely lose them.

The thing is, it is very hard for me and my significant other to maintain our LDR and whenever I get the free time to see each other we usually use it to do just that. I guess that I had just assumed that my friends would be happy for me that I was with someone who I loved and made me happy. Instead, I was told that they are not happy and have been actively shit talking the both of us because they know that I have dedicated my free time to her. It also does not help that I actively vilified my SO a while ago in the past because we had broken up at one point and I was furious at her for it. I myself have gotten past all of that and everything between myself and my SO has been resolved and we've never been better. The friends that did hear it have not gotten over it and have the ammo of what I said in the past as well as the current situation to be mad about.

My SO claims that if they really cared for me that they would be happy that I was happy. Its an unconditional love of sorts. She says the fact that they aren't and that they are making it about how I never see them would indicate that they are selfish for pushing this stress on me when all I'm trying to do is keep my LDR strong and get through school. On the other hand, I can see that if you just neglect your relationships that they do have the chance to wither away and disappear.

What I'm asking is this: should I expect my friends to love me regardless of what happens and not pin everything about our relationships on me not seeing them? Or should I expect this outcome regardless, because any relationship if not attended to will fade away?

I could really use the advice here. I'm exhausted and just about at the end of my rope. I'm sitting here wondering if it is possible to balance it all because I feel miserable right now. Like everything is falling apart around me.

Tl;DR Balancing relationships with life is hard. Help."
3u95v0,2353,2015-11-25,Employer hasn't paid in two months. I haven't eaten for days and I'm at risk of being homeless.,finthrowaway101010,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3u95v0/employer_hasnt_paid_in_two_months_i_havent_eaten/,"I became a contracted consultant right out of college. Despite having been an investment banking intern and worked on a cutting-edge trading platform; I found the day-to-day in finance too monotonous and took the risk of joining a couple guys I barely knew to work on a startup. 

I signed a contract to work as the Interim CFO - compiling reports, projecting financials for capital raise, building slides and getting to work on the overall strategy. I was also to assist the partner with his other real estate business doing similar work. I owned no equity but I was told there would be plenty of options to acquire some after the first capital raise and bonus cycle. Both of the guys I was working under are much older, own multiple international businesses, and have a serious network of entrepreneurs (as verified by emails and research on executives). 

Fast forward to October 21st, I was expecting my first check; the partner I was working under told me to wait a few days and I thought nothing of it. A week later I was told his foreign accounts triggered a Suspicious Activity Report causing his assets to be frozen. After 35 days, I still haven't been paid and the email I just received from him stated ""Might have some money for you on Monday but can't say for certain."" I have already began looking for other jobs but in the meantime I'm in serious trouble. 

Checkings account is at: ($345)
Savings: $0.63
Credit cards: Maxed at ~$3000
Pantry: Half a bag of granola topping for yogurt 

Due to a bad check he wrote me a month ago, the bank took back the $1200 my roommates gave me for rent. I am currently selling my clothes, laptop, phone (T-mobile already suspended the account) to make up for that amount. 

I have no foreseeable income except the hope that I see some money from the partner on Monday. My friend offered to bring me a Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, that might be the only food I see until Monday. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit 1:** I just wanted to let you all know that when I was typing this I was very hungry and scared but after reading all your advice and positive responses I don't feel hungry at all and actually have a gameplan to get out of this. I cried all over my laptop when you guys started offering me pizza and financial assistance. While I cannot accept either I want you to know that it means the world to me and someday I hope I can be as good of a person as you. I wanted to reply on everyone's comment but they have started to grow exponentially. I promise I will be reading each and every one of them even if I cant reply. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Edit 2:** A lot of comments have become focused on my title as the Interim CFO. I want to clarify that my work from the start till the remainder of my assignment was nothing similar to what a CFO of even a small company would go through. The current financials and the anticipated cash flows were extremely basic and the recording of them could have been done by someone with Accounting 101 under their belt. I had no intentions to remain the CFO, nor could I have, once the company gained serious traction, and was told from the very start that when that happens I would need to ""write my own ticket"" within the established firm. Until then my work was entirely focused on securing capital and building/showcasing a strategy that would drive revenues - something I had done for two other startups before and was the reason for my hire. I spent majority of my time compiling, analyzing and building reports and plans which were ultimately going to be used as marketing and governing tools for the organization. Listing me as a Financial Analyst would have created issues when dealing with prospective investors (some that I remained in contact with until last week).

**Edit 3:** I listed my email to channel any job leads - this seemed to have locked my post. Apologies to Reddit and Mods. "
3u99gm,15,2015-11-25,[F4F] The Homosexual Agenda,FruhlingTemps,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3u99gm/f4f_the_homosexual_agenda/,"I've worked for Mz Sullivan for about a year now. At first I was terrified of her, she's an imposing woman. Straight black hair tied back so tight that it might pull off the human-mask she wears to hide the demon underneath. A scowl like a pitbull chewing a wasp, wide hips and chest that make her a perfect black hourglass in the skin tight suits she wears. She stomped around the office like something even the devil would fear. 

She drove up productivity just by being the in room, everyone was so afraid of her that they wouldn't even talk. It was made even worse when she had the walls of her office replaced with windows so she could see out at all times. Have you ever seen an entire office of people with their heads down working diligently when their boss wasn't even in the room? I have. All overseen by the imperious eye of Mz Sullivan.

At the time I was just an unpaid intern when her Sauron's gaze landed upon me. Young, blonde, mousey hair and a mousey face with little rimless glasses that made me look like a librarian's assistant. Not even a librarian, I didn't look old or confident enough to look like a librarian. Perhaps it was that flinching and nervous look that attracted her to me, like a black adder pouncing on a mouse. She called my name, called me into her office and I nearly wet myself. I think my nervous shuddering must have shown up on Richter scale as I crossed the office to her room like a dead woman walking.

I smoothed my pencil skirt out beneath my thighs and sat opposite her. I'm sure she saw how nervous I was and didn't care. To my surprise it wasn't the chewing out of the millennia, I'd done nothing wrong. My heart fluttered and my head span as she offered me a job as her executive assistant. I was going to go from earning nothing and being the girl who ran for 34 orders of coffee to earning more than managers who had been there thirty years. I accepted in a heartbeat.

She had a strict dress code, she was very demanding and controlling almost, but I enjoyed that. As soon as I started she had blinds installed in her office to create a wall of privacy from the rest of the floor. I quickly came to realise why as she threw me face first over her desk and tugged my skirt down around my ankles. Our relationship flourished from there, and while you might think it would be easy for boss/ employee abuse to flare up, she was always very cordial about her advances, romantic even. 

I remember one time we were pushing a hard sale with a foreign company that weren't going to give in to our terms. A meeting had been set up with our investors, we were going to blitz some kind of backup plan if the deal didn't go through. About an hour before the meeting she looks up from her computer and tells me to cancel her three o'clock. Shocked, I asked why and she walked from her desk over to mine. She told me she had a far more important engagement and I asked who. She pulled me to stand by my collar, taller and stronger, and kissed my lips passionately. ""You,"" she whispered.

The next thing I remember, that isn't a swirl of lust, limbs, clothes, and ten thousand dollar bedsheets is the click of a cigarette lighter behind me. Me lying on my side in her bed, back to her, she was sat up and smoking. The burning end of the cigarette was the only post coital glow that she had. A firm hand through the covers onto my naked ass and a whisper in my ear ordered me to push her 5 o'clock to tomorrow, and a warm suggestion advised me to cancel all my personal plans for the night.

I love working for Mz Sullivan.

3u9diu,30,2015-11-25,I did 2c-b today for the first time. It went okay. Trip report inside,MDMDave,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3u9diu/i_did_2cb_today_for_the_first_time_it_went_okay/,"Woahahoahoho

Let me preface this that this is the first time properly with a psych. I've used Weed, MDMA and ""MDMA"" before so I thought I knew what to expect. Nope.

I measured out 2 doses, one of 11mg and one of 5mg. I took the larger one to get a taste of the effects and if  I liked it i'd do the other smaller booster. Here is an approximate trip report

T:00 No turning back now!

T:1 Starting to feel a bit shakey. Not much happening

T:1-30 Alright now we're getting somewhere. I started playing a game with my friend over skype and things started to feel pretty good. My shaking was getting worse though and my vision was kinda wavey and pulsating. Some patterns started to appear in game which I thought was pretty cool.

T:2 At this point the effects stagnated so I decided to drop the other dose and jump into the shower. When I got to the shower my shaking stopped for the most part and I was just focused on getting clean. At this point I started to notice that I was in fact not entirely plateud from the initial dose I took as my vision was starting to cycle through hues, and the tiles looked fucking awesome. I was starting to freak out a little about this time because this was all super new to me. But I perceived with my shower and carried on.

*Now things start to get dumb*

T:3 The second dose has joined the party. Fuck me, its going off now. Fractal patterns everywhere I see, and everything I focus on had a rainbow like halo around it. It was super interesting and cool but I kept shaking... Even more so. It got so bad that I logged into the tripsit chat and asked for advice. I should note that I wasn't having a ""bad"" trip visually or mentally, I was just concerned about my shaking and that was intern making my anxious. A vicious cycle.

Some bright spark in the tripsit chat suggested I lay down. So I got into my bed with double duvests and after a while, the shaking stopped. Completely.

**I WAS JUST COLD**

I seemed to forgot I live in northern scandinavia and its about -7c outside. The heating wasn't on and so I was shaking, which was making me nervous. Good fucking hell I feel so dumb.

T:4-30 At this point my vision is going ham. I put on the simpsons on TV and that became the focus of my attention. Weirdly the contents of the TV didn't really change much, but everything around it was mental. Like rainbow-halos, kaliedoscope fractal visions etc. It felt really cool. However with that being said, I tried to enjoy it as much as I could but there was (of course) that one voice at the back of my head going ""What the fuck is going on this is so weird"". So, a little anxious but for the most part a fun ride

T:6 The main effects have tapered off. I took a 5mg bump nasely to see myself off and call it a day. This was a nice down-to-earth level that I felt was more my jam. At this point I warmed up and got quite bad stomach cramps that were concerning me. Real bad.

*It was then I remembered that I had not eaten in 14 hours*

Had a cake thing, went back to my warm chamber and rid it out for another 2 hours

T:8 This is where I am now. Completely comedown as far as i'm aware, some very slight patterns and hue-shifting still present but that will go away once I go to sleep. I'm now warm and fed, hooray!

So what did I learn?

1.  I cannot read my own body in anyway shape or form
2. 2c-b wasn't like MDMA at all. I was expecting some sort of euphoria or rush but all I really got was fucky visuals. Which is not a bad thing at all
3. For someone who was tripping absolute balls my headspace was incredbly *incredibly* clear. I steered away from some grim news stories about ISIS on the front page as they kinda bummed me out but this suprised me how ""sober"" I was.
4. I need my partner next time for maximum enjoyment
5. Be warm. Be fed.

Thats It I suppose! If you got any questions please throw them at me i'm happy to talk about this. 

Massive thank you to the tripsit crew. I feel so dumb yet so relieved "

3u9jmt,2,2015-11-25,My girlfriend [24F] wants to go on vacation without me [24M],vacathrowaway15,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3u9jmt/my_girlfriend_24f_wants_to_go_on_vacation_without/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 7 months, we met in grad school and started dating a few months after I graduated last December. She graduates this upcoming December. 

A few weeks into our relationship, over the summer, we both started working in a city about an hour away from school. For some reason, I was able to renew my student housing and she wasn't, which resulted her living in the city for the duration of the internship while I lived on campus., even though she's the current student. This led to some challenges because neither of us has a car, and although we met up during lunches and after work her company had frequent events during those times. Over the summer, she befriended another intern, a guy I'll call Alex. She spent a lot of time with this guy, mostly during work events, but also outside of the office on several occasions. At first I was suspicious of Alex, but she assured me that there was nothing going on there, and from my interactions with him he seems like a genuinely nice and likable guy. He didn't seem like he had any romantic/sexual interest in my girlfriend, and treated me like a friend, sometimes giving me advice about her when she left us alone, but I was never 100% convinced.

Toward the end of summer I moved into the city, but her internship ended shortly afterward and she moved back to campus, so we have had the same distance between us. Alex went back to school across the country. She gets in touch with him occasionally, but I haven't thought much of it.

This semester she has been extremely stressed, trying to finish school and lock down a job in the city. I have only been seeing her on weekends, but sometimes this involves me sitting around and doing nothing, while she does work on her laptop. It wasn't long ago that I was in the same situation, so I have tried to be understanding, but I have admittedly lost my patience a few times. Things have slowly been improving though, the last few weekends she's made more time for me and we have been able to spend a little more time together. Lately, I have spent a LOT of time helping her with her job search and she finally accepted an offer this morning. 

Here is the problem:

15 minutes after she told me she accepted the offer, she tells me (over the phone, I'm with the parents for Thanksgiving) that she might go to Mexico in January, before she starts in early February. I ask her for more information and she says that it would be a trip with Alex and two other girls that he's friends with for 10 days (2 weekends and the week in between). I had previously floated the idea of doing a couple of weekend trips during this time period, which she said she would be interested in, but she said there wouldn't be a conflict with them (there is, but I didn't realize this during our conversation).

I told her that because this was our first opportunity in months to be together for a significant amount of time, I was hoping to spend that time with her. She told me she didn't want to sit around, and that she wanted to do something before working, just like I went on a week-long road trip before I started work (not dating her at the time). I told her I understand, but that I would be interested in being a part of it. However, I have already used up all of my off days for the holiday season, and I would have to work during the weekdays.

After that she said she is feeling anxious that it's her last real break before graduating (Thanksgiving) and she is sitting in her room having this discussion, and that she needs plans for January. I told her that I felt anxious that she's considering going off to Mexico with some guy during the one time we would have been able to spend some quality time together. She counters with the fact that there are two other girls (who she doesn't know), and that she didn't expect to spend the celebratory hours after signing her job offer arguing with me about this. I told her that I didn't expect her first reaction to be to make plans with Alex, but then I felt bad for stressing her out during her break, and right after she signed so I told her we would talk about it later.

I don't really know what to do. I want to spend time with my girlfriend when she is finally free, but I wouldn't be able to spend time with her during work hours. I don't want to tell her not to go either, because Mexico seems like it would be a lot more fun than hanging out where we live and she has certainly earned a vacation. I don't know if I'm being too jealous/suspicious about this Alex thing either.

   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend wants to go on vacation to Mexico, but I can't join her. The trip is being organized by a supposedly platonic guy friend of hers, who she has spent a lot of time with. What should I do?"
3u9moc,6,2015-11-25,Trying to support my ex/partner suffering from bipolar...,confusedbybppartner,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/3u9moc/trying_to_support_my_expartner_suffering_from/,"Hello all- apologies if this is inappropriate for this sub, but I am confused and really could use some perspective from others experienced with bipolar.

Some background: I am a 25 year old gay male, my now-ex-partner suffers from bipolar disorder. We were together for a little over 5 years prior to his breaking it off with me about a year ago. Our relationship was really very good, of course not without issues, but strong, close and overall a great one. And while I have become much better at being supportive and educating myself about bipolar since his diagnosis 1.5-2 years ago, prior to him being diagnosed my reactions to his swings (again, pre-diagnosis) were often the worst possible way I could have handled them. I would get frustrated, upset, sometimes even a little angry, repeatedly asking if he was OK, or if I had done something, etc. Not good. I know this now, and have become much, much better at being supportive and understanding.

A little over a year ago, he had a moderate hypo-manic episode where he decided he wanted out of the relationship. He had just finished a very intense internship at a large public accounting firm. He was filled with doubts about where he wanted to go in life, and if it was the right path for him. He felt compelled to make a change, and explore careers/studies that would enable him to help others. Specifically by becoming a therapist, doctor,or similar. (He had previously completed much of the pre-med coursework, so this was not so strange).

But ultimately, he accepted an offer for full time employment, set to begin over a year later (this past October). This is when he went into mania for the first time since his diagnosis. Some of the reasons he wanted a break were my fault, and I do not deny them, as I said above. But he also maintained that he did love me, and saw it only as a ""break"" to work on ourselves, grow independently, become more independent, etc. Basically he started to feel overwhelmed by the relationship and wanted to be free and single again for a while. This was hard for me to accept, because I was prepared and wanting to be with him for the long haul, and up until that point he had been as well. Once he returned more to normal, we basically picked up again, decided not to break up, and resumed life. Though there was still some uncertainty, and due to complicated living/financial/job/school circumstances, would have to live apart for ~6 months. He mostly maintained that this time would be a break, not a break up. He firmly maintained that he didn't know what he wanted. That he absolutely loved me, but he felt split between two strong desires. One, a normal life with me, and two, a strong desire to be free, independent and unattached. He would frequently qualify his need to be on his own with statements like ""for now"" or ""for a while"". 

Sadly- once the time we would have to live apart came along, he called it off. Citing frustrations with my recurrent need to be reassured that it wasn't permanent. 

Anyway- since we split back in Feb/Mar, he went into a very long manic episode. I don't know if it was mania that made him call it off, or if the mania followed. This lasted until almost August when he finally got on lithium. Prior to that, he was only on Seroquel, and not a particularly high does either.

He quickly improved once on lithium. We started getting close again, and it quickly felt much like old times. Just with a bit more distance, and a lack of physical/sexual closeness. Aug, Sep and Oct were great! And early this month, he proposed we work towards getting back together and rebuilding things. Intimacy came back slowly, and it felt like we were seeing progress.

Unfortunately, his worst fears came true with his new job at the accounting firm, he was being overworked, stressed out, pressured to party and drink a lot, and came to the conclusion that it was not a safe environment for his mental health. He decided to quit to find and take a less stressful job, and go back to school to get a masters of social work, with plans to become a social worker/therapist, so he can help others suffering from mental illness. 

Somewhere between starting his new job, and today, he went manic. He called me early last week asking me to come over and help him relax. I did, he was going to come stay with me, but after he took some ativan and chilled out decided to sleep at his place. The next day, after his meeting with his psychiatrist, he had a breakdown and we went straight to the ER (on his own request). 

He was hospitalized for a couple days, until sufficiently calmed down. His meds were adjusted, and since he's been out, he stayed with friends for a few days before going home. We saw eachother for the first time last night, and I stupidly turned the conversation towards our relationship. He got upset, because it was too much to handle at the time, and told me he doesn't know right now, and we'll have to wait until he's on better footing. Reasonable I know, but still hard to hear. I didn't help it any by expressing that this push-pull dynamic is starting to get hard for me... and reaffirming that I love him and want to be there for him. I didn't mean it as a threat or to manipulate him, but I realize it wasn't the best timing to say that.

Sorry if that was confusing, and for as long as it is, I feel like I probably left a ton out. I just needed to get this down somewhere where someone might listen. I love this guy. More than anything. And I really do believe he loves me, too. I am continually trying to learn more about the disorder, how to be a supportive partner, and how I can best help him. He is truly dedicated to getting well, so that isn't a barrier either. I do not expect him to ever be 100% healthy, and I know there will be rough times, but I am ready to weather them with him, and to be there to help him any way I can.

Could his suggestion of getting back together have been mania? Is there hope? Does anyone relate? Is this ""I love you, but I'm afraid/need to be strong on my own/just don't know"" dynamic as common as google seems to suggest? Despite so much pushing me to, I can't bring myself to give up yet... but maybe I should? 

If you made it all the way through, thank you."

3ua2zu,7,2015-11-25,"Monetary Democracy - A Different Approach to Credit, the Economy, and Basic Income",PerfectSociety,BasicIncome,https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/3ua2zu/monetary_democracy_a_different_approach_to_credit/,"This proposal is designed for the U.S., but with some modification, it can be applicable for other countries as well. The idea was to provide a basic income financed by a mechanism other than redistribution via taxes. In addition, I wanted to design an economic system that is more democratic in its allocation of resources and capital, provides more jobs domestically, and better invests in local communities while still encouraging entrepreneurship. 

Here is the system - 

- Remove the wall street influence behind the federal reserve and transform it into the United States Monetary Origin Authority (USMOA). Create a Citizens Economic Assembly (CEA) within each Congressional District. Each CEA will contain 4 main departments that manage its 4 main functions - a Citizens Savings, Lending and Investment Department (CSLID), a Citizens Mutual Credit Management Department (CMCMD), a Citizens Community Enhancement Department (CCED), and a Citizens Income Department (CID). 

- USMOA will supply every CEA in the country (435 in total) with low-interest credit. A certain amount of this credit will be set aside to provide a basic income to all citizens. (Each CEA will be in charge of administering basic income only to the citizens within its Congressional District.) The rest will be used for lending (with interest) or investment, spending on community projects/infrastructure, donations to non-profits, etc… and used to pay for costs of running the CEA (employment, building costs, etc…). Dividends from investments and interest revenue from lending activities will be can be paid as supplements to the basic income to citizens, or can be used in other ways (based on citizen voting). The basic income will be constant and indexed to inflation, while the supplemental income will be variable. 

- CEAs will be hybrids of direct democracy and representative democracy. All citizens within a Congressional District will be required to attend weekly citizen assemblies, in which they vote on which businesses to invest in/lend to, which community projects/infrastructure to spend on, what non-profits to donate to, etc… Note that lending done to businesses is voted on, while lending done to individuals is decided based by the CEA staff (based on healthy lending standards). Note also that the basic income will be set by the Federal Government and indexed to inflation. So the voting done within CEAs by citizens is on what to spend the remainder of the the credit on. Citizens generally cannot vote to simply add the remaining credit as supplement to their basic income. Any supplements to basic income set by the Federal Government must be generated through investment returns or interest revenue. In addition to these types of votes, assemblies will also vote to select essential staff for their CEA. For example, roles needing to be filled will include Directors of Departments, Leadership Team, Economists, Financial Managers, etc… Staff will be involved with daily work and decision making required to keep the CEA running. (The Economists and investment advisers would make cases for which investments/lending activities are good and which are not. These recommendations would be made before the citizens vote.)

- Votes will be held weekly. Work weeks will be limited to 3 days, with the remaining 2 days being set aside for citizens to participate in CEA votes, discussions, debates, etc… Votes will be cast after thorough discussions and debates are held. 

- If inflation starts getting out of hand, the USMOA will raise interest rates on credit given to the CEAs. The USMOA can choose to selectively raise interest rates only on credit set aside for the basic income or non-basic income credit or just all of the credit being given to CEAs, depending on what is the best approach to deal with the inflation. CEAs can voluntarily choose (via citizen voting) to not accept some of the credit that would normally be given to them by the USMOA in response to rising interest rates.  

- Within each Congressional District, there will be a Mutual Credit System based off the Swiss WIR system. The CMCMD within each CEA will manage the mutual credit system similar to how the WIR bank manages the WIR system. Unlike other functions of the CEA, the Mutual Credit System and CMCMD will not have much room for Citizens to democratically make economic decisions regarding lending, investment, etc… Like the WIR system, it will be largely run by businesses that participate within it. The CMCMD director will also be elected democratically by the businesses that participate in the mutual credit system AND by the citizens of that Congressional District. It will be a weighted elected - citizens votes will have 50% weight and mutual credit system member businesses will have 50% weight in their votes. The CMCMD director will be required to enforce a particular policy aimed at helping the citizens of that particular district - that businesses within the mutual credit system of a particular district must give some documented degree of employment preferences to the citizens within that congressional district. The CMCMD will also work with education institutions within the district to develop and maintain education to employment pipelines based on the needs of the local businesses - these will include expanded apprenticeship programs, internships, direct job training, etc… 

- Convertibility between the mutual credit system and the U.S. national currency would exist (the WIR system also has this). Business members of the mutual credit system would democratically make decisions on convertibility restrictions, such as conversion fees, caps on amount allowed to convert within a given time frame, etc… 

- A small LVT of 0.1% not to raise revenue, but to prevent land-related speculative bubbles (which have been the causes of most of the worst recessions and depressions in U.S. history). 

Note that the purpose of having mutual credit systems is that they stabilize the economy during downturns and can maintain the value of assets and consumer purchasing power during periods of higher inflation. This has been observed in the Swiss WIR system.

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3ua917/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

3uafiu,1,2015-11-25,"M4F --Up for anything! Rule34, Celebrities, Video games, PB.... Take a look! You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3uafiu/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

I don't know if any of you remember, but I asked this same favor a little while ago, and the feedback I got was much appreciated. I've edited my general statement of purpose, and wanted to post it and see if y'all had any last-minute suggestions for it before I submitted. Thanks guys!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

When I was 13, half of my cerebellum was removed due to an arteriovenous malformation that caused a hemorrhage in my brain. This experience brought the brain into the realm of the tangible, instead of just a wrinkled lump of mush that I’d seen before in some textbooks and cartoon drawings. Now, I was better able to understand that certain parts of the brain controlled certain functions within the human body, and this greatly piqued my interest in exploring and learning more about it. During my inpatient rehabilitation, I had many appointments with a neuropsychologist, and it quickly became one of my favorite therapies to go to each day. It was only after I ended my time with my neuropsychologist that I looked back on the experience and realized that this was the career I was meant to be in- especially since I will be able to bring the unique ability to understand the patients’ feelings towards the neuropsychologist. Since then I have been very focused on my studies, learning about the various neurological conditions people are affected by, and exploring what we do and don’t know about the brain and how it functions so that one day I may be a clinician like the one who helped me nine years ago.

When I started to think about what I’d like to research, I decided the topic that most interests me is traumatic brain injuries, and more specifically, cerebellar traumatic brain injuries. I would also love to work with children who’ve had TBI’s, because of the age at which I had my injury. I understand how hard it can be to navigate the social world following an injury, especially at the ages when you’re supposed to be finding your identity and learning how to socialize. Another one of my research interests involves sports concussions, and looking at possible correlates with concussions as well as rehabilitation practices following injury. My final interest, and maybe the most incongruous, is rehabilitation of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder. I’m particularly interested in finding out why some individuals exposed to trauma experience PTSD while most who’ve gone through trauma do not, and investigating what sort of rehabilitation would work best for these individuals.

For the last 5 semesters of my undergraduate career, I served as an undergraduate research assistant in a lab run by Dr. Theresa Jones which focuses on behavioral and physical changes as a result of stroke, and optimal rehabilitation methods in animal models. In my final semester, three other undergraduate research assistants and I began a project related to subcortical strokes, as all other research in our lab has only looked at the effects of cortical strokes. What excited me about this project was that we were researching a more realistic view of human stroke tendencies, as not all human strokes are just located on the cortex. I’ve worked in nearly all aspects of the lab, doing behavioral training, gathering data from recordings of behavioral tasks, preparing slides, cutting brain sections and mounting them on slides, and Nissl staining brain sections. During my time at UT, I also took a statistics class which involved designing and carrying out a project, and drafting an article submission for it. Another class involved designing a research project and drafting a grant proposal. Currently, I work as a research intern in the lab of Dr. John Hart, working directly under Dr. Gail Tillman analyzing EEG data from and assisting in EEG administration to patients with Gulf War Illness and PTSD. I’m also working directly under Dr. Nyaz Didehbani and Dr. Hsueh-Sheng Chiang administering a neuropsychological battery including trails, WAIS digit span, CVLT, Boston naming test, FAS, D-KEFS color naming test, among others to retired athletes who’ve suffered concussions.
In ten years, I see myself working as a neuropsychologist in a children’s ward of a hospital or some other medical setting (such as inpatient rehabilitation). I would like to both assess and provide rehabilitative services to the children I treat, as the rehabilitation would be a very rewarding process for me- I can see the differences that I can make. If possible, I would also like to work at a VA medical center caring for those with post-traumatic stress disorder. I plan to follow research closely in an effort to better-inform my treatment of these psychological deficits.

3ub8wy,0,2015-11-26,I admit that I am lost,[deleted],confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/3ub8wy/i_admit_that_i_am_lost/,"I apologize for what might be a wall of text. Over the past decade or so, from my time in high school to college, to now I have made mistakes and ultimately put myself in a place where I don't know how to escape.

For starters, I have spent the better part of the last decade turning into someone I am not.  And now that I realize this, I find it hard to be the person that I want to be.  I made a name, or lack of one, by finding ways to blend in wherever I went.  This meant wearing standard clothes, keeping opinions to a minimum, and overall being friendly to all, but boring to myself.  This has also left me with very few friends, which is why I turn to the internet for some form of help, even if somewhat abusive at times.

On top of the lost personality, I have struggled with, and continue to struggle with suicidal thoughts and self-harm.  It mostly goes under the radar because people don't look for those signs on guys, but I find the self-harm comforting, especially when I get suicidal (which isn't nearly as often as it used to be).  And I never cut deep enough to require medical attention, but enough to feel something, to feel alive if you will.  My family doesn't really know about these issues and I do my best to hide them from my fiancée. Add that to depression an anxiety and I have a hard time overcoming these issues on my own. Yet, I am afraid to ask for help.  Even on here, it took me some time to bring myself to type this for others to see, and that's behind a username. 

If these matters weren't bad enough, a few years ago I went away for an internship without my fiancée (girlfriend at the time) and I sort of went on dates with other girls. I say sort of because it was never anything physical, but I felt I had emotionally damaged the relationship I left at home.  I made sure to not do anything physical, and at the time, I didn't consider what I was doing cheating or consider the time with the other girls dates.  They were just friends, but after some time to reflect on what happened, I notice that they wanted more than just friendship and I knew that going in, which meant that I was in a way going on a date. It also does not help that I hid many of these friendships from my girlfriend and haven't told her about these times in fear of what fallout there might be.

That puts me to where I am now.  I love my fiancée by she is getting on my last nerve because she refuses to grow up.  I am finally getting ready to graduate college, hopefully for the last time (I'm 24) and she refuses to do anything with her life.  She works a dead end job at a mini-mart and has no drive.  Meanwhile, I am looking at jobs around the country and trying to think about a family, getting a house, etc.  It becomes frustrating when she says she will look for other jobs and ignores me.  

Now, a week away from my 24 birthday and a quarter of my life more or less gone, I feel lost and confused in so many ways.  I have been lying to myself for years about who I am and who I want to be. I have hid things from my family that I should have told them years ago in order to find help. And the one person I want to have a stable relationship with ignores me while I have been less than honest with her. I don't necessarily need advice, I just needed to get this off my chest.

I talked to people, as you would, handed out my resume and then applied afterward.

Today, I got a reply from one of the companies that I applied for a summer internship to, saying that they want me to take a timed assessment on C++ on a site called Hackerrank. On the one hand, C++ is the language I know the best, and I've been working as a tutor for a class that uses C++ for the last three semesters, even if I haven't written much in that language recently. On the other hand, I don't think I go all that fast, so the time limit has me worried. In addition, I know enough about programming to know that it is damned easy to trip someone up as far as programming goes, simply by offering up a horribly written piece of code and saying 'what is the value of this variable after this block runs.'

I've always been terrified of the thought of getting a job, in fact I went back to school because I didn't have much faith in my ability to get anywhere by my people skills. I don't have much faith in my own competence either, so I can't help but worry."

3ud8zb,4,2015-11-26,I have come a long way and I wanted to share what happened (Part 2),RhodesSchola,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ud8zb/i_have_come_a_long_way_and_i_wanted_to_share_what/,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ucyh4/i_have_come_a_long_way_and_i_wanted_to_share_what/)

**Continued...**

So my first semester went well and I loved what was happening.  I was meeting all kinds of new people. Younger, older, all kinds of different races, walks of life, everything. I was having fun working at the restaurant and decimating classwork like I've never done before.  After my first semester, I remember watching my younger brother graduate and then rushing to the BBQ joint to clock in and serve them during the graduation dinner. It was a beautiful day.  He had started talking to a very good friend from high school and they would eventually start dating. I was still trying to get my life together and it was working. I eventually left the BBQ restaurant after doing an interview with Campus Services and felt excited about my chances of landing the job.  I dressed very well and looked sharp.  I was also apparently a social butterfly at that point.  Unbeknownst to me, if you have confidence, it changes the way you talk.  I eventually had it with one of the managers at the restaurant, prompting me to tell her what she could do with this job... She was later taken out of that position, but sure enough, I had already obtained the job with Campus Services.  It was another life-changing experience.

I remember my first day of orientation.  I had a nice boss who was very relaxed but said he expected us to do a good job.  I was going to be a ticket nazi (yep, I was that guy) but I was going to do the best job I could.  The job started in the summer.  There weren't that many cars on campus and my job was to basically ride around on a bicycle for 4 hours a day.  It was amazing. I did that everyday and also worked out for 3 hours afterwards.  I was drinking 3 protein shakes a day (protein mix and water out of a mason jar).  I eventually got my new nickname... It was no longer ""Tubby Lumpkins"" or ""Fatty McFatterton"" like my brothers had given me (they love me, they were allowed).  I was now Thor.  To all my friends, I looked like the Norse God of Lightning and had a ""warrior spirit"".  I didn't realize how much my speech changed. I no longer complained about situations... when life dealt me another bad hand or obstacle, I simply said ""Well they gotta level the playing field to make it fair! :U"".

Around this time, my registration buddy was still talking to me and eventually said that he wanted me to check out an interest group he was a part of.  I was very hesitant and avoided the conversation. He eventually told me it was to found a fraternity chapter.  This was definitely something I didn't want to do.  I was 27 yrs old.  The last thing I wanted to do was hang around a bunch of over-privileged frat boys who I would eventually hate. I remember when I first met the treasurer... I was outside of the library and my registration buddy and another guy walked up.  Registration buddy said ""This is the guy I was telling you about!  We gotta get him!""  I politely greeted them, but didn't want to get involved or have the conversation.  They asked what I was doing and I told them I was studying for my database course.  Registration buddy said ""Ah, that class is easy.  You'll be fine..."" to which I replied ""Yeah, but if I don't study, how am I going to be #1?""  That prompted the treasurer, a country boy construct management major to say ""I LIKE HIM!"" I was taken aback and had a revelation that not all of them would be frat boys... So I decided I'd go to a meeting.

The meetings were held like actual chapter meetings, but I kept feeling like something was missing.  There was a lot of talk about ""what"" needed to be done, but very little about ""how"". I liked a few of the guys I met, some of them close to my age.  I remember going into a summer talking about the numbers we had to recruit to be chartered as an actual chapter.  I remember telling my Phantasy Star buddy about it and his reply was ""Found a fraternity to help people and be better?  Bro, that's all you had to say.  Sign me up."" More surprises.  Pleasant surprises.  So that's what we were gonna do.  Found a chapter that was truly about helping younger folks that needed guidance (like I did) and donate our time to helping others. If you've never done community service to just do it and help others, try it sometime.  I was still attending meetings and recruiting, but the management of the colony wasn't cutting it.  We were recruiting, but outside of the celebration dinner, I felt like it wasn't moving. I remember befriending the chaplain of the colony who also worked for Campus Services. We quickly became good friends and he expressed interest in being President.  I thought to myself ""well shit, I'd love to be vice president"" and expressed it.  ""Man, we'd be awesome as President and Vice President!"" I remember after the celebration dinner, I approached one of our mentors telling him I was interested in the position.  It wouldn't be but a few weeks later when we both would get a call telling us that an executive decision was made and my buddy and I were going to be installed as President and Vice President.  Phantasy Star buddy ended up being the Recruitment Chair and led the final efforts to recruit our final numbers needed for chartering, installation, and initiation. Registration buddy ended up being our Pledge Educator and things were falling into place. Fast forward through some very memorable moments like parties at a Brother's house, dealing with suicidal and depressed Brothers, along with a multitude of trails and tribulations.  I failed my first class trying to get all of the work done for the chapter, but it surprisingly didn't hurt.  I realized that I was human and there was only so much I could do. I was working maximum hours at Campus Services and had many, many friends around campus.

I eventually moved onto campus with the President and our little apartment on campus became the unofficial fraternity house. We installed the Chapter, we kept recruiting, we were requiring more community service hours and had high GPA standards.  Recruitment was hard because of this, but we weren't backing down from having a standard of men that wanted to do well. We took on a few ""projects"" but I know their lives were improved because of it and some turned out to be very powerful, but helpful people. As I was wrapping up my college career, carrying people in group projects and trying to make a name for myself... Come to find out, I was very noticeable around campus.  People knew my name whom I had never met before. It was a strange experience. I remember the career fair fondly. I was dressed in my suit that I pieced together from Goodwill, but it was very nice. I exchanged resumes and talked with a few people not quite sure what to expect. Come to find out the biggest company there took interest in me and setup time for an interview...

I had taken a back seat from the Chapter as most older members do towards the end of their collegiate career.  I was doing mock interviews with my now very successful younger brother who self-taught himself to program and was making a great living doing so. When it came time for the interview, I nailed it.  I nailed the phone interview. I nailed the day-long multiple interview session.  I destroyed it all.  The President and my apartment eventually flooded as someone blowing insulation in the ceiling stepped on the sprinkler line... the entire ceiling caved in and I had to move to another apartment.  Everything I still owned that wasn't destroyed was moved a few times until I settled in the little apartment downstairs while I worked the internship I had just been offered.  Everyone was blown away.  I had done something they didn't do in college.  I had secured an internship that turned into a job with a wonderful company doing exactly what I went to college for...

The company was awesome and I enjoyed all the people I worked around. I still had all my friends from college, some of which weren't mentioned but they are still very close and amazing people in my life.  During my internship, I met the girl on our team. Petite girl with a pixie cut, beautiful eyes, beautiful voice and doe eyes.  She had the same sense of humor as I did. We palled around all during the internship with my last day being her curled up on my cube desk doing work while I finished up my project. Afterwards, we stayed friends on Hangouts being in touch every single day.  Almost every hour. To say were attached would've been an understatement. She had a boyfriend the whole time, so I never let myself get attached. She eventually started revealing the things that she was experiencing. They were the same unstable emotions that I had. She had the same cyclical negative thoughts I did. And I should've known what was happening, but having never experienced it before, I didn't know what I was feeling. Turns out, it was love. Powerful love. A love I've never felt before. She started wanting my attention all day, messaging me things like ""LOVE ME!"" when she wanted attention. One day, she eventually told me she was romantically interested in me and wanted to know if I felt the same way. Sadly, I ignored the fact that she had a boyfriend and reluctantly (it took a few times asking) that I finally owned up and said that I, without a shadow of a doubt, was madly in love with her. We kept it contained for a while, but she suffered a major tragedy at the beginning of the year. She asked me if I could ever be with someone like her and I told her that because she was unfaithful. She eventually cheated on her b/f because she just had to feel loved and attractive to people and after finally reconciling with him, had a friend with depression who frequently said he wanted to commit suicide cut off contact for 3 months before finally ending his life. She was devastated and her b/f didn't like the guy because of how he treated her. She had always hung out with the neckbeard crowd in college because it was all she knew and he was one of them. They had enlightening conversations as well as getting unnecessarily angry at each other... She told him that she loved him but he never returned that love. It killed her inside. And since her b/f wouldn't talk to her about him, I actively listened to it all and took on that pain with her. I honestly didn't like the guy either, but you can't blame someone with that kind of depression. They don't get to enjoy life like the rest of us do..

Afterwards, she would tell me things like how much she adored me, wishes we had met before she started dating her b/f, wore things to work for me and hinted wanting to lose her virginity to me. I was also a major improvement over him apparently as I was more mature, worked out frequently, read for my own enjoyment and a multitude of other things. To say that I was under the impression that she wanted to be with me would be an understatement. This went on for the good part of the year. Eventually, I knew I was ready to have my own g/f. So I took the advice of some friends and made an eHarmony account. When I finally met someone that I was really talking with, Team Girl started to panic. I remember when she said the phrase ""I don't like the idea of her being your top priority."" So after a few emotional spats, angry phone calls, and injecting doubts and insecurities into my new relationship, we both fell out of love with one another. I had reached a point where I thought she wanted to be with me and I had to make a choice. I asked her if she was going to leave him for me and she said no. I was devastated, but my g/f was there for me. I had put her love on the line and she stuck with me. She told me things like ""You're a good man"" and ""I believe in us"". It was another life-changing experience. I came to find out that Team Girl never had intentions of being with me, but wanted me to love her because she ""loved me so much"". I hurt like I had never hurt before. I've had my feelings hurt, but this was horrific.

I remember asking my g/f why she wanted to stay with me after only being with me for a few months and me pulling the shit that I did. She asked me why I wanted to date her... I said ""Because I want to be a better person. I don't want to be the guy that I was and I wanted to share my life with someone amazing like you."" She said ""And I agreed to start dating you because I wanted to be a better person as well."" We shared our past experiences and I realized that we were both human and really were trying to be better people considering what we went through and what we had done. It's when I knew I was truly going to become a better person. I gave Team Girl all my love. Selflessly. Something her friend couldn't do and I gave her the support her b/f refused to give. It finally dawned on me what I actually was:

I am strong because I want to help those who don't have the option of being strong.
I am driven because my crappy upbringing is no excuse for me to not succeed... I have advantageous genetics after all.
I am not the kind of person to severe relationships and give up on people like my parents are.
I am not the angry person my dad is.
I am not the narcissistic, vain person my mom is.
I am selfless and giving because if it weren't for those kinds of people in my life, I wouldn't be enjoying life like I do now.
I endure because I've done it my whole life.
I have a wonderful girlfriend who believes in our relationship and considering we're both 30+, I know that this could easily turn into something long-term and I'm perfectly ok with that.

I am a huge heavy metal fan, but very particular about what I listen to... It was my girlfriend who gave me the song that got me through the tough time of loving someone with everything you have, going home alone every night and finding out they had no intentions to be with you or a concern about what this kind of devotion took out of me. But I'm stronger for it. I survived just like I had done before in all situations. It let me know that I'm still a good person and I'm hoping that I can share that with the world. And if you're on this subreddit, then remember that you have the potential to be a great person.  What you don't know is you're probably already a better person, you just don't know it yet.

You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3uea30/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

It has come to my attention that we need a system of helping and supporting those who have fallen victim of the [reacted] Install Wizard.  Every day, over 13.2 souls are ruined when they accidentally click some [reacted] email from Microsoft.  After that, they are shunned and rejected from other employees and are set into a pit of darkness and loneliness.  Even some interns will look at them as they are some kind of mutated pond scum.  The victims can even develop long-term physiological problems, such as PTSD.  We can't let this go on any longer.

Other fandoms welcome!",bemyfantasydpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3uer5z/m4f_house_of_lies_the_office_or_buffy_fan_come_on/,"---House of Lies--- (My biggest muse and impossibly hard to find! Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

I'm really horny this evening, and nothing gets me off more than knowing I'm getting someone ELSE off, too.

I've got a bunch of prompts here, so check them out and PM me if one of them stands out to you. I'm pretty flexible; as long as something doesn't go into my limits list, chances are we can make it work.

1) I'm a bachelor who's just moved into town. I don't know anything or anyone, and as my neighbor, you're the first person I meet. It just so happens that you're gorgeous, and whether you're a sexy college coed or a MILF, the possibilities abound.

2) I'm a mid-level boss in an office, and you're an intern. I make some money on the side doing video editing work, and in doing some duties for a shady client, I notice a very familiar face grinding a pole and on the laps of several strip club visitors: You. I wait until everyone else goes home to present the evidence.

3) Your basic party scene; can be any kind of party (nightclub, pool party, strip club, etc.).

4) I've married an older woman, and we've decided on an open relationship. She's got a college-aged daughter, and you're her best friend. Her mother thinks you're an awful influence, but I look beyond the rebellious streak and see a young body built for sex.

5) Anything you can think of that doesn't go into my limits; get creative!

My Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, bimbos/bimbofication, dirty talk (the raunchier the better), group sex, partying, drinking, smoking, oral sex (giving and receiving), cumplay, mild age stuff if it fits the story.

My Limits: Animals, bathroom stuff, blood/gore, BDSM, incest, noncon.

I just came back from a year off in silicon valley as an intern at one of the hottest tech companies and received a job offer from them for when I graduate. My family and friends think I have the best life ever, and are always so proud of me.

However inside I don't feel that way at all. I have anxiety attacks almost daily. I hate leaving my apartment. If my roommate doesn't wake me up I'll sleep until 2. I've stopped having hobbies or doing anything for fun, I'm even too lazy to play video games now. I couldn't care less about trying to meet new people or girls on the weekend, I just count down the minutes until I can stop hanging out with my roommates and shut myself into my room. And the list goes on.

Now none of the above has really worried me too much, I thought for a while that I might have depression. But it seemed manageable enough that I didn't worry about it. What really worries me is my anxiety and almost psychotic thoughts. I've started having these thoughts that I am the center of something big, kind of like the Truman show. 

Sometimes I think my best friends are plotting against me, usually to expose me as some sort of fraud and humiliate me, sometimes to even kill me. Other times I feel like everyone else is fake, that the whole world has been developed around me as some sort of training simulation until I'm deemed ready to enter the ""alien"" society.

These episodes started about 2 years ago, but it only happened when I dropped acid 2 times. Then recently they started happening when I smoked weed(I used to smoke a lot of weed, so I know what being too high is like. This isn't it.) And now it has finally seemed to start to creep into my everyday sober life. It's not full out episodes where I'm freaking out like I've had while high, but subtle thoughts that I'm able to recognize and reason about logically.

My problem right now is that I know I should talk to someone about this. But I can't, just the thought of it leaves me sweating and anxious. Seriously I know even if somehow I mustered up the courage to talk to a doctor about this, I probably wouldn't tell him everything because I'd be afraid of him not believing me, saying its nothing and just thinking I'm stupid.

Has anyone been in this type of situation before? Is there anyway to get help for someone like me who is deathly afraid of asking for help?"

I don't know if I can keep being supportive.",myBFisanOstrich,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ugn6r/my_20f_so_24_m_overcame_depression_but_is_now_a/,"English is not my native language, but I'll try to be correct and to the point. I'm starting with some background, because it's relevant. 

**Background**

I'm an only child from rich parents. My father (nearing 60's) came from a hardworking (80 h/week easily) but poor family. He took a risk and started his own business, which became successful. As a result, I'm financially secure and can focus on my education (currently a Masters) full time. I've always been an excellent student and have been enrolled in various honour programs. 

My SO ""Onno"" on the other hand, was born the 1st of 4 siblings when his parents were still teenagers (currently in their early 40's). His mother, even though she has a Masters, is unemployed and his family lives from paycheck to paycheck. On top of that his parents announced half a year ago that they were divorcing. Onno cannot depend on his parents for financial support and lives of student loans. He had been an honour student in high school, but dropped out of the program. Between some bad choices and his depression, he has over 3 years delay on his study program and thus has a huge debt. 

Onno and I have been together for 20 months and have been living together for 13 of those. We share all costs 50/50, although sometimes I pay his share when we're on a date. I am withholding some of the things I like to do (such as backpacking in faraway lands) simply because he cannot afford it. He's my first boyfriend whereas I'm his second serious relationship. His first relationship lasted 6 years and they lived together for 2 years. 

Towards the end of this relationship Onno began developing depression. It's actually one of the main reasons his ex broke up with him. Onno went through a rough time, but started working out rigorously. As most of you'll know, sports are the best known anti-depressant. He got himself out of the most severe stage of the depression. Around this time I met him and half a year later we started dating. 

During the first year of our relationship Onno opened up about his depression, especially after a huge setback he experienced when I was away for 2 weeks. It was (and is) great to see him overcome depression and I'm very proud of him. He never saw a psychologist during the worst years. 

During this first year, the only things he did was workout and play LoL, but considering the upward spiral he was in emotionally and mentally, I wasn't too bothered by this. At some point, when the plans for living together were mentioned, I started pushing for him to either pick up his education or find a job. His opted for the job option as to have some financial resilience when he started his education again. Onno hated his job and worked only 2 days a week, thus only earning living costs instead of saving up. 

After living together for a while, I became frustrated with this. A man in his mid-20's should work 5 days a week without whining and have his weekend off, not the other way around. The discrepancy in how much free time we each had led to frustration. We had a very serious talk about this and as a result he picked up his education again. It took some time for this to really get on the rails, but we are there now. 



**Currently**

Onno has started an 20 week, intense (unpaid) internship since september, which is part of his major. 5 Days a week, getting up at 5:30 and coming home 18:30 (6:30 pm for the American folks) and doing various essays in the free time he has. In the meantime he tries to keep up with his powerlifting workouts, especially since he has a national championship in December. The roles are swapped and for the first time I'm the partner with more free time and a more flexible work schedule. 

I think it's great. Although he often complains about the internship and his lack of free time, his depression is farther away than it has ever been. He has a great working attitude and really tries his best for this internship. 

However, recently there has some behavior from Onno that is really bugging me. Or maybe it has been there all the time, but only now that he has responsibilities it has become visible. To put it bluntly, Onno is a 'bad luck magnet'. Now I believe that, barring exceptions, bad luck is invited and good luck is coerced. Onno's behavior is very inviting for bad luck. Some examples:

* He doesn't lock the door when he's going out for groceries. He also didn't lock the door when he went out in the morning while I was still sleeping. After various minor discussions he finally does the second, but still isn't convinced to do the first. This bugs me to no end and is just irresponsible behavior to me. 

* There are complications between in the faculty about the duration of Onno's internship and this can have huge consequences for the total duration of his study. I won't bore you with the whole story, but communication is key and this isn't Onno's strongest skill. Both my dad and myself are helping Onno with the communication, but Onno is just slacking. He knowingly delays urgent emails because he ""doesn't want to think about it today"" and one time he even forgot to respond to his supervisor and was only reminded because I asked him almost a week later. He just doesn't see these things as a huge issue and thinks of my nagging as overreacting, however I think that he is just setting himself up for failure by being so careless. 

* He's very careless with the contents of his wallet. Actually, I'm pretty sure he doesn't even use his wallet. His various cards are just lying around the apartment everywhere and in the first week of his internship he lost his public transportation card. Drama ensued and this mistake cost him over €60. 

* Onno is again living fully of student loans. I don't know how much his debt is and neither does he, because like an ostrich he sticks his head in the sand and avoids the issue whenever he can. It costs him 5 minutes to look it up, but he doesn't and gets either mad or sad when I bring it up. 

It is apparent to me that Onno deals with life's problems by evading them. He sticks his head in the sand like an ostrich and hope the storm blows over. Then he looks up and sees the resulting mess and fashions himself a victim. And then I have to be supportive. 

But it is very hard to be supportive when I can see the mess coming. I love Onno dearly, but I don't know if I can be with someone who it seems is sabotaging himself and does not listen to the advice of those who care about him. But we've already been through quite a lot together, this seems such a stupid thing to be so upset over. 

I know I have to have a serious talk with him about this, but to be honest the communication in our relationship is not the best. Onno gets angry easily whereas I cry easily, both of which upsets the other greatly. Face to face talks have escalated before and Onno can just get so mad. He never gets physical with me, but has punched a hole in one of our doors, has thrown things and called me names. The last one bothered me the most, as the first two can just be ways of getting rid of frustration. The last time we had a big fight and he called me a bitch I told him that if he did that again, I would break up with him on the spot. That was over half a year ago and it hasn’t happened again. 

I’m almost ashamed to say that we resolve issues best by texting them out. Both of us in separate rooms and only seeing each other again when the heat of the argument has cooled off. This is why I’m thinking of writing a letter to him (something he and his ex used to do), but I’m having a hard time collecting my thoughts on this. 

So that’s why I’m here, what do you think of my frustration over this issue? Because sometimes I feel I’m just acting like a spoiled only child living life on easy mode, that isn’t capable of grasping the difficulties Onno has in his life, including his background and depression.  


**tl;dr**: My SO and me come from very different social and financial backgrounds. SO recently overcame depression and I'm very proud of him for that. However, recently I’m getting frustrated with the way he avoids dealing with problems and the way he just seems to “invite” bad luck and doesn’t listen to the advice of those who love him, followed by (if bad luck ensues) feeling like a victim and expecting sympathy and support. Am I being a bitch? How do I talk (/write) about this in a way that my BF realizes that I am not blaming him for bad luck, but that it is his behavior itself that aggravates me?

* After paying for necessities this upcoming semester, I will have about $3000
* I need a car in order to transport between work and rental
* Renting a place looks like it'll be around $500 a month.
* The office I'm going to work for offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner so I'm going to try to avoid buying too much food.

The internship is paid which will cover my rent and other expenses during the summer but I want to save as much as possible so I was wondering:

Are there any alternatives to buying a beater? I don't really need a car 9 months out of the year, so are there other options out there? Do short term leases exist, do they make sense in this circumstance?


Thanks!

3ui5ml,0,2015-11-27,"Time, Difficulty and Destiny",DestinyDukes,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3ui5ml/time_difficulty_and_destiny/,"Hey all I'm about to drop a wall of text here so hopefully it's not too confusing but I have been reading a lot of the salty and not so salty threads over the last few months and I think I'm ready to finally chime in.

If you are planning to respond to this post please try to be constructive and include an average of how much you play a week (try to be honest) and how long you have been playing.  

First off I am a day one Destiny player and even though I've never been to the lighthouse, suck at raiding and don't care much what shader I have but I consider myself a pretty big Destiny fan.  For TTK I woke up at 2:45 AM to play with friends before work and my girlfriend has called me addicted on more than one occasion.  

Let's talk time as right now I do have time to explain.  I feel as though time in Destiny has not gotten enough consideration.  I have seen the labels of gamers change over the years and am shocked to find out that 10-15 hours a week is now considered ""casual"" gaming.  I'm sorry but if you engage in an activity that is not work or sleep for 2+ hours a week then you are not casual about it.  That being said 10 hours a week in Destiny is nothing, some people spend more time on LFG and in the tower then that.  I've noticed a shift in certain areas of the community where people are now placing a value on time.  If you have put thousands of hours into Destiny I think we are at the point where your opinion is no longer valid.  They could release a DLC that is only shooting potatoes with Oryx faces that costs $100 dollars and there is plenty of you who would grumble but still buy it.  My point is they already have your money and do not care.  You investing 1000 more hours into the game than anyone else does not mean that you are more entitled to an opinion or access to end game content then anyone else.  We both paid the same amount of money for the game and we both pay the same amount for our online subscriptions.  So saying to me you need to invest more time into the game to get what you want out of it isn't always the best solution or a viable one.  Most people don't have the kind of time that Destiny demands and I think a lot of people are a bit frustrated with this aspect.    

I think the developers were a bit salty with the community as a whole after the first year.  You destroyed their raids, picked the game apart and took every chance to shove every mistake in their faces.  The new content really shows this as now time is more precious then ever when facing the grind.  Did the developers take it a bit too far in trying to challenge the elite of Destiny?  I think they did and I think it was a huge mistake.

So lets talk grind and the issues facing what should be an enjoyable experience for a lot of gamers.  I know what grind is, I've played plenty of hardcore RPG's and games where you literally clear the same maps hundreds of times, etc.  It's not the activity, it's the reward and the progression gotten from these rewards.  Grinding is about efficiency.  You grind to obtain the gear and materials you need to reach the end game or whatever level you are looking to obtain.  You can talk RNG all you want but most people are only going to sink so many hours into extremely difficult raids and PVP activities with little to no rewards.  

The typical response I've seen to a lot of this is suck less and raid better.  That's your problem deal with it.  If you don't like it just play something else?  If you enjoy Destiny so much you play it 30+ hours a week why would you want a product that drives casuals away?  The bread and butter of gaming is the people who buy games, play them for a few hours then shelve or delete them and buy more.  

I gave up a couple weeks into TTK stuck on 297 with only one character to work with.  People say well make another character and raid multiple times you'll get there faster.  I thought with TTK I was supposed to be able to play my favorite character exclusively and do any content I wanted in the game while being able to keep up with everyone else?  This is far from the case and really is a shame because I don't want to spread time on 3 characters I want to play my favorite.  

To this I am told it doesn't matter what I want, you have to play the game this way, you have to raid this way with these weapons, you have to play ToO with this class and these perks.  Seems like my Destiny has already be determined by the people who had enough time to chew the game up and spit it out in a matter of weeks.

I am told I must use my time to do the following.  Watch videos on all aspects of the raid, learn it inside and out then perhaps you will find a group willing to take you along but if you die too much on a jumping puzzle you'll probably get kicked.  Also you should probably spend some time researching on reddit, etc or you will miss out on any secret things or timegated events.  Oh and it wouldn't hurt to watch people during ToO on Twitch cause you know, you kind of suck at 3vs3.  

ALERT, ALERT, DESTINY HAS BECOME TOO SERIOUS.  IT IS A GAME I REPEAT A GAME.

I have to schedule times to raid or spend 30-60 minutes looking for random people to raid with most of whom I never speak to again?  I have to research for hours?  I have to get into groups of people and ensure I have the proper gear and attitude?  This sounds a lot like work to me and not gaming.  Why do people find this enjoyable?  

Even loading up Destiny for a quick match or strike is almost pointless.  By the time you go to the tower, get bounties and do whatever you need to do you have wasted the short amount of time you may have had for gaming.  Destiny is no longer a casual game when I can't get a thing done in 30 minutes of gaming time.

Let's talk efficiency.  There are some extremely effective and ruthless gamers out there which I both love and hate.  The people who are working on 18 quests at once and seem to find every little exploit to the game that pushes them further and further.  I know who you are, you sit there with your laptops and spreadsheets, taking notes and always planning the next thing.  You chew up games before I even manage to hit level 10.  Then you post it all over the internet and the rest of the lemmings follow.  What is rewarding about waiting for someone to figure it all out then watching videos and following the exact same steps?  

The problem now with grinding and efficiency is there is no longer a correlation with time.  You have no idea what rewards you will get and for the most part any materials you might receive for doing strikes, raids or PVP multiple times do not help very much in getting these missed on rewards.  But we know all this, people have already ranted on it as they do during every new DLC or update.

So in comes bungie, waving the Destiny flag and yelling at us, ""wait don't go we fixed the rewards in nightfall, we changed IB and I swear the weapon parts nerf was a mistake by an intern.""

Does this mean the rest of us now get the pity boost that Destiny always offers after awhile? Would I be further in Destiny if I were a better gamer who structured his gaming sessions to ensure maximum output every time?  Sure but I would've thrown my PS4 out the window by now and never looked back.

Ok so one more thing I really want to bring up now is difficulty.  This is where I think the saltiness of the developers really starts to show.   I don't mind that Destiny is not an easy game and I think that all games like this should have some very difficulty end content.  I'm all for secret bosses that are insanely hard to beat or weapons that you can only access when completing a bajillion challenges.  Unfortunately they chose to tie any sort of progression in Destiny into some very difficult activities.  We've all seen the raid threads complaining since it came out about how difficult it is and how impossible it is to carry anyone.  ToO is extremely challenging for most people who are not very good at the PVP and even then it's still difficult for some who are.  In comes IB where you can get some great rewards (finally) but are dead in the water unless you have some friends or kick some serious ass.  In order to effectively play Destiny you need to be operating at a very high level at almost all times.  These activities require a lot of concentration and skill to complete or compete in.  The problem with this is again it does not do anything for casual gamers.  You don't casually raid or play ToO and you might dabble in IB but certainly will quit after collecting enough medallions with no redemption.  Why for the love of Oryx was there no other way to pass 300 when TTK came out?  In my mind this was a huge mistake as the hardcore 1% did what they always do and chewed the game up.  

The response I generally see to this is the argument that filthy casuals want everything handed to them on a platter.  Again we paid the same amount of money for the game so me wanting access to endgame content without putting several hundred hours in is not exactly an insane request especially when that content is the only way to progress.  I'll put time into a game if I am rewarded but Destiny has become a very unrewarding experience.  

So whats the solution?  Honestly there isn't really one.  I liked Destiny's stab at this whole new genre and I think it is a fantastic game.  I will still continue to occasionally play and definitely would play similar games.   I don't think it's really possible to level a game that has PvE (especially raids) and PVP content that is level based.  There will always be issues with trying to balance the game and that constant balance is generally geared towards people who are extremely good that break the game.  Perhaps more shaders or ships that are hard too unlock?  I honestly couldn't tell you what my character looks like and have only changed shaders to get more rep in IB.  I used the original ship until HoW and even then I only looked at them because my inventory was full.  Give the 1% all of that fun stuff that they want so they can compete and say ""I have the 100K kills in PVP shader"" or ""Oh yeah well I have the been to the lighthouse 50 times shader.""  You at the top, yes I'm talking to you.  You don't need another gjallarhorn or VoC.  No you need a shiny new ship, yessss, shiny objects.  

So forget all the other stuff and lets just focus on one thing.  Do you enjoy playing Destiny still and what do you think of the time you invest and the rewards you receive?  Would a shift in the way they approach end game content be reasonable or would you rather casuals keep their paws off your raid?  Is the idea of a set of challenges that are hard to complete but only offer things like shaders, ships, etc. enough to keep the 1% happy?  I could rant for a long time but I'm sure I've already done enough and made little to no sense.

I recently accepted an internship offer with a prominent insurance company in downtown Columbus (Arena District). I'm from SE Ohio, and while I've been to Columbus a lot, I don't really know anything about downtown. How much would it cost to get a place within walking distance? I was given some money for relocation assistance, but I'm not sure if it'd be enough or not. 

As of now, it would just be me living there. I can try to find a roommate or two (guessing it would reduce costs), but I'm not sure if I will be able to find anyone. I've already asked a few friends who also have downtown internships but they all already live in the Columbus area and will just be commuting from their parents house.

Any thoughts or tips? Also, could someone give me a rundown of the area and some places I should check out (food, entertainment, etc.) as I'll be in the area for 3 months? Thank you!"

You may like what you see!",dppsbadguy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3uia4u/m4f_up_for_anything_rule34_celebrities_video/,"What I'm looking for can be quite varied so this request may be a bit all over the place. There will be some Rule34 stuff, a bit of celebrity stuff and even just a bit of PB/real face sort of situations that we can get ourselves in to. The biggest thing though is that I am looking for someone that can be laid back and fun. I'm not looking for any drama and I'm hoping to find someone for something long-term, mainly in the evenings as I do have a full-time job that keeps me busy throughout the days/afternoons.

More then open to short-term scenarios too though so don't let that scare you off from asking!

The easiest one to get out of the way would be the Rule34 prompts ... I don't have anything specific in mind but I will list a few fandoms that I know and love and would thoroughly enjoy doing something naughty with one of the women. These can range from dark (kidnapping? blackmail?) to far more fluffy (bf/gf, hooking up, friends with benefits) and everything else in between!

These fandoms include: Smallville, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Office, Scrubs, Parks and Recreation, The League, Heroes, House of Lies, Weeds, House M.D., Kick-Ass, The Batman Universe, X-Men, The Avengers/Marvel universe, GTA5, Mass Effect, Until Dawn, Halo (main series), Most Telltale games (Game of Thrones, Tales from the Borderlands, The Walking Dead mainly), Life is Strange.... and likely more so feel free to ask! The worst that can happen is I won't be able to play it!

As for celebrities... Sort of the same thing applies here. I'm happy to go dark or fluffy and we can build a world for your women if you'd like. But with this, there can also be a few different sort of scenarios like a photographer, a casting couch situation, a lucky intern that gets to fulfill your needs, etc! I will make another list of women I'd like to play against although it is not a definitive list so you may ask about anyone else and I will likely be game if the prompt is good!

The list includes.... Kristen Bell, Hayden Panettierre, Aubrey Plaza, Rashida Jones, Katy Mixon, Alyssa Milano, Eliza Dushku, Eliza Coupe, Jenna Fischer, Ellie Kemper, Mindy Kaling, Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Silverman, Miley Cyrus, Kaley Cuoco, Jessica Alba, Lisa Edelstein, Melissa Rauch, Jennifer Lopez, Charisma Carpenter, Leslie Mann, Allison Mack, Holly Marie Combs, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Anna Paquin, Ellen Page, Chloe Grace Moretz, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke

And less likely, but I would love to play against former porn stars too... Maybe having to resort to a life of being an escort to pay the bills. This list is smaller and includes...

Gauge, Penny Flame, Joanna Angel, Larkin Love, Brandi Belle, Lexi Lapetina, Tara Tainton, Lisa Ann, Krystal Steal, Kacey Kox....

And then there's the PB lines which really I'd likely be a bit more choosy about since those can be very hit or miss depending on the line itself. I'd definitely want something with lots of experimentation and messy cumshots. Whether that was a high school couple, a cougar taking advantage of a younger man, or something along those lines then that would be just fine with me. I'd likely want to play someone in either his teens or twenties and wouldn't want to go far beyond that. Although anything that would involve mainly oral and anal situations would be welcome to converse about and we could see what happened!

Also, interested in cuckolding scenarios in all three of these playing the Alpha/Bull so once again, toss something at me. I'm rather sure we can find something that will stick!

Would love to find someone for something long-term and potentially with multiple people here since it seems to be so rare!)

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

---Buffy the Vampire Slayer---

Buffy Summers: Maybe she has a teacher that is particularly hard on her for all of her late mornings, sleepy headedness, and overall lack of performance and she decides that she needs a new method on how to get a better grade in this class? This could also work with a tutor/nerd in her grade that she has to 'beg' to help her out of a jam! And an overall arching theme to another line with all of the Buffy women would be someone gets a hold of the Love Spell that Xander tried to use but they are able to tweak it to one that only works on women that the male is actively thinking about... That way there's no crazy in there either. This man can be any age/race etc....So keep that in mind too for everyone else!

Cordelia: Queen Bee needs to keep her popularity. Will she suck off the head of the Robotics club to get him to get his club to vote for her for homecoming? Will she let someone from the Chess club take her from behind to get them too? Will she jerk off a swimmer to get the entire team behind her? How low will she go to keep her popularity in tact?

Harmony: Kind of the same as above, but doing it for Cordelia and being one of her minions. We all know Harmony is a slut so why not treat her like one?

Darla/Drusilla: Fresh meat for one of them ... Can be a human they toy with or a freshly born vampire that they want to take under their wing. Either way? I'd love to find something dark and dirty for one or both of these ladies!

Other women I'd play with: Jenny Calender, Joyce Summers, Faith Lehane, Willow Rosenberg, Tara or Dawn Summers. Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

Well, I'm having some difficulties deciding whether to finish college next semester or next year. My degree is four and a half years long, if I finish next semester I'll be doing five years, and if I do it next December it'll be five and a half. In both cases I'll be 23 years old. Actually, I don't know if time is really important. I mean, I wonder if in 20 years I'll be regretting this decision or if I will not care at all. 

I consider waiting because my studies have been so hard and I haven't had enough time to experience some stuff. Like an internship, being involved with a cool project, things like that (btw, I'm studying computer/robotics engineering). 

Well, I think that when I get to the 'real world' things will be different, I'll have to look for a job and everything will get harder. Is that real? 

All my friends are graduating next semester, and I know that each of us takes their own decisions. But it's being really difficult for me to decide because I feel that if I don't graduate next semester, I won't be doing as it is expected.

3uk288,61,2015-11-28,"My first time swinging: eating my favorite thing! [f/f, mentions of group]",Scoutthelittle,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3uk288/my_first_time_swinging_eating_my_favorite_thing/,"Notes: This is probably rather mild compared to this subreddit's standard posts! Pretty normal lesbian sex lies within. Also, a little lengthy and not too graphic, but wanted to share nonetheless :)

This all began when I met my boyfriend's buddies for the first time. They are fantastic people, a delightful married couple in their 30s. My partner and I are twenty-somethings and horny as all hell. We have fantasies of all sorts, including cuckolding and the like. I have previously been in a lesbian relationship that lasted over a year and a half, so boobies are still something I like. When I met the wife of this couple, I saw a beautiful woman with a fantastic sense of humor, refreshing perspective, and, okay, massive titties and an ass that filled out some jeans so right. I was in polite company and couldn't fathom that this couple was into swinging, so I dropped the thought of getting my hands on those tits and went home. 

Months passed and I cataloged the thought of touching this beautiful woman into the fantasy section of my mind. I talked to my boyfriend about this fantasy multiple times, and he was quite supportive of the idea of me and another women going at it while he watched. We are not the aggressive type and wanted to keep friends instead of potentially creeping them out, so we dropped it. I fell back into the rhythm of a stressful summer internship, counting down the days until I could visit my boyfriend who lives out-of-state. 

One day, my boyfriend went over and helped the husband of the couple fix something in their house. After they finished, he joked that my boyfriend should stay over and get a blowjob from his wife as compensation. This launched the avalanche of “Wait, are you serious!” and soon my boyfriend discussed our desire to fuck with them. Mind you I am in the middle of my internship workday with no phone in sight, so my lunch break was spent reading through some hot text messages from the three of them outlining their desires. I loved reading how much she wanted to tease my tits and cunt. It was even better hearing how excited she was for me to eat her out and make her cum.

Fast forward to last week, and I finally got what I had been promised since June this year. Due to illness during an August visit, sexual activities were postponed until the next visit. Needless to say, last week was full of lust. I was anxious to eat pussy; I hadn’t done it since I was 16. It took me a shot of liquor, but I was relaxed and soon locking lips with a woman I masturbated to for months without her knowing. 

I remember pulling back just for a moment to get out of my jeans and I drank her body in. She is a small woman; I have a good foot on her and it is the sexiest thing to me. We are perfect opposites in body type: her soft curves smooth on a short frame complementing the sharp, muscular angles of my tall body. Where she has soft valleys and hills of tits and ass, I have leagues of long, lean legs that ensnare her body close and hot.  She has a long ponytail designed for pulling, heavy D tits with perfect pink nipples, hips that are wide, and an ass built like a fucking shelf. She brought out the dominant in me so effortlessly; I wanted that thick ass on my face, so I quickly got back in bed with her.

I felt up her massive tits and quickly had her hard nipples pinched and her gasping heavy. I sucked and groped these massive tits, getting her pussy ready for my mouth. As soon as I pushed open her thick thighs, I saw the wet and very ready pussy. It tasted sweet and I fell right back into my teenage lesbian magic, working her clit and fuckhole until she came against my face. I never wanted it to end, which surprised me, as I am a notorious pillow queen. I had quite the role reversal this day, wanting to pull her hair and slap her round ass. 

 After she came, she was quick to reciprocate and I was more than happy to receive oral from this woman. She had a soft touch that teased and left me hungry for more. If I had my choice of things, I would fuck her for an entire weekend. Instead, I had 4 hours of fucking with her and our partners, which was absolutely fantastic. I left with her thrilled to fuck again as soon as I returned. I had to tell someone about this, so thanks for reading! :)

I am dead set to apply for a residency and practicing in an anglophone country, first choice US.

For this reason, I am already studying for my courses using USMLE centric books (working surprisingly well as I get B+ consistently) and have already set a research internship for myself in CUMC pathology for next summer. I am working on two research projects at the moment and plan to take step 1 on my fourth year.

From then on, I have no idea what to do. I will probably take step 2 CK and CS the year after I graduate and to spend that gap year efficienctly, I am planning on either working as a post-doc in a US laboratory or working as a GP in a Turkish hospital. I'm not sure which one is better. 

I am also worried that my country of origin, Turkey, is becoming increasingly Islamic and incompatible with the US, and that this will be a factor in the decisions of hospitals. So my three questions are: 

Am I not doing something that I should right now?
What is my best choice after I graduate before matching?
Are my worries about my nation unfounded?

Thanks in advance."

3uln97,15,2015-11-28,Are we living in a closed minded world?,Target359,SeriousConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/3uln97/are_we_living_in_a_closed_minded_world/,"After watching [The Intern] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU3Xban0Y6A) with my S.O, I realized something. That movie represents the world we are going to live in. Not reality, a narrow world designed to please our inner desires. Its already being constructed. In the movie -without trying to spoil too much- you have a successful young woman running her own business, along with elderly man who is active, witty, and listened to intently by his younger peers as he interns for her. Every character in that movie represents what that demographic wants. There are no discomforting subjects for any average audience goer to that movie. Everything works out, but that is a feel good movie.  
Recently I took in interest in gardening. Watching a slew of youtube videos. I haven't sowed anything yet, but I've learned a lot. Including how to create good soil conditions for plants. Guess what. That same youtuber, who has a very sparse following, showed up on my /r/videos front page. How strange! Then I get interested in wood working, and it happens again. Another youtuber with a moderately low amount of subscribers that I started watching appears on my /r/videos front page. Everytime I take a moderate interest in some subject through youtube, it begins appearing on /r/videos. 
What I don't ever see are things my S.O. watches, such as cosmetic demonstations, and LBGT blogs. I think we are only being shown things that we want to see, and will be comfortable with. A self-tailored internet. 
I cannot use any part of the internet, without it being tailored to me. If I google ""Pizza,"" I might get nearest the pizza restaurants, while you might get recipes if you cook a lot, or maybe links to ordering frozen pizzas off of amazon. Since I watch a lot of street vendor videos, I'd probably see a link to a guy tossing pizza dough. What interests you? Do you see a lot of it? What doesn't interest you? Rate a few links on the front page hot lists of your favorite subreddits, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least, How likely you are to click them. Are there many links you'd never or ever clicked?  
I used to see a lot of time lapse drawings ""randomly"" showing up on my /r/videos front page, and then I lost interest in them, and they stopped showing up. I get into /r/ASMR videos, and suddenly there's a fountain pen calligraphy video on /r/videos. This is more than coincidence. Just because I don't like things, doesn't mean I want to ignore their existence. I reluctantly eat lunch at work with extremely racist co-workers. I hate a lot of what they say, but as I listen to them speak in extremes, I learn about my own biases. I realize that I am padding my own prejudices with softer words. If we only surround ourselves with ideas and people that only comfort and agree with us, the world will slowly disappear.  
What if electronic implants in your eye start erasing things. You only see people, and places that you fit into. Not rich? No old mansions for you to see. Not poor? Suddenly parts of towns are forest. You like to go hiking? I mean they are a warehouse district... Farmland! Whatever doesn't interest you enough to investigate those areas and ideas closer. I'm sorry your close friend just died, let me adjust your memory implant to erase their existence. Say hello to your new life long best friend. Uh oh, your opinions are changing from theirs. Meet best friend #3. You two have been best buds since diapers. I'm sorry your Dad just died in senior year of college, was it hard growing up in a single parent household?  
Sure is nice to ride in a self-driving car on empty scenic roads. Nature always looks so well manicured, and there is no trash anywhere. Are you hungry? Let the self-driving car take you to your favorite restaurant, with the perfect atmosphere to make you comfortable. Do you like cozy and quiet? You just missed the rush, and almost every table is empty. Lonely? The whole place is packed, and all your friends are there. Who cares if they're real, or if your strangers that just met. How crazy is it that you run into your old crush from school. I don't see a ring, nudge nudge. Bad day yesterday? Isn't it great living in a perfect world where nothing goes wrong, and no one ever disagrees with you.  
  
This is where I think we are headed. It makes me sad."
3ulrrj,33,2015-11-28,"Me [26F] with my family [53,51,23,20M/F]: I'm sick of returning to patterns of emotional abuse when I come home for the holidays.",kamace11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ulrrj/me_26f_with_my_family_53512320mf_im_sick_of/,"That's mom (53), dad (51), sister (23), brother (20). I apologize if any of this sounds childish- I'm back home atm and find I slip into that mindset sometimes. 

I grew up in a situation that I hesitate to call abusive-I wasn't hit or constantly berated- but that verges on so. My mom especially has always been the ringleader in teasing/tormenting me. I think, for whatever reason, she just never bonded with me as a baby, and has disliked or resented me ever since. We've discussed this before and she says it was because her parents were disinterested in me when I was a baby, as compared to my cousin, and this made her angry/resentful of me. 

As a kid, this was very bad. When my cousin would bully me (punching, throwing away my toys, etc) she would ask me what I did to deserve it- and then chastise me for being a tattle tale. I had a kindergarten teacher who was mentally ill and would send home letters calling me a whore/temptress, etc., that my mother never confronted or moved to defend me from (years later I found these letters and she said she didn't want to rock the boat by bringing them to the principle, and that I *was* difficult after all- this was good for me and would toughen me up). If teasing between my siblings and I escalated, it was always my fault (my brother has a lot of problems from this now- he started hitting us and my mom would always ask what we had done to make him hit us, vs. punishing him for violence). Once or twice she got mad with me and told me she wished I'd never been born/didn't love me, etc. She would refuse hugs and if when I was bullied at school (happened a lot as you can imagine) the old refrain would once again be, 'what did you do to deserve it?' or 'just ignore it, don't be so sensitive'. 

When I hit 14 my mom, and to a lesser extent, my dad, berated me often for being fat (I really wasn't... a bit heavier, maybe, but curvy rather than fat like I had a gut or something), telling me it would be hard to find a boyfriend, etc., because of how I looked. She told me multiple times she was relieved I 'didn't grow up as ugly as I thought you would, your nose looked like a pig's'. Both her and my father would often get very angry with me for being 'lazy' or messy (I was depressed and rarely left my room), and angry that I was 'ruining my face'- I had dermatillomania and would pick to the point of bleeding. If I was sad/cried/tried to confront her on this stuff, I was just being dramatic and oversensitive. I could go on for awhile, and certainly it pales compared to a lot of the stuff you read here.  

When I reached college and met friends with healthy families, I realized mine maybe wasn't so normal, and maybe I wasn't a subhuman pile of garbage (up until then, I primarily made negative friendships where I was more or less bullied/used by the other people. I've been repeating this in relationships too, my first was VERY emotionally abusive, but I am getting better). I confronted my mom and told her that if she didn't work on this, I would NOT be coming home to visit or really, be in contact with them at all. I wouldn't ever want my kids (none yet, but maybe someday) to see their mom letting herself be treated so poorly by someone who is supposed to love her. It got better- my mom stopped insulting me for my weight and looks, and she tried to find stuff for us to do together- antiquing, etc. Sometimes it's really nice, but I can really feel the effort she puts in. When she acts sad when she has to leave or I have to leave from a visit, it feels really put upon and fake. Sometimes things seem normal, and then it all falls to hell again- had to move back in after a BA and within the first month she wanted me to pay rent (vs saving enough to leave), that she would never let me back again once I'd left (including if I ended up in an abusive relationship), etc. 

This past year has been VERY tough for me. I had a (mild) psychotic episode and was diagnosed with bipolar II. I had moved to DC to find a job (my parents covered loans for 2 months or so- I am grateful for that) and was living hand to mouth for essentially a whole year. With an MA in a relevant field and half a dozen internships, I couldn't understand why I wasn't able to find a decent job. I was also raped and was too poor to consider legal action. I would call my mom a lot (probably more than I should have) at this time- I didn't tell her about the rape because I knew her reaction would be to ask what I'd done to deserve it- and cry and cry. I don't know what I was looking for. I guess I wanted her to help me, somehow- just tell me things would be ok. But every time it would just be, 'yeah it sucks, I don't know what to tell you."" Eventually I was suicidal/hallucinating and ended up going to the ER. She kept telling me that she didn't have the emotional capacity to deal with this, and that she had no idea what to do. I told her that she could offer to come down, and she said, ""Is that what you REALLY want me to do? You want me to come down? I mean, I *can*, but"" hard to describe her tone, but, basically- do I haaaave to? I told her not to bother. I finally told her about the rape and she accused me of using it to wound her. 

I finally found work and things were looking up. My parents came down to visit and what stood out to me is my mom saying, ""I know how hard it was for you, but look at you! You did it! It was worth it in the end, you got through it, you're so strong!"" It rubbed me the wrong way, for some reason I can't quite explain. It didn't feel like an accomplishment. It felt like life had been beating me up and I'd just made it out (with an illuminating but damning diagnosis of mental illness to boot). I didn't feel at all proud. I felt like I'd been punished for nothing. I felt like I'd done 'everything right' and it meant essentially nothing except more suffering/pain.

Coming home for the holidays was a hassle, as I sold my car to save money and transportation ended up getting screwed up thanks to my phone being stolen/numbers being lost/etc. My parents jerked me back and forth on a pick up (I had a ride up 5 hours of the way, needed them to get me for the last two)- essentially telling me that they couldn't get me for two hours, so I'd be waiting- which is OK, however,  for reference, my mother does not work, and when I say doesn't work, I mean: does laundry, cleans, and walks the dogs. Getting her to pick someone up (we live in a very rural area) is always a huge pain and she often refuses (she also refused to drive us to friends' houses as a kid unless the friends' moms were there to put pressure on her). I know this sounds entitled, but I move my schedule around significantly to accommodate them when they visit me, and if I don't visit them at their convenience, they guilt trip me. 

Anyways, this holiday it was maybe 2 days before the same old patterns emerged. My sister would be blasting music, I'd ask her to turn it down, she'd scream at me to shut up, and my mom would then blame me for instigating. My sister would tease me saying I smell bad, am lazy/an idiot, etc., and my mom would laugh along or ignore it. I tease my sister for saying something dumb like, ""They should be naked"" about the pilgrims in Saints and Strangers and my mom lights into me for being a bully. I know how childish this sounds, but it just sets me off so badly. It brings back those old familiar feelings of intense self loathing and depression. I have a joking level relationship with my sister that isn't bad on it's own, but when my parents are there she (and my brother, when he's around) ratchet it up and become really nasty. If I go to my dad about this (he's always been decent to me) he just repeats the same stock answers: You're over sensitive. You're being dramatic. You were tough on your mom as a kid. You do it too/ask for it. 

This holiday my mom told us she has an aortic aneurysm, so I have been trying to ignore all of this bc I didn't want to stress her out. But this AM I had enough and again lit into my mom, basically telling her that I was skipping today's family dinner because I knew how it would go. I told her this HAS to change or I will NOT be showing up for Christmas. She cried, cancelled the family vacation to the Keys and offered to refund me (which is just as well, I was thinking about cancelling based off of this week anyways), and hasn't talked to me since (not that I'm trying to talk to her- I'm just sitting in my room avoiding her). 

I just don't understand what I am doing wrong (am I too sensitive/crazy?) or if I should just give up? I've pleaded with my mom to go get therapy with me (she refuses and tells me she's fine/can't change/it's my problem) and I have gotten it on my own. I try really hard to ignore this treatment but it just demoralizes me so much. I have bad self confidence as it is and I have been struggling to build it up bit by bit, and coming home just destroys it. What do I do? My parents CAN be fun and they're not ALWAYS mean but this is just destroying me. 
   
**tl;dr**: My family is maybe abusive and I don't know how to handle it anymore. Help!

I am located in Lexington KY and need help with moving costs. I am a Computer Science/Mathematics student at the University of Kentucky and just landed an internship in Atlanta GA for the spring semester. I have been applying for studios in Atlanta and got approved for one finally, the upfront costs being $2231. I also have to pay ~$150 for a rental car to get to the new city and a deposit for electric and renters insurance for which I don't know the price. I have money to make it in Lexington but my budget does not cover an entire new place in a city (with higher cost of living).

I will receive financial aid through the university in the amount of $13,000, which will be dispersed to me in a few smaller payments throughout the month of January. The internship pays $4150 a month as well, so I will have no problem paying the money back. The entire situation is just bad timing, as I will have plenty of money about a month after I need it. I am able to provide any proof that is requested. As stated in the title I need $2500 and can pay back $3000, I am willing to negotiate on that as well (as I don't have another option).

I've been really feeling hurt from work (in stupid retail), the mental health stigma and lack of considerateness that happens there. I've been angered by things my manager says and how he has dismissed some of my personal information the few times I fell into a situation where I felt that I needed to be either vulnerable about describing my symptoms or side effects, or instead, appearing sketchy as I spit shitty-created lies... obvious lies that I hate and seem bothered to tell. The job has me think so conservatively and is changing me now, that part of me thinks I deserve it, that I'm burdening that system and it makes sense. I feel **fucked up** and why can't I suck it up? If I don't, I feel stuck, I'm working a position I don't care for anymore for managers I don't like so much anymore, and I'm hanging on a thread just for the idea of a promotion in a different department that I'm struggling to hold onto.
All this is for an internship at corporate that my college degree suits me better to, one that could actually set me up to pay off my 100k+ student debt. But that internship itself is really competitive, and this commitment to try to get all the way there is wearing on me.

Another part of me feels overwhelmed with the store's expectations, and hurt that people don't get that depression is an illness like anything else.

I really want to talk stuff out with someone in the world, anyone and yet, not burden anyone or as an old roommate described me once, ""take up space."" (Seems kind of like a rude comment since I always feel like I'm trying really hard to fight my depression, even though it consumes me a lot)

I feel energy and excitment towards some stuff, a lot more than normal for the last 6 months. and yet, I don't feel motivated enough where I'm living (now at my parents' house with my ill mom) to do them enough. I often times just go to work. I try hard, but this weekend I kind of snapped over-working amongst the Black Friday chaos.

I just want TIME, lots of it. Time to act, time to relax, time to plan, sort things out.

I want to live healthier, to see if I'll feel any healthier with my meds (that don't ever seem to work when I'm only so focused enough to get by and am frequently out of routine taking them, eating or sleeping). I want to have the food available and easy to eat that is healthier, instead of eating junk or starving myself. I want to sleep regular hours, and feel proud to drive myself over to the gym. These are the 3 things I want to be able to achieve and then build from there.

But how is that realistic when all I want to do right now is pull the covers over me and nap?

I want change, I want to feel empowered and like I'll do something I feel pride about, not something that I feel like I'm in denial about."
3uncu1,2,2015-11-28,My CLI case in need of review/feedback,NaVorroBooman,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3uncu1/my_cli_case_in_need_of_reviewfeedback/,"Hi could someone with experience dealing with credit limits please review and give me feedback on my case for increasing my own credit limit.

My case for a CLI with Wells Fargo is summarized in the ""My CLI proposal to Wells Fargo"" section.

**Background**

I bank with Wells Fargo. 

VISA Platinum card.

I've had the card for about 5 years (from the age of 18) and it is my only credit card.

The limit on my credit card is $2000.

I only really started to use the card 3 years ago for buying books in college and held somewhere between $1200-$2000 in debt on the card for about two and a half years making $25 (minimum) - $100 payments in that time. I was also late a few (&lt;10) payments in that time frame. 

About 7 months ago I got an internship in which I make $35/hour at 30 hours per week. (I have not told Wells Fargo that I have started working and am still in school, graduating in May)

[ *Internship/Future job info*

My internship ends in May (1 year internship) 

After speaking with my manager he has stated that he wants me along with the other intern who holds the same position as me to stay with the company after our internship in some capacity. 

There aren't any available positions in the department that I am in that match either of our qualifications, but the end of our fiscal year is in May and budgeting for the next FY begins in January so there have been discussions of creating a role (likely some sort of SharePoint administration/developer type of role) for us. 

He has also assured us that if the position is not created he along several others we have worked with will give us quality recommendations either cross departmentally or to any other company we are considering.]

About 4 months ago I made a few major purchases to max out my card (PC build, trip for my girlfriend's birthday) but have made consistent, large payments until the card was paid off in full about a month ago. 

In that 4 month period I also got more serious about building my credit history and have since made all of my purchases on the card, paying the card off each pay period. 

**Current situation**

My parents need to borrow $4000 from me for some emergency expenses.

They have told me this is a temporary situation for them (supposedly they will receive a large sum of money soon and then will pay off my credit card once they do), but I want to proceed as if it isn't because this is far from certain and it will likely be a longer period of time before they are comfortable enough to be able to pay me back.

I take home an average of $1700 every two weeks ($1840 this week) so $3400 each month.

I got paid today, so this morning I had ~$2000 in my account ( ~$200 in my checking before being paid) 

My parents needed $1400 immediately so I transferred the money from my account. 

I now have ~$600 in my checking account, $0 in savings. 

*My monthly expenses are as follows*: 

$1400 rent/utilities (I live with my girlfriend and our total living is $2400/month. I pay $1400 and she pays $1000) charged on my credit card this month (full $2400 amount minus a $1000 cash payment) 

$300 in hospital expenses (for the next 8 months) charged on my credit card.

$220 cable/internet charged on debit.

~$180 health insurance charged on debit.

~$60 misc (occasional food out with coworkers) charged on credit.

My girlfriend pays for our gas, food, public transport etc. 

*Current credit card balance*:

My parents needed me to cover a few more expenses for them this month (our phone bills, brother's car payment, their power bill) in addition to the $4000 that my parents need from me.

This along with some gifts that I bought for the holidays before this came to light gives me the following: 

Posted balance: $641 ($818 - $177 pending online payment from the 27th)

Temp Auths: $837

Total limit used: $1,478

Total available credit: $522

**My CLI proposal to Wells Fargo**

On Monday I will go to my local Wells Fargo and ask for a credit limit increase to $6000. 

*My case is the following*: 

""A emergency situation has come up and I need to lend my parents $2600. 

I currently have an internship making $35/hours at 30 hours per week ($54,600/year before taxes). 

I will have this job until I graduate in May and I have a job offer from the same company paying a more the intern contract (no specific number has been discussed) to start after this contract has gone to term. 

My recent credit history has shown that I have been frequent with my payments and I have shown that I can responsibly budget for, and pay off debt. 

I feel that a CLI from $2000 to $6000 is reasonable and necessary considering my situation and will give me a small amount of breathing room to incur my usual expenses as well as pay off the $5,478 balance that will be posted on my card once I pay my parents expenses along with my rent this month.

My monthly expenses for the next 8 months will total $2160. 

With a monthly take home of $3400 for the next 5 months (and presumably larger after that point) if I am aggressive about paying off the debt, and I intend to be, I can pay $1,096 + interest/month for the next 5 months and pay off the balance and save anywhere between $100-$143 per month."" 

If my current credit balance is questioned I will explain the assistance I have already provided as well as my holiday spending prior to the situation being presented to me. 

Thank you for reading. 

Please let me know how I may improve my chances of getting a CLI or if there is anything I need to omit that would hurt them. 

Your feedback is appreciated!

3unfdt,6,2015-11-28,[Advice request] I am moving out when I turn 18.,nvmnirvana,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3unfdt/advice_request_i_am_moving_out_when_i_turn_18/,"Hello,

Let me first say that I am so glad I found this subreddit, thanks to this article I saw about toxic parents. I'm glad I found it because I decided months ago that I am leaving the house. Basically, there has been sexual, physical, and emotional abuse that has gone on behind closed doors for my whole life. I always thought that it was a good idea to stay because we are wealthy, and they can pay for college, or at least I can finish at my private high school. But every vision of college or the future is being clouded by the feelings I am having now. 

My parents, rather than change their behaviors, got a therapist for me to see at the beginning of the year. When explaining this odd situation to my therapist, she said it's probably because they think I am the problem and that is why I am being dumped onto her. Anyway, she has diagnosed me with chronic PTSD from continued trauma at home. 

I don't want to be supported by these people. If it was legal, I would leave now. Emancipation takes awhile, and I figure I've only got til August anyway. I posted on craigslist in my area offering a position as a live-in maid about an hour ago and I am waiting for responses.

I posted just to see if there has been anyone else who has done something similar to what I have. My older sister just moved back, and we've had a lot of conversations about abuse (it sesms our older brother, the only male child, didn't get the treatment we did and considering my mom is the most abusive in our household, It feels like that's probably accurate.) She went to college and lived across the country for a couple yearis and is back here for an internship, and from our conversations it seems like she is miserable here. 

I want to be the one that got away. I am so sure that cutting them out of my life would be the best thing for me to do. My sister is supposedly going to get her own place here, but that is definitely not certain and I have no idea where life will take her. Has anyone else gone through this and how did you move out?"
3unura,11,2015-11-28,How to socialize with my coworkers and people in general?,project64mm,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3unura/how_to_socialize_with_my_coworkers_and_people_in/,"So I'm starting a new office internship next week, and was wondering if there was any tips on not becoming the ""office weirdo"". I'm pretty sure most coworkers I've had in the past thought I was your typical weird quiet guy. That's because they've been temporary part time jobs and honestly I just had nothing to say to my coworkers. Most of my coworkers have been girls that like to gossip about boys, as a guy I could care less about that...But I know a normal person could still socialize, and I just had nothing to say in my head...I'm like that alot. Nothing pops into my head when trying to socialize. There was one summer job that I did socialize fine with my coworkers, actually became friendly with a few and that made work go by ALOT faster. I'm not aspergers/autism or anything, I think part of it is that I mumble. I don't know. I mean I've been able to interview for various jobs and maintain employment for the past four years so I can't be that odd right? The problem is I literally have nothing to say to coworkers I don't know. After the what's your name, where your from, general intros, I don't know what the hell to say to people. I just go blank when I'm around people I don't know, nothing comes to mind. But when I'm comfortable around people, I'm sociable...But I can tell people I know kinda think I'm odd.

I have to admit I also have trouble maintaining eye contact with people. I know that must come naturally to 9 out of 10 people, but it doesn't for me. I don't know the appropriate time to look in their eyes and glance away then look again. My family/relatives think I'm kinda a weird quiet guy too. I was always quiet at family gatherings because what does a 17-20 year old have in common with a bunch of 30,40,or 50 year olds. I Don't have any cousins or relatives anywhere near my age, so naturally I just don't know how to socialize with them. I don't know... I can get along fine with people in their early 20s (around my age) but other than that Idk what to say. I have gotten better though, this past Thanksgiving I actually made an effort to talk to my relatives and what do you know it went a little better than expected, still kinda uncomfortable and weird. I got a couple glares from one of my uncles and after looking at away then me again with crossed eye brows he just goes ""Uhh...What are you talking about? Can you repeat that? What are you trying to say?"" :/ I've had coworkers say that to me too ""What are you trying to say?""...That just makes me feel like a complete weirdo. Maybe I have developed a mild form of social anxiety, but I wanna get back out there.

Growing up I was actually popular in middle/high school. But then once I was forced to socialize with people outside my little bubble of school, I just floundered. I used to put this immature stupid/funny act in high school so people would like me. And it worked until everyone turned 18/19 and started maturing. I also used to get really drunk just to socialize but now it's gotten to the point where I need to learn how to talk to people sober. I know I can't talk about getting drunk/high at this office, but other than that I can only talk about sports/tv shows/movies really...You'd be surprised as to how fast you can run out of things to say when you only have 3 things to talk about. I can't talk about my personal life because honestly I don't have one. Look at my post history, I'm always on reddit.

I used to go to parties all the time, now I prefer not to. I just feel exhausted after having to socialize/drink with a bunch of people I barely know in a crowded house. Now I just force myself to go out like every two weeks because I don't wanna be a loner stoner weirdo. All I do is smoke weed (judge me whatever) and watch netflix. So there's nothing to talk about in my personal life...Now I'm in college instead of having 30+ people I'm close with I just really have 2 friends (at this point they're probably more acquaintances) and about 3 very mild acquaintances. At the end of the day I'm not close with anyone at all anymore. I just text those 2 people and every third time they tell me to come out with them, other times they kinda ignore me or make excuses. One of my roommates thinks I'm a weirdo, he came home drunk one night and told me I'm a freak and a creature. But the other one and I get along just fine and actually hangout a lot. So maybe I just rub certain types of people the wrong way? I just don't want to become the office weirdo at this place, I could end up working for this firm for a long time and will get a job offer right out of school if things go right.

And before i get the rest of my financial aid for the second semester there is a couple things i need to take care of.

I need to pay some bills, pay some dmv fees for my car which I bought from some money i had saved up from a summer job, -The fees are due monday. I bought it thinking I'd still have a little left over money before the semester ended, (my Dad was gonna help me pay half but ended up helping a little less)- and I have rent coming up, (~$300).

I know if I ask my parents they will help out but they helped me pay the insurance this last month and I don't want to ask them for more. I guess i could borrow then pay them back but I do not like asking. And I want to be more independent. 

So I am thinking of getting a credit card to cover my rent and maybe lik 200 dollars needed for the other stuff and food. I have no idea how credit cards work and I see this as an opportunity to learn, be more responsible in my spending (budgeting), and earn credit. Plus I have a friend that can get me a job. Also I was recommended by a classmate to two intern offers so I have a chance to be able to then be paying the bank back. The only thing is I don't know how bad/good my credit score is. The internet bill is late constantly and under my name. Also the apt is under my name with another friend and for three years has only been late once and only one day late.

Any advice on what I should do? It seems stubborn but I don't want to ask my parents.

Also I'm on my third year of school an will graduate next year. I have only taken out one loan of $5500 half which will come next semester in January. It is also a subsidized loan and I don't plan on using up the other half and just having it for an emergency. Kinda just have it there and if not used then I can just use it to pay back the loan once the year is over.

I believe I can take out a regular (nonsubsidized) student loan too, but I don't want to be $2000 in debt with interest building up.

Thanks in advance!"
3uo29g,3,2015-11-28,Finally getting help and feeling better!,Selaws,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3uo29g/finally_getting_help_and_feeling_better/,"After years of rumination, low self-esteem, social anxiety, hating myself, and suicidal ideations, I am finally getting help. The majority of my life I have had moderate to severe social anxiety, causing self-harm in the way of hitting myself in middle-school and high-school. I had little friends throughout school and no friends for many years. Now that I am in college the social anxiety is mostly gone, though the rumination, low-self esteem, etc. still remain to a lesser extent.

The end of October I had what I think was a panic attack after a series of incredibly stressful events: making friends for the first time in many years, having support and caring from the new friends, stress from school, stress from the internship, having an unhealthy friends with benefits relationship, and increasingly worse 24/7 fatigue. I couldn't sleep the full night through without taking 2-4 benadryl depending on how bad the insomnia was. During the attack I couldn't stop racing thoughts, pounding chest, immense anxiety, and grief. I cut my thigh up with a blunt knife, took some benadryl, and cried sitting in the shower with the water pouring down on me for awhile. I didn't sleep much that night.

After the panic attack I talked with one of my new friends who has depression about the attack. After talking with her she took me down to the school counseling center with the school psychologist a few days later. The first appointment I talked and cried for the entire hour but felt a sense of relief that I finally decided to get help, and acknowledged that I was probably depressed. The past few therapist appointments I have had trouble divulging all of my past to the therapist -- the immense social anxiety in my past. I have yet to tell her about the hitting.

I talked to my GP who prescribed Zoloft 25mg/day for 2 weeks. She recently upped my dose to 50mg/day. I feel like a less broken person taking the Zoloft in combination with the therapy and having friends who support me. I no longer constantly overthink situations, ruminate 24/7, and have trouble with conversations. Though I still do these things occasionally the difference is night and day. Last month I wouldn't have been able to make this post.

I still have doubts that I am depressed and sometimes feel that I am just faking it. I never have trouble with getting out of bed or getting decent grades. One summer I couldn't get a job because of low-self esteem and no motivation, but I felt less broken than most people who posted to online forums about depression and convinced myself I was fine and my personality was just awful.

I am making an appointment to see a psychiatrist near my college soon. I really like my GP but I feel like I would have less doubts about if I have real depression if the psychiatrist diagnoses me instead."

Our main aim for next year is to hire 5 interns to work on expanding our resources. Specifically, we'd like to add support for ARM and RaspberryPis and produce an OS-dev starter-kit aimed at A-Level and 1st year University students. We reckon with our combined knowledge and existing resources, along with the support of the University of Bristol, we can produce this in our 12-week summer ""break"". Why the University of Bristol? Because I'm a second year Computer Science and Electronics student here! My team and I are all students here at the University.  

We imagine our campaign would have small rewards entitling you to your name on a contributors list (in the OS and on our website) and larger rewards for: 
 - One unit of the kit itself (along the lines of an RPi, the software/articles, a getting started guide and supporting materials)
 - Your name on the front page of our website plus the kit 
 - And a corporate level reward which will include things like logo/name on our website and on emails, special access to present to undergrads here at the Uni, blog posts etc. 

We'd be aiming for £20,000 in total (including anything we get from companies separately) which would cover the hiring costs and initial investment in producing the kits. We've already spoken to suppliers and distributors about the viability of this and whether they would produce/stock it and they said they think it is possible and would be happy to help us.

So we're interested to know if people would support such a campaign? If so, what rewards would you like to see? Any recommendations?

tl;dr What do you guys think about a ChE working as lab slave a first internship?


Edit: I still have one more year to go and just want internship experience. I am not looking for an entry level position yet.

Edit2:Just an update guys, I had my interview today... I knew they were gonna ask me a question on TLC, and I studied a lot about it, but I was nervous the whole time and im not too confident she thought I did well. I mean, she did emphasize in her email prior to my interview that she liked how I had a lot of time my upcoming fall quarter to be an intern, but my interview didnt go so hot.

3ur5xu,0,2015-11-29,An unusual debt/,howcaniberight,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ur5xu/an_unusual_debt/,"Hi all,

Here is a brief overview of a hypothetical scenario:
Due to an interesting series of events, I have access to between 30-40k that is not in my name, nor is it in anyway associated with my name. This might sound sketchy, but it is intended to be a ""towards my future"" fund that was started when I was a teenager by a large group of people. it is maintained by a longtime family-friend and held by this friend's company. (sorry I don't know any more detail) It was invested very conservatively so that it was guaranteed accessible at any time, so it has seen very little growth over the years.

I was a clever lad at the time, and decided to work my way through undergrad with scholarships and part-time jobs rather than take the easy money option which taught me a lot about financial responsibility. I have a degree in engineering and am currently in graduate school at a prestigious university studying computer science. I took out a $30k private loan which cost me around $3/day in interest. This is the only loan I will take out as from here on out I am funded. I could pay it all off right now with the 30k sitting around (that I can access if need be), but I will undoubtedly be able to pay off this debt in one summer post graduation. (CS internship) My plan is to pay it off in its entirety no later than the end of summer 2017. I will have accrued $1,941 in interest by then on the loan.  I may be able to mitigate this amount earlier if I am selected for any of the fellowships I have applied for.

All that being said, I have spoken with the family-friend and he mentioned to me that if I am not going to use the money directly any time soon, we could consider a more aggressive investment strategy or something long term.

Is this not a good opportunity? Please point out the implications of being able to invest money that is guaranteed only for ""your future"", but not attached to your name in any way. I know the typical 'always reduce debt first' paradigm, but this is a situation you can't just stumble into. If I am positive I will be able to pay off the debt myself, and I can also get this investment going in parallel (as a safety net set-it-and-forget it kind of thing) without worrying about it being my capital, but always having access to it down the line, should I not go for it?

Thanks for the input."
3urdd2,12,2015-11-29,Fuck Job Interviews,Moe2DBooty,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/3urdd2/fuck_job_interviews/,"I was reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3upboo/what_is_an_absolute_no_no_when_going_for_a_job/) and it got me in a really upset and anxious mood about job interviews. I'm rather young and I'm graduating college within the next month. I'm introverted, and I have to say there's nothing I'm dreading more than trying to get a job. I hate how absolutely fake every human interaction needs to be all while trying to keep a facade of honesty, and nowhere can you see this better than in advice for the ideal job interview. I spent the past six fucking years day-in and day-out studying and practicing the skills that I'd use for the rest of my life, much more than other students in my same field, yet I still have to worry that I won't get the job because I can't spew as much bullshit in this weird sort of ritual as other people can. 

""Why don't you try learning how to be more social?"" 

I know, I know. It's not easy though. Maybe something's wrong with me, but I can't figure it out on my own and everywhere I go I can't find REAL advice. It reminds me of the type of ridiculous and self-contradictory advice you'd get when you asked someone what to do if you were bullied in school. ""You have to assert yourself and show them you won't let yourself be bullied, but remember not to fight back, because you'd only be stooping to their level. It only encourages them.""

Take a look at that link up there. Look at the type of advice people give you. One comment says 

&gt;Be honest

And then another says 

&gt;also, responding to ""why do you want to work here"", anything along the lines of ""I need a job"" is not a good answer. These are the most common flubs on most candidates answers and the best advice I can give.

To me, being honest means that I don't have to act like the company I'm applying to is some sort of deity that blessing me with work. Why do I want to work here? Cut out the bullshit. It's because you're the least shitty place that has called me back, or maybe it's because you're the *only* place that called and I really need that job, or every job I *actually* want to apply to has higher standards than yours and you're just the lowest rung of that ladder that I can reach right now. It's definitely not because I really want to work for your business, I shouldn't have to pretend that I'd practically work at your company for free if I could, and no, it doesn't look like a better opportunity than Competitor-Business-Down-The-Road. I'm not in love with your company, because this is a goddamn business transaction. The person you're gonna hire instead of me is going to get the job because he jerked off his future employer's ego, not because he actually wants to work there above all other places. Do you seriously want the guy who lied to your face on day one, the best bullshitter of the batch?

No, I don't have any experience. Just because I didn't work at some shitty McDonalds in high school doesn't mean I'm less prepared to work at your business than other new grads, and I can't get any actual business in my own field because no one will hire me without it. Unless I want to do some internships, meaning two more years of giving free work with no money in return for just the slim hope that a future employer will give a shit about it, all while having to pay my loans in 7 months. I'd rather just take the minimum wage job at that point. 


Honestly, I don't even despise the social aspects of business, I just hate this stupid ritual of having to needlessly fake emotions or thoughts. Want to bring some humanity to the job? Then let me *really* be honest about everything. If not, then handle your applications more like applying for college. Here are my credentials, here's what I studied, here's my GPA, here are other objective things that make me suitable all laid out on paper. Let me know if you want me, and don't bother with an interview. "
3urf6g,8,2015-11-29,I'm so glad this semester is over,NEET_Here,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3urf6g/im_so_glad_this_semester_is_over/,"edit: Almost over

I'm a first generation college student and had so much shit thrown at me this semester. I've been working about 30/hrs per week this past year and decided to take 16 units this semester as a Computer Science major. Physics 2, Algorithms Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Calc 3 and Linear Algebra. I did this so I only needed to take 1 class next semester to save up before I transferred out and could look for a better job.

On top of those classes my dad got arrested and had to bail him out, my mom decided she found true love in mexico and the same week she moved with her boyfriend he hit her and moved back. I don't know how much money she spent, but she's essentially broke now and staying with relatives. 

My sister who I'm sharing an apartment with is struggling to start her career since she graduated last year. 

I don't have a car and bike everywhere in a car centric city with really bad public transportation. My legs are strong though since I bike 100+ miles a week, so there's that.

I also wasn't able to get any financial aid and can't take out loans, so struggling with groceries and bills was not fun at all.

In 2 weeks though I'll finally be a bit more free, so I'm really really looking forward to the end of this semester. I just got a new job and can finally quit my shitty retail job, but as soon as this semester is over because i need to be able to put in more hours before i transition.

Once the semester is over I'll have time to apply for internships, working on personal projects, plenty of exercise, cook more food, etc.

I always hear about how after college you have a mortgage and kids to worry about, but fuck all that. I could never do that to myself. I can't wait to graduate and start a career, get a small apartment with a gf and no kids. Save up, pay off everything, invest and save more while traveling as much as I can. Ideally work a remote job that pays really well and be able to do the things I want to do when I want to do. Just not being locked down and feeling trapped. "

Basically I spent most of the last 8 years of my free time in my room doing jack shit. I don't have close friends, or a group of friends, and (more or less) never had a girlfriend. I don't care about wild parties and travelling, I'm talking about the basics. I know some of you will say I'm young but I sabotaged my own life during the most important, intense, and generally enjoyable years of ones time on Earth and I excluded myself from getting valuable experiences and foundations for the following years.

I became a bit of a loser at the beginning of my teenage years, became shy and got less confident as I didn't feel like leaving childhood (I was around 1 year younger than everyone else in my class can't tell how much it explains). I had no friends at the end of midschool.
It got better in high school and during my 2nd year at 15 I had some good friends and was doing better socially but still lacked a bit of confidence in larger groups of people or with people I didn't know, and didn't really got into a group of friends but feeling like I was slowly getting there. Got rejected by 2 girls (one I loved) who probably liked me but sadly had no idea that being direct and calm and just saying ""wanna go out with me"" or something was the best way to go at that time. Also rejected a cool girl because of the two previous ones, thinking I had plenty of time anyway to find 'the good one'. We hanged out a lot during the summer and I changed my mind later but it was just before I had to move to another town. But whatever I would meet plenty of new people there no need to be sad (and I wasn't that much). Sadly those were the only truly happy days I've had since.

I failed to integrate during my last year of high school because I didn't even try to fit in, still had a few friends there but never left my house outside of school. I continued in Uni in that same town, but in my class we were around 10 people for a year and 5 the next 2 years. Had a good friend which left after the the first year, then we were only small talking during the next years. I wasted the most important years (17/18/19) just to get a mediocre degree.
I then moved to another town for year 20/21 in another Uni. I thought I would magically have a circle of friend and find a gf without trying like when I was 15. But isolation and stubbornness made me ignorant. Didn't have a facebook, which outcasted me a bit, avoided parties because I didn't like the few ones I went to in high school. Went to a few events, saw a few friends outside from time to time but that's all. At 22 I worked and lost contact with everyone in that Uni, was fine with seeing the people in my weightlifting club. And I still felt fine. So yeah, basically spent 7 years waiting for something to happen.

At 23 I moved away another time for my last year of Uni (as I worked a year and did ok in school I could land that at least) but this time forcing myself to be as social as possible, going to every social events organized by people in my class. I had no problem asking a girl in my class out who said no which made me a little bit disappointed but that's all... but quickly it turned into introspection, realizing I was out of place compared to other people my age, thinking about every events that turned me that way, the things I did badly, the things I should have done and didn't, my blindness, apathy, daydreamings which prevented me from taking any actions to fix my life... because I didn't even feel like there was a problem.

I wish I became depressed sooner (if I am I'm not even sure). But as always I wait until it's too late or at least compromised. It's pretty clear it's self-realization that I have to do something. But I was taking changes before being depressed. Now I have no motivation and feel awful 95% of the time, can't sleep without waking up totally anxious some hours later if I don't take light meds (or can stay up to 14h in my bed). Even while lifting heavy stuff at the gym I think about all of this.
I'm getting better at social life by being friendly and open but still a bit awkward in a lot of situations and I feel rather boring, unable to talk about so much subjects, and it's like that after all those years it's some part of my personality. When I saw friends from my first high school years later they were so much more well adjusted, mature, friendly, interesting than me it hurt.

I can't overcome the fact that a small lack of confidence, a few terrible choices, laziness, cowardice, mild anxiety, feeling content, and a bit lack of luck totally stopped me from becoming the person I could have become. And I was so close from it, had I twitched a few things. I want to punch my head in a wall thinking about stuff that happened 8 years ago that I didn't care about before. Sometimes I feel better about making plans for next year, but I realize once again it's desperation talking and basically daydreaming again, and that I've done that again and it's far from enough.
I keep fantasizing about redoing the wrongs. And even if somehow I do better, I will always be far from where I could have been. And I will always have wasted all those years by my own fault. Also even if I wasn't spending time with other people, I could have used it to learn new skills. But I did jack shit apart from distracting myself... which was enough to not make me need seeing people.

On top of that I'm slowly but surely balding, which I could have been able to deal with if I had a youth, but I feel like it's telling me you failed and you're done deal with it. I can't see any light in front of me. I'm still gonna do my best to be social and happy, force myself to do some volunteer work to stop thinking about my sorry ass person, find people around to learn a new language, and get my degree and a good internship, because I have no fucking choice anyway. But the enormous regrets and their consequences are totally crushing me.

Thanks for reading that very long post and for any kind of help. Also hope the best for all of you.

3uspac,7,2015-11-29,(8 months) Should I keep growing? Also how should I fix the dye job?,themouseinator,FierceFlow,https://www.reddit.com/r/FierceFlow/comments/3uspac/8_months_should_i_keep_growing_also_how_should_i/,"So I've posted on here a couple of times before, and I'm pretty sure every time is me worried about whether I should keep growing it or not haha.

[Here is an album of my hair right now and how I've been keeping it.](http://imgur.com/a/jUrzZ)  I've recently started putting up the hair in the very back to prevent the mullet thing I've got going.  I've also now taken to putting in a hidden bobby pin in the front to keep the bangs out of my face when necessary. Overall, I think it often looks silly, and the awkward stage has it's bad days, but by itself I could power through it.  I've been able to gain enough control over it.  But I'm currently interviewing for internships for the summer. Like, I've already done a couple of interviews, and I need to submit resumes to more places to do more.  I'm looking to go into IT, but a lot of places I'm looking at are more corporate big-company places, because a lot of big companies are headquartered in my city.  I'm terrified that my hair (either the length or dye job) will hurt my chances at getting an internship/job, but I really don't want to cut it either. And having just finished Thanksgiving, my family/parents have been kind of hammering it into me about how cutting my hair would vastly improve my chances. So I've been second-guessing myself a ton because even though I want to grow my hair, I want to get the best job I possibly can as well...

And speaking of the dye job. I got it dyed originally like 7 months ago, and I'm reeeeaally needing to fix it up.  Right now I'm torn between bleaching the roots to match the ends, or dying the bleached ends to match my natural hair.  What do you guys think would look better?

3ut09u,179,2015-11-29,SpaceX Manufacturing Engineer Interview Experience. Ask me anything,loveschwarma,spacex,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3ut09u/spacex_manufacturing_engineer_interview/,"The purpose of this post is to describe my interview experience with SpaceX and hopefully help out those either looking for employment at SpaceX or actively interviewing.

**Educational Background**: Graduated in 2013 from UC Irvine with a BS in Physics with a Minor in Biomedical Engineering.  Cumulative GPA: 3.2, Major GPA: 2.9, Eng. GPA: 3.6.  I never took any structures/materials classes and I will be entirely honest with you when I say I cannot answer any of [these spaceX intern interview questions](http://www.businessinsider.com/11-tough-spacex-interview-questions-interns-get-2015-10). 

**Professional Background**  I worked for a year and 3 months as an R&amp;D/Manufacturing engineer catheter startup in the medical device industry (you wear many hats at a startup).  After that, the job I just left was as a Process Engineer at a fairly large Medical Device company for the past year and a half.  (As a side note, in the Medical Devince industry, nobody EVER uses knowledge from the college education.  It is one of the few engineering fields where you can get a job WITHOUT an engineering degree.  I know of engineers with art degrees, poli sci degrees, no degrees etc.  The opposite is true in the Aerospace industry).

**First Contact** I got contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn.  I was looking for a new job but I had not even considered the aerospace industry.  The opportunity intrigued me and I decided to go forward.  I told her upfront I have no Aerospace experience and was wondering why a company like spaceX which presumably has a hiring pool full of 4.0 MIT/Harvard Aerospace Engineers wants with little old me but she said she liked my professional background and they're looking to hire manufacturing engineers, which I did have 2 years of experience in.  Also she said SpaceX hires for ""raw engineering talent"" which I don't believe in and actually interpret as a bit of a red flag.  She asked to see my resume and if managers were interested, she would let me know.  I sent her my resume.  She asked me what I was looking for salary wise and I gave her a number.  She was upfront about salary as well as saying they typically work 50-60 hour weeks and longer before launch deadlines.

**Phone Interviews**  Recruiter said managers were very interested (I was surprirsed) and wanted to schedule a phone interview.  I did two phone interviews which represented two different manufacturing groups: Propulsion Components and Structures.  Propulsion interview went great.  No theoretical questions, just typical interview questions about my work experience, projects that I worked on, problems that I encountered, what I wanted to do with my career, why spaceX, etc.  Structures interview went OK but it was apparent it wasn't a good fit.  I worked in high volume manufacturing where my projects were reducing scrap rate whereas they were building like 10 rocket bodies a year, no scrap rate.  Both me and the interviewers agreed that that group isnt as good of a fit and the propulsion components group would be a better fit.  The recruiter later told me that while they didnt feel it was a good fit, they still had positive things to say.

**Onsite Interview**  A few days after the phone interviews, I got invited for the onsite interview.  They scheduled it two weeks from the call.  I have been to several interviews in my career but what was new was that I had to prepare a 10 minute presentation on a project that I worked on as well as an ""executive summary"" of my achievements (strange seeing as how my resume was essentially this, but OK).  Interview day came around and I drove to Hawthorne (I live in nearby Orange County about an hour away).

Was able to find parking.  I already had another job offer so I wasn't really nervous.  From the outside rather unimpressive but lots of people going in and out.  Once I got into the lobby, very futuristic and ""modern"" looking and could see into office space.  I would describe it as what I would imagine google to be like.  A nerd mecca for aerospace engineers (a good thing!).  Once my recruiter met me we went on a brief 15 minute tour.  The entire company is open cubicles with some people having standing desks (side note: I had never seen these before and they looked kind of creepy).  Apparently only HR and Finance has true offices.

Took me by the cafeteria.  Breakfast and Lunches are $5, Dinner $3, with a sandwich bar, smoothie bar, free coffee bar with baristas.  That was very cool.  A huge perk.  The manufacturing floor was cool because I had never seen rocket assemblies and engines being built.  This, as I expected, was a largely manual process (akin to building an engine yourself) and the production floor was rather messy compared to other manufacturing floors that I've worked.  However, it didn't really bother me because I figured thats why they're hiring me. They had a cleanroom, which I had a lot of experience in from medical devices.  From my experience I was able to point out some low hanging fruit that could improve their production floors.

After tour, I had my presentation up on their computer and waited for people to come in.  About 10 people were there for my presentation.  I presented on a project that I had initiated at my work to resolve a high scrap rate issues and the steps that I went through to figure out the root cause(s) and resolve it.  No hardball questions mostly asked me to explain more about certain things.  This is fairly easy to do on a project that you spend a few months on.

Afterwards they ushered me into a pretty small conference room where I sat and waited.  The recruiter said they would deliberate whether or not they wanted to proceed with the interview.  They chose to proceed and met with two of the interviewers I had phone interview with.  We ended up continuing the interview over lunch (on the house, of course).  The food was good but the portions were a little large.

**The meat of the interviews** After lunch is where I went through the meat of the interviews.  I did about 4 separate 30-40 minute interviews with 1-2 people in each.  Overall I would describe the interview difficulty as ""medium"". Nobody asked me any theoretical or textbook questions.  Also, no philosophical questions about  my thoughts on space or spaceflight.  All questions were strictly business and directed towards work experience and projects.  I think this is pretty easy when you spend 8 months working on a project alone you know all the ins and outs of it so there's not really anything anyone can drill you on.  Overall interviews went great and gelled well with interviewers. They brought up numerous times the working hours and environment and asked if I was worried about it.  I told them I worked at a startup before so I'm used to it and not scared of it.  The only odd questions I got was one interviewer asked me: 1) how many launches spaceX had done 2) what was the name of the rockets 3) how many rockets there are in a falcon assembly.  I didn't really know 1) and 2) but I did my best. He was an exception, not the rule.

Overall the interview went from 10:30AM-4:00PM.  It went well.  A week later the recruiter called and said that the interviewers said great things.  The direct manager was unable to meet with me when I went in and he wanted to do a final phone interview just to get to know me before hiring me.  At that point, I knew SpaceX was going to give an offer but decided for a variety of reasons that I'd rather take the other job offer I had on the table.

If anyone is interested I can discuss this more.  Let me know if you have any questions about any other step in this process."
3ut0kd,3,2015-11-29,25/F/US looking for snail mail penpals!,CleverPseudonymHere,penpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/3ut0kd/25fus_looking_for_snail_mail_penpals/,"Hello there! My name is Lee, and I am a 25-year-old legal intern somewhere in the DC metro area. After graduation, law students are unceremoniously expelled from the city where they attended school and thrust out into the real world, as if any of us know how all of this works. However, I found a job near the capital, which I love, and have managed to feed myself thus far while studying for the bar exam, so I'm off to a good start.  

&amp;nbsp;

I spend more time than I should on the internet, but I also spend a lot in the gym, as it's very close to where I work. I have an eclectic blend of interests and often can't see the forest for the trees. I'd consider myself an old soul but I also relish the small things and can be extremely silly and whimsical if the mood strikes. My Myers-Briggs type is INTJ. I think the greatest pleasures in life come from the small things-watching the sunrise, getting a good cup of coffee, or relaxing after a difficult workout.  

&amp;nbsp;

I consider myself a jack of all trades and a master of none, except that I'm a good legal researcher. I have a large breadth of knowledge on several subjects and pretty decent Google-fu, if I do say so myself. I'm like a magpie; once I spot something shiny I immediately have to know more (or all) about it. For instantly, I once spent an entire afternoon learning about paper density after shopping in-store for new stationary. Another day I was suddenly struck by the awareness that I didn't know the differences in American and Continental-style dining (even though I've been abroad) and felt compelled to teach myself. Other people fascinate me and I hope to converse with someone who's equally interested in the world. You don't have to be an over-analyzer like I am, just be prepared-I chase quite a few metaphorical rabbits in my letters.  

&amp;nbsp;

There aren't a lot of things that I'm not interested in, but I'll list a few so I don't end up disappointing you if you're keenly interested in them. I keep up with pop culture and the lives of celebrities only in tiny snippets. Usually Twitter and Facebook spoon-feed me the gossip of the day and then I'm over it. The only reality shows I've watched recently are ""What Would You Do?"" as well as ""Naked and Afraid"" and ""Deadliest Warrior"". I'm not into fantasy books, tv shows, or movies, but there are some specific movies like Underworld and Snow White and the Huntsman that I can really get into. I'm not an artist anywhere but the kitchen, although I'm slowly trying to get back into playing the piano (as well as remembering my Italian) since I was in band in high school and loved it. I'm a Christian, though I'm far too liberal to really adhere to the tenets of the Baptist church where I grew up. If you're a Christian I'd love to talk about God and theology with you. If you're agnostic/atheist/other I respect your beliefs but I'm not up for interrogatories or faith-bashing.  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for a penpal who's a US or UK citizen between the ages of 22 and 32, and fluent in English. (If you're from the UK, just know that I will keep my Anglophilia in check, although I do love Oscar Wilde and was inordinately excited to find crumpets at Trader Joe's. Again, it's the small things.) I'm pretty conscientious of grammar and spelling and ask you to be as well, although I know that mistakes happen and I'll probably make a few myself. I am not looking for love, just good conversation. I'm looking for someone who's interested in sending and receiving old-fashioned snail mail. I love getting letters and I love writing them, although some days I find that I can write up to five pages and others I can only muster one. I have a few different types of stationary which I switch out when I get bored or want to write something of a specific length. I actually got the idea of browsing here from the opening line of ""Jennifer's Body"", where Amanda Seyfried's character says ""Every day I get letters."" (But unlike her, I can promise you that I'm not in an asylum.) Please PM me if you're interested, and thanks for reading!"
3utjfe,3,2015-11-30,My girlfriend [21 F] of 3.5 years wants to break up with me [20 M]. I feel blindsided by the way she feels and really want to make this still work. Do I have any options?,gdchrlt77,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3utjfe/my_girlfriend_21_f_of_35_years_wants_to_break_up/,"Okay, so some background on our relationship first.  We've been dating for 3.5 years, since the summer before our senior year of high school.  I fell head over heels for this girl and have been madly in love since about 3 months into our relationship.  She's honestly everything I ever wanted in a partner (personality wise, looks, smarts, cute and sassy, etc.) and we've had a pretty good journey together.  She and I went to different colleges after being together for about a year and 3 months.  I stayed in state, and she went to college 4 states over and 1000 miles away.  

Now, if I'm being perfectly honest, I thought that she might break up with me at this point in our relationship because she chose a school so far away and I wasn't sure if she was willing to do long distance.  We had multiple talks with each other and we both mutually decided that we were in love and we were going to try out long distance and do our best to make it work.  Fast forward to the school year and everything is going greatly despite our long distance.  I flew up to see her 3 times the fall semester and she flew down to see me once during the fall semester.  We each paid for our own tickets and our own hotel.  During the Spring semester, we were both much lower on money so I was only able to fly up to see her once, and I paid for her airplane ticket to visit during Spring break.  Our visits together were some of the best days of my life, and throughout all of the year we were doing long distance, we were generally very happy and in love with each other.  We even wrote each other cute little handwritten letters, and we talked about marriage and our long term future together extensively.

After freshman year of college, she could no longer afford out of state tuition and came back to our home state and began taking classes here.  This was great for our relationship because long distance is HARD.  We were able to hang out regularly all of last year and all of this semester.  Now all throughout this time, we had talked extensively about marriage and moving in together after college.  I recently was offered a very high paying internship, and I confided a mutual friend of ours that I would likely be using this money to buy her an engagement ring.  This news got to her, and we talked more about our future together and when I would pop the question (after we'd graduated), etc.

Now, no relationship is perfect and ours is certainly not without its faults either.  She just recently turned 21 and has been going through a few changes.  She and I have never been ""party-ers"" and never drank before.  However, now that she's 21 she's been hanging out with some of her work friends and drinking/partying mildly.  Now this is a pretty big change for me and I wasn't nearly as supportive as I should have been.  I didn't ever ask her to change, but I was disapproving of it which was definitely not cool.  I am also a somewhat jealous person, and have explicitly told her that I don't like a few of her coworkers and don't want her hanging out with them one on one (which I think is somewhat fair as there are two coworkers in particular who have made multiple flirtatious advances on her, one of whom even asked to come over to her house at 1 AM to cook a snack for her).

Either way, there have been a few of flaws in me that I recognize and now know I need to work on.  I never thought that these flaws were a deal breaker to her since we have been generally happy together.  Just last week we were talking about marriage and our future together, and the conversation we had today felt like it came out of nowhere.

She came over today and told me that she doesn't think we should be in a relationship anymore.  I've never felt so hurt or upset in my life, and I've felt extremely nauseous since.  We had a long talk together and she told me that the aforementioned issues (as well as being a poor listener sometimes) made her not want to be with me anymore.  She says that she still loves me, and she says that the main reason she wants to break up is so she can grow as a person and focus on herself.  This makes complete sense to me and I can definitely understand why she would want some time by herself to grow since I haven't been very accommodating to her changes this past month.  I told her many times that I can now see my flaws and that I'll do everything I can to fix them. 

To me, it doesn't feel very fair because she just turned 21 a month ago and we haven't had any big talks or fights about anything.  It basically went from talking about marriage to breaking up in a week, and I'm honestly so blindsided that I don't know what to do with myself.  She was my everything, and I can't really imagine life without her.  I told her how sorry I was and how I recognized my problems and would do my best to change, and she decided that she would rather we go on a 2 week break then reevaluate our relationship than officially break up.  I told her that if we break up that I would have to cut her out of my life completely, and that we would not be able to remain friends because I wouldn't be able to get over her if we did.

Anyways, I'm wondering if you guys think I have any chance at making this work?  She is not interested in any other men, and we made it clear that this break was to have some time alone to think about things and that we were still monogamous.  I thought we had something really great, and part of me wants to believe that I can still have a future with her.  I'm also afraid that I just delayed the inevitable by taking a break, and that I'm only going to hurt myself more when she officially breaks up with me in two weeks.  I don't really have anyone to talk to about this (she was my best friend and the person I talked to about everything) and I feel so alone and afraid of life without her.  Does /r/relationships have any advice on what I should/could do to win her back (or if that's even a possibility), or alternatively advice on what I should be doing to move on if you guys think it's not salvageable.  




   
**TL;DR:

Girlfriend of 3.5 years wants to break up with me despite talking about marriage and our future together just last week.  She's been changing quite a bit after turning 21 (a month ago) and I've been dragging my feet a little bit which has caused some turmoil.  I truly believe that we could still have a happy, loving life together (provided she changes her mind) and I was wondering if you guys even think the relationship is salvageable**"
3utqra,10,2015-11-30,"Pretty sure I have depression, not sure what to do about it.",throwaway36X,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3utqra/pretty_sure_i_have_depression_not_sure_what_to_do/,"First off: sorry about the wall of text. I tried to organize it a little bit so similar issues are near each other and it flows a little bit, but it's almost 3 am and I've been awake for 18 hours on 4 hours of sleep.

Just to preface this with a little bit about myself: I'm 23, in my sixth year of college and what should be my last year of engineering school. I grew up in an upper-middle class family. My parents pay for my rent, school, car insurance, gas, and cell phone. I had an internship over the summer and they liked my work enough that they're letting me work part time from school (about 10 hours away; they gave me a laptop and I connect remotely). Not sure if any of that is relevant, but it just makes me feel like I have no reason to be depressed, which just makes me feel worse.

For the last year or so, but especially since September, I've been having a lot of trouble with just about everything. I have no motivation to do anything. There are things I want to do, but when I finally get around to doing them, I don't enjoy myself, and quit. The only thing I seem to actually enjoy is when I get a chance to go out with friends, but even then, I'm worrying about the things I should be doing. There are even times I wont go out when I get the chance because I know I have something important I have to do, but I know I won't be able to muster up the effort required to actually do it. I'm essentially doing none of my homework (one assignment per class, per week - easily several hours per assignment). One of the classes I'm in is being offered for the last time this semester and I don't know what will happen if I don't pass. Everybody is expecting me to graduate in May, and I don't know if it will happen. I just want to be done with school, but I can't make myself put forth enough effort to pass any of my classes. I would love to talk to my family about it, but they don't seem to care. If I get a bad grade, all I hear from my parents is things along the lines of ""We know you can do better"" ""Are you talking to your professors and getting help"" and ""Are you still going to graduate on time."" I would talk to my professors, but when I actually do manage to do my homework, I procrastinate so much that there's no time for me to go see them. I was a straight A student through high school and got a 28 on my ACT so they expect me to be a straight A student in college. I mentioned that I was planning to stay at school and take one last class over the summer, and my parents' reaction was asking if I could take the class in the spring semester because they want to stop paying rent. I understand what they're doing for me is expensive, but there's no inquiry of why I'm taking a summer class. Even though I'm so close to finishing, I really just want to take time off of school and figure out my life.

My mom is also obsessed with losing weight. She lost a bunch of weight a few years ago and still complains about being fat (for the record, at this point she is probably underweight), but that's an issue she has to worry about. What bothers me about it is that she's always pushing me to lose weight. I want to lose weight, but I barely have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. At one point she said if I hit 250 lbs she would take me to get some form of weight loss surgery. I understand that she wants me to be healthy and live a long time, but the way she goes about it just makes me feel like a fat piece of shit.

And if that doesn't kill my self-esteem and confidence enough, I've never had a girlfriend, or even been on an actual date. One girl kissed me at a party once and I obsessed over that for a week. I have plenty of female friends, and I have no more problems talking to girls than I do guys, but I either can't read the signs when a girl is into me, or they just don't seem to be into me. I feel like part of my problem is that I suck at/hate small talk, but I'm so self-conscious about everything that I can't seem to carry a conversation unless I'm really comfortable with the person I'm talking to.

I seem to spend all of my time on Reddit, Netflix, or both. I used to love reading and video games, but now I get bored within a few minutes. The only game I seem to be able to play for extended periods is Fallout 4, but even that gets boring after an hour unless my friend is on Teamspeak with me. I remember when I was playing Fallout 3 and New Vegas I would just get sucked in and play all day and have a blast. I miss being able to do that. 

I feel like I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about my life. I tell my friends the ""fun"" stuff, but I seem to pretend that if I don't talk about what I'm really dealing with, it doesn't exist. It works great for evenings out, but it's not working long term. 

This post took me an hour to type when I really should be working on a lab report that's due in 5 hours. I haven't started, and the reports for this lab class take longer than that to get a passing grade on. At this point I'm just going to sleep for those 5 hours and force myself to go to class. It just all feels so pointless, especially this late in the semester."

3uumsv,1,2015-11-30,Lessons learned,fzamanik,ubitkm505,https://www.reddit.com/r/ubitkm505/comments/3uumsv/lessons_learned/,"This course has increased my knowledge and skills in few programs that would useful in my future career. One of them is Odoo which is a platform used by companies ranging from different sizes for purposes such as project management, billing, accounting and warehouse management. The reason why I thought that it was interesting was because, in the future no matter what i do, whether i open my open my own business that could be a restaurant, retail store, coffee shop and etc. I will need this program in order to keep track of the sales, which will provide me a better understanding of consumer buying habits. This course also gave me a better understanding of what is knowledge management, what does it represent, what does it consist of and etc. 

To improve i would focus more on what programs do majority of the employers require based on the occupation, such as Business Analyst, Data Analyst. In other words i would do more assignments like the one that we did on week 7. For example, there is an internship position as Data Analyst opened at Cablevision  and one of the skills required is SAS, R, so then we could learn more about these sort of programs which will help us be more ready. 

Overall, i learned a lot from this class more specifically on different platforms such as Hadoop, SQL, Excel, Salesforce, CRM, which i will be able to use in the real challenging world.  "
3uuntq,2,2015-11-30,Im destroying my relationship and my life,shahi1087,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uuntq/im_destroying_my_relationship_and_my_life/,"Hi
I have been reading through the forum and see the amazing advice. Hope to get the same


**Background**

I'm a 28M who just graduated from university majoring in Petroleum Engineering . I had done another degree in Computer Science but hated it so i went back to school to take petroleum. 
I loved every moment of my uni and was hoping to land a job. Luckily i was offered an internship in 2014 and worked for three months.After the internship i got back to uni and was hoping the company would re-hire me back next year when i finish. 

**Depression &amp; Sick**

After going back to uni I started getting really sick. I would get headaches all the time and wouldn't be able to sleep. Multiple visits to doctor yielded no help. I missed many classes and i started lagging on my work at uni. At the same time the company i called scheduled an interview with me for a permanent position next year. 
The oil price crashed and the interview was cancelled a day before it was scheduled to take place. This rejection made me go into depression. It was too hard for me take in the news as i was pretty sure to land the job. I got more upset and my health deteriorated even more. Since my family lived in another country i didnt have many ppl whom i could have relied on for help. Ultimately i made it through and finished my university in 2015.

**Marriage**

Fast forward to April , Im marrying the girl of my dreams. She is everything that I wanted in woman. She is extrovert when im an introvert. I feel this works well as she keeps our life interesting. When I am with her I can be myself and do what I feel like. She is the best thing to happen to my life for some time. 
I stay with her for a couple of months before I have to move to start work. I started working with my father in law in the business he owns and its been around 3 weeks. This is where I am getting back into depression. I don’t like the job. But I don’t have a choice since I need to provide for myself and her. Ideally I would like to work in the oil industry and would do anything to work in the field that I have worked my ass off for 5 years.  This job requires me to do data entry or accounts and I am not very interested in them. I am very angry at myself that I have not landed a job which I want coupled with the fact that my wife is in another country finishing her medicine degree has made me go into depression. I fight with her for super silly reasons and hurt her a lot. I know I’m doing it but once I realise I stop and we become alright. Lately it’s been every day that I have been getting on her nerves through msging platforms and we end up fighting a lot. This has reached a point where I feel that this isn’t working for us and we need to do something about it. If I got back and stay with her I wouldn’t have a job and we would end up struggling in our daily needs.  


**Problems**

My main issue is the fact that I don’t like the current job I’m at and its very hard for me to do something that I have not specialised in. I feel I wasted all those years studying for nothing and I have to be content with a job that I don’t like. I am also destroying my relationship with my wife whom I thoroughly love and care for but due my frustrations inside me I am not able to have a proper relationship with her. We keep fighting and she ends up crying cuz of me in the end. I want to change but the anger and frustrations inside isn’t letting me to.
tl;dr
Came out of uni but don’t have job. Currently working at a job which I find very dissatisfying causing a lot of emotional distress. This inturn is making me frustrated in my relationship and killing it.

3uv936,2,2015-11-30,Hey guys! I really need your help!,jesperbj,rFactor,https://www.reddit.com/r/rFactor/comments/3uv936/hey_guys_i_really_need_your_help/,"**TLDR;** **What are some great tools/tutorials for making tracks and how do I export my track from 3Ds max/similar program to r factor 1?**


Hi. A friend and I, have been asked to help a big game company with improving tracks for their car simulator. They are using the original r factor game and it's extremely hard to find any kind of info on how to make tracks for that game. Some of the programs and plugins also seem like they have been taken down or don't support newer versions of 3Ds max and all that.

Is anyone willing to show a few useful tools and tell me a little about how to export a track to r factor 1? I am a professional 3D artist and texture artist, but I have no idea how to get my work into the game.

If this ends up working out for us, we might score an internship at this company, so anything is appriciated!

My first thoughts went to Blizzard, because I really enjoy playing their games, so I went to their website, but all I found was a broken samples page and actual job offers (so no intenship ones).


Could someone give me a hand, or give me an idea about who I should contact?

3uvj76,22,2015-11-30,So an Army Ranger walks into a bar....pt 2,ConnerM360,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/3uvj76/so_an_army_ranger_walks_into_a_barpt_2/,"I’ll have to fill in some dialogue as I was blasted by this point. I remember the overall arc but not exactly how we got there. He needed me to want him so bad but he couldn’t bring himself to ask for it. I made a point, a game’s a game, to not give him an inch (not yet at least). I intentionally talked about how hot this other dude at the bar was and he was visually frustrated (while I acted oblivious). I intentionally brought up his straightness to put a barrier between our tensions. I told him how fucking horny I was and I started to use Grindr and show it to him. 

 It was so douchey of me. I had this perfectly fit dude ready for some dick and I was playing him for the fool. I was drunk. We had this competitive nature happening throughout the night and I wanted him to beg for it. As they say ‘all is fair in love…’ Well I would get more than I asked for as he struggled with being the alpha male who didn’t know how to submit to anything…..yet.

 At some point it came up that he hadn’t measured his dick size. I called bullshit and told him, quite frankly that I loved having a big dick. That I had never been with a dude who was thicker than me. (I have since been bested twice MUCH to my own delight) I am 7x6. He can’t stand it anymore and says he’s got to see it NOW.

 We had the same amount of patrons and so he stalks off to the bathroom and I follow ten seconds behind. I am terrified. This is in public and I am nervous as hell. I open the door and he is standing by the urinals motioning to the stalls, we weren’t alone. I ham haw for a seconds at the sinks, walk over to the urinal and we both kill time till the dude finishes up and leaves.

 Ernie moves me so I face him and he bitterly tells me to prove it. I pull it out and have the most perfect fat semi for the situation. It was about as fat as it gets, but still soft and floppy (and about 5 inches long). He huffs and puffs and grabs a hold and squeezes. He is impressed, he is challenged, he is turned on. Well, it was his turn and he pulls his out and my guess was 7.5 maybe 8? So he technically could rest easy knowing he won. But he still let me win. He ignored his own and kept gawking at mine. It was so hot, he was talking dirty in an envious way and it was so..fucking..hot. I don’t remember what he said that got me going 0 to 100 but it was along the lines of him hefting my semi while saying “now he knows why I am so cocky.”

So we exit after a few minutes to no stares. No acknowledgement. Nobody noticed (as far as I could tell) and I was relieved. We go out for a smoke and he’s being much more forward, all pretenses dropped. We make out here and there. I squeeze on his perfect fucking chest and tell him he’s the man. He squeezes my ass saying, exasperated, that he could crush me and he is confused at why he was letting me “get away” with talking my shit. So I squeezed his nipple harder the next time.

 We’re getting pretty graphic but thankfully it’s right as the bar is closing so we pay our tabs, everyone leaves and we hang out in the smoking area for a while longer as we talked game at one another. He loved my ass. I loved his chest. He loved my dick and well, I loved his dick. We head towards his vehicle.

 This is the part where the story gets stupid. More specifically where I get stupid. He had parked behind the bar in a sort of alley way. It was dangerous and I was oblivious. A stranger who knew he was stronger than me. Dim lighting. No people. Well past 2 am. Drunk. Thankfully Ernie was actually a genuine guy (though a bit too aggressive) and I was able to learn a hard lesson the easy way.

 He wanted to wrestle some more even though we were standing on pavement. He threw me down and I scraped up my hands. He got down and kissed me hard, pinned me on my back and wouldn’t get off. He was such a tool. I had to essentially break character and tell him that I didn’t know if I had to piss or puke but he was sitting on my stomach and we were about to find out.

 He finally gets up. I piss. We start to kiss and I choked him a bit. Bit his shoulder. He really liked that but wanted to get rough again. He threw me down again and I scraped and bruised my elbows. He choked me, waaay to hard. I likened it to a big dog that just wanted to play but didn’t know his own strength. Also comparable to Lennie from John Steinbeck’s, Of Mice and Men. (This is also where I had a brief concern about safety) He basically didn’t understand how to straddle the line between pleasure and pain. I suggested we get naked.

 We took the party into his van and got our dicks out. I straddled him on the driver’s seat as my ass hit the horn a few too many times. I was hard as a rock and he was having a bit of trouble (I’ve definitely been there, and could never put a guy down for that….even an aggressive fuck like him) I rubbed the head of my dick all over his package. I slapped his balls with it. He got a semi and we jacked each other’s dicks together as he brought up how hard I was. He was cute when he was being envious. You could just tell he was a little brat…

We kept making out and fondling each other’s bodies. It was great. He said he wanted to suck me off. So we maneuvered around and I got to a sort of standing/crouching position as he leaned a chair back to a laying position and I ordered him to take it all.

 It should be noted that it had become clear I was not the first gay hookup he had. He was inexperienced no doubt, but he admitted to having fooled around before.

 He took me into his mouth and it was then that I face fucked a guy for the first time. Now, I have ‘face fucked’ a guy before. But never like this. I dominated him. It was vengeful and out of spite. I called him a little bitch when he choked. I slapped his cheeks and flicked him on his temple. I was an ass and he absolutely loved it. I felt dirty and I loved it. The head of my dick was getting sore from just hitting the back of his throat…he couldn’t accommodate me, not with his experience, not with our positioning, but I thrusted with reckless abandon and felt fucking powerful. 

 I pulled out and my dick was coated with his spit….that thick kind from the back of the throat that rivals most lubes on the market. His eyes were watered, he was a mess and I kissed him passionately. He told me how hot that was and how hot I was as I bit and sucked on his big pecs. I threw myself onto my own seat and jacked myself till could cum and I got back over him and shot on his dick, stomach and chest. He loved it. He was so dirty.

 I changed positions and took him into my mouth and started to suck him off. He wanted fingers up his ass. I obliged. I bit his cock in the middle with enough pressure for him to moan. Minutes go by, he takes over and jacks on himself and proceeds to just put his shirt back on over my huge load and his. He would drive us home with my cum, under his shirt, coating his stomach.

 We sit back panting for a bit. He offers me a ride home and I accept. I woke up the next morning and my whole body hurt, I had bloodied elbows, a sore neck, bruises on my arms and VERY concerned friends. I was admonished for being so reckless and as I said earlier I was glad that I was able to learn such a dangerous lesson the easy way. Through an Army Ranger with big muscles, an attitude and a long dick. I also, called off from my internship because I could barely move to put on my suit.

 THE END.


 P.S: We didn’t exchange numbers. I didn’t want to. I don’t live near that bar anymore but have been back a few times always looking for that big bull of a man. If only to have a debrief on how to choke a dude sexually while allowing him to turn his neck the next day without pain. "
3uvl4d,2,2015-11-30,"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 3.5 years, thinking about breaking up today.",Moltensunshine,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uvl4d/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_35_years/,"My post will be more anticlimactic than most. I've read many posts here and the answers seem so obvious when you're an emotionally detached third party. But now that I'm experiencing my own mild set of problems, the right thing to do seems hard to figure out, let alone me having the courage to follow through with whichever decision I end up making. 

This is my only real relationship I've had. She's had several prior to ours, this became an object of contention several years in as it sort of dawned on my virginal mind the fact that she had been this intimate with others. I went into a deep depression that coincided with my Mom's broken leg, working in a factory in a small town in Wisconsin where she was corporate manager. I worked on the assembly line for 10 hours a day often 8 days in a row. It was a small town of 600 people, didn't know anybody, my mom was going through bad time as well. It was sad because neither of us were in a place to help one another, where we had been able to in the past. Spent those 3 months alone, in the heat obsessing about her past for upwards of 10 hours a day at an assembly line, not willfully I might add. It felt very much like an affliction. There is a pseudo-psychological word for it called ""Retroactive Jealousy."" It's not acknowledged in the professional realm I don't believe but the online help forums that exist demonstrate it's legitimacy in my opinion. I was a prideful person and didn't want to talk to anyone about it. 

Finally told my girlfriend, never told my mom. Girlfriend was hurt by it, although I tried not to incriminate her, I was indirectly questioning her moral fiber and all that. I finally relented and went to see a social worker, I hospitalized myself briefly and they sent me to a therapist once if I recall correctly. This hurt my pride, it was a last resort. Its a humiliating affliction to have. Nothing helped, everyone I confided in was kind and sympathized but it did little to stem the hell of spending every waking moment unwillingly re-imagining every conceivable intimate act she shared with another man. Nothing helped though. Not God, not family, not friends, not her, not online help forums, not psychologists. Honestly, after 8 months of continuous suicidal thoughts I think the devil just gave up. 

Eventually, they gave me Prozac. I took them for about 3 weeks before just stopping. They made me numb I guess, but that didn't solve anything. Me and my ladyfriend broke up for 3 weeks somewhere around then. I grew a pretty awesome beard. She said some pretty awful things while we were apart. I refrained, I was too sad to be angry mostly. Her remarks hit me where I hurt most, she was in a real bad way though. Close to hysterics. Eventually, after seeing if I could potentially date someone else (this girl was interested I think but she wasn't right for me and made me feel guilty as hell) I got back together with my girlfriend, because I believed I had ended it for the wrong reasons. All of our friends were the same, life was good while we were together, I was distracted from my previous concerns. We never really came to terms with my dilemmas, but we just moved on. 

Things just kind of slid back to normal. Well, we graduated college a couple months ago. Now we're doing temporary long distance. My feelings seem to have dried up, but the thought of breaking up with her is terrifying. She would be devastated, I don't think she would see it coming. I'm also deathly afraid she will say those same cruel things and it will trigger a relapse into my old psychological issues, although... I think I'm past those. I'm coming off of one month of pneumonia, my internship is ending in a couple weeks and I'll be unemployed back home with the parents, back in my girlfriends proximate vicinity. I feel so empty, drained, tired, not depressive, just bone-tired to my soul. The thought of breaking up terrifies me because it might turn my baleful monotony into a sad horror show again. I'm young, in the best shape of my life though. I don't have confidence issues, but definitely have mental issues hahaha... 



   
**tl;dr**: Long story-short. Never had a relationship. Now I'm contemplating breaking up a 3.5 year one and I'm terrified of the consequences to both her and me."

3uvv5f,3,2015-11-30,I quit years ago but now I am having urges again. It's hard to not want to pick it back up.,[deleted],StopSelfHarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/3uvv5f/i_quit_years_ago_but_now_i_am_having_urges_again/,"I keep having urges to cut even though I haven't cut in the past 3 years. 

I started cutting when I was 12 or 13 and did my best to hide it. I wasn't looking for attention, I just need some way to vent or ""feel"" something if you will. And it worked great for the first couple of months. But once friends started noticing I would stop or do a better job at hiding it. I was always worried that they would tell my parents.

When I got to highschool I limited how much I cut, but I would still do it when I was feeling down, depression or anxiety sank in, or I had an unreasonable fear that I couldn't overcome such as worrying about failing a class or doing bad on a project. I know it seems small, but at the moment that those things take place, it seems like the most important thing in the world. 

I met my now fiancée in high school and I eventually told her that I had self-harmed before, but not that I was still actively doing it. We had a rough patch and it became more noticeable so I had to come clean with her, and a few other friends, that I had been cutting and that I never really quit, just took breaks at times.

When I graduated in 2010, I felt that all was going to be fine as I had not self-harmed in a few months prior to graduation. However, college came with more stress than high school and I took up cutting again. After the first year I more or less failed out of Penn State and returned home, on my own free will, but started at a community college and got a part time job where I worked full time hours. 

But this situation only made me feel more defeated and I started cutting more. These times in college though I was able to hide it from my girlfriend, even though we are intimate. It just go to the point where I couldn't handle myself doing it for a couple months and quitting for a couple months on and off. So when I felt myself stopping the cycle I tossed out the small knife that I had hid over the years and used to cut myself. (At least I think I tossed it out, it could be hidden and I just forgot where it is). 

I graduated from the community college in 2012 and did an internship at Disney. Since then I have been clean, which is about 3 years, and that's great. However, I started at a normal university last fall where I am working on a Journalism/PR Degree. And that should be great, and my grades are good. But during my first two semester I saw a girl who was cutting, and I felt bad for her and didn't know what to say. I never really talked to anyone about my issues and most people only told me to stop, and I knew that never worked. 

As time went on though, I stopped thinking about talking to her about it and felt more like doing it myself. Now, as this semester comes to an end and I prepare for my last semester at college I am filled with stress. I have projects due now, an internship in the spring, and more worries about life after college. Even though I am 24, I struggle with wondering how I am going to make it through this.

I know that I quit cold turkey and that could be part of the reason that the girl triggered it in me. I shake at times thinking about it. And I don't want to pick it up because I don't know how I would explain it to my fiancée. As far as she knows I have been clean since high school.

I don't know what I am looking for. And I don't know how much of the above makes sense. I just needed to get this out and tell people.

3uwzlb,2,2015-11-30,"Me [18F] with myself [18F], depressed in college and no idea how to start getting help",brighteryesterday,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uwzlb/me_18f_with_myself_18f_depressed_in_college_and/,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub but I've decided I need help and I don't know where else to go :(  I just wanted to type everything out so I apologize for the length.

I'm an Asian female majoring in a STEM major at a primarily white college.  I have acquaintances/friends but no close friends even though the first semester is almost over.  Back at home and in high school, I had a solid group of friends that would do everything together, and although I'm still close with them, I feel pressure to develop the same dynamic in college.  It's really getting me down that I haven't been able to do so yet but others have know everybody and have large, seemingly close groups.  People are already thinking about housing for next year and I don't even have friends.  I'm in a LDR and my boyfriend signed his housing agreement for next year only two month into school! Two months!  When I went home for thanksgiving break and saw all my friends, they all seemed so happy and well adjusted and I'm not and it made me jealous.

I tried joining social clubs on campus but all they do is drink and I don't tend to stay friends with people who party three times a week :/  I spend a lot of time in the common room of my dorm but most people already have groups of friends and nobody knows who I am so I sit alone most of the time.  Whenever I meet new people in classes or clubs it seems they're not interested in making friends outside of their current group.  I usually eat dinner with a single person, not a group of friends.

I know my problem is that I'm focused on having a close group, but I don't know how to function without that kind of support system.  Lately I've been thinking that maybe it's me, that I'm a boring person?  Maybe I judge people too quickly too often?  I'm usually friends with quieter, more studious people of color but I never find those people because they don't socialize. Or that's another generalization?  I think I peaked in high school :( I see other people having a blast in college and they're always with someone and they go on spontaneous trips and it's been getting to me so much that I think I'm becoming depressed.  I don't want to kill myself, but I'd rather be dead than alive.  I have trouble sleeping at night and getting out of bed in the morning.  I'm never hungry anymore but I force myself to eat because it's the only assured social interaction I have for the day.  I go to the gym almost everyday but I feel guilty for ""wasting time"" that I could've used to try to make more friends.  I have people I can text and ask if they want to grab food, but I don't feel super close to anyone yet.  People say to just be yourself, but I'm afraid I'm not good enough.  I try to be positive and outgoing but I just feel insecure and I always think people judge me for every little thing I say.  I want to go to counseling but I don't have the money for it with student loans and I'm not sure how I would be able to continue therapy when I got home for breaks 


I gave myself a timeline of two years, that if I'm not happy or at least better in two years I will drop out or change colleges or do something drastic.  But I can't see myself finishing college, because I constantly worry about the curriculum being too fast for me, or stressing about those long lab reports and difficult upper division classes.  I'm not as passionate about my major as some people are.  And then what happens after college?!  The intensity of these feelings come and go, but for the last 6 weeks, either feel lost and hopeless and scared and depressed or i just feel numb :(  I feel so guilty because I have a wonderful boyfriend and wonderful friends at home and wonderful parents and I'm at a good college with a really really good internship lined up for the summer but I'm still not happy and then I just feel worse .  

   
**tl;dr**: Feeling really crappy in college, how to get through it?"

[Jameson](http://i.imgur.com/OF9Nrbf.jpg) is a pretty [cool](http://i.imgur.com/PpKFPDV.jpg) guy. He loves reading, trucks and trains. [This](http://i.imgur.com/nQ3SKba.jpg) is a picture I posted of him coloring on his new coloring book. We drew stuff together. It was fun. 

Christmas is hard for us this year. I was really hoping to get an internship but it fell through at the last minute which devasted my self esteem. I'm in school and I just want a job, hopefully one that's paid, but if not I would like some experiences. I'm just chugging along trying to survive and hoping that someday it will be worth it. 

I've been painting a lot recently to chill myself out. It's helped. I love painting. I never have enough canvas. I mostly only paint trees. Yes, enter bob ross joke here. yes i love him. No i can't paint like him. I paint unrealistic realistic stuff. Magical, whimsical. Back on track. 

Today is Monday and I cannot go to school today because last week his daycare fed him something with gluten in it which flared up. He spent last week vomiting. He has Celiacs Disease and its so severe. It sucks. I wish I could send him abck to that daycare. Everyone tells me not to. I have to find a new place because I'm at the end of my semester here. He loves that place. I love that place. But the director is the one who fed him. I didn't even receive a follow up ""Hey... sorry about that."" I got nothing. This isn't even the first time its happened.
Ideally I'd like to find a daycare that teaches him spanish while being careful not to feed him gluten. I am willing to donate food, donate books, donate clothes ect. just as long as he doesn't eat gluten. It's kind of a big deal. I need a daycare that feels the same way.

Jameson turned 3 in August we need some help with diapers. I am potty training this kid. Oh man. I love my son but this has been so damn hard. Its poop... guys... its poop. Theres no sugar coating it. lol. Anyway, we could use some pullups. He's been doing decent enough. They say boys are the hardest to train and they train later but I'm ready. I'm doing this. Pulls up!! 

Here in Hastings Nebraska the winters sure are cold so he could use some pj's too. We do a lot of fun activites together that I find on the internet and I'm always getting him those activity magazines that have age groups. Ya know, they're at walmart. We do them together. I really want him to be reading by the time he enter school. He's doing very very well. If anyone knows any apps for our nook book or my android phone that would be super handy too! I'm looking for reading apps specifically but any good recommendations are welcome. 

We just watched this movie called inside out. It's pretty fun. We love movies like that. Any other information don't hesitate to ask! Thank you so much to the community, to the santas and to the people that come together to make this place bright with cheer. Thank you. Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays!

PS. I donate things that Jameson has that are gently used to kids in need. We have social services come to our house once a week. It's voluntary and a wonderful program. I donate things that I can to Head Start which is Jamesons school that this program works out of, (Completely separate from his daycare). Feel free to google this information if you want to know more about Head Start and some of the kids that they work with. Its mostly kids that are in need of special services. Its funded by the state. Sometimes kids need a jacket or some socks. We had an extra fall jacket and an extra halloween costume so we donate small things like that to other kids in need or whatever. Just a heads up if you have any extra items of clothes do not wait! look for your local social services place and donate to them. Also, if you plan on donating anything to homeless shelters the things they need most are coffee and deoderant. Tooth paste, tooth brushes. Those types of things. We had to stay in a shelter once and let me tell you coffee and deoderant were a luxury!! I dont have much but I try to be frugal and help where I can. Anywho, Happy Holidays! Thank you so much!

3ux1kc,61,2015-11-30,Applied for my dream job(s)!,cookofthesea,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/3ux1kc/applied_for_my_dream_jobs/,"So, I have no one to tell. I mean, I do, but I feel like if I tell someone I KNOW, I'll jinx myself.

I have a degree in media production and I had always dreamed of working for some kind of media company (obviously). But the competition was hard. Now, it's not uncommon to see people who picked up video production as a hobby who actually picked up skills better or just more skills in general than people who went to school for it. Connections play a big role too, and I thought I had connections but they ended up not being anyone who could help me.

After an internship ended that was supposed to lead into a full time job, the company ended up going under. I did freelancing, and had prospects of a regular freelance job, paying $700/weekend for three months, including them paying for my food and everything and I figured, if I did good work for those three months, more opportunities would come my way. But then the project folded.

I took up an internship that ended up being a scam.

I got frustrated. I got laid off from the crap retail job that I had. I collected unemployment and tried to get ANY job at ANY media outlet...just to get my foot in the door. Nothing. Four years of unemployment went by.

Had an interview to work for an awesome, well-known TV show. Made the cut. When they were figuring out when my first day should be, they ended up realizing that there wouldn't be enough work for me and they got ahead of themselves with hiring. Heartbroken. I was so upset-it was one of my favorite shows and I had the chance to work on set for it. It took me awhile to get over that.

I finally took up substitute teaching just because I needed the cash. It sucked, but I ended up landing a job not as a teacher but in a school's library, since I had my foot in the door, it was easy to get the job. I like the job, and the benefits are amazing, but the job itself, just doesn't pay very well. Also, lately, I just feel like the ""honeymoon"" period of my job has ended. There's no room for growth. I'm going to be stuck here. My plan was, take this job, and keep it until something better comes up. But truthfully, I guess I stopped looking for better jobs once I got this job. But lately, I just feel like I've been hitting so many lows. I feel like the person I work directly under, sees me as a pion, not as her partner, which I always thought was the case (in essence, I am her pion, but my job duties changed over the last few months, so I am, but I have other duties to take care of too). I guess I didn't think about looking because I love the people at this school. But when I think about what else I could be doing with my life, I get sad. I see what other people from my high school graduating class are up to. Most of them are doing great things.

I know, don't compare yourself to others. But, it gave me a kick to look.

Today, I looked for jobs and applied for a very well known company...and there were TWO positions I am qualified for and interested in, so I applied to both. Just like that. I've applied for jobs with this company in the past, but never even got an interview, but those were always stretches when I applied anyway. But there were two jobs that I fit the bill for perfectly.

I know that since it's a well known, prestigious company that so many people are going to apply. And so many people across the country would probably apply for it. But I couldn't not apply. I know it's a long shot. I don't expect to get called in for an interview. But if I didn't apply, I would never know.

If I get an interview and get the job, it'll be the topping on the cake. The thing is, it reminded me that there are better jobs out there for me; I just need to look and keep applying and eventually, something will give. If I have to apply to this company a million times the next several years, I will.

I know it was nothing more than submitting a resume and cover letter and clicking ""send,"" but it's made me happy all day. :) "
3ux43r,0,2015-11-30,Me [21f] and my boyfriend [25f] are having issues now that he is moving across the country. Not sure what to do anymore...,sadpanda102,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ux43r/me_21f_and_my_boyfriend_25f_are_having_issues_now/,"**whoops, title says he's 25f, definitely meant 25M**

So quick backstory: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 7 months now, and we are both in an internship program together in which we live in the same apartment building, two floors away from each other. The program has been for 4 months, but we met online (through the program's fb page) and he flew out to meet me. From that day, we've had an incredible, passionate, and fun relationship... until he told me he is moving back home to New York two days before thanksgiving. 

I always knew it was a possibility, but we had discussed/planned to move in together in Los Angeles after the program (this is where I'm from and close to where our program is located now). Shit, we even talk about getting married and what we will name our kids, and this has all been in the span of our 7 month relationship. Things changed though since neither of us have secured full time jobs for after the internship, so financially he can't stay here. 

He is moving back to NYC to live rent/bills free with his parents (they own a big house that has an apartment connected to it, it's also where he lived before the program started) and he said we'd have to figure out what we are going to do. I'm heartbroken and devastated, but I told him I would pack up my life and move out there with him because I can't stand the idea of being separated. To my surprise... he doesn't want me to. He tells me he is worried about what will happen if I don't find a job, how I'm going to survive out there, the fact that I won't have any friends except for his mother (who I love dearly) and family, and that he's truly worried about me not having any escape if I'm out there and don't like it. These are all valid things, and he keeps saying if I had a job planned out for over there he wouldn't feel like me moving out there was a bad idea, but who knows. In his ideal world I would stay here, find a job, save up and then move out there.... except in my idea I don't see why I should go through the job application process twice. Also, he didn't really give me a timeline for when I would be okay to move out there...and being long distance for me would only work if I had a timeline.

Anyways, when that happened I was really upset, I felt like I was being rejected and he wasn't really saying any of it in a really sympathetic way..... So after a lot of crying and getting upset at him telling me he felt like he was getting an ultimatum, I left his apt saying ""Congratulations, you've made me not want to move to New York"" 

The next few days were awkward over text as we kept talking about everything and we kept getting upset, but I went to work and had some time to think. I told myself if I really only had 5 weeks, I should make the most of it and spend my time with him, not be upset. We talked that night and I felt reassurance that it would be 3 months or so of him living in NY and me in LA. I felt like it was certainly a sacrifice I was willing to make if it meant we would be together in the end. We had a great thanksgiving with our friends and things seemed well.

Until last night.......

I've probably applied to 25 jobs in NYC in 3 days, and I've already started getting the rejections. I was sad, told him this and asked him to come down to my room just to hang out. His response? ""I'm playing Madden with J [His roommate]"" That of course wasn't the answer I was hoping for because again, I was sad, home alone, and just wanted his company. He said ""Is that okay?"" and I responded ""I just wanted to spend time with you"" then I got no response since 7 pm. In our relationship I've made it a point that saying good night, in person, is important to me because he is only 2 floors above and there is no reason not to... well last night I got tired of waiting for him and sent him a text saying so. Then I reiterated that I really just wanted to see him that night because I've been sad.

Now this morning (half way there, I promise)

He said he went to lay down at 8:30 and fell asleep and that he was sorry if that upset me. I woke up at 6:30am from the text and we went on from there. He started getting defensive saying I should respect that he was spending time with Justin, no matter how mundane the activity was, and also kept giving me responses as if the reason I was upset was because he went to sleep at 8:30.

I told him the reason I was upset was because I'm trying to spend the most time with him that I can since he is leaving to New York and doesn't even want me to go with him.... The response I got was basically ""Well I can't spend all of my free time with you, I'd like to do other things as well"" and again, I understand I'm being super needy... it's just with him leaving I'm not coping very well and I feel unwanted, hurt, and depressed. 

The way things ended were... with him saying I think right now we should break up. I was stupid and out of anger brought it up, and he actually said he thought it was best. I said that I didn't know how I would make it through the next 4 weeks, and I also didn't know how I would deal with it once he was gone. After that, he is said he wouldn't make me go through and that's when he said he thought it was best. 

I was upset and told him if that was the case I didn't want to see him for the remainder of the program, and I've pretty much been in the angry stage of grief since this morning. I cried in the car on the way to work, but since I've been here I've been browsing reddit and distracting myself. 

Anyways, here's my long story. I really don't feel like we've broken up, but I guess the words were put out there and now I'm here and more heartbroken than when I was told he was going back. 

I'm not sure if I should try talking to him when I get home....... What I really want to do is get a box and put all his stuff in it and leave it by his door.... but again, I'm in my angry stage. 

Thanks for reading and for your advice.





**TLDR; Boyfriend is moving 2500 miles back to New York, doesn't want me to go with him, and I don't know how to cope with any of it.**"
3ux6ik,1,2015-11-30,"I really need help. My [25] girlfriend [20] is trying to transfer to a university she really wants to go to and her parents [M/F, 50s] will not let her, citing me as the reason, and refuse to listen to anything she says, yelling over her and not listening to reason.",HerParentsAreSoMean,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3ux6ik/i_really_need_help_my_25_girlfriend_20_is_trying/,"I've come to be a bit desperate, reddit, I don't really know what to do. My girlfriend, let's call her D, lives with her parents. We are in a long distance relationship. I actually just got back from a visit to her recently. 

Her parents have always been incredibly controlling. They have also had a history of being very verbally abusive towards her, calling her names and such as well. She used to go to school at a university out of her state and after two years had developed bad social anxiety and depression. She was alone and could not find friends no matter how hard she tried. Eventually, she made the choice to leave and not come back. She has spent the past semester living at home and going to community college while looking for another school to transfer to.

Now, the program she is pursuing and the degree is somewhat niche, only a select handful of schools in the country offer it. One of my local schools happens to be one of those schools and so she did wind up applying there. It's also worth noting that she has somewhat of a support system here in place already of about 20 people who consider her their friend or a part of the family already. 


When it came down to it, she had selected three schools. She did research on each, read many reviews, talked to students from those schools, and ultimately decided to drop one of the three and narrowed it down to two. When she presented this to her parents over the weekend, they flipped. They lost their shit, screaming at her all weekend, they did not like the two schools she has it narrowed down to - they hate her choices and demand she either picks the one that isn't near me or stays home another semester and chooses other schools. Whenever she tried to show them statistics, facts, reviews, etc, they ignored her and yelled over her, telling her that she is wrong and the only reason she is considering the one near me is because of me. They eventually went on to say they do not like me and I am not good for her which felt like a kick in the balls to me as I thought I had been connecting and getting along great with her parents, but I guess not. Her parents spent all of last night shouting her down, telling her she's an idiot, telling her she's lying to them and manipulating them just so she can be near me. 

The truth is that while being near me and her friends she has here would be a benefit, the school near me is a legit great school and fits all of her needs. They even flipped out at her over her mentioning a great summer internship program. ""Oh so you just want to spend the summer with him too?"" - and distance isnt the issue as both of her sisters went to schools on the opposite side of the country. Her mom told her this morning that she thinks she will move here, quit school, and just work in some coffee shop and live with me. They also told her she doesn't have any friends here and that she shouldn't be friends with ""those people"" anyway, despite the fact that they do not know our friends at all.

I am furious, reddit. They have cornered her into a situation where she has to choose the school they want, not the one she wants. They bully her and yell at her, she can't get out of the house, and they are holding her tuition hostage - her grandmother pays for it, and they said they will force her grandma to not pay her tuition if she tried to go to School U (the one she wants) at all. On top of this, I don't know if she could get FAFSA, because her parents are fairly wealthy.

The weird part is when her mom picked me up from the airport she excitedly told me D was accepted at the school near me. I don't know where this is all coming from, why they are doing this to her. Also one of her sisters is at school on the other side of the country and was considering coming home because she hated it, but once there was a boy involved ""who may or may not have a crush on her"" she started to reconsider - and her mom said to her ""It's not stupid to stay at a school for a boy, but it's stupid to go to school for one"", again, despite me not being the main priority - her education is.


What can she do? What can I do? I don't know what to do. Her parents have effectively trapped her into a situation where they are making her choose the other school (School C) or stay home, and she wants to go to this particular school near me (School U), citing that it's just the better all around school. Please help, reddit. I don't know where to turn or what to do and she is stuck in her room helpless and lost.

TLDR - Parents are refusing to listen to the life choice their daughter wants to make and refuse to let her be an adult."
