Not filthy rich but the kind of place where people get their kids brand new cars for birthdays/graduations, and they don't usually have to worry about money. I'm a high school senior who may not be able to afford to graduate.

Due to school policy, I can't walk the stage until I've paid off everything I owe to my school. Which is about $400 with various costs. The same graduation I am supposed to speak at...I still find that wryly amusing.

In total, my mom brings in about $20,000 a year. Including what my dad pays in child support, which is about all the financial contribution he does. I knew we were struggling, but I never realized just how little money we have to spread around. Before I got access to her tax returns, I would get mad at her for telling me to put our income on applications because I thought she just wanted me to look more needy so I could take advantage of the system. I didn't realize we actually were living off that kind of money. She's got a steady teaching job, but of course, it will be a long, long time before we can live comfortably. Her salary  supports my two sisters and I, as well as my aunt. 

Obviously, finances have always been such a problem in our household. I'm constantly calling different companies whom we owe bills to, asking for extensions so I can have some internet to finish an assignment or whatever. My mom knows what minimum to pay where so nothing gets shut off, or which expense we can cut out this month to carry over somewhere else...

She is trying so hard to make things work for me though. She bought me a $200 prom dress, which I couldn't believe, since it was so far beyond my budget...but she insisted, and told me I deserved it after working so hard and not getting to have any fun all these years. And I thought it was crazy expensive until I realized everyone else at my school had budgets of ~$500 or so for dresses...She's trying to spoil me right now, but I know she's paying for everything with credit cards because the money just isn't there and I can't help but feel so guilty.

I was lucky to be chosen for a full-time paid internship this summer, and I thought this was finally it, and that it was going to be enough. I'm realizing now that I'll probably have to pick up a second job in the evenings.
Needing to work = needing to learn to drive = $350 driver's ed so i can get my license (which we've put off until I am now 17 because I could never afford it...still can't, but it's a matter of necessity now) = needing to buy another car to get me to work ~30 minutes away since the only one we have is my mom's ancient one. But it's all about money!!

I'd been doing some tutoring on the side for some money, but for the next month, I have absolutely no spare time between 8:30 am - 7:00 pm, cutting into all the time I would be spending doing that. I can't work anywhere else until I can drive (I don't live in a walkable place and I can't depend on others for rides, since they have their own lives too), but I'm not even sure I will even be able to finish paying off my driver's ed.

Through scholarships and amazing financial aid, my parents will not have to pay a penny for my $60,000/year east coast private college. Not for books, room and board, nothing. No loans either.
Too bad applying for more scholarships is not helping my current living situation though, since most of them award money directly to the college, not the students, therefore, only reducing my financial aid package from my school, not putting any money in my pocket to fix my situation.

Even after I've gotten myself out of the red, the cost of replacing my four year old laptop, buying clothes to handle the East coast weather after living in the South, even pocket money for going out to dinner or a movie...it's adding up. Yes, I may not have to pay anything to go to college, but that also means my family can't afford to help me move in and I can't fly the 2,000 miles home any time except for summer and winter breaks.

This is incredibly long, but I just wanted to let it all out. I mean, every time I think we're finally making progress, it feels like more obstacles get in our way. I've long given up on waiting for God or anyone else to help me. I do what I can to help my family, but it's as if the world has other plans. Nobody in my life knows how bad it is, and I try to forget about it, but some days everything just feels so futile and I feel like resorting to the lowest measures to make a quick buck so my mom can stop wondering how we're going to make it...This life thing isn't very easy to handle.

TL;DR: Can't catch a break. Money's great...Too bad there's not enough of it. Feeling generally hopeless and useless right now."

I already have a bit of experience under my belt at a small company but I'm looking to move on to an enterprise setting. My main question is this: Is it better to aim for a position that would be easier to get in some company (tech support to customers) and try to move up to a low-level administrator later or should I apply straight-away to an administrative position?

Also, I already have my CCENT (ICND1) and I'm planning on getting my CCNA soon. Would it be better just to focus on that for the time being? Exactly how important are certifications in the field compared to experience and college GPA and/or major?"

Is that true? Could someone that is attending OSU confirm this and explain what the process is like.

What variety of internships (what fields of study do the internships pertain to)?

What company is doing the internships?

How hard is it to get accepted?

What do the internships pay if at all?

What is an average week for someone involved in an OSU internship?

What is the average working day for someone involved in an OSU internship?

**If these internships are a figment of my imagination, just go ahead and tell me.** If they aren't a figment of my imagination, tell me why I feel like I'm the only that's so impressed by $40k for an internship with a 40% acceptance rate.

t2won,4,2012-05-02,To Jordan,hurtgirlfriendIL,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/t2won/to_jordan/,"People like you make me sick.
I trusted you.
When my boyfriend told me he was going to San Francisco for a weekend with his dad and staying with you for a night I was nervous, but he assured me I had absolutely nothing to worry about. I emailed you, tried to get to know you. You said you would connect me with someone who could help find me an internship there in case we both moved. I even told you that you were a good friend to him. I thought we were cool.

Then what did you do? Tried to get him to cheat on me. Tried to sneak up an kiss him because you knew it was your best shot of getting one. Pathetic. Maybe nothing happened, but you made him question things with me. When he broke up with me the day he came back on Halloween it was out of left field and broke my heart. 3 weeks of misery I endured until he realized he had made a mistake and wanted me back. Then he confessed he was talking to you and potentially there were feelings. That did not last long.

We got back together and you sat there, a thousand miles away, thinking you had successfully stolen another girl's boyfriend. You texted him, tried to send him cards, meet up with him. But he didn't go for it, did he? No. 
I could understand if I was some horrible bitch. But I'm not. I'm a social worker! I dedicate myself to helping others as a living! I may have flaws but I am a GOOD person and I never did ANYTHING to deserve this! I love him with all my heart. I support him in everything he does. I take care of him. I give him all of my love and care. You couldn't share that bond with him that I do, you couldn't go through everything with him that I have. I have stayed by his side through the worst moments of his life, moments that would have sent other girls fleeing. Even so, you tried to take that all away from me, like I'm nothing. You caused the worst three weeks of my entire life (really, the worst 3 months since it didn't stop even after we got back together). And the pain lives on. I feel it every day.

You stupid whore. I tried to establish some kind of friendship with you because I wanted to be supportive of him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DID IN RETURN?!?!? What kind of person are you???
I've tried again and again to forgive you, but I can't. Every time he checks his phone, his email, I think of you. Those LATE nights you tried to call him recently? I was with him. He told you we were back together but I guess you have no respect for either one of us. You are disgusting.

I hate this, I hate where I am. I've never had trouble forgiving anyone for anything, and here I am with you. I've never even met you and I despise you. You have caused me to have feelings and thoughts that make me feel disgusted with myself. You shattered my confidence and made me feel like a worthless piece of shit.
Please. Leave us both alone. Let us move on with our lives and our relationship. I care about him more than anyone else does, more than you ever could.

Leave us in piece."

Also, any information on getting around Charleston with just a bike would also be really helpful.

I'd also be interested in anyone who wants to carpool to Blackbaud and has a sublet available (or maybe I could find a sublet nearby).  Hopefully I'll figure something out with one of the other interns, but everything is starting to get a bit close for comfort.

My heart goes out to everyone who's lasted long enough to see their loves once again! Indulge, have fun, but play safe, if ya know what I mean ;) I truly am happy for all you happy redditors as I owe you guys a lot. I read LD every day but I haven't posted anything yet, so here I go...

I wish I can share the joy some of you redditors are currently experiencing. My SO (20F) is coming home (Toronto) from her placement in Amsterdam, but it won't be happy times.

We've been at it for 3 years now, she moved away for university 2 weeks after we started dating (I came close to just letting her go without her knowing how I feel). Our distance factor started off at 500km. It was tough, but we managed. In January of this year, she took an internship in Amsterdam (6000km, 6 hour time difference) and talking to her became damn near impossible. We could only manage a Saturday/Sunday Skype call. This seemed to take a greater toll on her than me, I was much busier with school and work. I barely got a moment's peace during a typical week. Her schedule was more more regular, and often left her alone with nothing to do.

It begins to turn sour when I find that she's completely gone from Facebook and Twitter. I try emailing and calling but to no avail. When I do manage to connect with her, she says that she blocked me these sites to help cope with my absence. I wasn't a fan, but I mustered up enough understanding to accept it; she simply doesn't want any reminders of how lonely she is there.

One day, I was upset for some reason and needed to talk. She listened, but I would've got more consolation from a wall. This is very unlike her. She said she has **suspended her feelings for me** to make the LDR easier for her. Another large pill for me to swallow.  

Time goes by and she seems well, she manages to stay positive from what I can observe. I'm a wreck though, I look at her and think about how staged and superficial our conversations are. She doesn't get upset at my absence anymore but there is no more compassion in her. She used to call me, in tears, in the middle of the work day to say how much she misses me. It broke my heart but I felt we really bonded in those moments, as short as they were (supervisors don't can smell a non-business call from miles away).

We talked about having to make sacrifices but I would never stop loving her. She seems okay with me knowing she ""doesn't love me right now."" :'( 

So. In two weeks or so, I'll have the opportunity to visit her at the 500km location, she has completed her work-term. I'll be in the same room as her for the first time in 8 months but I'm not excited. I plan on having a very serious talk with her. I've decided to put everything on the line.

A humblr request:
Help me prepare for this pivotal weekend because my feelings are all over the place. Is it possible for someone to simply suspend their love and get it back later? Or is it wiser to just end things things with her while she doesn't reciprocate my feelings? 

**TL;DR my SO ""Suspends"" her feelings for me to ease LDR pains, I don't like that, she seems fake now. I'm visiting her soon and I may break up with her. Please advise.**

t2fml,7,2012-05-01,[FR] The key to getting better? Going out and pushing yourself consistently. (long),[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t2fml/fr_the_key_to_getting_better_going_out_and/,"This is a bit long. Scroll down if you want a recap of lessons learned at the end. It's been a while since I've written anything here. School's been insane, but I'm in New York for an internship and decided that I want to take the opportunity to develop myself as much as possible. I've been going out with a group of sedditor, all of whom are great guys and much better than me (but I'm catching up). I'll refer to them by their reddit accounts for privacy sake: Red_Alt, Mr. Blond, and solonyc. My sticking points are many but I will highlight them, along with any other salient points, for your edification and discussion.

**Saturday Night, Clubbing in New York**

I met up with Red_Alt and a couple of his college friends in the Meatpacking District, New York's clubbing area. Red's friends aren't into pickup, but seem like decent fellows. Red is on his last night of 59 consecutive sarging days, and the progress that he has made is phenomenal. We can't get into the usual place because the usual bouncers that we're friendly with aren't there, and we have too many guys. Instead we go a nearby beer garden and meet up with Mr. Blond, who is also at the end of a 30 day challenge, and generally kicks butt. 

**Brazilian Beer Garden**

We break after Red yells at us to open, looking for sets. He's charging through the place opening left and right and I need to get my ass in gear. I sit down with a mixed 4 set, 3 girls 1 guy, and talk for a minute before I get blown out pretty hard. Red points out a lone HB6.5 and I sit down and introduce myself. She must have had the prettiest damn eyes I'd ever seen, we're talking Jack Donaghy shit here. She doesn't know what to make of me at first, but I word vomit my way through and she eventually hooks. Her HB5 friend comes back with their drinks and is really confused by my presence, but I draw them both in, especially when I find out that one's a law student in Brazil, and the other just graduated from there. I get really excited because I just found some lawyers to network with. Their HB 7.5 friend sits down next to me and I've found my target. She's also Brazilian, in college here. 

Red_Alt and Mr. Blond join us and we have a good rapport going with the group. However, we're not locking in or isolating, so some of the energy is wasted. For instance, Mr. Blond and I are alternating between talking to the 5 and the 7.5, so I'm not progressing as quickly as I could have. I am however getting good kino with my arm around her shoulder and our legs and hips touching. By the time I get to kinoing around her face I know I need to isolate. I straddle the bench and face her and put my arm around her. She's still facing perpendicular, which is far from ideal, but at least her eyes are locked in mine. I ask her, as a communications major, what my body language says about me at that moment. She basically says I'm very open, and the fact that I'm looking her in the eye means I want to see her naked. I jokingly ask what she looks like naked (Red thinks this was a mistake, he's probably right). We start playing at a scenario where we're going to have a one night stand in the bathroom and eventually I take her hand to isolate (this is still a game, F-closing in the bathroom wouldn't have been feasible in this venue). She must have given the signal to her HB6.5, because she suddenly says she needs to go to the bathroom too. So much for isolating. I joke that we're going to have a 3-some and take both their hands. HB7.5 jokes that we're going to do it in a photobooth, so I lead her in, but as soon as we get in she hugs me, pecks me on the cheek, and runs off to the bathroom. I should have just grabbed her hand, pulled her in and kissed her, but frankly I had no idea what I was doing and was scared shitless up to that point. When we get back to the table I get the lawyers' email addresses because I genuinely do want to expand my network. I try to time-bridge with HB7.5, but she won't give me her number. 

**Rub-a-dub-dub**

I collect Red's 2 friends and go to meet Red, Mr. Blond, and solonyc who had previously bounced to a club. They'd managed to BS the bouncer into letting them in by saying they knew the DJ. I try the same line but they say we need girls. The sedditors come out to help us out, and I leave Red's friends to wait for them while I look for girls to get us in. I hook with a 3 set sitting in a lounge/bar but they don't seem like they're up for clubbing. I get blown out HARD by a Japanese 2-set on the street. Eventually we see a two set going towards the club, and at Red's urging I run after them and catch them in line. They don't think they can get in, so I propose that since I need girls, and they need to know the DJ's name, we team up. They're not going for it, but as we get to the front of the line I put my arms around them and say to the bouncers, ""you said I needed girls right?"" They look at me, look at them, ask who the DJ is, and let us in. I'm thrilled, and the girls are very impressed. I introduce myself but let them go so I can get in touch with the guys. The sedditors get back in because they're stamped, and Red's friends are able to BS their way in with 1 fewer penis holding them back. 

My night is fairly uneventful after this. I open a bunch of sets, get blown out of some, have good interactions with others. In just a few weeks of sarging with these guys my AA in the bar setting has mostly melted away. I used to be afraid of not knowing what to say, but now I know I can just word vomit until I find something that hooks. If the set doesn't hook and I get blown out, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. 

The other guys are having very good nights. Red's friends jump in the large hot-tub that is in the corner of the dance floor and start a wave of chodelier dudes and topless women in after them. The sedditors are opening any sets we can. Mr. Blond is feeling really low energy but pushes through like a champ. When we're up on the rooftop bar, at least 2 sets open solonyc for a cig. He eventually escalates with one so far that he picks her up and starts making out. Red proceeds to make out with her friend. 

We eventually go to the dance floor. Remember how I said I have very little AA at the bar? Well it turns out that confidence is context-specific, because I feel fucking *uncomfortable* on the dance floor. Like I just don't belong there. It ruins my state, and generally sucks, but I know I need to *make* myself comfortable there, so I force myself to stay in, just dancing by myself. And in a way, it works, because at the start of the night I couldn't imaging grabbing a girl and dancing with her on the dance floor, but by the end I was at least contemplating trying. By focusing on the short term goal of just being comfortable with myself in that setting, I freed myself up to make progress. 

Solonyc is dancing with basically anyone he pleases, makes out with at least 5 girls, and gets a ""double make-out"" (not entirely sure what that is, 2 consecutive?). Red_Alt is grinding up on girls, and by the end of the night is making out with one against the wall while solonyc works her roommate. It's 4 O'clock and I'm exhausted. Mr. Blond and I head out, Red and Solo follow with their girls in tow. I hear there was no F-close, but damn did it look like it was going to happen. 

**Executive Summary**

Lessons learned: 

*Confidence is context-sensitive and you need to develop it in contexts where you don't have it. If you don't like the dance floor, get on the damn dance floor. 
*Worry about developing skills, not outcomes. I don't get down on myself when I get blown out or don't get a number, because I at least I got to develop my skill set further. Now that I can approach and transition I can worry about isolating and escalating.
*Word vomit.
*Push yourself. I'm still self-conscious when I talk to girls who are taller than me. Both the girls who I got into the club with were at least 3 inches taller than me, if I hadn't talked to them I would have spent the night putzing around on the street. 
*Lock-in and isolate as soon as you can. If you fail, oh well.

tl;dr: Tried to isolate with a Brazilian college student, BSed my way into a great club, felt awkward on the dance floor, saw boobies.

The friend of hers backed off and told my GF to also. Whilst nothing is, or was, going on he had my best interest in heart. This BFF told my SO that he couldn't maintain friendship with her because he was worried about me. (My perception, interpretation, feelings, jealousy, threat... you get the idea.) Which upset my partner. He had inferred that because of my irrational and unjustified animosity, he had to sever ties. This intern upset my GF. 

He is one of her closest and only, (no malice intended,) friends. They're close and admittedly, i felt threatened. So going against all my fibres, and my pride... I drunk dialled him tonight. I laid it out.

I have to be honest. I couldn't be more at peace with the dude. Legitimately charmed. Though my hang up is should I have called? I wouldn't take it back though is it justified?

Muchly appreciated x 

tl;dr I called a mate of my girlfriend to restore their friendship though he has higher feelings for her than she does for him?! Read above and ask away. Appreciate any and all feedback.

Most of them have been about the real money auction house, but I could not find anything related to the release dates.

So my issue is similar to many others, I'm originally from Europe and will play on Europe with my friends. On the 15th of May I will however be in Malaysia for an internship.

As we got to know earlier, Diablo 3 is launching for each zone at a different time. For Europe, its going to be at midnight (central european time). The asian release falls together with the opening of the US servers, which is several hours later.

Seeing as European servers open up first, does this mean that I can immediatly login to these when they open, in my case at 6am? If that is the case, wouldn't that mean that the European servers will be flooded with people from the US? Anybody got any information about this? Much appreciated!"

He's either doing that, or joining the army.  
  
I've wanted to take a year off since I graduated high school, but between undergrad, work, and law school, I never really had the chance.  
  
The plan is to take the year, or maybe just 6 months, after graduation and travel the US, working odd jobs for extra cash, and living out of a car. It sounds kind of rough, but I really want to do it.  
  
So, my question is:  
  
**Would taking a year off after graduating law school ruin things for me?**  
  
I'm not at the top of my class, probably just barely in the top half. I've taken a variety of courses, and have an internship for the summer, so there's some experience. I figure that once I get started with a career, my only real chance to do this again will be when I'm too old to enjoy it.  
  
Is this a dream I should give up on?  
If not, any tips to make it work?"

This summer I will be doing an internship at a firm in Midtown East (Madison Ave). I have found what appears to be a great place to live in the Bronx (very close to Fordham). The rent is perfect for my financial situation ($500/month) and it a ten minute walk west on Fordham road to the 4. However, as someone who is completely unfamiliar with the area, I have no idea if this is really a safe place/ a good deal. A little about me. I am 20 year old, white, male.

A few quick questions:

    Generally speaking, is this a safe neighborhood?

    Is it safe to walk 10 minutes down Fordham Road to/from the 4?

    a. At all hours of the day/night?

    Any other general input for a student considering this area.

Thanks so much for the help!

EDIT: Thanks for the great advice so far everyone. Just to clarify one point..the $500 represents my portion of a 2br w/ a kitchen. I will have a roommate. Does that change any recommendations?

Thanks again.

Some dialogue on transborder queer issues, expectations while traveling, your experiences, etc... would be awesome. ",nonquistadora,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/t4i2j/i_am_a_23_yr_old_queer_woman_doing_an_18000_mile/,"As the title states, I'm 23, queer, and a woman.  I traveled to West Africa two summers ago and was very aware that being queer/out/open was not as casual or safe as I am used to.  Though my muslim host in Togo was very open and accepting, I am unsure about what to expect on my upcoming trip.  

My trip is an 18,000 mile solo ride from Vancouver, B.C. to Ushuaia, Argentina.  I'm doing it on my KTM 690, opting for campsites and couchsurfing hosts over hostels and hotels.  I'm looking forward to CSing in Latin America because it's easy to find LGBT friendly hosts.



About me:  I recently graduated from Arizona State with a BA in Global Studies and a BA in Political Science.  I'm doing this 18,000 mile trip to research and develop a sustainable bike coop that integrates permaculture food systems, malaria prevention, and easy and affordable access to transportation to alleviate poverty in rural communities (primarily focusing on developing countries).  I've traveled a bit before.  My first time outside the US was my internship for my Global Studies degree in Ghana and Togo.  I was in a group of 8 women, 4 of whom identified as queer. No one was out to any of our Togolese counterparts (30 young men from the University of Kara and University of Lomé), but there were a few occasions where I had conversations about being accepting towards all humans (recognizing common humanity) and  there was an implied acceptance of homosexuality on behalf of my Togolese friends. 

My ex girlfriend is a women and gender studies and justice studies double major.  I am really into feminist discourse and queer theory as a result of endless nights spent helping her with her homework.  I want to keep an eye out for transborder queer issues - I am actually hoping someone reading this could point me in the direction of some academic reading on this topic - and document my own experiences as a traveling queer woman.  

So, I want to open up some dialogue about what to expect/what issues to look out for...

I'm not as concerned with personal safety, and am not looking for advice on that.  I am more interested in queer theory, transborder identity, etc. 

As a general rule, I value safety over pride.  I am planning on passing as straight when I don't see a big gay presence, and being myself when I see other out queer locals.    I plan on wearing a ring, as my experiences with suave young men in Costa Rica last summer showed me that a ring is much more effective than a million ""No, not interested"" letdowns. 

 
Also, please feel free to ask me anything.  I need feedback and I appreciate new things to think about

t7hgq,9,2012-05-04,Tren Bastion Birth Story (Planned C-Section w/Complications),Kibure,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/t7hgq/tren_bastion_birth_story_planned_csection/,"As previously posted I have several complications that really limited my choices on what to do.  I could have had a natural birth but if there were any complications at all the likelihood of serious consequences for both my son and I went sky high.  Especially if I needed an emergency C-section.  So to ensure the safest delivery for both my son and I we chose to schedule a C-section for April 27th, which was my 39 week mark.  

One of my complications is two stainless steel harrington rods in my back that cause my spine to be immobile from my neck down almost to the bottom of the spine.  The fusion ended just above the area where a spinal block would be placed, so we risked an X-ray and prepared for the anesthesiologist to attempt a Spinal Block.  My husband and I arrived at the hospital at 10:30 to begin the preparations for the surgery.  An omen of how the day was going to go should have been when it took four sticks to get the IV in place.  

Now before I continue, I want to say that the hospital I was at is brand new and extremely well staffed.  There was no time that I didn't feel like I was in very competent hands.  After all of the drama earlier about which hospital was going to accept me I am very glad I ended up where I did despite the 3 hour drive each way.  

About 12:30 I was taken back to the operating room, with hubby waiting outside in the waiting area for the time when he could come in.    I sat up on the OR table and had to lean forward and try to arch my back. With the two metal rods there was no chance that was happening.  As the anesthesiologist tried to set up the spinal block we find out that the x-rays were never received by the hospital despite setting up to have them sent several times in the three weeks since they were taken.  After about 30 minutes and multiple attempts we finally had to face the facts that a spinal block just wasn't going to work.  

So on to General Anesthesia!  This was something we wanted to avoid due to the breathing complications I had during the pregnancy.  They laid me down and started the prep.  I remember them placing the oxygen mask over my face, and that's when I started having breathing problems.  I tried to tell them that the mask was not letting me breathe enough, and that I felt like I was suffocating.  They insisted I was fine because my pulse ox was 97%.  They turned on the dream gas and I started choking.

Now, I was out for this part so I didn't know what happened except what was told to me.  With General Anesthesia the husband isn't allowed in the OR until a specific point at the hospital I was at.  Apparently an Intern did not get the memo and he brought my husband in too soon.  I was laying on the OR table cut open, pale, and barely breathing according to my husband.  It only took seconds for the doctors to realize my husband was in the room and yell at the intern to remove him.  From what I understand at one point my husband tried to  punch the intern for showing him that and he had to be watched by security for the rest of the operation.  Unfortunately when he was being brought in at the right time apparently the anesthesiologist was busy trying to keep me breathing (breathing treatments and oxygen I have heard) so he was ushered out quickly again.

Despite all the breathing problems I had during the procedure my son Tren Bastion was born at 1:53pm weighing 7lbs 12oz and 20.5 inches long.  I finally got to see him just after 3pm, and was able to start breastfeeding him then.  My prolonged time in getting treated after the surgery kept me from him but we still managed to keep the nurses from jumping the gun and feeding him.  Mostly because he is one of the sweetest and most well behaved babies I have ever met.  He is easily soothed and wasn't even crying or upset about the wait when they finally let me have him.  

I was kept in the hospital for four days, and they were considering keeping me more but I drew the line because there wasn't really much of a reason to continue to keep me.  During the whole time Tren has behaved so well.  The only issue we have had is that Tren is more adjusted to a night time schedule, but I believe that is because during the pregnancy I worked as a Night Auditor.  This really hasn't helped my husband though because we have a hell of a time keeping him asleep at night.  He normally latches and feeds well but during the late night/early morning he will often refuse the breast or refuse to sleep in his crib.  So far most of the nights I have ended up holding him for a good portion of the night as it is the only way he will sleep and not disturb hubby.

TL;DR: Had a planned C-section that didn't go as planned and ended up with breathing complications during the surgery.  Baby was delivered healthy and happy anyway."

* I want to get a credit card, preferably with a competitive APR, possibly a student rate and/or rewards/cash back.
* Any student programs would be a plus.
* I've heard and read horror stories about Well's Fargo, so I'd like to avoid them.

Is there anything else major that I should be looking for? I'm fairly new to this! Thanks!

*EDIT:* Also what would be better, a fixed APR of 14% or an introductory of 0% for 12 months then a variable of 10.99%-23.99%  after that? This is assuming that I don't pay off my balance every month."
t6w7i,12,2012-05-04,Two and a half year college relationship is stagnant and I'm ready to call it quits,slipferd51,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t6w7i/two_and_a_half_year_college_relationship_is/,"Requisite information: I am 21m, she is also a 21f. We have been dating for two and half years to the day.

**Warning: Long wall of text incoming.**

Since I started college as a freshmen, I have dated my SO. We literally met three days after school started and haven't been apart since. This is my first serious relationship, and the first person I've had sex with as well; I was also her first serious relationship. In the beginning, our relationship was really good. It was healthy, we each had time to ourselves, but we really just enjoyed being together. Relevant to mention now is that I'm a really frugal and careful person; I like to plan everything and save money, and I started college with significant personal finances. More on that part later.

About mid way through freshmen year, in January, my SO began to say ""I love you"" and I began to repeat it back. I was a little unnerved by this at first, but I was starting to genuinely believe that she was the one for me. We had so much fun together, and being a little opposite, I was and still am crazy attracted to her.

In that February, my SO revealed to me that she felt that was she was depressed, and that she might have been for a long time and only realized it after meeting me and seeing how positive and driven I was to succeed in life. Her semester completely took a dive as a result, and she simply stopped going to classes, eventually flunking them. I spent the rest of the semester spending all of my time with her, including going to counseling with her and trying to help her as best as I could. It was through counseling she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; they prescribed medications, but due to having no insurance, she could not afford them. This was the first red flag for me.

At the end of the year, against my better judgement, I convinced my family to allow her to live with us, the rationale being that there were a lot more jobs for her here in Chicago than back in her small town in Wisconsin. My family was aware of her semester break down, and beginning to question if the relationship was healthy, but I just shrugged them off. For two months, things were okay, but as the summer wore on, I began to discover her dark sides. I couldn't see my friends like I wanted to; she was insanely jealous of any significant attention I paid to  my family or friends, and I spent the summer locked in a bedroom with her watching movies everyday. For a go getter like me, it was like I had died.

At the end of that August, we began to have blowouts and she would state that she wanted to break up, but then an hour later come crying for us to get back together. At this point, my mother wanted her gone because she was disrupting the house, but I kept defending her. Eventually, it came to the point I told her she needed to go home too; her dad was really ill and her family needed help, but she refused to go home, so I kind of kicked her out.....three times. Each time she packed up, it was a crying mess on both our parts, and each time, after an hour, she wound up returning and I defended her to  my  mom. After the third time, I finally packed up her stuff with her and actually drove her home up north, and for the last three weeks of August, we were separate, but still together.

Beginning sophmore year, her previous friend/roommate decided to change living situations, and I am unsure if my girlfriend had a role in this. Being the only other friend she had at school, I was now her sole emotional anchor to the school. The year started okay, but as it wore on, I realized she wasn't attending classes still; she would do one night class okay, but fail all the rest of her classes. At the same time, she lacked any motivation to any field or job, flirting with environmental science, business, music and biology.

This pattern continued into the Spring semester too, unbeknownst to her family and mine, as I played a willing accomplice in hiding her flunking everything. All this time, she began to push our relationship further; against my wants, she wanted to get engaged and eventually married. We began to have blow outs every week over engagement. Like an absolute idiot, I started going ring shopping with her, because I thought maybe it would mollify her. Nevermind that I could not afford that at all, I was just stalling for..I don't know.

At the end of the year, we began to fight over the direction for the summer; I wanted to go home and work my old job, but she wanted me to come live with her for the summer without any job prospects. At this point, my family wanted nothing to do with her and wanted me to break it off completely. She began applying for jobs all over  the Chicago land area. I thought that if maybe she didn't get a job, she would go home peacefully and I could maybe distance myself to the point that I felt strong enough to break it off. Boy was I wrong.

What consistently amazed me was how much motivation she could have to stay in my life rather than improving herself; she found a job downtown that could barely  support her living in the area during the summer. I went home for two weeks, and she did as well before her job started. During this time, we had a ton of blow outs, including one right in the middle of my family moving apartments. I abandoned my family on moving day to spend time talking and crying with her, and in my depressiona and confusion, almost ran back for the summer to her house that day, abandoning my job and family. 

That night ended with me pleading with her to go home, in the rain, at 9PM at night because she had nowhere to go. Eventually, she did arrive home at that midnight after I had several calls with her family with neither of us knowing her whereabouts. I thought this was the end. But...she showed up in Chicago a week later living at a extended relatives house, to work the job she had gotten.

We reconnected, and...I lied to my family about being with her the whole summer. I would see her every single day, driving twenty minutes south every night after work to have dinner with her. My entire summer income supported her; I basically fed her the summer because she never worked enough to pay rent and feed herself. My family was in the dark  this whole time. I began to sink deeper into depression.

Flash forward to the beginning of junior year. Again, both semesters, she has basically flunked everything; her family is still in the dark. I lied to my family  and told them I had gotten back together with her in November, in a very dramatic fight where I abandoned my family for Thanksgiving to go to her family's house. I did that the year prior, and then at Christmas I almost did the same again before gaining common sense. Despite staying with my family Christmas night..I drove six hours roundtrip to spend five hours sleeping with her at her family's house before returning to my family and lying about my whereabouts.

During the Spring semester, I won an extremely valuable and prestigious government internship in Washington D.C. this summer, and even after agreeing to possibly being apart for the summer so I could go  do this internship, she has now begun to demand that we go together, and that I find us a place to live and money so that we can spend the summer out east together. I  have subsidized housing; if I tried to bring her, I would lose that,  and I'm basically unwilling to do that.

Now, on top of every event, two other things have convinced me that I need to get out of this: one, she has completely changed my spending habits. As a result of the relationship, I am in some serious credit card debt, to  the tune of $2k; my family has little money, and scholarships are all that have paid my way through school. My school job barely covers these bills, and yet I still spend hundreds of  dollars every semester eating out and buying her things. She also eats of my meal plan, even though she has an apartment to cook food in; her family basically cannot financially support her completely, and so myself and my family's money has picked up the slack.

Secondly, I have become an absolute chronic liar since starting this relationship. I lie to  parents, to friends, to teachers, to everyone. I  hate myself so much for it; I'm completely depressed over the state of my life. I feel absolutely trapped, and I know  I need to get out, but I  feel like I don't have the strength; I keep giving in to her, spending all of my time with her. Partially I'm worried I'm codependent, and I also am constantly worried about her depression and her possibly being suicidal. Like I said, she has no one but me; absolutely no one.

Basically...how do I end this /relationship? I know everyone says clean break...but I feel like this is going to ruin my life trying to extract myself from this. Any advice or words of encouragement would help me a lot.

**TL;DR**\

* Girlfriend is depressed and previously suicidal, borderline disorder and no meds.

* Relationship has constantly broken down and destroyed my familial and friend relationships.

* She has made me broke and depressed as a result, and I need to get out, but I'm weak and I can't bring myself to do it.

t6rgx,10,2012-05-04,ISE Majors..,fukyeahISE,SBU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/t6rgx/ise_majors/,"Don't ever let anyone tell you that your major is useless or a waste of time. I've seen it all too often on campus and on this board. This CSE/ISE holy war has got to stop because I fear that it is seriously turning people in the wrong direction; And while normally I wouldn't give two shits about everyone else's business, I'm in an extra good mood today. So here we go (from my 4 year point of view).

The facts about SBU's ISE program:

* ISE provides a broad **background** in topics relating to programming, networking, linux, databases, hardware, customer support, and ethics. That's all. You want to learn VM's? Set up an eSXi box on your own. You want to learn AD and GPO's? Set up a DC. You want to script? Do it on your own.
* Difficulty is relative, but if I had to compare ISE to CSE I would say ISE is much easier. Really.
* On top of that, ISE is a degree that is extremely easy to coast through. I have news for you; If you put little/no work into this degree you will not find a job. Absolutely will never find work. In an interview it is painfully obvious when someone doesn't know material they should. In this sense, you wasted your time. 
* ISE is a **completely different degree** than that of a CSE degree, and lead to very different jobs. 
* The average ISE student will end up doing Help Desk/Desktop Support after school. The average starting salary will be between 42,000 and 49,000. However, Help Desk/Desktop Support is only a starting point. After Help Desk your opportunities **will** explode and paths will open up to more lucrative jobs like Systems or Network Administrators, Consultants, Executive Support; the list goes on. **However,** while doing Help Desk you must be working proactively in a way that helps you achieve your end career goal. Nothing is impossible.
* An ISE degree is not a pigeon hole - Not working hard enough is a pigeon hole.

By now you're probably thinking who the fuck I am to tell you about the ISE major. I'll tell you, damnit. I'm graduating this May with a degree in ISE and I have worked my ass off. In my junior year I found an internship off campus which lead to an on-campus internship in my senior year. I began applying for jobs in November and finished up all my interviewing in April. I've been through more than 30 phone interviews, have been invited to interview on site at 7 very successful companies, and received 5 job offers. The job I eventually took pays well above the ISE average and includes a bonus structure that will blow some starting CSE starting salaries out of the water. That's who I am.

Some final thoughts,

If you're an ISE major that is putting in little/no work - please stop, you are making us all look awful.
If you're an ISE major that is working hard - **continue to work hard**, and please reach out to me if you want help with resume writing, interview help, or career path questions.
If you're a CSE major that is down with the ISE program - Stay cool playa'.
If you're a CSE major that is a pompous ass - Fuck off.

I'm turning 21 in about a week, and I'm a miserable failure.

I'm studying computer science at a pretty damn good institution, and I passed my first two years easily due to prior knowledge and good habits. However, I'm about to finish my third year, and I've dropped a class and am failing another one.

I simply don't give a shit about anything anymore. I spend all my time playing videogames and watching anime, I don't go to classes, I barely turn assignments in. I just for some reason find no purpose in anything right now.

I've got a summer internship working with a company that does software development, and it will be fun, but for some reason school itself just makes me want to gag and turn off my brain completely. I feel like there's some creative gene in me that could do some really cool stuff (I love cooking, for example) but my current degree and studies have just become an absolute theory-ridden slog.

Hell, I could honestly see myself dropping out and going to culinary school or something, it would be a hell of a lot more interesting than this, and I'd meet people who actually enjoy what they're doing instead of slogging through to a degree.

I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation and what you did to get out of it."

As someone who has played since beta, and been around Rioters and pro players for a long time, I've learned some interesting facts. None of these are NDA bound and not all of them are terribly important, but I think some might be interesting, so here's a post. I'm sure a lot of you know some of these already and that's fine, but not everyone does =)

I'm not sure if I'll do these regularly, I guess it'll depend on reception. Either way, in this edition I've broken it up into two different sections. Beta facts and facts about awesome Rioters (nothing personal or negative, just things that are already public but not widely known). 

Beta Facts
----------------------------------------------

* There were a lot of broken things you could do in beta at level 1. There were level one barons, level one dragons, and five promote and five rallys to rush down middle lane.

* There used to be waaaay more brush on Summoners Rift back in beta. Like in front of dragon and stuff. 

* Here's a [list of the top 500 players prior to the reset at the end of beta.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=20721) Familiar faces like Takashix, Reginald, and Dan Dinh at the top. Also note that these players are supposed to get ""master beta player"" and ""grandmaster beta player"" icons. They've yet to get them.

* Here's one of my favorite League of Legends videos from back in beta, [Rammus vs the World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy3wmLbNPdc). Take a look at dat UI and some familiar names.

* When League was first in beta, it was only available to play during the weekends. At the end of each weekend, everyone would get on a Riot owned vent and chat about what they thought of the most recent build with Steve Snow, the lead producer. This usually devolved into everyone arguing about something specific: gold card locking, philo stone, and more come to mind. 

* I think when I started playing in the beta, I would guess there were less than 200 outside the company playing it. Now there are over 32 million at last announce. Still blows my mind.

* ~~You used to be able to stack sunfire capes. A friend of mine used to always demand team sunfire games, where everyone got a ton of sunfires. Dat AOE damage. I forget if you could still do this out of beta, but if you could it wasn't for that long I believe.~~

* For a long time, no one knew what the business model for League of Legends would be. I remember when they announced it would be free to play. 

* This is a [hilarious thread from beta](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=17475) featuring some well known players and edrama.

* Towards the end of beta, there was a little tournament called the Baron Cup. It was one of the coolest things about the beta, [you can see the thread about it here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4522)

* [Brackhar hired me back in 2009 after hearing my brilliant ideas.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3265)

* The first game of League of Legends I ever played was on the winter map, 1v1'ing a friend. I was Nunu and they were Annie. Nunu's passive confused me, because I came from Dota where there weren't passives. I think there were probably about 15 different champions to pick from at the time.

* I'm pretty sure human Ryze is one of the rarest skins in the game. You had to get it by preordering League of Legends at retail. Remember that League was a sleeper hit, and that they were offering preorders through their site, so very few people preordered through a Gamestop or whatever. I have human Ryze =)

* Rammus had an actual voice with regular lines, but it was pretty bad. They took it out and what was left is what you hear today. They had planned to change it, but it just kind of worked out that it was *okay.* 

* Everyone from Beta talks about how much cooler we are than all of you in [the adjudicator forum.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=11)

* There were exclusive IRC channels back in beta for adjudicators and stuff. Guinsoo would frequently leak stuff there. =)

* If you couldn't get to the login screen on the launcher because it said servers were down, you could Konami code past it. 

Rioter Facts
----------------------------------

* Phreak used to be a WarCraft 3 professional player, [here's him doing commentary for WarCraft Replays.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZE_PI1BhdQ) Be sure you stick around until 2:36.

* I know of several different Rioters who worked on well known titles before coming to Riot. [Christina Norman](https://twitter.com/#!/truffle) was an important designer on Mass Effect 2. [OhMikeGoodness](https://twitter.com/#!/ohmikegoodness) was an animator on Bastion. Tom Cadwell (Zileas) was actually a professional Starcraft player when it first came out, and is well known for inventing reaver drops. After that he worked on some lesser known games, such as Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft. There are a lot more, but those spring to mind.

* Lulu is voiced by PrincessAura, a Rioter who works in player support. PrincessAura was [also on a show called WCG Ultimate Gamer,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Vdu6hezsE) a show about pro gamers. She played Super Smash Bros.

* Also on above mentioned show was Hatperson, Justin Wong, Rachel Quirico aka Seltzer. Yes, that Hatperson and Seltzer.

* Rivington the 3rd was a backup for the show, and knows a lot of people from that as well. Rinoa was in a clan with Seltzer. It's weird going to places like IPL 4 and being around all of these guys that have crazy connections with each other going way back.

* Maokai and Veigar are both named after Rioters. Maokai is an artist. Veigar started off as a QA intern in beta, and now he's a high up producer. He and I were friends before he worked at Riot, so it drives me SO INSANE when people pronounce the champions name ""V-eye-gar"" because his name is ""Vay-gar"", prounounced like ""ray"". He's also a giant, unlike his champion equivalent. [An Icelandic Giant.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iuQ1IjlHYE) I don't feel bad for him though, because long ago he mocked my 61 point frost build in WoW. 

* [Ironstylus](https://twitter.com/#!/riotironstylus) and OhMikeGoodness are both named Mike IRL. They're also INCREDIBLY hilarious individually, but dangerously hilarious when they're together. They're also amazing artists. Here's a [look at some of Ironstylus's work before Riot.](http://gallery.me.com/mmaurino)

* Guinsoo gets a lot of flak for the neckbeard he sported in the first video patch preview he was ever in, but I met him in Vegas during IPL 4. He's a really, really cool guy and incredibly stylin' and good looking. Ladies looking for a designer, track down this dude. I introduced him to Doublelift and Guinsoo told him he needed Vayne lessons from Doublelift because he doesn't know how to play her. Doublelift replied by telling him he didn't know how to play her either. 

* On the first floor of Riot HQ there's [this big room where they do presentations and stuff.](http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/riotgames_images/large/ShowAndTell.jpg) I went there for a non-Riot event last Christmas that they happened to be having there. It's cleverly called the Urf Memorial Lounge.

* I think I've interacted with every member of the Riot eSports team by now and I can tell you that they're all amazing. Mad props to all of them, but I want to give special points to 
[Lykaeus](https://twitter.com/#!/RiotLykaeus) and [RavenBeauty](https://twitter.com/#!/BridgetDavidson), both of whom never see any camera time, but work together to make sure every event goes smooth. I really mean EVERY event. When I was in Vegas, they would spend all day making sure things were going okay with IPL 4, AND with the European event that same weekend, and then they would stay up and make sure the Korean tournament went well later that night. If you're happy with how smoothly tourneys have gone lately, they're the unsung heroes and they deserve crazy praise. 

* There is no such thing as a ""lore team"" -- just a creative design team. There never was a lore team, so they didn't all get fired like some people say. They're also not just sitting around not doing anything. The creative designers work alongside game designers on every champion. While someone like Ezreal (the designer) will decide what abilities Vlad might have, the creative designer will work with artists to decide what he'll look like, they'll write all of his punny lines, etc. They're basically responsible for how the champion ""feels"" thematically. If you like the abilities a champion has, you can thank the game designer. If you like the personality, you can thank the creative designer.

* There are several Rioters who have told me (and I believe them) that Riot could form one of the best NA teams with people from live team and QA including Jatt, Classick, Statick, Milkcow, Roku, etc. 

State of the League Gaming House Bonus Facts
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* While I was writing this Doublelift walked by me and told me he was going to make a ""Doublelift's Fun Facts thread"" that will ""destroy your fun facts thread."" When I asked him what he would put in it, he told me he had no idea, and that he ""just liked to talk shit"". He then continued to mock me. 

* Shortly thereafter, he informed me that he forgot the nice chopsticks I got for him last Christmas in Korea. He then consoled me by telling me that all of CLG got to use them, and that he bragged to his teammates about how they were such a nice gift, and that I had given them to him for his birthday. Again, I gave them to him for Christmas, we didn't even meet until three weeks after his birthday. Peter uses all of his brain power to make da big plays, and none of it to remember normal things. "

Anyway, I am a (somewhat) recent college grad, and I am at a point where I really want to start focusing in on a career path that will utilize my skills and that I will find fulfilling. I've been a ski bum in Wyoming for the last two years, which has been awesome, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the prospect of working at a ski shop for the rest of my life. I’ll be moving to Chicago and I want to use this opportunity to break into the industrial design/product design field. I applied to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's product design graduate program but I didn't get accepted, and I think my lack of practical experience in the field was really to blame for this. I was a visual art major at a liberal arts college, and I did as much work in the realm of design as I could. I only really had access to a table saw and my own hand tools for a woodshop, but I really enjoyed making furniture. 
Here’s some of my work-

So here’s where I need some advice from my fellow redditors: my plan now is to work my ass off to become a better applicant and ultimately get accepted to an ID graduate program in Chicago, and I was wondering if any of you had some advice/comments on what would be the best way for me to proceed down this path.
Here’s what I’ve got so far:

1. Take community college courses to learn Solidworks and Autocad (Maya? Any other programs?). I’d like to start this during the summer, but being in western Wyoming kinda limits me in terms of community education resources. Any suggestions for good online courses?

2. Try to get an internship with a design firm or a design consultancy firm (any suggestions here would be super helpful, since I don't really know where to look)"
t8hys,7,2012-05-05,Help! I'm dealing with some serious trust issues and anxiety in a long-distance relationship!,thisisthrowaway1234,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/t8hys/help_im_dealing_with_some_serious_trust_issues/,"Hey /r/relationship_advice,

Throwaway account here obviously. I'm writing because I'm having some serious trust issues and anxiety over my long-distance relationship. First, let me give a bit of background. Please forgive the huge amount of text; I would really appreciate it if you would read it and give me some help!

My girlfriend and I met at a friend's party in our hometown last summer. We hit it off really well and went on a few dates. She's nice, friendly, very independent, cute, and has bizarre but awesome tastes. Our first date was sushi and then we watch Jacob's Ladder (psychological horror/thriller flick) and an ISIS DVD (cool post-metal band). Second date was Interview with a Vampire and listening to Mastodon (another sweet prog-metal band). 

I had just graduated with a degree in physics and she had just finished her second semester at a good art school and was back in town for the summer. As it turns out, though, I was accepted into a PhD program for engineering at a school located only 3 hours away from her! So we talked about it; we both kind of just wanted a summer fling, but since our schools were close we decided to make this work. I will point out that we're both pretty unusual and quirky people; we are both very independent and don't need to talk to each other or see each other all the time to be comfortable. I just finished my second semester at grad school and we saw each other once every 2-4 weeks on weekends, skyped and watched movies about once a week, and only occasionally texted. Things were going very well; she had her stuff to do and I had mine, and we respected that. Our fields are very different, but I am a very creative person myself; after some consideration I chose physics over piano as a major a few years before college since I had been classically trained for most of my life. We had a lot of interesting differences but have a lot of common traits and tastes as well; she would show me cool foreign horror flicks and death metal bands I hadn't heard of, I would tell her about science and cosmology and show her color pictures of nebulas I had put together during my undergraduate career as an astronomy researcher or tell her about crazy sci-fi ideas I have.

Fast-forward to about a month ago, around April 2. We hadn't seen each other for about 5 weeks and hadn't talked too much, didn't seem like too much of a big deal as this was a busy semester for us both. We decided to skype chat; she was writing a paper, and I always offer to help her with that because I think writing is my strongest skill.

In this skype chat, she mentioned the idea of us possibly taking a break and seeing other people. I was shocked at first, but I tried to keep my emotions out of it and be rational; it's unfair to use emotions to blackmail people. I asked her frankly, ""who is it that you want to sleep with?"" She said it wasn't that, she just felt like we could be missing opportunities. While I agree, I felt really bad; she has a much more active social life than I do as a grad student, and I know that because of her quirky personality she prefers to hang around guys a lot more than girls so I figured one of her guy friends had been coming onto her. I, on the other hand, don't have any girls who I am friends with in my grad school town; hell, I only have acquaintances, which is fine since I use skype to keep up with my old college buddies and play video games with them.

I told her that I couldn't really see what she hoped to find other than someone else to sleep with. I told her that our relationship has been great, we care for each other very much (I wouldn't use the word ""love"" really, I've said it a few times but I know that I care about her a bit more than she does me which I am fine with). Still, the idea of her being around so many guys and being such a smoking hot girl made me wonder that somebody else was trying to encroach due to the long-distance nature of things.

We talked for over an hour, and the seriousness abated as she agreed she didn't want to lose what we have. I told her more than once that if she felt she needed to end it that it was fine; it would hurt me a lot, but she needs to look out for her interests, not mine. We have always tried to have this attitude in our relationship and she agreed, and we also both suspected that she may be feeling this way since it had been so long since we had seen each other and we hadn't been in touch too much. The conversation quickly turned light-hearted with us telling jokes and sharing funny videos on the internet, so I didn't ask her anything else, but it did bother me that she felt that way.

About two weeks later (April 14 or so) we were skyping again, having a good conversation, and I was a bit drunk and a tad emotional so I asked her if she still felt fine, she said yes. She told me what had happened to make her have some doubts; apparently a senior at her college had friended her on facebook after finding out she is a big metal head and she had been talking to him a lot and hanging out with him some. I told her that way okay, that I didn't want to tell her who she could and could not hang out with; that would be unfair of me unless I suspected something sinister. She also confessed that she was somewhat attracted to him; he is a pretty good-looking guy, better looking than me, dark complexion and thin and somewhat toned, plus they had a lot in common being art students and into the same music. I told her that was okay, you can't help to feel attracted to other people, I know from my angle there were times when I met other girls while we were dating in whom I found interest. Still, I always made it clear that I had a girlfriend out of respect for them and my relationship.

Finally I was done with classes so I went and visited her around the 25th for about 5 days. We had a great time; I helped her finish some papers, we watched a lot of Game of Thrones, we partied a bit together. Everything was going well, but I still couldn't get this other guy out of my head. I mentioned to her that I would like to meet him since I would like to be able to judge his character.

We got drunk and headed over to a party he was having with some friends. It was pretty rowdy but fun. I will admit to my shame that I did try to alpha-male him a bit; I have about 25 lbs on him, a good 15 of which muscle since I work out a lot, plus I have trained extensively in Judo and somewhat in MMA/Brazilian Jiu Jitsu so I can pull off the dumb monkey-brain alpha shit if I want to. At one point she and I were going outside to smoke (I smoke, she only does when drunk) and he says flirtily to her, ""Smoking is gross!"", to which I responded ""Ear Gauges are more gross!"" and tossed him a bit of a smirk and made eye contact until he broke it. I know, stupid alpha male bullshit, but I was drunk and didn't have the best judgment. We go outside to smoke, she takes a few hits and goes inside to use the bathroom. I finish my cig, she doesn't come back out, so I go back inside to see the other guy being a bit touchy-feely with her, tickling her and whatnot. He was pretty drunk so whatever. As we were hanging out I mentioned to my girlfriend that I was having fun, but I had half a mind to go up to the guy and tell him to stay the fuck away from her (more alpha male bullshit) but she convinced me not to.

So we hang out for a few more days, get drunk together a lot. I'm not a very emotional person but when I drink I can be, so I know I brought up my doubts and concerns another 2 or 3 times (bad idea I know, the last thing I want is to be repetitive). She admitted to having feelings for him and said that she didn't think she could trust herself around him and that she should hang out with him less. I told her that was her choice, but I thought it was a good idea. I was torn between feeling controlling and feeling like I had no control at all. I admitted to her too that I felt like it was a bit unfair; this other guy is an artist with a great portfolio which I'm sure she likes a lot, whereas I only have a few of my piano recordings from my younger days and other than that I have a technical write-ups a published article which are obviously dry and not as seemingly-impressive as art. I told her this and that I envied artists sometimes since others get to more readily appreciate their work than in the sciences.

One of the last things I mention before I leave (around the 30th or April) was that I wasn't comfortable with her seeing him so much. She said she understood, talked about if she was in my shoes and whatnot, so it seemed to be over with. I apologized for bringing it up so much and told her I had a great time and whatnot, so I left to return to my place (2-3 hours away) since I had some meetings. She said she would come visit me in a few days.

My girlfriend arrived in town last night (May 4) and we had a great time; we went to a cookout at a friends house and had a lot of fun before returning to my apartment. We smoked, watched some of Blade Runner, had a half-serious half-silly typical trees conversation before having some great sex and going to bed.

I always wake up earlier than her, so I begin working out and am about to go for a run when I notice her phone has a text. It's from the same guy. In a bit of bad judgment I flip it open and look through it. She and this guy have been texting A LOT. I read through a mountain of texts and saw that they had been hanging out a lot, which I knew about. However, it seems they had also been hanging out since I had left, almost every day (including the evening I left on April 30th), and they had been talking about getting together and drinking and watching movies. I read through many more texts, she seems a bit flirty and emotive (to be fair this is how she texts to everyone), using a lot of smileys, and I saw at one point he had made a pass at her, offering to come over and keep her company as she was going to bed; she had brushed it off in a silly way but had not explicitly said ""no"".

I'm ashamed at having read those texts, but I do feel a little betrayed because I had told her that I would prefer she hang out with him less and then, lo and behold, she had hung out with him about every night after I had left. I should point out that the guy does have roommates and there are always people over at his place so they weren't alone or anything.

I hate to bring it up to her one more time, but I think I should, this time while sober. How should I do it and what should I say? I want to preface it by promising not to bring it up again. I do trust her, and I know that if anything were to happen she would tell me. I would also preface it by saying that I am sorry for bringing up my issues with things with her so much and that I understand it's not fair to her, that I will start talking to my friends more about things instead of her so that she doesn't see the negative side of me so much.

I don't think I'll tell her I went through her phone, that was a shitty thing to do, but if she asks I will admit that i couldn't help it. I am going to tell her that I saw the text from the guy while trying to take a silly picture of myself with her phone to set as her phone's wallpaper (which is true) and I think I will go on to ask her if she is still hanging out with him a lot. If she says ""no' (which I doubt she will, she doesn't lie), I'll tell her she's lying and admit that I glanced through her phone some; her transgression of lying about having been hanging out with him, should she do that, is a lot worse than my looking through her phone some in my book.

I also want to tell her that I am bringing it up this last time because I am sober and collected and a sober conversation is better than a drunken and emotional one. This guy just graduated and is going to be leaving her area soon so I think I know what she was talking about with ""missing other opportunities"". Also his insistence on them getting drunk and watching movies/hanging out is not good, nor is her agreeing that they should do this. I want to tell her that if anything were to happen we would both feel rotten because what we have is so unique and works so well, and we have a great relationship where we are very open and honest; she has told me on many occasions that she really likes what she has and doesn't want to lose it over something stupid. I also want to tell her that I don't want her hanging out with this guy any more (perhaps that's a bit harsh, I might just say less often); I'll mention that she doesn't always trust herself around him, and I'll tell her that she should under no circumstance get drunk with him. I have told her before that I know he is just trying to get in her pants before he leaves and that he will bring it up at some point, probably when she is alone and vulnerable.

How should I go about doing this without seeming insecure or accusatory? Also, what else should I say? Should I talk to this other guy and tell him to stay away?

It's just really bothering be because my usual deal with girls is to be nice to them, bring the ruckus in the bedroom, and respect their choices; if things don't work out, they don't work out. That having been said, all these doubts and the trust issues are bothering me as much if not more than this whole situation; I want to be the best person I can and not try to hurt anyone else. I suspect I am a bit more emotionally involved in this relationship than she is, and more involved than I have been in previous relationships. I'm not the clingy type at all, but I can get insecure at times. I am going to talk to my friends and my sister about this for some guidance as well and I really want to minimize the trust issues.

My girlfriend and I are going on an out-of-state vacation for two weeks in a little bit over a week from now, and after that I will be working an internship for ten weeks. I can fly her up to my internship once, but other than that I will not see her for the summer, and I don't know how long she is going to be around this other guy. I just want everything to be out there in the open with her and to have a really honest conversation. I don't want to lose her over some seductive asshole who worms his way into her life despite knowing she has a boyfriend.

Please help! Any advice is super appreciated! Thanks!



Edit: **tl;dr**: Long-distance relationship, great compatibility, communication, and independence on both our parts. New guy comes along, girlfriend hangs out with him a lot, things seem a bit sketchy and I want to get the situation under control and get over my feelings of lack-of-trust and jealousy.

t7u38,0,2012-05-04,American Student Trying To Study In Canada,StuBickel,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/t7u38/american_student_trying_to_study_in_canada/,"To make a long story short, I'm an American 20 year old going to university in the United States. I'm not doing well in school and this is largely because of my mental, emotional, and psychological being. I'm getting testing done for potential medications and such but a large part of this stems from the fact that I am just unhappy in my current situation socially and I feel like I need a fresh start. So I am beginning to explore potential options for me. 

One idea I had was to move to a school in Canada. I am majoring in journalism and I am currently the editor of a moderately successful hockey website. So I feel like my passion for hockey might make me happier in Canada. I realize there's a lot more to Canada than just hockey but I feel like it would give me a big reason to connect with a lot of people; whether its attending a juniors game together or playing on the street or watching highlights on tv together or whatever. I also have the idea set in my head that I'd be able to find an internship related to hockey much easier in Canada than I would in the US. 

So I guess I have a few questions:

-Am I being completely delusional in thinking that my interest in hockey would give me a way to connect to people in Canada? I realize that it's not as simple as, ""you like hockey and so does Canada so everyone will love you"" but would that give me a way to make friends and have a social life despite being an American kid new to the country that is transferring over? 

-Am I being completely delusional in thinking that I'd have some success gaining some sort of internship related to sports in Canada? 

-How difficult is it for Americans to get into a decent school in Canada? My current college GPA will likely hold me back but I did very well on all my exams in high school and had good enough grades there. 

-Assuming you guys think this might be an idea worth pursuing for me, what are some solid schools for me to look into for journalism that preferably aren't in the middle of nowhere (I guess that eliminates all of Saskatchewan, right)?

Feel free to call me out on any stereotypes or unrealistic claims or thoughts I have written. I'm just in a bit of a funk right now and I feel like a change of scenery might do me good. Thanks for your comments."

ta2wx,4,2012-05-06,Why can't it be my choice to live or not to live?,Finallythrowaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ta2wx/why_cant_it_be_my_choice_to_live_or_not_to_live/,"Okay so finally I'm saying something, despite having ups and downs, helping people on this subreddit and suicidewatch. I feel like I have to say this in order to try and get some insight in responses from you all. I'm a twenty something male and I fear that even at this stage in life I have nothing more to give.

I've been depressed at some level since childhood, I remember telling teachers that I never wanted to participate in anything (games with others, clubs, sports) because when I did it never seemed worth it. I was almost forced to be on the debate team in high school because a teacher ""saw such potential in me"" but I refused. I just never found any of it worth the effort. People my own age disgusted me, I could not stand to be with them in class let alone in something else. I felt very isolated most of the time because of this.

During high school I became a nervous wreck, I trusted no one and I felt like I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind and becoming a zombie.  I was so spastic during my senior year that classmates asked to have me removed from class. A counselor talked to me and then I went home. I was constantly afraid, the anxiety never stopped and it made life hell.

I never believed what anyone said about ""Be confident. Believe in yourself."" It felted canned, cliche and superficial. Even there was something redeeming about me in an objective reality, what good was it if I could not believe it?

One college later, now finishing my 4-year degree after a simple AA I still have no reason to believe in myself or my future. Life just seems like a trial where people just add expectations and demands onto your shoulders and expect you to go through it. I know that is a terrible way to see things but I don't have anything else. The anxiety never got better despite professors liking me even while getting mediocre grades because I just never saw the big picture in it.

I've had a few short lived relationships with women, but I could never really get close to them and eventually they figured it out how distant I was and left. I never wanted to go out with them, or do anything on most days because I felt trapped in my apartment.

Long story short I'm not going to debt over college, but I feel no drive to do anything anymore. A semester just ended, an internship is going well, but I am completely without any motivation or future picture of my own life. People wanted me to have big dreams and do big things. But I feel like I am living an elaborate lie because I want no part in the way people see me or what I could offer the world.

I think I don't have anything for them, to meet their expectations, be a productive member of society. I've seen counselors who suggested medication, I want no part in that either, you do not alter your brain chemistry without some long term side effects. A counselor I've been seeing for a while now put the idea of graduate school on the table, I almost told him to go fuck himself despite the helpful advice he has given me over a very difficult time in my life. 

I feel completely alone, I never leave my apartment. I hate this city and I feel trapped in here, staring at the walls doing nothing. I have no friends and no desire for much of anything anymore. 

I tried to kill myself last year after losing a place to live (long story) and I realized that was really overreacting to what it was. Why did my brain tell me to kill myself when the next day I called, moved out and found a new place to live?

One year later I still feel like I'm just slogging through life with no real goals or ambition. This world is a cold and unfair place, nobody ever said otherwise, but I've never seen the light at the end of the tunnel. I can't even exert the effort to get out my apartment and try and enjoy myself, it just feels hollow.

I just dont understand what compels people to keep living. At one point in life I thought I knew, but I am so anxious and confused all the time any joy or concrete reasons have lost all meaning.

I know I ranted, left out some details and skipped over somethings but I am really tired. Please help me answer that question. Maybe there is some motivation after all, but I don't know how to reach it. Maybe I am just a narcissistic, lazy whelp and I deserve to suffer my entire life because my cowardly indecisive ways...

**TL;DR Felt out of place my whole life, no aspirations or motivation. Very detached from other people. Nervous wreck that effects every part of my life. Why should I keep on living?**"
ta2tw,8,2012-05-06,Living in Paris (yay!) means more time until reuniting with my SO (no!),jwalkins,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ta2tw/living_in_paris_yay_means_more_time_until/,"Hey LongDistance! I'd like to be excited/vent to you all if you don't mind.

I'm studying abroad right now in Switzerland studying French and it's amazing. I'm very happy and I'm learning tons, but obviously I'm not super thrilled that my SO is back in the United States. I was supposed to come home after my finals in June, but then a series of events happened:

1. My internship supervisor offering that I could continue my internship this summer in Paris.
2. Me mentioning it to my SO and him responding that he would totally come to Paris for the summer if I got it.
3. Me deciding to apply for funding for my school and ask my boss if I could actually take her up on the offer.
4. My SO finding out he needs to work extra hours this summer to be able to make ends meet so he can't come to Paris.
5. Me receiving enough funding from my school to be able to stay, and getting an official offer for the internship.
6. Me deciding to pay for my SO to come visit in May, only for his work schedule to not allow it.

So now I will be working in Paris for 6 weeks this summer (yay!) but that postpones when I get to see my SO from the original June 15th-ish to July 25 (aw). I'm so excited for my opportunity as an individual but I feel absolutely awful as a girlfriend. I thought that we were halfway there in March or so and now I realize we're just at the halfway point because I'm staying longer. I wouldn't give up this opportunity but I hate having to postpone when I'll see my SO (though I was able to book an earlier flight home than I thought I would by about 5 days). How do you guys reconcile individual triumphs with relationship downfalls? Anyone else in the same situation?

tl;dr: Amazing opportunity to work in Paris this summer after my study abroad experience but that means I don't see my SO until far later than planned. Any advice?"

Is it stupid?",[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t9u0q/sub_3000_lexus_ls_400_or_acura_for_a_college_kid/,"So my brother is in college and has about 3K set aside for car. He needs a car to drive to work (intern). What does /r/cars recomend?

Most people seem to suggest sticking to 1993-97 Accords, Camrys, Civics and Sentras (all available for about $2.5K with ~200K on the odo). However all our internetfu shows that LS400's, ES300's, SC300's and Acuras TL's, Legends with ~200K on the odo are all available for ~$500 more than the Camrys and Corollas.

Does anyone have any experience with these Luxobarges and what it might cost in terms of repairs. Is this financial suicide for a college kid?

Our reasonsing is this the Lexii, Acuras seem to be built to last longer than the Civics and Corollas and while buying a 200K mi car it might make more sense to buy one of those as your chances of things breaking down is lower. Are we just being silly?

Any inputs from people who've worked on and/or owned Lexii and Acuras would be especially beneficial.

t9cqs,6,2012-05-06,"[w4m] 19f, get lunch in Jersey City?",[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/t9cqs/w4m_19f_get_lunch_in_jersey_city/,"Hi! So, I actually live in central NJ, but I've acquired an internship (software engineering) this summer in Jersey City. Thus, I'll be spending 40 hours a week there. Starting this Monday. Scary.

For this summer's forecast, all signs point to lonely. I'd love to meet someone in the area who'd want to get lunch with me on my break or maybe dinner after I get off, sometime two weeks-ish from now. My treat! Y'know, as long as it's something not too expensive that is...all depends on whether I've received my first paycheck or not...

If you were in the Jersey City area AND also in the comp sci/engineering field it would be even better! Because I'm a bit nervous and would love someone in the field to freak out about everything to.  BETTER YET, if you also commuted there from central NJ... But now I'm getting carried away.

I'm posting this about two weeks early so we can become familiar with each other at least a little, prior to meeting in person.

Anywho, if you are of an age less than 25 (I suppose?) and greater than 18, will be in the Jersey City area and are interested, PM me! We can exchange foe-toes and all that.

I'm probably going to sleep upon submitting this, so I won't be responding until the morning. Please don't give up on me when I don't respond immediately!"

t99uw,1,2012-05-05,"Young 20's couple: she was once caring and loving, now cold and emotionally neglectful.  I need some advice for this 4 year relationship.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/t99uw/young_20s_couple_she_was_once_caring_and_loving/,"I’ve been having much trouble with my girlfriend for the past two months and it’s really beginning to crush my emotional side.  I apologize in advance if this is slightly incoherent or long as I’m not in a very good place right now.  We are straight, in our early 20's, and have been together just under 4 years.

For some background: we met freshman year in college and hit it off splendidly.  We were each other’s firsts but she had some emotional baggage from a previous boyfriend.  I spent much of this time attempting to mitigate what he had done to her and tried to restore anything in her that was broken.   Later in our first year together we had both developed an alcohol problem and during one particular drunken night I cheated on her.  I have since been forgiven and certainly had to pay the price for what I did.   

We spent the next 2 years extremely close to each other and truly developed as partners/best friends/lovers.  There was a rough patch during one summer (we’d visit each other every two weeks or so when we weren’t at school)  where I became emotionally neglectful due to a few heavy lies regarding her past that she had told me.  We made up in a very cathartic outpouring of emotion.  

Everything was well for the next year, aside from normal, little fights and what not; typical of any relationship.  Fast forward to this past January: she had been complaining about me not being romantic enough despite everything else being seemingly normal.  I have to be honest in that I cannot justify or conjure some bullshit excuse as to why I wasn’t being romantic enough.  I wasn’t there for her in that way to the extent that she needed.  That being said, there was still romance in our relationship, just not enough.  I may have been becoming bored of her and the relationship.

Up until this point she had been for the most part wonderful; a joy to be with.  Extremely caring, selfless, and possessed what appeared to be a bottomless well of unconditional love.  But one weekend she “snapped” and couldn’t handle me anymore, leaving me for what seemed like the first weekend apart in years (we did regard each other as best friends after all) and in my drunken state of idiocy  I repeatedly called her and said some generally fucked up things.  This happened twice and another time or two in a much more mild manner.  Very bad move on my part.  I was being overbearing but my motive was to prevent this girl that I love, who had become such a large part of my life, fade from me.  Yet in doing so I had pushed her farther away.

We’ve had a few good times since then but it’s not the same.  That warm, radiating love energy is gone from her.  I’ve been trying my hardest to be as loving as possible but it’s certainly difficult when it’s not reciprocated.    Now I’ll be leaving college in a few days to go home for the summer but she on the other hand she will be interning somewhere across the country for 3 months, by far the longest we’ve been separated.  Today I was very upset with her for working an extra shift (a little part time job that is easy to call out of) as we only have this one weekend left with each other, but she insisted and I became a bit hysterical with crying as I realized that she’ll truly be leaving shortly.  The fact that she chose working this extra shift instead of being with me hurt greatly and she’ll be doing the same tomorrow.  The worst part is she is now out with her friends after I told her I really need to be with her after work, as she did the night before. 

I’ve called her and explained how this is crushing and emotionally neglectful to me as I’ve been reduced to a crying mess, which isn’t who I am!  But she just responds with anger and frustration at how I’m making her feel bad about herself.  I’ve tried to give her space but now there’s no more space to give and I’m really heartbroken that it’s becoming ever more apparent how likely it is that we will break up during her internship.  Realizing how fragile or ephemeral our relationship is makes me appreciate how great everything was in the past.  But she won’t cut me any slack.  She simply doesn’t seem to care for me or love me anymore.  It’s horribly depressing and has induced multiple panic attacks.  I know I’ve been far from perfect but I feel so worthless right now falling from whom she cared for most to something that’s so easily marginalized.  It’s as if my emotions mean nothing to her.

I ask of you reddit:  what is a guy to do?  

**TL;DR**  Girlfriend of 4 years was once loving, now doesn't seem to care about me and neglects me when I pour my heart out to her.  I feel like the relationship is falling apart and it's making me feel worthless.  She's about to leave for a few months which makes everything feel more urgent.

t93m5,14,2012-05-05,feeling really lost in life,sighfeelinghopeless,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/t93m5/feeling_really_lost_in_life/,"This is probably more of a rant, but if anyone does read, any advice would be greatly appreciated. This is the most lost I've ever felt in my life, but I do realize its not a hopeless situation and that all my problems are just first world yet I still can't bring myself to turn it around. I've always been a hardworking student who got good grades. I got a full scholarship studying engineering at a selective school and graduated with a good GPA with work experience and extracurricular activities. I was one of those students who had to work really hard for the grades, but managed to do very well. 

My motivation I believe stemmed from genuine belief that all of this would be paid off with a great job and a bright future. However, during my senior year, I realized I wasn't crazy about the entry level jobs I was looking at and decided to go the higher education route. I decided to do a Master's degree as the years getting a PhD seemed far too many. I didn't want to be too far distance wise from my grandparents as I am their primary caretaker and ended up attending a very expensive yet mediocre school for engineering, and what I believe to be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. 

Midway through taking classes that were barely beneficial, I interned for a company for several months to buy some time to figure out what I want to do with my life. This began my downfall. When I still didn't do anything to further my career towards the end of my internship (I don't want to return to the same company due to how far it is from home), I decided to return to school and give it another chance. Once again, every class seemed worthless and too expensive, and so I dropped all but one and figured I'll look for a job with the free time. After three failed interviews, one with a really great company that I had high hopes for, I came to a complete stop in my job search and just haven't brought myself to apply for one in months. I started to wonder if engineering was even for me, starting to doubt if I even chose the right career path for my natural abilities as it never did seem to come easily to me. I instead started using all of my free time (and as I realize what a joke this one class was, barely any time for homework) trying to learn other skills and make side money for rent and food. 

I'm at the end of the semester, and I haven't submitted my only project (days late) from what seems to be complete apathy for my Master's degree as I believe it's best to drop out since I'll need another 20k to finish. Yet I realize that I really need to get a full time job to get by and my side online job is not going to sustain me. However, I have literally spent the last few days doing absolutely nothing for my project or my job search, and have just curled up in front of the internet trying to do everything else to take my mind away from reality and starting to believe that I've just become truly truly lazy. Over these few months, I have stopped talking to people in my life, not even reading messages that I get because I don't want to face anyone I knew in my past and have them learn how pathetic I've become. I cry every night feeling absolutely sick to my stomach that I'm this way yet can't bring myself to change it. I don't know how this all happened, how I became so useless and apathetic when just two years ago I would go out of my way to get that 100 percent on my HW/exam grade. 

I want to start supporting my mom who's been diagnosed with depression for the past year and decided not to work anymore and provide a steady supply of money to my grandparents, but I'm so afraid of another rejection. I'm not even sure where to even begin my job search especially now as a Master's degree dropout (what would I put on my resume?). I can't for the life of me get my shit together and finish my project and just stop acting like a truly worthless human being. I know it's something I just have to do, and as much as I believe this, I just don't. I feel so helpless and unmotivated and angry at myself. I feel like I screwed up everything and that all my hard work in the past was for nothing. I haven't spoken to anyone in days apart from my family, and truly wish I can wither away. I hate what I've become and have changed for the worse.

This isn't the me that I imagined as a hopeful eager freshman so many years ago. I see everyone else around me (even those who barely worked in college) with full time jobs or completing their grad degree, excelling in life and wonder where I've gone wrong. I know any sane person should be able to get out of this situation alright, but why do I feel so weak? I have all the resources in front of me and healthy as a horse. I'm almost 24 and feel like I'm as mature as a 12 year old. How can I be so weak as an adult when I should have all my shit figured out by now, and be able to stand on my own two feet. Back in college, I always challenged myself and reached for goals, now I feel like I do everything possible to just be safe and not fail. I no longer have any confidence in my abilities because I have just failed so many times and only want to get by unnoticed in life. I really needed to just write all this down. I'll be damn surprised if someone actually reads this, but anyone gone through something similar?  "

tawf1,76,2012-05-07,CHILDHOOD RUINED...,jennafoo33,Scary,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scary/comments/tawf1/childhood_ruined/,"I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it. 
Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.
 Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""Rock-a-bye-Bivalve"" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Squidward's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.
One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off. 
While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.
 
The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest. 
The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality. 
Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. 
The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. 
The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. 
The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. 
The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed. 
About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams. 
Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames. 
The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink. 
The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.
Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.
 
The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does."

Every now and then, someone will delete their account noting how Reddit is their primary source of procrastination. I know how hard it is to delete your accounts and never come back, but something that's even harder (but to me, more rewarding), is making an account that only has access to a specific set of subreddits.

I decided that I had had enough of opening a picture of Reddit, laughing, and moving on to the next. I had had enough of reading story after story of someone else's great quests when I could've been out making my own. I endeavored to quit Reddit for good, but then I remembered that this site has also been an excellent source of info.

So I created this account. Through my hard work I will be beginning a very selective internship in the business-field soon, so I am only subscribed to the primary business and economics related subreddits, /r/fitness, and of course, /r/getmotivated. It was hard to quit totally, I initially left /r/askreddit in and also subscribed to /r/nba thinking I was allowed one time-waster, but really I just spent most of my time there.

I urge you to try it. Reddit is what you make of it. It can easily be a tool of procrastination and wasted-time but can also be a great asset in increasing productivity and obtaining knowledge.

I am currently in a long distance relationship. I see my boyfriend every 3 or 4 months or so, and usually for only a week to two weeks at a time. Because of the fact that I only have sex a couple weeks every 1/3 or 1/4 of a year and because of the cost, I (up until now) haven't seen it worth it to be on a continuous round of birth control pills. Thus, we rely on condoms. 

Also, I have an irregular period and I don't really keep track of them (again, because I don't have sex often and thus most of the time I don't really need to keep track. Realizing now that this is a bad idea). I keep trying to figure out when my last period was ... I know that I wasn't on my period by the time I went to see my boyfriend, which was on April 7th. Thus it must have started at least a week before that, but probably even before that. 

SO. I haven't had my period in probably at least 36 days, most likely more. The last time I had sex was two weeks ago, almost exactly. We used a condom every. single. time, and we weren't aware of any ripping. I took a pregnancy test today and it was negative. This doesn't really make me feel TOO much better, considering my period is still M.I.A 

But here's where it gets really bad. In one week I am partaking in a rural internship for my education degree and I will be spending 4 weeks in an EXTREMELY rural location (no doctor) and there is nowhere in the entire province for me to get an abortion. I already know that if i am pregnant that I will get an abortion and I feel relatively fine about it, but I really don't think I am going to be able to survive for 4 weeks in this rural place knowing that i'm pregnant and not being able to do anything about it. I think i'll turn into a lump that can't get out of bed. 

I need suggestions, or help, or just kind words, or something. I am really freaking out here. "

I am a graduate student who will be moving to Houston this summer for the first time (having never been there) and am looking for a place to stay (June/July - and some of August if possible). I have been checking craigslist regularly but there are no responses to the ads, the places either disappear too quickly or are with a roommate or too expensive. 

I am looking for a 1br/1bath somewhere near Rice University/Galleria so that I can easily commute to my work but would also be willing to stay somewhere slightly further if the situation was good and the price was reasonable. I do not know anything about the Montrose neighborhood but most people have told me to stay away :| 

Anyway, I am a SAP who plans to be working long hours archiving information, spend limited time at home browsing the internet and watching TV/movies, I am very quiet and clean and do not go out much. 

I am looking for something between the price range of 500-800 (depending on what utilities are available) but really need to keep a budget because I am going to be dipping into my savings since the internship is unpaid. 

Does anyone know of anyone that would be willing to help me out or can help me find a place that meets my needs?

I'm sure the majority of people will be wearing T-Shirts and jeans (especially my fellow interns), but I want to make an impression and dress my age.  I'm mid-20's, older than my peers, and married - for some reason this makes me want to dress up more. Not to mention I'm trying to turn this into a full time position.  Some other possibly important things: I'm 5'6"", slim but not skinny, wide/broad shoulders.

I've been reading around, and here are my thoughts so far:

* Dark, fitting jeans (Levi 511/514 seem to fit me well)
* Khaki pants 
* Blucher shoes or boat shoes (I prefer brown leather)
* Lots and lots of business button-up casual shirts (whites, blues, subtle patterns)
* A light cotton blazer (summer time, but I think I look good in jackets)

The main predicament I have is, will I stand out too much? Is there something I can do that will make me more dressed-down without being sloppy?  I have tons of nerdy graphic tees, and I have no idea what to do with them.

I'm on a student budget, but I'm willing to push it to the limit.

Thanks for the advise, MFA!

How do you dress well in a casual work environment?"

About a week and a half ago, I lost my job at a restaurant in Va Beach. I've made peace with the fact, especially since I had asked them to move me to the Norfolk location over a year ago; I live here in Norfolk.

I've applied to several restaurants, even computer tech jobs. I've not heard anything back.

My availability is wide open until mid-late August, which is when I will be enrolled in classes at ODU. Therefore, I've declined some FT positions because I believe in not wasting anyone's time in case my classes can not work around a FT schedule come this fall.

The majority of my experience is in waiting tables. 
I have about a year's worth of experience of administrative work.

Am doing my internship here, but have to say the internet connection has been fairly dissapointing so far. I'm currently using a dongle but in my condo its rather hard to get a decent connection.

Am looking for a place where I can go with my laptop (dont want to use their pc, prefer mine) and play some videogames or just browse the web at a good speed. Any of you have any recommendations for me? Preferably some websites which I can check out!

For your information I'm staying in a condo in Mont Kiara, so anything close to there or in KLCC/bukit bintang/etc would be awesome!

Thanks for the help!"

Screwed up a friendship, that was dear too me, because i decided that telling that girl i'd love her would be better than just stayin friends and enjoing her company (we know that this always works out, right?). 

I'm studying engineering combined with economics, and i fuckin hate the economics part, but i don't want to quit, because i also got a internship at a good firm here in germany, even thou i'm mostly used as an it guy, because of my it affinity. But i also regret doing this, because by choosing to take the intership, i had to go to study at a university, thats not respect anywhere in germany.

And there are a lot of decisions i totally regret, many are women-related, for example, there is this one girl, which went to school with me, and she was inviting me to her place to ""play videogames"" or ""watch star wars"" and being the socially akward penguine i am, i didn't know how to react.

I know, that my life isn't carved out yet and i'm still very young, but i just wanted to get that off my chest, to start turning my life around. Thanks for reading this."
tcaah,22,2012-05-07,Boyfriend and I moved to the big city together. Now I'm suddenly left behind.,Down_A_Peg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tcaah/boyfriend_and_i_moved_to_the_big_city_together/,"Been a lurker for some time now. I was hesitant on posting to Reddit for advice, but I've hit a brick wall and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice is welcome and much appreciated. I understand I'm about to post a wall of text, but even just one person's advice is enough for me.


My boyfriend (23/M) and I (22/F) have been together for about two years. Everything was great. We met in Ohio where we are originally from. We both had ambitions of moving to Chicago at some point, so we decided to do it back in February. It was a little sooner than expected, but eagerness reached the best of both of us.


Fast forward to the present. We moved into a tiny one-bedroom apartment together, and we work the same job in a small business for a friend. It's been about two months since this has went on. We see each other 24/7, and we started bickering back and forth about stupid things. I assume this has to do with the fact that we get no privacy anymore. We have lived together previously, but we worked different jobs and separate hours. After another pointless argument one day, the tension grows, and he ends the relationship. Just like that. I tried to rationally talk some sense into him but nothing I said worked. It was like talking to a wall.


It's been about three weeks since this has happened. We still see each other at work, but I've been temporarily living with a new friend. All of our Chicago friends are mutual as well, so there have been occasions where we'd both be invited somewhere, and both attend. A lot of times he would treat me normally and do his harmless flirting, but I eventually told him I couldn't handle that if he doesn't want us to work. 


After a few long conversations here and there, I found out the reason he left me is because he wants his ""me"" time, and that I don't inspire him.. He also admitted the other day that he's afraid of commitment and is running away. This I knew. What bothers me most is the fact that I don't inspire him. Is this fair to me? He just obtained his Bachelor's Degree in game design, and is working an internship with a game company. I'm very proud of him. On the other hand, I'm still in college, debating over what I truly want to major in. I'm not terribly far behind, I just started my college education later than most people. I'm a step away from my Associate's Degree. It's not exactly where I'd like to be. I'd like to be further, but there's nothing I can do about that right now except take classes at a normal pace. He moves at a very fast pace and needs to be constantly succeeding, which isn't a bad thing. However, I don't move as quickly as he. I do have plenty of hobbies. I know I'm not boring. I enjoy making costumes, playing video games, exercising, and I'm taking up calligraphy. My job requires traveling around the country to sell at conventions and I love it. I ride horses but I haven't been able to lately due to the time and money it takes to commit to it. I have a good head on my shoulders, and I'm very understanding and down to earth.


Another problem is that he's been chatting with a girl via texts. They met back in January, and their level of talking has increased after we moved together. Luckily she lives quite a ways away. He told me that her work inspires him. She's a talented artist. That's great; whatever. She has feelings for him, but he's told me and his other friends that he friend-zoned her multiple times. Should I believe this? I may be over-analyzing. He's not the type of person to talk to two girls at once. Then again, his mind has been kind of a mess after all of this.


He told me the other day he wants to work things out with me, to take things slowly and build back up to where we were. Instead of immediately jumping for joy, I asked him if he was sure about this. He didn't respond for a bit, and eventually said he isn't ready. Now we're (kind of) back to square one. I want to wait for him, but at the same time I don't because it's much more painful than I expected it to be. I love him. He says he loves me and has never loved anyone this way. He tells me time and time again I'm basically perfect, even after he has left me. 


Apologies for all the text. If someone could help me out, I would love to listen. Is there any hope for this relationship? I want to give him his space, and I am. He just needs to understand that I won't be waiting here forever; it just hurts too much and this isn't easy. Am I expecting things to change too quickly? Time just seems a lot slower while dealing with all of this. I don't like being in this city without him. Don't get me wrong, this city is amazing. I'm just kind of lost in it right now. It damn near killed me when he said I don't inspire him. How can I inspire him? Is he just being stupid and having trouble dealing with his stress? Or am I expecting too much too soon?



**TL;DR** Moved to Chicago with the boyfriend. Suddenly he left me due to stress, wanting to be alone, and lack of inspiration. Yet he still says he loves me dearly and just needs time. Do I wait for him? Or do I think about myself and move on? I'd rather not move on. Not yet.

tfb5d,9,2012-05-09,A bit of advice starting an SEO digital marketing internship and the first week is not what I expected....,thrillho111,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tfb5d/a_bit_of_advice_starting_an_seo_digital_marketing/,"So after graduating from university and taking care of an ill family member for most of the last year, I am finally starting an internship at an SEO company that helps small businesses get an online presence and increase their traffic. I have been really excited as I have had some experience using social media as an administrator for a university society, and in my free time use it to discuss pro-wrestling and other entertainment (I would like to think I use it more and a larger set of social media networks than the average person). I also managed to write a bit about the topic for a paper while studying. Anyway, while looking after this family member and having a previous bad experience in my first job of publishing, I decided to try and make this a career and do something that has given me a lot of pleasure in my leisure time. 

So I started the internship last week. I've been slowly learning basics on my own up to now, reading Google's guide on SEO, listening to several podcasts (though I still have a lot to get through) etc. I still have things to learn, such as basic computer tech stuff like HTML but I'm getting their slowly as I can see it is quite a bit essential especially when looking at websites and advising what can be changed (I'm able to pick up things from just appearance at the moment). I studied English and Media, so I do not have a computing background (so any advice on things to read or look at to get me up to speed at a level that is at least satisfactory would be of much help). 

Anyway, in my first few days I was a bit alarmed that my boss was asking me to edit fake FB profiles to change a previous student to appear as a mature woman for the purposes of spamming. I have also been asked to use WordPress to edit a site about cash loans, which have a lot of anchor text links to cash loan providers within the articles and for tags. My boss also has a Twitter account under a different name and admitted that one of her clients thinks this is her real name. From my brief reading and basic common sense, I can tell that this isn't right and I understand that it is a slow and steady process to get results for anyone in SEO and social media.

My boss seems a bit flighty and while planning a wedding, is also taking on a few other additional projects. There are quite a lot of things that she said she intends to go through with me and she has begun doing that (like using Squidoo and Hubpages). My boss has also said she will go through Google services like Adwords and Adsense though I have done my own reading into this to prepare.

The internship goes on till the end of July so I'm confident that I still have ages to learn new things and it HAS only been the first week and a bit. I'm not getting coffee or doing many of the usual remedial tasks that an internship usually consists of, which is a plus. It is also only 4 days a week so I'm picking up some part-time work on the side.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I think partly to ask for advice or ask if there is something I should watch out for. Has anyone else had previous bad experience within companies who are not exactly using White Hat strategies or are kosher? Also is there anything I ought to be reading/listening to as far as starting out and keeping updated in the world of SEO and social media? I already listening to SEO 101 and SEO Advisor while I work so I am making the most of my day. I've already made up my mind that, once I get involved in actual projects for the company, that if I am asked to do something Black Hat or something that makes me feel uncomfortable, I'll make it known that I do as I don't want to be pressured into doing something that will come back to me and I'll be blamed for.

Anything I should be listening to/reading?
Anything to cover the detailed techy stuff such as HTML to get me to an OK level.
Should I be worried or is this just another case of starting out in an industry and ""paying dues""?
Anything I should watch out for?
Am I asking the right questions or is there anything I've missed?

This post is a bit all over the place I know; I guess I just have quite a bit on my mind at the moment.
Thanks in advance

UPDATE: Just a quick note to say thanks to everyone who replied or commented, and more so if you also provided recommendations for things to listen to or read. It was really helpful to listen to your own experiences. I actually had a really good day today, and I'm looking on the bright side that I have 10 weeks left and lots to learn whether through my boss or individually. I think when I created this I was having a rough day and needed a vent, and you've all responded very kindly. I'm in no means a bad situation compared to some things that are posted on Reddit daily so all is good. I'm actually going to return to a WordPress site I created in February on pro-wrestling (I'm a big fan) and use what I'm learning as I go along and apply it there, which is a pursuit which will seem actually feel fun and be productive. Again, thanks and I enjoy prowling r/SEO whenever I can :)"

I work for a Houston-based electrical company looking for good ME’s and EE’s. I thought we had our summer internship spots locked-down already, and then we had a student take a job somewhere else. That's left us scrambling to fill an open req. At this point I feel we’ll probably have better luck with local students. We’ve already got one UH student starting next week, and there are several other UH students working in internships or part-time positions here.

Requirements:

1)Enrolled at an accredited 4yr university majoring in an engineering discipline. Preferably ME or EE.

2)2.5GPA or better

3)Ability to legally work in the US.

4) CAD and Drafting Experience

This job is mostly CAD-based in nature, and will require spending the majority of your day at a PC. Applicants should enjoy that kind of work. Our ideal candidate is an ME who has good 3D CAD and drafting experience, but we will gladly accept the right EE. If a local candidate works out for us over the summer, we would like to be able to continue your employment 10-15hrs a week during the school year. 

Due to the nature of Reddit and the wide variety of stupidity that can be found in other sub-reddits I’ve registered a throw-away handle and would prefer not to post too much about myself or my company. If you’re interested PM me and I’ll get back to you with contact info and how to apply. Any other questions, post away here.

I'm a to be junior in college majoring in Computer Science. I'm an active member in our campus' Epic Movement, which is the Asian American focused branch of Campus Crusade for Christ (now known as Cru). I have had many opportunities this past year when I was looking for what my summer plans were, I was given the opportunity to work at an internship, work at a [Bible Camp](http://www.camprivercrest.org), and I was accepted to the Summer Project. All of these opportunities seemed awesome to me, and it was so difficult to choose, my parents wanted me to do something where I would make money. The day before I was supposed to tell all the supervisors what I had decided, I was almost certain I was going to choose the Bible Camp.

That night, I started feeling really uneasy and didn't feel right about Camp, so I started talking to some friends about it, and ended up feeling like I was called to [San Francisco](http://gosummerproject.com/projects/424). I've been on the road of support for some time now, and I would like to share my [support letter](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/73556255/support%20letter.doc) with everyone. In my support letter, it explains the cost of the project and what we'll be doing in San Francisco. The cost in the letter says $4400, but the cost has very recently been lowered to $4000 (Praise God!).

My support raising has been tough, as until now I have been fairly passive about it, but I now understand how active I need to be for this. So why am I making this post? I want to ask Reddit for support, I need help in this, it's humbling to be here asking people I don't know for prayer and finances. 

If anyone would like to support me, you can mail me a check (address in the support letter) or send by PayPal at beeyee2010@yahoo.com. I'm very new to PayPal, so check would be the better option overall, as I don't really know what I'm doing with PayPal yet. I have seen some of those donation websites that some people use, if anyone thinks I should use one of those, let me know. To those who want to keep updated on how everything is going, I keep a [blog](http://beeyeesanfran2012.tumblr.com/) and update it fairly frequently. Feel free to contact me by PM or by email at beeyee2010@yahoo.com or beeyee0401@gmail.com.

I come to you today at the end of my rope.  I truly have no idea where to go from here.  I know what my issues are (at least I believe I do) and I need guidance from the community that the FAQ was not able to answer for me, at least in the detail I require.

First and foremost!  Basic information to help you figure me out:

-Male

-20 Years old

-173 Pounds

-6’1”

-Very limited weight lifting experience (less than a year)

-I do NOT have access to a bar that is NOT attached to a smith machine (the only gym in my area only has smith machines, and I am trying very actively to find one (a bar) for purchase, but for all intents and purposes I do not have access to the equipment necessary for Starting Strength, which I’ve most identified with)

-I have a fun little condition in which cardio causes me to erupt in painful, extremely itchy hives, and I’ve recently started taking Claritin in hopes it alleviates the wretched itchiness.  

My Goals:
Well, I have a myriad of health issues, and in attempts to prolong my life, I really, REALLY want to get in better shape than I am now.  However, it is at this junction I have been graced with an opportunity to surprise my SO.
She has currently gone away on an engineering internship in Maryland, and that leaves me 3 months all by my lonesome.  Well, as something I need to do- and because I love the gratification of lustful eyes- I have about 3 months to do as much as I can to revamp my body, with a primary focus on aesthetics, so that on my SO’s return, I can surprise her with a healthier, more attractive, version of myself.

Yes it is a bit silly to want to do this for that reason, but I’m a silly 20 year old male, and I’m asking for help.

Here are my questions:

1)	Should my main focus be weight lifting in conjunction with say, running, to lose as much body fat as possible to have the “cut” look? Or because I have such little weight lifting experience and an undefined musculature, if I cut the fat away would I just look like a tendon-y, skeletal monster?

2)	Should I just lift as heavy as I can and eat a metric-shit ton of food to gain as much muscle as I can and say to hell with cutting?  Go big or Go home?  If that’s the case and I can’t do SS as it is intended due to equipment restrictions, what program would you recommend?
 
3)	Perhaps it is a mix of both worlds?  Should I weight lift and eat big on my work out days, off days cardio and eat at maintenance?  Or something else?  Am I missing something obvious? 

4)	What would you have me do?  I have the will to succeed, strong discipline, and a time line.  

The Male inside me wants to say Strength is the priority.  The Boyfriend inside of me wants to say that Looks is the goal.  The ""I don't want to die at 40"" inside of me says ""whatever is best for my health, I'll do"".


I appreciate your time and consideration.

I'm a 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 20. We're both going to school and I'm currently doing an internship so I've got work all day. She is free all day, since she's done with school for the summer. We've been going out for around 2.5 years now and everything's been perfect, and it still really is (in my mind). We basically live together and we know each others schedules fairly well.

She went out with this guy back when she was like 15 or so, and broke up with him a month later. They're still in contact every once and a while, and he's ""never gotten over her."" She is ""over him"" and ""thinks he's absolutely gross"" and ""he's so weird"" yet she keeps talking to him. Even to this day, this guy confesses his feelings to her all of the time, and even asks her friends about her and if she ever talks about him, or if she has feelings back, how much he likes her, etc.

This guy will call/text my girlfriend constantly. She has no issue and isn't really hiding anything, but doesn't really tell me much either. This guy knows all this stuff about her, so I'm sure they talk a good amount... I don't want to be a nosy asshole so I don't really ask, but it's been on my mind recently. 

I don't really want to overreact, I just need someone else's opinion. She claims this guy is just a friend, and I absolutely know she's not cheating on me... but I just have a feeling that she has feelings for this guy again. She hangs out with him once and a while (never alone together, usually just at parties that he invites her to and she goes with her friends). I brought up that I was worried in the past and she has said stuff like ""don't worry, we're just friends, why can't I have friends that are guys"" ... and all that sort of stuff. I respond that I don't mind that she has guy friends at all, but it's just a little weird that this one regularly confesses his feelings to her and is constantly bugging her. 

Even recently this weekend, this guy had a party with his friends and invited her, and she brought me along. She later texted him ""she was sorry"" and ""she shouldn't have done that to him.""

So reddit, what should I be feeling here? I am hurting and angry inside, but I don't know what to do. "

""Okay, here goes nothing Reddit. (This may be a long one.)
(I will first off admit I am a little drunk, so things may not be grammaticality correct, spelling, etc.)
I have been in a relationship with this girl for 3 year. We have live together for 2. We had two dogs and two cats. Basically, we were on track for marriage. We have previously moved two other times, and were about to prepare for our third (and at the time final) move. On a couple of days before our third move, we had a talk about our relationship after I got out of work (I generally work late nights as a intern). We've had this talk before about where our relationship is going before - while we had both discussed marriage before and wanting to go forward with it after I had finished college (she had graduated back in December, I had a year left). It basically came down to ""We needed to take a break.""
She left that night to a friends. From there on out, I went to live at my mothers. We had many conversations that week that were emotionally charged and involved lots of crying. After the move, we met for dinner and drinks). We were both incredibly happy to see each other, with much affection from both parties. Since the break, we both managed to stay in contact, not just because of the move, but because of the obvious. After the dinner, we made plans to see a movie and just hang out at the mall (a bizarre choice on behalf of the mall admittedly), but those previous two encounters were distant and awkward. We were both tired, I from stress and her from having to take care of all the animals (I am not capable of taking care of any of the animals due to having a maximum of animals at my Mothers). Yet, in many conversations before, she had stated being sad about us not being together. She had admitted that she was sad because it was ""almost like she had lost a friend"".
Yet, I was a lot off worse.
The reason for the break was because both of us had to deal with personal habits we needed to deal with. I am generally not neat, I don't eat well, I manage my finances piss poorly, and I intern for a company that is an amazing opportunity but bend ass over backwards for the in an attempt to get a job next seamster (or at least a paid internship as my current job pays nothing and gives no hours at all). She also needed to learn how to be independent of me, as she could not carry a conversation without even mentioning me.
Or course, since I didn't want to force her into anything I obliged.
Since the break, I have become increasingly depressed. I continue to use alcohol and food as a crutch. I am no longer happy anymore. She was the only thing that kept me happy apparently, despite having such great opportunities with work and college. I try to distract myself with work, but it only works when i'm there. I've gotten back into writing music, but once I hit writers block, all these thoughts come back. I skip class frequently. I lose sleep due to the stress.
The big problem is that she can't keep her decisions straight. A week into the break, she wants to end EVERYTHING. I haven't even made any of the changes she had suggested. Her reason behind this was due to be being drunk at the time of the phone call and not having moved anything out of our previous house. Days later, we had realized we had a miscommunication about everything - she knew I was going to a beer fest and we had not discussed a date when I would move everything out.
Our previous two outings together were very distant. She had wanted to go out just ""as friends"". I obliged, just so I could see her. Yet, it hurt for me not to get any affection from her.
I have seen her once time since, last week.
Since I have not been getting any sleep due to it, I was in a daze when I saw her (I had to get her money for final bills at our old place). She had noticed I was not right, and asked twice if I was. I, of course, played poker face and lied. ""I'm fine. I'm just tired.""
Co-workers and friends have even noticed my depression. They of course help, but I am the type of person that wants input from anyone that can give it, no matter their stance, position, or relation to me.
So, I think that's it Reddit. Questions are encouraged, along with inboxes. I love this community and would love some sort of help. I still do love this girl and have invested a ton into this relationship to end it.
Thank you.""

Since then, I had learned she has been dating other people, sleeping around, and cheated on me once during the midnight hour before the break. This originally did not help my mental and emotional health, but I created distactions (like finally releasing music onto the global marketplace like iTunes and Spotify!) that helped sometimes. After finishing writing music, or going out, or working; I would still come back to my thoughts and think about the situation. To combat this, I would still drink. And I wrote out a letter. I finished this letter maybe a week ago, but never had the courage to send it out. 

I finally sent it out. Here's what it said:

""Hi,

I would have mentioned this during our phone call today, but since you were driving I didn't want to bug you: I need to get a couple of things off my chest.

I really, really miss you. To the point where it hurts me quite a lot. I know you don't feel comfortable talking right now during this period and I understand that, but it's really hurting me a lot and I find it quite, how should I put this - unfair. I know we are on a break, but it's really taking a toll on me - emotionally and mentally.

I miss everything about what we had. 

Everything. I miss seeing you, the animals (as I mentioned earlier), hanging out with you - you name it, I could go on. And I know you miss me also. 

I would love it if I could see you sometime soon. If we can, then great - let's set up a time sometime soon.

If not, that's fine too as I can't do anything about it, but it doesn't make me all that pleased. I know we want to make this work out, but for the sake of not only my emotional and mental health, but yours also - we really need to sit down and talk. 

I know we can work on what needs to be worked on while starting to date again (I have been working on these things and will continue to work on them).

Thanks for taking the time to hear me out.""

I really don't know where to go with this. I know she's not going to respond immediately. I actually went on a ""date"" yesterday. It was friendly. She was nice. I am also interested in a good friend of mine. 

In conclusion - I am hung up on my ""ex"", but still preparing for the worst. 

If you made it this far, Reddit user, you are a upstanding human being. 

Thanks. "

Ever since last February when we had that AWESOME tech-connect put on my the wonderful women in Career Services, I've been submitting resumes and e-mails, making phone calls, and visiting in person local engineering firms hoping to garner favor with the Gods of job-placement and score an internship or co-op. No such luck!

Does anybody here have the hookup with any companies that can afford another intern this summer? It can't help to ask.

I've only interviewed at Gulf Power, and unfortunately for me they decided on another candidate. Oh well.

Hey, on the assumption that at least somebody else in here has been having the same difficulty as me - tell us your story, too. How hard have you tried? Misery loves company.

I'm off to go sabotage the WUWF radio towers until their engineer begs the station to let him have an intern. BRB.

I'm starting a new internship next Monday with a company I've worked with before, and they're starting a new dress code where every day is jean day. However, I don't really have ""nice"" jeans - the only pair I routinely wear have those fake worn spots that I don't think are appropriate for the work environment.

Does anyone live in the south/Georgia/Atlanta area and know where I can get nice, skinny (Express jeans are the only ones I've found to fit me so far, department store brands just won't cut it, I'm around a 28 waist/32 length/bootcut) jeans that would work in a professional environment?

Second question that I just thought of - what kind of shoes do you wear with jeans at work? I've been accustomed to dress shoes with dress slacks forever, but I think Converse are a bit too casual for work, even if it is jean day.

Thanks in advance for all the help! :)

Edit: Forgot budget - I'm looking for under $100 if at all possible, a good balance between value and style would be preferred. Definitely not el-cheapo Walmart-brand jeans, but also not $200 brand-name jeans. Keep in mind that I don't shop often and I'm not very brand-aware though, so I may be a bit flustered/overwhelmed if you start throwing out brand/store names. Please bear with me! :)"
tgri6,7,2012-05-10,Frontrange Colorado: Need assistance with paying a vet bill for my roommates German Shepherd pup.,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/tgri6/frontrange_colorado_need_assistance_with_paying_a/,"UPDATE:  You can donate by phone if you call CSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital (970) 297-1263, state that you are making a donation to a bill and reference Stella's case number 277748.  I am working on setting up the Chipin account as well.

Hello Reddit,

I am a veteran and currently unemployed along with my roommate (a vet I served with in Iraq). We have been able to make ends meet but since being out the Army it has been difficult for us dealing with PTSD on top of school and other stressors of everyday life. We have two dogs, both are German Shepherds. The older boy who is mine, named Stanley is ~9 months old and 70 lbs while Stella is his and is~7 months and 40 lbs.

Anyways, me and my roommate were cleaning our garage yesterday when we heard yelping and ran to Stella and saw her paw was completely floppy and we freaked out. I never felt so helpless because I knew we couldn't take her to emergency (did that once... $1500 for an overnight stay for a fever. My mom helped out on that.) because we don't have the funds. So we call around to the different Vet offices and decide to go the Vet Teaching Hospital where I live near.

So we go there and it turns out to be a 7 hour hospital visit. At first we were only talking to non-specialist Veterinarians who were ""ok"" with casting. I kept asking questions however and she went and got the orthopedic surgeon and he laid out our options. He said because the break is of small bones that a cast would be a far second to surgery because the success of those small bones setting back in place was a &lt;30% chance of success based on his experiences. This could lead to a gnarled paw and then we'd have to amputate since she would develop terrible life long arthritis. He said we could go with amputation since dogs do quite well on 3 legs according to them (this wouldn't set us back all the costs of casting.) So, eventually one of the interns mentions this grant program to do 80 hours of animal oriented community service in order to get $1100 dollars. Since I was there with my roommate and we both care a lot about our dogs they allowed both of us to get the grant giving us $2200 towards medical care. This wasn't policy but because we are both Veterans they gave it to us. This was wonderful news because it made Surgery an actual viable option (and in my mind the only option I'd want for her, we both said we'd rather give her up then do the lowest cost form of treatment).

So her initial Surgery (tomorrow) will put metal coils over the bones in order to keep them in line so they don't heal together in what the Dr. called a ""malunion"" but rather straight. He said because she is young it's a double edged sword since she will heal fast but if the bones heal wrong then obviously that's not good but if in place then a very high success rate. The Surgery estimates are $3200 low and $3500 high. Like I said we already have $2200 (for the x2 80 hours of community service due by September).

I hate asking for handouts, but I am struggling to take care of myself and although I understand what a burden taking care of Animals can be but they also make me and my roommate laugh and smile when sometimes we can't find one positive thing to smile about. It is what it is. We both love our dogs and I know he would do this for me in order to help my dog Stanley.

We have to pay in full by Friday but I should be able to open a line of credit to pay 6 months no interest... and then 27% interest rate. I am asking for donations from anyone that wants to help. I will work on scanning the estimates (for you to see) and uploading pictures of Stella and Stanley. If you are located in the Northern Colorado area and you own or work with anything that has do to with Animals (pets/livestock/wildlife) and need some free help please send me a message/post since I want to knock these hours out as quick as possible. The grant program is still in a trial run and I want to make sure I fulfill all my obligations to keep this program running for others who ever happen to fall in a situation like this. I will work on setting up a paypal account as well.

TL;DR: My big dog broke my battle buddy from Iraq's little dog paw with multiple fractures. The surgery to fix this costs $3200-3500. We have $2200 on credit right for an animal oriented community service grant. Also, if you work with Animals and need free help from two able bodied 20 somethings please let me know so I may fulfill my community service obligations.

If you think this is a fraud then I please ask to refrain from posting, however I will answer any and all questions within the context of the thread so please ask away. The more people that see this thread the better.

tglaw,8,2012-05-10,My story so far - a year in London,redshirt3,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/tglaw/my_story_so_far_a_year_in_london/,"Hi. 21 year old guy etc.

This may be a long one, so sorry. But it may help those who are new in discovering or exploring their bisexuality. Im open to questions aswell.

So ive been with women during college and first couple of years at university and loved it, i was a late bloomer anyway so that actually made it even more exciting. But starting from about 14/15 I had blips on my radar that i might like guys aswell but could never commit to it or work up the balls to try it out.

But starting in october last year I moved to London to do a year long internship as part of uni and thought id use the fresh start to explore seeing guys with the option of keeping it secret if i needed. I've said to myself that im going to use the time here to go for guys over girls, as i am very comfortable with my 'straight side' and can work on that anytime.

Just before I moved i started talking with this guy on OkCupid, he was cute but kinda a shy type like myself. I would take regular trips on the train (didnt live IN london just studied there) we would hang out and talk for hours in random places. It was around 3 weeks in that I worked up the balls to kiss him, and it was a strange experiance - my heart was thumping so loud and I was shaking and my brain was telling me this was a weird thing to be doing, simply because 21 years of habbit is hard to break not because I had doubts etc. Skipping to a couple weeks later, we rented a hotel room in this town work had sent me too for the week and basicly this is when I had my first same sex experiance.

It felt right and I wasnt uncomfortable at all, although when he got his **** out and i had to interact with that for the first time it was abit of a mindfuck, perhaps like driving a car for the first time, or trying to work a friends shower (lol). The next day I felt both relieved and also saw a boost to my ego. I had pushed through the barrier and was a new person for it. Skipping ahead alot later now, it was after this that me and my friend agreed that we didnt quite match up for a relationship but could be friends.

By this time I was flying up to scotland during the working week then back to LDN for friday nights and weekends. This limited my spare time to just friday or saturday nights really, so I once again turned back to OkCupid. I started talking to this hot &amp; interesting guy - filipino, attrctive, fun, freelancer and open minded. This was on the monday and by the weekend we already planned to meet (we'l call him 'J' for now). We talked for hours, had cocktails, went to bars etc. He revealed that he had an 'open' relationship with someone currently in the states which confused me a little, but all the same he came back with me and that first evening was amazing and I had no trouble doing things I was still cautios about etc.

For around the next couple of months he would normally spend an evening or two a week at mine and we would have sex and talk, and start to go out for meals etc but not in a commited way. But I started to develop feelings and get quite attached. This was a silly thing for me to do and advise others to not do as it began several months of hardship for me.

The so far distant boyfriend came to the UK for a week on his way through Europe and wanted to meet me as they were going to break up. I agreed as for a small while there was, perhaps, a glimmer of hope this could clear the path for me to maybe date 'J' in the future. The three of us were sat in this pub, and it was kinda weird. The bf was asking me questions about me and why I liked 'J' and how did i feel about the situation etc and I wasnt sure what to say.

After a strange series of events they came back with me to my place, I think they thought I was after a sort of threesome but I wasnt, but rolling with the dice had been the theme of my year so far, so I went with it, and we were in my bed. At one point I was making out with 'J' while the other guy jerked him off. But I got uncomfortable and asked for everything to stop, I think it was out of jealousy seeing them together. We all ended up talking for a few hours, mostly this other guy saying I wasnt good enough and even started comparing myself to him and using this as some sort of template for all my inadequacies. It was really a fucked up situation to be in.

After they broke up 'J' went through a period of emotional uncertainty and decided to focus more on his work. I hardly ever saw him and he was basicly ignoring me. I would spend most days feeling shitty and upset, like what most people would experiance after a break up, which shows how silly I was to get so attached. 
I did at one point meet up with another guy, cute, kinda a nerd, nice accent, we went out, accidently met up with a bunch of my friends from home who i then came out to (being caught in soho with a guy didnt leave me much choice) and that night we had sex. This gave me an additional piece of experiance as we was only my third guy and it was great. He's since moved back to his home country.

Sometime in March I saw 'J' a little bit more, for a very brief patch things went back to normal, but the gap had started to widen and he wanted to be with someone more connected to his work and routine which is fine, I have mainly gotten over him now and would like us to be normal friends as he's an amazing person and was a big part of my bi development. If he can work with that idea remains to be seen but I honestly hope so.

I have since been with a couple more guys and am currently looking forward with a once again (relatively) clean slate. In what is really a short space of time I have gone from a nervous and clueless guy to someone at ease with my sexuality. And how my attitude to the sex has changed has been really great, a few years back I could never picture being with anyone other than women but now have even adapted to enjoy being with guys. 

Im starting to talk with and ask out both men and women now and consider my story a successful one, even if there were bumps along the road. Sorry for the length but I hope this will be a guide to someone out there. Thanks"

I need a place to stay in the area. /r/Idaho is dead or might as well be, /r/TwinFalls never had a pulse. So hopefully someone here might be of some help.

I own a home here in Boise as I go to BSU. Live with my brother, he is staying here so leaving this place isn't a problem. But I won't be bringing much with me in terms of furniture. Pretty much the bare essentials to work, sleep, mountain bike and Diablo 3.

The area is understandably more expensive to live in, but Hailey is a bit cheaper than Ketchum so I'm looking for Hailey area as it's only 15 minutes or so from where I'll be working most of the time.

If anyone is familiar with the area and can recommend something or knows someone that can put up with a 23 year old College Senior with a computer and Mountain Bike(s) till August, I would appreciate it.

I'll be posting something in /r/Idaho on the off chance someone reads it.

tftry,1,2012-05-09,She never wants to talk to me again :(,derpulon,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tftry/she_never_wants_to_talk_to_me_again/,"So my ex and I broke up in early January. I was the one who initiated the break up because I was frustrated about how little communication we had. We were somewhat long distance due to me being on an internship and her being at school (an hour away roughly). Things were good at first, but then she was generally pissed off all the time and seemed annoyed by me (I think from the stress of school). She also had groups of friends that she never wanted me to meet or know about me. I was pretty much persistently depressed. Anyway, that was in the past and I broke up with her over email.
Following the break up, there was a lot of arguing through instant messaging. She wouldn't admit she did anything wrong. Eventually we reached a point where we were able to talk online as friends... but then arguing broke it apart in the end.


This happened several times. I attribute it partially to the fact that talking over a messenger client does not carry your intention/intonation very well. There was usually a month or two between whenever we would talk again.


I became depressed as she 'seemed' okay with it. She was posting pictures on facebook of her and her friends having fun (the ones I wasn't allowed to meet). It depressed me and I resented it since my life was still pretty much dead.


I eventually unfriended her on facebook because of another chat argument about the breakup among other things. It was also partially because I couldn't stop myself from checking her facebook page and thinking about her.


This helped since I could literally not see any information about her. I started online dating and essentially forgot about her for a while.
She eventually asked me why I deleted her on facebook... and it turned into another argument. I eventually told her it was to make the break up easier, and that I would re-add her when I no longer had feelings for her. Following that, the argument subsided. We had a nice chat about what's going on in each other's lives.


Another month passed and she asked a coworker of mine (who also knows her) out for lunch as friends (she recently started an internship nearby mine). He sent me a screenshot of their conversation where he asked if I could come too, and she said no because I broke up with her and insinuated she was an arrogant bitch. Confused by this, I messaged her over Facebook and told her I wasn't going to try and divide friends and that I wouldn't influence him to not go. Her response was her blocking me completely on Facebook.


Later I asked her over chat why she did that. And she said it was because she was tired of me being accusatory and didn't feel like dealing with me anymore. All she feels when talking to me is sad. I asked her to unblock me, and she said she wouldn't since we weren't friends. She said at this point she doesn't really care if we ever cross paths again. She said this friendship is done, good bye - and that was it.


Now here's the thing about my ex; she's very literal. If she says something, that's what's happening. It is true that in all our arguments I was being accusatory (telling her she had no empathy. etc), mostly just trying to convince her that I wasn't the only reason our relationship died. She also takes accusations very personally (part of which I guess can be blamed on ambiguity of textual communication). She said I just had to accept her 'egoistic' attitude (her words) because that's who she is, and her real friends accept it - and that things didn't work out just because they didn't work out.
So now that leaves me at this point... aside from my ex being my ex, she was a good friend. I've never been in a situation where a long time friend never wanted to talk to me again. On top of it, I don't even know if I'm wrong or not.... and after that, it's feeling like I was.


Now I guess I'm just really depressed. What do I do to feel better? I'm stuck at work roughly 9 to 5 during the week, have almost no friends here, having limited luck with online dating and now know somebody out there doesn't ever want to talk to me again. I already go to the gym and tried distracting myself with hobbies... but everything seems to only work for a little while.


Is there anything else I can do to get over this?"

ti4i1,2,2012-05-11,So my boyfriend broke up with me last night out of the blue.,Alocasia_Fruit,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ti4i1/so_my_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_last_night_out/,"I'm 22, he's 22. I graduate college in seven days. Our situation is kind of weird. We're long distance (he lives in PA and I live in NY) but we met each other through mutual friends online. This was almost three years ago. We helped each other through some really difficult stuff and he transferred schools to spend this year with me. But he took a year off at the beginning, so while I'm graduating, he isn't. This wasn't a problem.

He has an internship in DC for the summer. No big deal. He's coming back to school in the fall, and our school is closer to my house than his house in PA is, so that's also no big deal. There were no problems outside of normal tiffs and stupid arguments. Until yesterday.

He's been really stressed out over school. I mean really stressed out - not sleeping, not eating, barely getting work done. It's finals week, so while I'm all finished up and ready to graduate, he's still busting his butt trying to get his stuff done. I've been letting him, giving him space, whatever he needs. But we met up at the dining hall yesterday for dinner and I noticed he wasn't really talking to me or looking me in the eyes. This was on top of some funny behavior the night before when I didn't go spend the night in the library with him and our friends (I was sick, and it was pouring rain and I didn't want to walk over there) so I asked him straight up, ""is everything okay with us?""

And when he didn't answer, I felt like everything just fell apart.

But I thought it would be fine. Our friends showed up and I was visibly upset, I didn't really eat but neither did anyone else, really. When we left dinner, I went back with him to his room because he said we could ""talk."" I didn't realize then that the decision had already been made.

He told me that he had been thinking about it for a very long time, since the beginning of last semester. He said that he didn't feel how he expected to feel when he finally got to the same place as me. He said that he had just been biding his time waiting for the right moment to break up with me, and that I just noticed too early. He said a lot of normal breakup stuff along those lines. He said that he was only putting on a front the whole time because he thought if he could be the best boyfriend possible it wouldn't be an issue (he was, and always has been, perfect in that regard) but didn't break up because we had become such an institution among our friends. I asked him if this was because of the distance and he said no, I asked him if there was somebody else and he said no.

I think that would be easy enough to understand. Sometimes relationships don't work out and I get that. Except he cried. He cried so much. I was crying, he was crying, he kept saying he loved me but he didn't know if he loved me like I loved him. He kept saying all this contradictory stuff. When I finally got too upset to stay there any longer, I tried to walk out of his room. He burst into tears and asked me to stay a bit longer, and then cried on my shoulder for five minutes.  Then on my way out the door, he said he would miss me.

Am I missing something? We'd been together over 2 1/2 years, I thought I knew him. I thought this semester was going so well. It was basically perfect for me, he was basically perfect for me. I was invited to his sister's wedding in the fall. He scheduled his internship around being able to go to my graduation and graduation dinner (which he texted me last night he still wants to go to). He's dropped countless money on Steam games just over the past couple months because he knew I wanted to play them (which is a big deal because he's not a big spender in any way, shape, or form). We had plans. We didn't fight. I really just don't understand what's going on right now.

And then he Facebook messaged me that he wanted to spend the night last night. (No sex.) I said fine, that we could catch up on Community, but then he changed his mind at the last second and said everything was really weird for him.

I haven't really slept, and I definitely haven't had food. I can't stomach it. (I'm sick, too, so that isn't really helping the appetite situation) I'm waiting for him to wake up to respond to my request to talk to him again. None of this makes sense.

Problem is that once I hit Arkansas I got a phone call from the person I was supposed to be renting from telling me he found someone who was going to pay him more, so the room I had arranged was no longer mine. Padmapper hasn't been much help because people either don't have anything open until June or they want me to lease for 6+ months - that's not feasible because I go home in August.

I'm currently bouncing around hotels and friends' couches and desperately need somewhere stable to live for the summer. My internship starts on Monday and I'll be here through early/mid-August. If you have something available, just fire me off a message and I'll get back to you with my phone number so we can get a feel for each other.

Close to the Metro is a huge plus as I'll be working near the National Mall. Areas surrounding DC (Maryland, Virginia) are fine with me.

Since I brought my car, parking is helpful (but I can make other arrangements if needed) and at least meager furnishings (bed bare minimum) is needed."

I'm a European and got the great opportunity to do an internship over in LA from the beginning of July to end of September, so just under three months.

Now, the office is pretty close to LAX (south/east), and I would like a nice area to stay, hence I was aiming for Santa Monica/Venice as it is close to the beach and close to where I work. I will have a car available for the time.

Do you have any special suggestions on where to look for a rent/sublet for these three months? I would very much like an own room. I already know and frequent westside rentals, padmapper and craigslist...

Does it even make sense to try it from here or would I best aim for a hotel or so for the first couple of days and go apt scouting from there?

At any rate, if you yourself are looking for a sublet/room mate for July - September, then holler at me!

Any help is appreciated as it is a bit of a tricky task from afar. 

Thank you my dear redditors.

&gt;Notice the ""_cls"" at the end which makes it sound like a classic map. Not sure if this will be free though, so we'll see.
All of the other preview files in the .iwd file are for the other DLC maps that have been released or announced (the ""_ss"" ones might be the face off maps).

Analysis of **MW/MW2 Nostalgia map pack** rumor: Comparing the image of [MW3 Terminal](http://images.wikia.com/callofduty/images/7/74/Terminal.jpg) found in the patch, there are some differences when compared to the image of MW2's Terminal shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/DbDDi.png). Let's debunk the theory of why I don't believe that this is a ""left over"" image from MW2. First of all, this was found and added on the May 8th - I don't think IW would just add a random place holder image or preview image or if it's just a careless intern's mistake. Second, people mentioned that the color is off. True. MW3's map color correction is more ""dull"" and ""muted"" compared to MW2. Third, the angle of the preview image of MW3 Terminal is different from the one found in MW2 Terminal, which brings furthercredibility that the rumors of a ""nostalgia"" map pack. GHANDI (in the CoD forums) hinted at such a prospect, possibly being even free and being available to everyone in all platforms. If my analysis is correct, a MW2 ""nostalgia"" map pack could imminent. Be excited my friends.



**Update 1**: Somebody mentioned that the MW3 Terminal looks mute and dark compared to MW2 Terminal. It makes sense because color correction on MW3, from experimentation, is more ""mute"" and ""dark"" compared to MW2 and MW (CoD 4)."

I'm a marketing and development intern for the Center for Chemical Addictions Treatment (CCAT) on Ezzard Charles Drive.  My internship has revolved primarily on organizing our annual CCAT Walk, a fundraiser to benefit the agency and its patients.  CCAT provides a lot of services for the community, its patients, and their families.  Our program includes community-based detox, short term residency, and a 12 week aftercare program.  Our facility also offers alumni events, a suboxone outpatient clinic, and a series of educational courses for families and friends of patients.  Finally, we house al-anon and AA meetings once weekly.  

The success rate of our program (which includes detox, STR, and aftercare) is very high, with over 60% those admitted graduating.  If you know anything about the heroin epidemic in the Ohio River Valley--or anything about addiction in general--these are pretty good odds.  The center does a lot of good for the people it serves, their families, and for the community, but it is still yet to get the recognition that it deserves.  

I'd love to change this.  We're trying to get the word out about our organization through radio commercials (maybe you've heard about us on WARM 98?), print advertisements, and Facebook (check us out! www.facebook.com/ccatsober).  Our annual walk, coming up on May 19th, is also a big part of this.  Last year it was a huge fundraiser for us, and more importantly, it was a great way to tell people about a resource in Cincinnati that many of them are unaware of.  This year, we've added a mural to honor those lost to the disease of addiction.  

So please, if you are free on May 19th, register for the CCAT Walk!  Registration starts at $25, and the money goes to support a great cause.  The walk starts at 9:30 AM and runs until 12:30.  You can find registration on [our website, ccatsober.org](http://www.ccatsober.org).  You get a shirt, free food, and a chance to enter in some really cool raffles.  More importantly, any money you spend goes to fund a great organization in your community.  

If you guys have any questions about the walk, CCAT, or its programs, please feel free to ask!  I'll answer to the best of my abilities, and I'd love to see you all there next Saturday. 

Thanks, guys!

thjxp,12,2012-05-10,I'm going to send an email to the Chancellor in an attempt to reduce the number of emails sent to all students. ,mynameismunka,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/thjxp/im_going_to_send_an_email_to_the_chancellor_in_an/,"Here is my email.  What do you all think about my idea?  Is this email clear?  Do you all agree with what I'm saying here?  Send me some feedback!!

Dear Chancellor White,

My name is X, and I am a first year graduate student at UCR.  I believe that the number of emails sent to all students is much, much too high.  I feel like my inbox is constantly flooded with emails sent to [students].  In the last two days, I have received 13 emails directed at all students on campus.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 

It seems like most of the emails are simply reminding us about events around campus.  I agree that email is a good way to inform all students of events happening around campus, the fact that we get so many emails causes a numbness towards any emails that are obviously sent to all students.  I believe there is a simple way to fix this problem.  I am currently subscribed to NASA's education ""express"" emails.  The format of the email is as follows: the first part of the email is a sort of ""table of contents"".  It has the title of each topic discussed in the body of the email and a very short description.  The rest of the email is broken up into these topics and then each topic is described in detail with all the information I would want.  I think this would be an excellent format to mimic.  I can easily scroll to the parts of the email that are relevant to me, such as when puppies are on campus, and ignore emails that would not apply to my situation, such as an undergraduate opportunity for political internship in Washington DC.  The NASA email is sent out once per week, and keeps me updated without flooding my inbox.  I think most of the emails sent to all students would be able to easily fit into this category.

I guess someone would have to be in charge of the emails.  Anyone who wants to send an email to all students would have to go through the one in charge, and this person in charge would have to make sure everything was formatted correctly.  Of course, there would have to be exceptions, such as campus crime alerts, or other time sensitive messages.  Overall, I think this is a simple, effective way to reduce the number of emails sent to all students.

Thank you for your time,
~X"
thix4,13,2012-05-10,I feel as though I've stopped loving my mother...just in time for mother's day.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/thix4/i_feel_as_though_ive_stopped_loving_my_motherjust/,"My relationship with my parents has always been complicated. I was physically and emotionally abused for a good portion of my childhood, mostly in relation to my grades. My father was more on the side of physical abuse, but my mother saw him hit me and let him, sometimes joining in. At the time I could do nothing about it because I was not a citizen and if I sent my parents to jail, my family wouldn't take me, leaving me most likely being sent to an orphanage in Russia.


Recently I have gone in for an evaluation for adult ADHD. I had problems concentrating/with hyperactivity as a child, and I still have a good portion of those problems now (although I managed to develop coping mechanisms with most of them and am a successful student at university).


However, despite my faults I was  by no means a terrible child. I had problems doing homework and keeping grades up, however I started staying home alone at age 8 and would do the dishes while my parents were out.

This semester, after taking a few graduate courses as an undergrad (thanks to an accelerated program at my college), I found I didn't have as good of a handle on my ADHD symptoms as I thought. After going borderline suicidal I talked to a counselor and was recommended that I talk to my doctor. 

**This is where it all goes to shit.**

I couldn't make the appointment on my own (forgot the number to my GP)/I needed someone to discuss family history, so my mother came along. She spent the entire time telling my doctor how terrible I was as a kid. 

My doctor is a really nice lady, and actually offered me some wonderful resources on dealing with symptoms while I set up an appointment for an ADHD evaluation with a psychologist (to know for sure before putting me on meds). However, she made the mistake of telling her own story and stating how her son who was also diagnosed later in life, had a hard time forgiving her for the arguments they had (she is not abusive). She ended that statement with how I shouldn't necessarily blame my parents for not understanding. 

**I don't think my doctor knew what was going on. But on the car ride home my mother went off on a self-righteous rant about how I shouldn't blame her/be mad at her for the abuse I suffered as a child. She said that the doctor was right, they were doing the best they could, so I shouldn't blame them.**

**I tried to explain that even from a logical standpoint, what they did was wrong. If hitting me didn't bring my grades up, why keep doing it? The only reason would be to vent your anger/stress.**

**She would laugh at me when I tried to make counter points. Then she told me that she wouldn't grovel at my feet. I find this ironic because when I got lost trying to get to a friends house (the very last time they tried to hit me) and was found after police intervention, my dad made me kneel and grovel at her feet. Furthermore, I didn't want her to grovel, all I asked for was possibly an apology. My mother also had the emotionally manipulative moment where, during this conversation, she asked me if I loved her.**

A month later I came back from school for my first psychological evaluation. My mother was acting really strange and really out of it. 

During the second history evaluation (this time with a psychologist), my mother once again went off recalling my worst moments. Telling him how horrible I was.

**On the car ride back, she told me that our last conversation 'broke her spirit' and how she could just so easily snap and not care about me anymore. She pulled this once when I tried to give her a tip when we attempted to learn to scuba-dive...Her telling me how easily she could lose interest made me lose interest, I haven't dived since, she did multiple times. My mother told me about how all of her friends and my father were worried about her, and how it was my fault. I had to sit and listen to this, and apologize the entire ride.**

**I asked her if she felt better after that tirade. She said she did- I didn't.**

Fast forward to summer vacation. I finished my semester, my grades are okay and I got a much needed extension on my final project for one of my classes. I am living at home and in between internships (doing an unpaid internship until I leave for the city for my paid internship). I work incredibly hard, I am out of the house at the same time my parents are and I come back after they do...I also work Fridays, they don't.

**We are supposed to have guests over this weekend, and the cleaning lady my parents hire decided to take the day off before they come in. My mother attempted to bribe me to vacuum the house and wash all of the floors on Friday. I agreed to it because the way she said it I had no choice, despite the fact that I work most of that day, still have to unpack my belongings and have a project to finish.**

Yesterday morning my mother barges into my room demanding for the 1000x time that I clean the house on Friday. 

**I admit I gave her a bit of attitude when I told her I would do it. She blew it way out of proportion, started shouting about how lots of parents make their kids do these things for free, how I'm ungrateful, and how she supports the entire family.**

Here is the thing, yes she supports the family, but given her income I am hardly a money suck. She makes over $180,000 a year.

* I go to a state school while taking out the maximum in student unsubsidized loans.

* I pay for most of my own medical expenses (except for the psychologist in this case).

* I wear mostly hand me downs.

* I am a CS major who for the longest time had two computers which were barely functioning (until I fixed them).


* My TV is older than I am (literally). 

My father on the other hand (who is acting really nice as of late), spends the most money in the family:

* He buys new cars.

* He bought new bass boat.

* He had a say in our house being way to big for a 3 person family.

* The year I wen to college he got tired of being my mothers secretary for 6 years and blew 50k on starting a new business.

My mother hardly gets to enjoy any of the lavish things he awarded himself.

I understand she works hard, but so do I, I am trying to make the most of myself given my circumstances. I do not spend lavishly or spend all that much of her money. 

She tries to act like a martyr when all of this was her decision in the first place:

* She could have not had unprotected sex/ aborted me if she didn't want to support/care for a child. Sometimes I wish she did.

* She didn't have to marry my father.

* She didn't have to move to the states and start from scratch (she had a medical degree and could have found enough work in Ukraine to comfortably support herself).

* She could say no to my dad.

* She could have bought a smaller house/less things.

**Now, since our argument she is acting really pissy, sighing every time she sees me/ignores me and she started chain smoking...again (up until last year she didn't smoke). She does this because it worries my dad/her friends and she gets attention and pity.**

**She has also procured the lovely habit of telling me ""this is just your adhd talking"" when I do something she doesn't like.**

I guess I am the horrible child, I think I always will be in her mind. My dad tries to mediate (does so much nicely), but it it more focused on my direction with ""why do you upset your mother like this"".

**But yeah, I think I don't care anymore, I feel numb to her, I think she may be right in that I don't love her. I Have 1.5 years left in college and once I am done I think I may cut ties (after paying her back for my education so that I don't feel like I owe her anything), at least if things stay this bad.**

She talks about how it is so easy for her to snap and lose interest, how I killed her spark...well congratulations mom, when attempting to get yours back you killed mine.

**It's sad to say I have a much healthier relationship with my father, who used to do most of the physical abuse, than I do with my mother.**

**Happy fucking mother's day.**

Sorry for the long rant, I really needed to vent.

**Side Note:** Lately my dad has been taking time out to sit and listen to my opinions. Although in a  really lame manner he attempted to apologize for his past actions: 

""Some things in our past suck, but if they weren't that way we wouldn't be the same people, it still doesn't make them less bad, but it's hard to judge."" It's lame but I consider this an apology because it's the closest to one my dad has ever said to almost anyone.

My dad also told me when I got my preliminary diagnosis:

""I am pretty sure I have the same thing (he has it worse), and I used it as an excuse to not do well. Please don't let this diagnosis stop you from being successful or happy.""

**TLDR: I don't think I love my emotionally abusive mother anymore.**

I bolded the highlights."

Brought a half a liter of concentrated yeast slurry home from the brewery I intern at. Pitched it at about 75 degrees at 9pm last night after shaking up the corny to aerate. Its now 9am and there is no bubbling from the blow off.

The brewer I am interning under had mentioned that he pitched this yeast into his IPA (12bbl fermenter) on a wed and came back on a friday and there was no activity and he thought it had stalled but it had actually almost completely finished. Very vigorous yeast.

Is it possible it bubbled all night? Should I give it another day and check the gravity?

UPDATE: checked the gravity... its at .035 (4% abv)... so it took off but is certainly not done yet. I overpitched so I suspect its going to be at the estimated 6.5% within the next couple days. I will let it go 10-14 days, cold crash it, and transfer."

A couple people made the good point that I was probably no where near ready for commercial level work. However, I have progressed to the point where school work is no longer challenging. I have worked my way through my school's entire CS course list (APCS, Honors Java, and Computer Programming) and I am looking for real world experience and problems. I fully understand the issue with making myself financially responsible for my work, which is why I think a summer internship would be perfect. I just need an idea as to what companies offer these types of internships. I live in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio so companies close to there would be best.

 I want to get a feel for what it is really like to work in the computer industry, and I feel this can be best accomplished by working with people who have real careers in the field, not just working on open source projects or other individual type problems.
That being said, I have done paid work for a college student in the past (his class assignment, it was a great learning experience for me) and it was quite enjoyable. If anybody knows of a site that deals with this kind of work then I would love to know about it.

**TL;DR: Need names of tech/software companies offering internships in the general Columbus area and/or sites that offer homework help to college students.**"

Are there any events I could go to or something I could do from Michigan to get a little more notice from San Francisco startups seeking a Junior Level software developer?

1. Brown leather dress shoe that can be worn both bus cas and bus prof.
2. Leather soles: I hate the squeaking of rubber soles and I like the clicking of a leather sole.
3. Round front with no cap toe. (I think this will help the shoe double as casual and professional)
4. Brown (obviously) I kinda wish the shoe color linked below was an even lighter brown.
5. Affordable price: I'm a college student trying to look good at my internship this summer; therefore, I am certainly a price sensitive individual.
6. Speaking of internship, it's in the banking industry which (for those who don't know) is probably the most conservative industry there is.

With those things in mind, here's what I found (below).  I would appreciate feedback and alternative suggestions.  From how they look in the pictures, the only thing I can think that I would change is the color to a less dark brown.

tlam4,5,2012-05-13,After a serious depression episode I owe my college money and can't finish my degree. Can anyone help me?,fuzzyferret,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/tlam4/after_a_serious_depression_episode_i_owe_my/,"**Tl;dr I was a college student with undiagnosed ADHD and Major Depressive Disorder. I finally snapped my senior year and had to spend a week in a mental hospital. My school refused to waive my tuition even though I filed a medical withdrawal and now I don't know how to pay them back.**

**So I'm looking for advice on types of jobs to look into, as well as special grants for individuals in my situation?**

I started college undiagnosed as ADHD or MDD, two years into my degree I finally found out about my ADHD and was able to get treatment to help me do better in classes. After my third year I had a cumulative 2.98 GPA and was doing very well in my senior year courses. The pressure of such a difficult major, taking 16 hours which included a pretty intense optical physics lab, working, trying to do research, and a difficult home life finally built up until it was too much to handle. I ended up having a pretty serious breakdown and had to be checked into a mental hospital at which point my MDD was diagnosed.

After filing for a medical withdrawal, the school informed me that I was too late in having my mental breakdown to get any of my tuition waived so I now owe the school the full cost of tuition for a semester before I'm allowed to continue college. So I started working for my fathers company doing home remodeling which I've done since I was pretty young. It was going pretty well and I even landed an internship with a financial company. After my internship I went back to work with my father and relatively quickly after that was involved in an incident at a bar that left me unable to work for a month. Not having income for a month along with paying medical costs took up most of the money I had been able to build up and left me back at square one. Now my fathers business is floundering, we haven't seen many jobs at all recently. He owes me a significant amount of back pay because he has been trying to keep us from losing our house.

On top of all this my mother suffers from an extreme case of bipolar disorder and continually steals money from the household for her own use. So any money that I could potentially use to pay off the school goes toward her 20$+ lunches with friends. My father is extremely unhappy and has no one to talk to about it so he talks to me. I'm not sure why I'm including this except for the fact that it makes me miserable and I have no one to talk to about it. In any case it creates a very difficult situation living at home with them and I would move out if it weren't for all of the trouble I'm already facing financially.

I have two goals at the moment which are to find a new job and move out of the house. My only problem is that these are pretty damn difficult when you don't have much work experience, or a degree. What options do I have? I've been thinking about joining the military, trying to get a job in the field on an oil rig, or going to Afghanistan/Iraq as a civilian contractor.

I have a pretty extensive computer background in scripting, programming, and Linux; but I've been told by a couple prospective employers that my background doesn't count for anything unless it was attained through a company so that I have 2+ years of on the job experience.

Please any possible options are welcome, I just want to go back to school and finish playing with numbers so I can get my degree and start my life.

I know it's not that bad at all compared to what a lot of you are going through since we'll see each other in September. We've had to do long distance before through periods of our relationship and we got through it then. The thing is that we'll be apart for her birthday, and I'm worried it will be awful for her since she's living by herself in a city where she doesn't know anyone. She's never been that much into her birthday, but I want to try to do something to make it special for her. 

What can I do from so far away? The catch is that I already gave her a present before she left and she told me not to spend any more money (since I bought a plane ticket to see her next month as well). I'm willing to bend that rule a little though.

Help me make her birthday special, Reddit!

I am a engineering student, with a two year old daughter. I currently am an intern for a subcontractor at NASA. Several months back my baby mama and girlfriend of 6 years dumped me. I began smoking again, which brings me too my bind. My internship which I've been at for over a year decided to start drug testing. I haven't signed the employee contract which is basically agreeing to take a drug test and follow their terms of employment. So I can still decide that I don't want to accept the extension and quit without any long term consequences. The downfall to that is I lose a well paying job gaining experience, as I have to ind somewhere new to live by the 30th due to unrelated issues. If I accept the employee contract, I'll have a few days to a week maybe (just guessing), before I have to pass a test.  I don't know anything about the test, and I've never had to fake one before. If I fail it could ruin my daughter and I's future, because I had to get government clearance for the job, and it's through my school. I need to be able to get a job in my field when I graduate, and I'm not sure how losing this internship would affect that. I also don't want any chance of losing my daughter. She is my world. Everything I do is for her. Smoking pot is the only thing I do for myself, and I never do it around her. I need some advice fellow ENTs, how should I handle this unfortunate situation?"

To qualify 'industry insiders' - I literally mean anyone in the gaming industry in any capacity: design, creation, testing, distribution, marketing. Anything.



Here's the deal:



My brother is a mad-keen gamer (PC and console) and a general tech-fan (especially AV tech). He works as a retail assistant at EB Games here in Australia (I think it's Gamestop in the States), reads gaming mags and website all day, and generally knows his shit. He also used to sell AV gear (TVs and peripherals) for another retailer and is cluey enough with the latest tech to make a bit on the side doing kit-outs and installs for any 'technologically challenged' he meets through the shop or through word of mouth.



He's a lovely guy, smart enough, but not brilliant. He wouldn't manage at university, but managed to get a TAFE certificate in I.T many years ago. I'd say more study probably isn't in his future.



**My question to you, industry types, is this:*** What kind of jobs exist for people like this (of which I'm sure my brother is not the only one) in or around the gaming industry, that would allow someone to make a modest living being around the things they love? And how would they go about getting started?



Any advice you have on careers, courses, internships, slave postings, etc, would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance. Game on!"

togf6,43,2012-05-15,My story of Academic Suspension to Dean's List,frenchybrown,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/togf6/my_story_of_academic_suspension_to_deans_list/,"Well I came into college from highschool with a sweet scholarship and other financial aid leaving me to only have to pay $4,000 of my $40,000 plus private University (provided I maintained a 3.0). I was in the top 15% of incoming freshman for GPA and ACT score. I also had gotten used to just coasting by on my good test taking skills and quick learning like I did in high school, spoiler it doesn't work in college. 

1st Semester I slacked off a lot, turned in A papers 2weeks late and got D's on them (seriously it would say ~~A~~ Late:D) why on earth did I think that was okay? Anyways I got a 1.92 GPA and an Academic Warning and Probation. As this was my first experience with this, I didn't take it seriously.

2nd Semester I did even worse, deciding not to turn in one of my final papers because ""I was on vacation and didn't feel like it"". Anyways 1.74 GPA and a letter over the summer gave me Academic Suspension. I appealed this and through a solid letter of reference from one of my college profs (who basically said I was smart but lazy) and a letter of my own, as well as pleading my case to a member of the academic counseling board. I got off and was able to attend again in the Fall.

My Sophomore year I worked at a moving company and a Bank for 30 hrs or so a week and maintained a courseload of 1 fewer class, each semester, average GPA :3.3! So I was thinking I'm fine, I turned it around; I was wrong. Over the summer I received a letter saying my cumulative GPA was below my requirement for scholarship (like 2.5 or so). I appealed this through a strong letter and my improved Academic performance, I again cheated failure. If I had lost this scholarship my college days would've been over.

Finally this year, in the fall I did fine 3.3 or so, but this semester I absolutely killed it, I'm looking at around a 3.7 or so and the Dean's list. Nothing is final yet, but simply the fact that I'm still here and I'm finally performing makes me so proud. When I think back on how many close calls I've had, it really scares me to think how this could have all come to an end. I'm still struggling to come back from that horrid year, internships look down on my GPA, I can't get into the honor society for my major (I have a high enough major GPA, but not cumulative) and a lot of extended family still give me shit like ""Oh frenchybrown, do you still have your scholarship?"" ""Yeah, you know perfectly well I do"". I'm learning you can't let anyone else determine what you do or how you perform. I did well this year because I decided that school is too important to dick around with.

Anyways, sorry this got so long, I really wanted to get this off my chest today. I feel so proud of myself and hopeful for the future, but still realize I have a lot of work to do still.

To all you incoming freshman, holy shit take it seriously! yes you will have a ton of friends, free time and new opportunities at your disposal, remember what you are there for. Work hard and play hard, don't play xbox for hours and then blow off homework, that is the stupidest thing you could possibly do. This is the time when you find out who you are and prove yourself, to others and to yourself. Take this shit seriously, you have no idea how many opportunities you can create for yourself at college. Get involved, go to bed tired, because you accomplished so much during the day, not because it's 4 am and you stayed up all night on reddit. I know if someone had told me all this 2yrs ago it would've been in one ear and out the other, but you are different and you can be whoever you make of yourself (good or bad).

tl;dr I almost got kicked out of college two years ago, but instead I made the dean's list this year"

Being in college, I don't have too huge of a budget.  Preferably want to spend less than $60 for a button up shirt and definitely less than $100 for shoes.  I plan on taking advantage of Memorial Day sales that should be happening next week.  

What stores should I check out for slim fitting shirts/polos?  

What patterns, if any, would be acceptable in an office setting? 

What colors would be the most versatile?

I honestly have no idea as far as shoes.  I was thinking of getting a pair of brown boots when fall gets closer.

I'm not sure if I missed anything, but all tips and suggestions are helpful!

Thanks!

tpezm,3,2012-05-15,"I have to live with a friend who appears to be jealous of my relationship this summer, with my bf in the same neighborhood and visiting often.  How should I navigate the situation?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tpezm/i_have_to_live_with_a_friend_who_appears_to_be/,"I am a 20-year-old female college sophomore and part of a tight-knit group of about 7 friends within my dorm, including my boyfriend (M, 20... for the sake of anonymity we'll call him James) and a mutual friend of ours (F, 21, we'll call her Katie).  My boyfriend and I have been together officially for 7 months now, but have clearly been interested in one another for a little over a year.  I have been a member of this group of friends since I arrived at college and before my now-boyfriend and I began to develop interest in one another.  

Katie and I always got along really well until I began to become interested in my boyfriend.  At that point, the amount of time she spent with James started to worry me.  I was sure that he was interested in me until he and Katie would spend hours at a time together, usually instigated by Katie.  I worried that she might have a crush on him, further complicating my feelings toward James, since I didn't want to hurt my friend.  However, we had a heart-to-heart conversation over the summer before James and I started dating, in which I told her about my feelings for James and she subsequently made it clear that she was actually interested in James's best friend, Will.  She had told him of these feelings a few months before without my knowledge and essentially been rejected.  In my mind, this freed up the path for James and I to get together.  So far, our relationship has been great.

However, since James and I have been dating, Katie has shown signs of jealousy.  I know that she has problems at home, although I don't know exactly what they are.  I also know that she confides in James with help in coping with these problems, which doesn't bother me at all, since James is a good listener and helps to keep her grounded (she has anxiety issues and he is good at calming her down).   However, she often comes into the room when we are together, ignores me altogether, and tells James that they need to talk, planning walks together and other outings.  This wouldn't bother me in itself, but the way in which she ignores me and talks only to him is frankly annoying and hurtful, especially because I essentially asked for her permission before dating James and she expressed her happiness for me when we first became a couple.

She is abroad this semester and posted an article about friendships between men and women on my Facebook wall, in which the conclusion that was reached was essentially: ""Relationships are nice, but platonic friendships between men and women should not be overlooked either.""  I didn't respond to the link (I didn't really know what to say), but apparently she later asked James what he thought about the article (answer: he started to read it, but got bored and stopped) and then proceeded to ask him if he was happy in his relationship with me.

I know for sure that James has a lot of esteem for Katie but also feels that she is far too high-strung, stressful, and simply not his type, so there is no way that they are secretly in a relationship.  However, it bothers me that Katie is acting so cold around me when from her own mouth there is nothing to be jealous about, since she is supposedly not interested in James.  

James is my first boyfriend and was my first kiss as well.  Katie has never been kissed and has never had a boyfriend, so it is possible that she is expressing her frustrations about this by being resentful of our relationship.  It is also possible that her main interest was Will, but she also had interest in James, and is jealous for that reason.  

However, the main reason I am asking you for help is because, due to a number of unlucky circumstances involving difficulty finding summer internships until late in the year, Katie and I will almost definitely be living together this summer (along with at least 2 other people) with James living nearby and coming over often.  There is also an outside chance that James will have to come and live in the apartment as well.  Although Katie is a really good friend of mine and we get along in all issues except where James is concerned, I am really worried about navigating this situation without accidentally expanding the Cold War.  Any advice that would help me understand Katie's feelings and how to deal with them would be really appreciated!  Thanks all!

**TL;DR: A close mutual friend of my boyfriend and I appears to be super-jealous of our relationship (but is only being cold to me and not to my bf), despite the fact that she told me before we started dating that she didn't have feelings for my bf, but rather his best friend.  I have to live with her and possibly my bf this summer.  How should I navigate the situation without making it even more awkward?**"
tpdqu,2,2012-05-15,So I have a few questions:,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/tpdqu/so_i_have_a_few_questions/,"SO here's my little dilemma. I'm a college student that has recently finished school so I've moved back home (a tiny town of 3000) for the summer. I work at an engineering internship and work around 60 hours a week already. I've only smoked around five times, the first few with some buddies and the last by myself basically just to finish the pot that I had left over and each time I've had a bunch of fun or felt really good (relaxed).

Anyway, I don't know of anyone in this town that smokes and I want to continue smoking during the weekends, just at night to have some more fun playing my video games. So my first question is, how do I find someone that deals?

Second question is.. I bought a bowl (I think that's what it's called, http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSM9xw-A2HqJtKfQw4lBn9Mfy9iqz9kI5ixBGV3SkLND1rqYa6QwSqfRgZV). How do I pack it properly? How small should the shreds of Marijuana really be? Also, how do I clean the inside of it near the carb, there seems to be some sludge :(.

Third question is.. Where should I stash my marijuana if I do get some. Currently living with the rents over summer and haven't really got any good hiding places. What are the best ways to keep the smell from escaping, my plan was to get like five zip-lock bags and lock those up real tight then just chuck them under some clothes or something..

Fourth question is, if I were to go hiking over summer I would need to travel and I'd also like to bring some pot to really enjoy my time hiking. What would be the best way to travel with Marijuana?

Thanks guys! :)

Ever since I had an abortion a couple years ago I have felt very empty.  People have tried to have relationships with me but I don't think they get what they are doing to themselves.  It's not like they pity me, but being in a relationship with someone who is still fucked over by their own stupidity is just asking for it.  Meanwhile I know that because I feel empty I feel like to cling to a relationship because I want someone nearby, around to tell me it's ok when everyone else has forgotten or just says it was just a batch of cells.  

Ultimately, there is no evading any of this.  What is done is done.  I am doing everything to make a better life for myself, I've returned to the house, I have an internship, I'm a full time student.  It doesn't feel like it's enough.  I feel like I have crap friends who just want to tell me their business when their bored or want a sympathy buddy.  I feel like I'm still half assing things, I feel myself starting to slack again in school.  I'd go to counseling but it's taking some action that I need and I'm working on it.  

I just wish I knew how to get past this every time I try and make friends, only to feel like I'm a traitor to their morals and am a loser to myself.  "

The thing is, between the hour-long commute to get there, the stresses of tasks I'm given, and the fact that when I get home, it gets a little late and I'm really tired, I find that I just don't have a life of my own any more.

Also, I should be paid soon but I haven't been and the accountants haven't even set up my pay. So I just feel like I've got nothing in return. I have shit in my back account, and I'm working my ass of full time, and for what? Yeah, it's a good experience, but when I come home, I just feel tired and I don't have a life of my own any more.

I shouldn't complain. It's a paid internship and I know plenty of people working shitty jobs/no jobs for fuckall pay. I have a great girlfriend who is beautiful and awesome. I'm 20, work a white collar job, and have a high chance of landing a good, well-paying position at this company once I graduate. But is this what it's always going to be like?

Weekends just fly by. Maybe I should work on making them seem longer.

Also, I nearly never see my girlfriend anymore. She's busy at work too, and it's a shock since on campus we'd see each other plenty.

I've been on 40mg Celexa for 2 years now, and it's worked, for the most part. This just sucks though.

Me (20 M), girlfriend (19 F) have a great LDR, it's only be 7 1/2 months so far but wow she is an amazing person. So intelligent, beautiful, funny. My dream girl. I know the relationship isn't long but I love her so much and I want to be with her. But she has hopes of becoming a doctor, her dad is a doctor so it kind of runs in the family. Like I said she is an intelligent girl, 4.0 gpa her first year at college.

Summer is here and we're back home, about 2 hours away from each other. Still haven't seen each other since April. Today her dad told her how she thinks she won't be able to become a doctor, basically he doesn't have faith in her and she won't be able to do it. According to him she's not ""aggressive"" enough and doesn't have any internships her summer before sophomore year. This got her EXTREMELY upset. She told me she's seriously considering transferring to a premed school in Europe to get away from her father and prove him wrong. This hit me pretty bad. We both love each other so much. I told her to go for it cause the last thing I want to do is hold her back and her dreams.

She's planning on going to Europe second semester of sophomore year so that would be Jan. 2013. Obviously anything is possible, but she is very smart and I have no doubt she'll get in those schools. She already has her heart set on this and I know that a relationship won't be possible if she goes there. 

Do I let this relationship run its course until January or do I end it soon? Either way I'm going to be heartbroken, more so in January. She's already showing me photos of campuses in England and it's crushing me inside. I've put on a happy face for her because I don't want to be the reason she holds back. 

tldr- gf thinking about going to europe for college, i'm so sad and don't know what to do"

trxpf,1,2012-05-17,My long winded story,This_Gets_Thrown_Out,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/trxpf/my_long_winded_story/,"This is going to be long. I feel the backstory is somehow important.

Currently 30 years old. I grew up in a pretty poor family (during the 80s recession) My dad was in the military and my mom ran a small daycare.  I didn't have a TV or toys excluding the Legos my grandma would buy me when she visited (the visits stopped as my mother doesn't talk to her mother) My household was extremely religious, attending church at least 4 times a week and this was used to justify my mother giving away most of what little money we had to the church because ""they needed it more than we did"". I suffered from apathy and something more like alienation from my peers. I had no friends growing up. I did well in school, usually around a 3.5 GPA because it was easier to just do school work and get it over with. I didn't excel because *effort* wasn't something my mom taught me. She taught me hard work = gift from God, not hard *and* smart work = likelihood of getting ahead in life. My dad took every assignment he  could that was away from the house. Work was his escape, and still is, to this day. I only remember 4 trips from childhood that we ever took. I was talented as an artist but wasn't allowed to work on stuff because ""you'll make a mess"" is what my mom told me. She also beat me with a metal vacuum cleaner tube whenever I did something she didn't like.

I was accepted into the school music program. My mom told me ""I wasn't allowed to play anything without a volume control"" and then bought a broken piano (she got rid of it two years later)

In high school I was a ""weird"" kid. Not trench coat wearing weird. I tried my best to dress normally because I figured it would help me blend in but not enough, apparently. I wasn't exactly made fun of because I was good enough at sports and was tough enough to pose a physical threat (high school is so easy compared to real life) to most people but my mom wouldn't allow me to play team sports and told me I didn't have enough dedication to do so anyway. You start hearing that crap in elementary school and eventually you'll believe it. I still did pretty well in school, but once again, it was easier to do the work, get it over with, and move on. Not enough motivation to have a 4.0. I didn't get into trouble. What kept me sane was walking the neighbors dogs for cash on the military base. Was never very good at handling money but my parents never seemed to have any. This problem persisted long into adulthood.

I grew up on military bases and their education system is pretty horrible (DOD schools) When we finally moved to America I attended a private Christian school of a pretty huge church, but when the principle runs off with the gym teacher, the pastors daughter gets knocked up in highschool, the song leader is busted for looking at porn on the church's computer...(do I need to go on with this?) I understood church was a great money making scheme from a very early age but this isn't something you can talk about with the adults who are a huge part of the problem. I believe in God btw, but that is another story. I only kissed two girls in high school after I turned 17. I'm not sure if this is relevant in anyway to my emotional development or indicative of something else.

I was obsessed with anatomy and death by the time I graduated. I went to college to study mortuary science and worked in a funeral home. I did well in the ""basement"" but didn't work funerals because I don't relate to people and felt no need to fake emotions to help deal with families. I quit the funeral home business because it exists to make money (normal for any business) but the monetary success of a funeral director is based off of commission in most cases. Selling high priced funerals is morally wrong to me. I dropped out 1 class short of graduating.

I had to get a job and ended up at a moving company after getting kicked out of my house (I was 20 and the parents said it was time to go). I did quite well but it was an experience. Most of the employees are felons or people who are totally down on their luck. I did well because I was strong, careful, spoke well to customers, and wasn't black (we had customers who only wanted white or hispanic guys) I managed to do everything in the company including management, sales, and long distance driving. The problem was that I topped out and knew that no matter how hard I tried, 50k a year was the most I would be making. That's not enough to live in this area. I did the math a long time ago and 64K a year is the minimum you need to get by if you're single. That's a shitty condo and second hand car BTW. Ironically enough the same company offered me 65K a year last week, but working at a moving company? Fuck that, seriously. I've got some horror stories about moving companies and they are extremely shady businesses. 

I manage to go back to school. My dad finally returns home and felt guilty so he put up about 70K for me to attend. I got a degree in Advertising. Graduated Magna Cum Laude, but took off time in between due to depression. Fell in love with the Advertising industry, then out of love. Mad Men started a few semesters into school and people referred to me as Don Draper. Guess that was a compliment? I fell out of love with the ad industry and got fucked over at my ""paid"" internship. Doing art direction and branding but usually the boss would just disappear when it came time to pay me the percentage of our fees.

Moved back in with my parents and have been in the basement ever since. My mom and sister weren't happy about that but my dad pretty much told them to STFU he pays the bills anyway so they will just have to deal. I help around the house. I'm a good cook, do the yardwork, help my dad prep his job. I think of myself as his executive assistant. He gives me money for gas, cell phone, and health insurance. It's enough to keep me happy because I know he loves me very much. To help deal with depression I go to the gym 3x a week, but even that is something of a circlejerk and part of that is working out is too immediate a reward IMO. It's not hard to bang out hard work in an hour or two. It's too simple. I watch my diet pretty well and wonder if what is wrong with me is a deficiency of some sort. I've thought about working in a gym from time to time, but eh...it's a non job IMO. 

I was playing in a band (quite good actually), but got kicked out because the new bass player bribed our drummer by flying him out to various places on his +1s with the company he works for (bass player has a great job, but when you're fat, unable to play your instrument, and have psoriasis on your balls it's hard to get girls) These guys also don't have a problem with getting chicks drunk to hook up and I don't want to be around people like that. But music was keeping me going on some level. I'm not a fool though. I look early 20s but the music thing probably was not going to happen, and my motivation for art is really low right now. I sold all my bass gear last night. I stare at the wad of hundreds, wishing it was gold, knowing that paper money is essentially useless (fiat money). 

Depression runs in my family. My cousin (degree in Criminal Justice) *enlisted* in the army at 34 years of age. He loves it. I don't believe in what our military stands for so that is out. Ironically enough the one thing I do better than just about anyone else is shoot guns and have thought about turning that into a career but I really hate the culture that surrounds guns/the firearms industry. 

Last weekend my 19 year old cousin was killed(car accident, thrown 75 feet from the vehicle). As the QB he ended a 10 year losing streak at his high school and took his team to the state Super Bowl (they lost) Apparently he suffered from depression as well, something about a girl involved, but the family isn't talking about that and I'm not going to ask or assume. It was weird being back a funeral home, knowing I could have done better work on the guy. I hated it. He did more in 19 years of life than I have in 30. 


**ANYWAY** My entire life I've felt out of it. I had a long term/long distance/abusive relationship (got my nose fractured when she sucker punched me among other things) but the girl left me for a middle age guy at some point (""he has money"" she said). She always referred to me as ""the alien"" because my weird emotional states. I ended up dating a model/commercial real estate agent after that but the only reason that happened was because she wanted a guy in a band. We didn't get along, she is now with a signed musician (good for her, she was a great person, we just weren't compatible) I can fake being normal, but it's lame that I have to do that. It takes effort to be normal and drains me. I have extreme mood swings but it's all directed internally. 

What's keeping me going? I have a best friend who works in the financial district here. He hates his job because of the corporate bullshit/hours but makes too much money to leave.(His health is declining from stress/long days) I talk to a girl I knew from way back when. She tells me that she likes me because she was 230 lbs in high school but managed to lose 100 lbs, get implants, and became a hottie. She tells me I was the only guy who was nice to her when she was obese. My other best friend and I make some electronic music together but he's moving away from here (similar band situation). 

**sorry for the drivel**

**TL:DR** I don't know what to do and know that ultimately I am the cause of my problems. Yet I stay in the basement and think too much about everything.

I was doing C25K before I left for the summer, and I really liked having a structured exercise program that changed and had noticeable improvement.

trbjs,2,2012-05-17,My self destructive way of thinking,boomerang1111,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/trbjs/my_self_destructive_way_of_thinking/,"I had no clue where to post this, but since I suffer from depression I figured it might as well go here because that might have something to do with it. Anyways, my outlook on life is that if I always set my expectations low enough, I can never fail to meet @them, and I get some sick, twisted form of pride from this. I've never seriously discussed it with anyone, but I felt like I had to get it out, and I'm between therapists right now. As an example, when I dropped out of college the first time, I had met exactly what I had expected for myself. However, when I actually got hired for a part time job, which then led to an internship at a PC repair shop, I far exceeded expectations. But not a day goes by where I expect to go home employed. Hell, not a day goes by where I don't pat myself on the back for living through the morning. With this pattern, I almost always surpass what I expect of myself, but when I inevitably fuck up, I'm not surprised or disappointed at all. This has led to a very ""whatever"" attitude, where I don't strive to achieve anything without some kind of financial motivation, which I consider the main reason I dropped out of college twice (aside from my atrocious grammar). I want to move out, but working full time sounds like an inconvenient pain in the ass for not much spending money, due to bills. So I live rent free with my parents, cleaning in exchange for food and bed. Maintaining friendships sounds like hard work, so I don't talk to anyone unless they contact me first, which never happens outside of work. I don't know if this outlook is normal or not, but I wanted to feel like someone would at least listen to my ramblings without publicly shaming me. Anyways thanks for reading I guess."
trb9x,0,2012-05-17,I'm losing the only woman that I've ever truly loved,screwed_in_auburn,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/trb9x/im_losing_the_only_woman_that_ive_ever_truly_loved/,"I'm so afraid that my girlfriend (21) and I (23) aren't ever going to get back together and I don't deserve to have this happen.

So we have been dating for almost exactly a year and like all couples we've had our ups and downs.  Mostly little shit like me being at work too much and not spending enough time with her, and me not having enough time to do things on my own, etc.  But always figuring things out within a day and 99 percent of the time we have both been extremely happy, and I feel lucky for every day I get with her.  Lately she has been having problems with people stealing things from her apartment (we still live separately) and has been trying to figure out who.

A couple of nights ago she and her friends started questioning/accusing me of doing it (I DID NOT), and this turned into a larger fight of me being angry about being accused and her being angry that i wasn't confessing.  A few more friends get involved and when the argument hit its peak, one of my ""friends"" decides that its time to tell my girlfriend how he, my other friend, and I had used her car when she was home for winter break and didn't tell her about it.

Now she says that she can never trust me again, told her parents who now hate me, and that we're breaking up.  I understand that it wasn't a great decision and took responsibility for taking her car without permission, it was stupid and i definitely should have told her.  But I don't think that it was proper grounds for splitting up at all.

This was two days ago, i haven't been able to sleep, eat, have any motivation for day to day things like running errands or going to work.  She is leaving next monday to go home for an internship that is 800 miles away.  I don't know what to do.  

I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest because this is the only girl that I have ever told I loved, and I truly meant it.  I thought that we were going to be together through college and farther.    Its killing me that something like this is enough for her to just ignore the love and caring that I have and tried to show on a daily basis the entire time that we were together.  I know I screwed up, but didn't think this would ever happen.

What do I do now?

TL;DR - My girlfriend broke up with me because she cant trust me for borrowing her car while she was away.  She is leaving in a couple of days for 2 months and I don't think I can make it without her b/c I have altered my life so much to be with her.  Now I don't know what to do.

ttudt,7,2012-05-18,Today I completely broke down and never showed up to my internship--again. Need advice...,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttudt/today_i_completely_broke_down_and_never_showed_up/,"I thought this would be the best place to ask for a little advice about what I've been going through. So, this fall, I was diagnosed with MDD (severe, recurrent). I've suffered from the same symptoms for as long as I can remember-- low energy, over-sensitive, over sleeping, not being able to sleep at night, outbursts, no concentration and above all just a pervasive feeling of shame and guilt. I started going to therapy in the fall but couldn't afford to keep going. I see a psychiatrist once a month because I was prescribed Wellbutrin, but its clearly not helping very much.



I took the Spring semester off of school to relax, which I wasn't really able to do. In the fall semester, I'd had an internship that I completely flaked out on after a few months there. I liked doing the work and was grateful for the opportunity, but it was too much in conjunction with classes. I was feeling a lot less pressure during my semester off, and I asked if I could come back. The executive director of the place I was interning said sure, but only if I really thought I was up to it. I really thought I was.



I was doing OK for the first few weeks, but then it was just a repeat of everything that'd happened in the Fall. I had a bunch of coursework to finish from the semester before and the internship was getting in the way and stressing me out because I also had a part time job. I quit the job, but that still didn't help. For a month now I've been losing so many nights of sleep, worrying about going into the internship without having the work they need done and at the same time not being able to finish my school work. 



The more I needed to concentrate, the less I could. My deadline for school passed about a week ago, but I still had a research paper (actually a Modle UN scenario) to write for the internship. It had to be done by last night, but when I was working on it I lost my internet connection. I freaked out and just went to sleep because I'd not gotten more than 3 hours sleep in the past couple of days.



I woke up this morning around 8 and tried to work on the paper a little. I had to be at work by 11. I hardly got anything done, and was so tired and so stressed out-- I just felt like I lost my mind. I was crying hysterically for a few hours and by the time that was all over I felt so ashamed because I was going to be late and not have the work done that I just flat out didn't go. 



I did this once in the Fall, too. My boss was understanding, but I don't see how he could be this time around. I just need to know how to handle this situation. I'm afraid to look at my e-mails in case there's something from my boss since I'm so embarrassed. I thought maybe some of you would have been in a similar situation before and could possibly share some wisdom. Thanks in advance!



**tl;dr I have MDD and its been a stressful month. Didn't show up for my internship today and I'm wondering how to handle talking to my boss about my no call/no show?**"
tttz5,0,2012-05-18,What do you think of this idea for a charity?,newuk,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/tttz5/what_do_you_think_of_this_idea_for_a_charity/,"Hello everyone.

I am a design graduate living in the UK and I am sick of companies advertising unpaid full-time internships.

So many companies abuse the internship scheme in order to get free labour from talented graduates in the Creative Industries. So few of us can afford the luxury of working for nothing yet we need experience on the cv to get the paid job making it extremely difficult for new graduates to start their careers.

What I am currently in the process of doing is forming a charity aimed at people within the creative industries to offer them funding to help while they undertake unpaid internship schemes.

I feel that the internship scheme needs to change but at the same time there are so many loopholes which companies can use to get around paying people e.g. voluntary placements and work experience.

What I am asking from all of you guys is some feedback on this idea and any suggestions you have towards the idea to help make this new charity be worthwhile and really helpful to those in the creative industries.

Thanks guys"

tsqtz,4,2012-05-17,Possible Internship - C++/MFC/Maintenance - Oil Company Domain Software Package (Visual),maintenanceguy,houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/tsqtz/possible_internship_cmfcmaintenance_oil_company/,"This is a potential software internship (C++/MFC maintenance) with an energy corridor software company.

You are familiar with C++ and may have done some MFC coding at some point. You are happy working on old code and love puzzles, and have a great eye for detail. You know who you are.

I've seen a few folks asking around about internships, and asked my boss about it, and he cleared me to start paperwork. If no one bites here, then I'll have ex-Rice/UT/UH/A&amp;M peeps hit up CompSci departments there for anyone not working yet this summer.

PM me (new account but old redditor). I do not know pay or other terms yet. Cliche, but this is a cool opportunity for the right person.

Not used reddit for anything like this before. I'll try and respond to PMs. You can keep it pretty anon if you like. Just give a rough idea of experience, what you'd expect in pay and what you'd hope to learn. Links to previous work are obviously an advantage.

Fast learners are ok, but you should have some decent VC++ experience. You'd be sharing an office with a couple of support people, with dev experience.

If you have a particular reaction to this post, feel free to post in the comments."
tspjb,3,2012-05-17,"Been together for almost 8 years and although at one pointed I wanted to marry her, I don't think I do anymore. No idea how to handle this. ",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tspjb/been_together_for_almost_8_years_and_although_at/,"A little backstory. Met as undergrads, didn't start dating until we both had graduated. Things started off slowly and then progressed as you would expect, we moved in together after dating for about 3 years. Come this Sept/Oct we will have lived together for 5 years. 

Shortly after moving in with each other she decided to go back to school to get her doctorate. At the same time we were starting to talk about getting engaged. Knowing this I knew we would have no money to get married, even with help. We decided that if she went back to school we would put off getting engaged until after she finished. 

Things continued to be great. She went back to school and although it was difficult financially we still had fun. 

Looking back now I can see it started as soon as she graduated. All of the sudden I was being put on the spot by everyone, ""when are you going to pop the question"", ""how long have you two been together now"", etc..... It had come sporadically before, but this was a torrential downpour. I tried skirting the question, tried being witty about it, but eventually I snapped and would respond with ""when I am ready"" in a curt voice. And thats when I noticed that a lot of it was coming from her, or should I say on her behalf. She was still finishing her internship and knew that I was still flat broke. I wasn't ruined by any means, just broke, still living paycheck to paycheck while she was finishing up. It would be another 4 months before she started earning a full paycheck and I would be in a position to start saving. So in Sept. she started full time and I started saving. And I have been saving ever since, to the point where I almost have enough to buy a ring. But now I don't want to!!! I've watched her change over the last 12 months. She started out being coy about it, oh look this random person I met once got engaged on facebook. She dropped hints and as the savings account grew I started to pay more and more attention to them. But it in the last few months, her tone would change regarding the subject, all of the sudden she wasn't happy for her ""friend"" getting engaged but instead miserable that she wasn't yet. She “promised” to leave me if I didn't put a ring on her finger by her next birthday which will be this fall. 

And now I don't think I want to marry this person. I don't want people to get the wrong idea, I still love this person and realize that she is just acting out of frustration for not being married yet. Yes her peers are giving her a lot of pressure. But I don't think marriage should be approached by a “you have to or else” kind of attitude. I hate being forced to do anything, and I feel that I am being forced to get married. The sad thing is that for a long time I did, I really did want to marry her. And now I am pondering what our marriage will be like and I am forced to ask myself if this is what I can expect from her. Will she do the same thing when she wants to have kids, or buy a house, or whatever. 

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated. 

Edit: I am in my early 30's, she's in her late 20's. 

TLDR: Been with a girl for 8 years, wanted to get married but don't now because I am being forced to.

tuvz5,3,2012-05-19,Is this the normal status quo for a relationship?,Dovakeeeeeen,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tuvz5/is_this_the_normal_status_quo_for_a_relationship/,"I'm currently almost two months down the road with my girlfriend (17), I'm 17 as well, and everything's been going well, or at least I think it has been.  
There's one issue that's been bothering me since about a month ago. So here I go:

I feel like I'm always the one initiating contact and that she doesn't really take the initiative to communicate.  Sorry if this sounds kind of selfish, but hear me out.

I'm usually propose and plan out dinners, dates, and pretty much any activity we go to.  On Skype, I'm always the one to start the conversation and I can't remember the last time she has.  If I don't say anything, there's simply no conversation.  Same applies for texting.  At school, I'm always the one who seeks her out. In general, I'm always pushing for the contact.

I only find this kind of strange because when I look to most other couples (generally speaking), both sides seem to be putting effort into spending time with eachother.  They wait for eachother after class, for lunch, and what not.  I understand relationships are different for everyone, but I'm still puzzled over this.  She's said she genuinely likes me and wants/likes to spend time with me, but her actions say otherwise.  

She's quite busy will school and intern work at times and I try to help her with it as much as possible.  On the note of her personality, she's kind of shy and indecisive.  


Is there any explanation as to why it's like this and how I could change it? Am I simply acting too needy?

I like her a lot, and I really don't want to see the relationship go wrong because of something like this. 

**TL;DR - One sided relationship -&gt; Feel like I'm always the one pushing with no pull from girlfriend, not sure if she's uncomfortable or what.**

It's a bit of a rant before my question, included for context and to just structure the situation into text for myself.

I'm male, 22, and have always been a fairly anxious person. Typically this manifested itself as a general stress; it's rarely crippling however, and normally it just coerces me into working harder at things. Except for the scenario where I have to make a reasonably life-altering decision, with no clear best answer, under a time limit. In these cases (happened once before), it leaves me mentally paralysed; feeling frustrated, melancholy, and running circles inside my own head.

I've just completed an internship with a company that I joined straight out of university. I work as a programmer, it's what I'm good at and what I enjoy. Working for the company has always been somewhat mediocre; perfectly bearable, sometimes enjoyable, It's not the best environment but I'm doing what I'm skilled at. Nonetheless, I've cautiously kept an eye open for a better opportunity.

Well, it comes time to sign a new contract, making me a permanent member of the staff. At the same time, I received a job offer from another company doing work I know I'd be fairly good at, but potentially boring. I walked into work on Tuesday fairly confident that I would be staying on with my current company, sticking to programming.

Well, I get told that my old company no longer exists due to financial problems. I'm offered a position at the company that owned mine, but that it will come with significant changes to my job description. I'd still be programming, but additionally I'd be doing more or less anything else ""technical"" the boss needs me to do. This is terrifying, as I've always gravitated to things that I know I'm competent at, and the company does work I'm not particularly interested in. The company also offers to pay me a little more than the other offer I received.

Now I'm stuck. I've been trying to decide since Tuesday. On the one hand I have an exciting work environment and easy, moderately interesting work (or so I expect). On the other I have slightly better pay, a work environment I already know, and the opportunity to learn a skill I otherwise wouldn't. Additionally, if I really do end up hating my work or find something considerably better, leaving a place I've worked at for six months seems better than quitting after a month at the new position... I find some comfort in having an escape route, even if it remains unused...

I'll be the first to admit that I'm in a brilliant position, I have no right to complain. However turning down one or the other leaves me at a loss. I'm delaying in answering, frustrating myself and them too. So here I sit, pondering the situation over and over.

How do you guys cope with these sort of scenarios? How do you console yourself with picking one or the other?

Thanks!"

We were best friends for the last year. We began hooking up over the spring semester and she told me she had feelings for me. Due to many of her and my insecurity issues, I thought it was best if we didn't date, so I told her I didn't like her, and it was a bad idea.

We continued hooking up anyway, me freaking out a lot because I thought I was (and i was) hurting her, but more because I was hurting myself.

A few weeks ago, a friend of hers randomly asked her out, and she said yes. This caused me to freak out, and tell her how I really felt on an emotional whim. She freaked out, and we didn't talk for a few days. When we began talking again, it quickly went back to our old flirtatious ways, even though she was seeing this guy, who was goign to another state for an internship the entire summer.

On thursday, I managed to get really, really drunk. I got lost, and couldn't find my way home. I gave her a call, and she was at a bar with our friends. She told me I was right near my house, and i'm being stupid and should walk home. I was really, REALLY drunk and honestly could not figure out left from right, which I explained to her to no avail. I stumbled downtown somehow and ran into her and our friends. She wouldn't speak to me, and was really upset. 

The next day, I dropped some of her belongings at her dorm, as I was emptying my room and leaving my apartment. I told her to get her things, and go. She grabbed them, said thanks, and went into her place, not before looking back at me as I drove away.

I am now home for a few weeks, before I go back to my school for a job, where she is also on campus taking summer classes. We're not speaking currently, and I don't know if she's sorry, or pissed, or anything.

I'm just confused. I don't know what to do, and I don't know know what to think."
tw39n,18,2012-05-20,"Buying my first suit, and I'm hoplelesslysmall. (shopping experience/need advice)",hopelesslysmall,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tw39n/buying_my_first_suit_and_im_hoplelesslysmall/,"warning: I just posted this and saw the real length for the first time, it's really long!


Hey MFA, I've been reading around here for the past few weeks in anticipation of buying my first suit. The suit doesn't have a specific purpose, really, but I'm a 21-year-old college student and will probably have an accounting internship next summer, hopefully a job in the field soon after, and everything that comes with those positions. So I might not need a suit tomorrow, or next week - but I'd like to be prepared. Plus, suits are cool. 

So with my (very) basic understanding of suits I picked up here, I went out to try things on.


First: I've only measured my chest. 34"" by my friend's measurements. I'm also 5'6, and weigh 125lbs. So I'm pretty short, pretty skinny, generally unsubstantial. Looking online before I went to stores, probably too small. Oh well, what the hell, let's just try 'em on, it won't be so bad.

I went to Macy's first, because they have like 30-40% off some stuff, plus I had a 25% off discount coupon, plus I was hoping they'd give me a macy's account for an extra 10 or 15% off my purchase and I could start building some goddamn credit. So I tried on their stuff, even though it was all 36. Alfani and Bar III, their in-house brands, even the ""slim"" stuff was just a mess of fabric when I put it on. I don't know to what extent a tailor can fix shit, but all of this stuff was beyond redemption I'd think. The other brands offered a similar fit - CK, lauren by RL, TH. I'm not up-to-snuff-enough with the technicals on why suits fit like shit, e.g. was it the armholes or shoulders or etc., but, well, I just felt like I was stepping into a blanket with holes in it.

I tried kids sections, but as I expected I am kid-sized but not kid-proportioned. The fit was just off.

An aside, I had my girlfriend with me, so this isn't all self-analysis. She happily agreed that I looked like shit. What a jerk. 

Went to other places. Zaras is supposed to have small stuff, right? I couldn't find a 34, wasn't a fan of any of the suits I saw there (little to no wool, mostly cotton/linen/polyester/other fabrics I've never heard of, guessing shitty synthetic stuff, and I'm hoping for 100% wool like most guides recommend) and the 36s felt like a slim-fitting blanket. The guy at brooks bros. told me to try on the kids suits with similar results to macy's except with a nicer suit - still not happening. Their other suits, obviously big, boxy, american. He offered MTM - I politely declined. I'd assume BB MTM is out of my pricerange. Everything there was. Not sure why I went.


That's about it. I skipped Nordstrom - out of my budget, though I'd love to go and try on some AEs sometime (is it a dick move to find my size, leave, and wait for a deal on factory seconds??)...JCP, other cheap departments, well I don't want a shitty suit and I'm sure they carry the same as Macy's. Heard great things about H&amp;M (not quality wise at all, but for a small guy), unfortunately the closest is 1 hr 45 min away. I'd prefer not to drive 3 hours round trip for the possibility.


My last, desperate stop was some scummy-looking local suit shop. The salesman there saw me and his eyes lit up. He rushed me into the first 34s he could find. Wow, it fits alright - not great, but maybe we could fix it. Only ~~$99~~$199, you say? I asked him to stop trying to get into my pants (well, he just wanted me to change into the suit pants) so I could think for one goddamn second - now the suit is $99 so my ""this shit is shit"" alarm is going off. He was a used car salesman who wandered into a suit shop and was selling me a car with a rebuilt engine without telling me. The jacket looked a bit...off. I was interested in what material it was made of, it had a ""super 150 wool"" tag on the arm, but I looked inside the jacket anyway and it said ""shell made from rayon/trueran"". 

Not quite sure what a ""shell"" was, but assuming ""shell"" means ""the outer part of the jacket"" I wasn't too alright with buying a rayon suit jacket. Not sure why it had a super 150 wool tag on it, too - blend of wool/rayon/trueran? Wool on the interior, rayon on the ""shell""? I'm not sure. But I don't want a shitty, shiny, glistening jacket (on second glance, it did have a noticeable...sheen to it). I didn't feel like asking him and getting a bullshit answer. ""But, but, but, bu....the engine's only *a little bit* rebuilt, sir."" I had a bad vibe from this place the second I stepped in, he looked and acted like a scumbag used-car-salesman-shark-asshole, I saw the word ""rayon"" in every jacket pocket I looked in, so I just told him I'd think about it and left. 

Now I'm here. I'm sorry for the lengthy post. Maybe I should open a blog. But I just wanted to give you guys the full rundown on what happened, why I think I'm trapped in a hopeless situation. MFA might've set my standards pretty high, but even pre-MFA I think everything I saw would've resulted in a ""pass"".


Opinions? Options? I'm looking into MTM now, it's a little more than I hoped to spend, but I guess it will be a little more now and a little more in a year when I need a suit **tomorrow** and can't wait to get an MTM. 

Thick as Thieves looks awesome. 

Propersuit looks cool, but they're a bit more pricey, and not in my city ATM. I will be in a city they're in on vacation, in a couple months, so it is an option (if they stay in one city for months, not sure how they work, guess I'll email). Having them measure me is definitely an upside over TAT, and their suits look great as well. 


I'm not sure about spending about $480 (accoring to TAT) to $650 (cheapest propersuits) but I guess it's really not expensive at all, considering I was ready to drop around $200-250 in Macy's for an average suit on a deep, deep discount. And I've heard MTM might not be the best option for your first suit on MFA, not sure why though, and not sure what other choices I have. Time is hardly an issue, though, so I think that knocks off a big con of MTMs like thick as thieves.


So, once again, I write too much. Just looking for guidance. The $650 for Propersuits is basically a huge extension of what I'm willing to pay, so if you have any suggestions don't take that $650 and say ""if you can spend just $100 more..."" because I'm already spending hundreds more (not cutting into food budgets or catastrophe-savings, don't worry). And if it seems I'm kind of set on TAT/Propersuits, it's because I kind of am, but with enough persuasion against it I can be changed.


Thanks so much, MFA. Sorry for boring you with my shit.


**EDIT** Hopefully this will be seen again. This is in reference to what I perceived as the scummy local suit store. I thought the suit was rayon, possibly some kind of wool/rayon blend, due to an inner tag that said ""exterieure/shell trueran/rayon"" but a kind MFAer pointed out that shell = interior...which doesn't make a lot of sense, but chances are he's more experienced than I...and that the rest of the suit could be, as advertised, wool - or at least wool-ish.

Well, I ended up going back and asking the guy. He said the rayon was in fact the lining of the suit, and then told me I'd have 7 days to return it. So I went for it, so I wouldn't have to sneak pictures. The guy's still a scumbag, though, just throwin' it out there, so I took pictures. Unfortunately my camera isn't too hot and my house is 98% dim lighting so the pictures are destroyed by flash and such, couple I took without are way dark. Not sure if you could tell what material it is based off of these pics... I tried, though.


http://imgur.com/a/piVBw


Personally, I think I'll be taking it back. I feel dirty wearing it now, whether it's wool or rayon or fuckin' top-quality cashmere. But I would like to know what you guys think. Again, sorry for shitty pics, I might try tomorrow in some better spots in the house (maybe even outdoors, I have yet to see sunlight hit this thing) "
tvokv,2,2012-05-20,A Letter: Because It's Just Time to Move On,Lost_and_Myopic,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tvokv/a_letter_because_its_just_time_to_move_on/,"My ex was always on Reddit and telling me about it. He never really told me his user name because he values anonymity and uses Reddit as a means to get feedback on things. I actually knew what it was for a while (when you're on Reddit all the time and leave it open, you're not keeping it a secret) but respected his privacy and eventually forgot what it was. If you knew me, you'd know that I am extremely curious and love finding out things that people are specifically keeping from me. So the whole respecting privacy thing was really difficult. Anyways, after he broke up with me I stopped talking to him all together (easiest way to handle a break up for me). There are a lot of things that I just never got to say to him. Some because I didn't realize, some because I brushed them aside, some because I was so upset that he was breaking up with me that my head went blank. 

I'm twenty and he is about the same age. We didn't go out for very long – Less than a year with six or seven months of getting to know each other closer before that. I have a bad history with guys, so this time, I put everything I could into making things work between us. I feel a bit wronged. Luckily, I'm young and decently educated and decently attractive. There's a lot of time for me to find someone else. Since there are a lot of unsaid things, I thought of here. After a couple of weeks of poking around Reddit, I decided to post a letter to him. I've written about seven different versions and each time they have gotten shorter. The first was somewhere around six pages. I'm tired of writing to myself and having the letter go no where. So here's my letter and it's just time for me to let go.

Dear Harry,

It was not completely my fault for you being unhappy or me who started all of our “fights”. I was fairly reasonable and did not expect too much for a serious, committed relationship (which by the way, you put yourself in one once you asked me to marry you and I did not pressure you into that) - just too much for you. Breaking up with me and not taking any responsibility for anything really messed with my head. It was hard to break the feeling that everything was my fault when you didn't take any blame. I did not suddenly become type A. I've been that way all of my life and you knew me for a while before we started dating. It would have been kinder if you had just said that you couldn't be with me because I was going abroad for a year. Standard, generic, and reasonable.

You were only amazing when you were physically there with me. Otherwise, I very rarely felt considered. You never understood me. You hardly ever knew what I wanted or needed. I had to flat out tell you what I needed or take it for myself. Even after telling you, you couldn't really deliver. You kept promising me things and not following through until too late or not at all. Quite often, I would have to remind you because you would forget. You would disappear when you had something to talk to me about or when we started to get emotionally closer. The reasons you gave me when you broke up with me are things that you hadn't brought up with me before. You never wanted to talk. When you messed up too badly or we'd be fighting for a while, you'd make a larger gesture. It was like you thought that would make up for everything even though you made very few changes. And you wondered why I always seemed disappointed.

I resent you a little for trying to tell me how I should have acted at dinner when you broke up with me. Yes, there were better ways for me to have acted, but there were also better ways for you to have acted. I asked you to dinner specifically stating that my roommate wasn't going to be home. You agreed to it five days in advance and I thought that you understood what that meant. I assumed that a straight guy would at the very least realize it as an opportunity to have sex everywhere in the house. Turns out, I was going out with a guy who no longer thought about having sex with me. Then you didn't tell me that you had to leave early until we were on our date. Please note that you didn't say anything about coming back or how long it would take until you were leaving my place to go tutor the guy. All you said was you had to leave and as it turns out, you stayed with me on the date for less time than I had prepared for that night. I went to the store, cooked for hours, cleaned, dressed up, etc. Do you know how long it takes to layer the cheesecake brownies alone? The were made from scratch and I made them because I know you like them so much. Then you didn't even stay for dessert. I wanted everything to be perfect especially with all the fighting we had done recently. So yes, I got disappointed. I didn't want you to come back over because I didn't want you to be around me being disappointed. Clearly, the night meant very little to you and a lot to me. Then you decided that I was mad at you didn't come over when you said you would or talk to me the next day and broke up with me the day after that. 

You broke up with me shortly after you stopped needing me. In the last couple of weeks, you dropped your class that was stressing you out, talked to TA/friend about your issues with him finally, talked with your mom and found out that she was okay with the fraternity and supportive of your education, found a new dream of getting that internship. Around the beginning of those few weeks you told me that you needed me (I was really disappointed when you told me that). I talked with you through everything, held you, supported you, etc. Well, you stopped needing me and then you dumped me. I've told you before, I don't want someone who needs me, I want someone who wants to be with me. As it turns out, you were the kind that needed me. And now I feel like an idiot.

I finally figured out why I was so upset at country swing dance. I was extremely jealous of K. You probably don't realize it, but K is the only person you talk about outside of your family. I don't mean mentioning like you do all of your friends. In fact, you talk about K more than you talk about people in your family. Do you know how hard it was to listen to you when she was sexually assaulted? Yes, it was not a good thing that happened, but I listened to it for a week. A week that you kept reminding me of every situation that can be described as sexual assault that happened to me. And every situation you reminded me of was worse than what happened to K, but I didn't get any support like she did. I didn't have someone constantly trying to help me or worry about me. What happened to K barely registers as sexual assault on my scale. It was high school-age summer camp crap to me. I didn't need to have conversations and conversations about her and M and how horrible he was for her and how she needed to move on. You were far too excited for her switch to an open relationship. It also hurts that you only asked me to go east coast swing dance when you promised K that you would go. It also hurts that you would keep those promises to her but you couldn't keep a stupid, simple promise to get my tupperware from your brother. You drove upset, drunk, in the snow to meet her because you promised her you would go dancing and she wasn't even there. I would have loved to be taken out dancing more. It's quite pathetic for a girl to have her favorite dance partner/boyfriend not take her out to go dancing just to have fun and dance with her. You were extremely attracted to her when you first met her. You called me K after sex once when we first started dated. You said you were just friends so I ignored everything. That's why I didn't even know I was jealous until a few weeks later when I tried to go dancing again. I wouldn't be surprised if you two got together after a while of her being single once she's single. If you do, I wish you the best. She's an amazing girl and I think you would be better at giving her what she needs than you ever could with me.

Thank you for breaking up with me. We were horribly matched and I don't know if I ever would have broken up with you. It was amazing to get my acceptance email for the scholarship and not have to feel guilty for leaving you for a year. I was so happy that I cried. Thank you for showing me what making love was. It's changed my view on sex a lot and now I only sleep with people I have a stronger emotional connection with. Thank you for teaching me I need someone who will do what they say they will, plan ahead, keep a schedule, and can take care of himself – someone who's grown up a little more. I'm really tired of taking care of guys. I suppose I really do need someone like me – which is something I have been strongly opposed to since D. Which brings me to: thank you for helping me get over D. I barely panic when I see him and this is the first time I've been home where I don't feel scared and anxious. I also now know that I want to get married someday. Thank you for giving me a few wonderful moments even if overall it was a waste of time. Good luck with everything.

	Sincerely,
		M&amp;L

P.S. I didn't mind trees as much as you thought I did. I minded them when associated with you. This might have something to do with the fact that you told me that you quit before we started dating, started up again a little while later and said that you would only a little, passively lied to me about how much you did, directly lied to me about it for months, it made your depression worse, it took you away from  school and friends and family, you didn't tell me for two months about being arrested, and then continued to tell me stories about it."
tvnmj,9,2012-05-20,I constantly think about killing myself in hopes of just starting over because I feel like a failure,1259385594989823,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvnmj/i_constantly_think_about_killing_myself_in_hopes/,"This is going to sound like a lot of first world bitching, because from anyone else's standpoint, that's what it is--trivial whining from a relatively ""well-off"" person. But to me, it's fucking hell.

I'm a year out of college. I moved to a large city away from my home and the town of my alma mater to take an unpaid internship that eventually turned into the vastly underpaid job I have now. I'm not ""scraping by"" in the sense that I'm struggling to put food on the table. I've got an apartment, I can generally afford food (even though in the beginning I had to dip into the savings I had accrued from working throughout college), and sometimes I can afford new clothes and nicer things.

But I'm fucking unsatisfied. Ever since I was a kid, I've had major problems with competitiveness and comparing myself to others. I can never be happy unless I am the best, and on the relative scale of things, I am nowhere near the most successful of the people I know. It seems like everyone around me, friends and acquaintances, has somehow landed well-paying jobs doing things they love, living in cities they love, hanging out with their friends. I have no friends in the city I'm in. My best friends live across state and across the country.

I find myself hating and resenting my friends. And hating and resenting myself for having those horrible feelings toward people I should probably be happy for. I push people away because I resent them, and am disgusted by my jealousy. This is so embarrassing to admit, but I have one ""frenemy"" in particular of whom I am insanely jealous, and who is doing extremely well in her life and having success pursuing the dream that we both have in common. I find myself hating her because her family is rich and she has the means and ""backup funds to fall back on"" to give her the freedom to do what I would like to do, too.

The obvious solution is to move and pursue a new job... I've tried searching for new jobs, but it's unbelievably discouraging to email your resume out to twenty people and not even get a single, ""We've received your resume"" reply. I don't feel as if I ""deserve"" a job, but I sure as fuck would like the chance to prove that I am worthy of one. It seems like I can't even get my foot in the door. (And here comes the jealousy--somehow my friends have swanky jobs and can afford to travel to other countries or fly around to visit each other, and are going out, eating nice food, buying nice things, and generally enjoying their lives.) (I feel like I sound incredibly whiny in this paragraph in particular. Please forgive me.)

I have a boyfriend and he is very loving and supportive, but also poor. He has to comfort me when I break down emotionally in complete anger and disappointment and dissatisfaction with myself. This happens once a month. A sobbing fit. Sad that we never go out (can't afford it), sad that I have no one here except for him.

People tell me I'm fucked up for resenting people around me, or that I should be thankful that I have a job at all, etc. etc. And that makes me feel worse, because I can't help how I feel. People are constantly telling me, **""Do something about it.""** I don't know if anyone else has ever felt this way, but I just feel paralyzed. Like I don't even want to try.

Which brings me to the topic of this post--that I am constantly haunted by the dark desire to just kill myself and somehow get a chance to ""start over."" To do things right the second time around. To put myself on the road to success, not down this path of failure that I seem to be taking. 

I don't think I could ever go through with it. I have been suicidal in the past and never pushed myself to even attempting the deed, but I've been close. I feel myself slipping into the darkness. Sometimes I just cry by myself--and then feel pathetic in the face of those who tell me to do something, which only adds to the self loathing.

I feel like I haven't adequately described exactly how potent and damaging my feelings of jealousy are, but I just can't find the words to convey the feeling properly.

If you read this, thanks. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest, even if no one sees it. I hope no one recognizes me.

**tl;dr** Poisonous jealousy, feelings of worthlessness, and self-dissatisfaction are ruining me."

So, the CFTC has [these reports](http://cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalCompressed/index.htm) that can be loaded through excel.  How do I get those into a file on my PC that I can use in C++?

txok8,6,2012-05-21,A day in the life of a Community Access Specialist,ilovecheesepie,ADayInTheLifeOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADayInTheLifeOf/comments/txok8/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_community_access_specialist/,"Hello, Reddit! I work with adults with developmental disabilities. My job used to include Employment Support/ Community Access Specialist but with the economic climate (especially for those who are developmentally disabled) we, as and organization, have decided to drop our employment program! 

What is Community Access? Community Access is an integrated community program allowing those with developmental disabilities to access the community in a safe and rewarding way. The individuals I work with designate goals for skill building based on their talents and interests and for each outing, we choose an activity that meets those goals. It is also my job to find interventions to better improve someone's skills. For example: One of my clients has OCD and we are working on saying ""Oh well"" compulsively when he is denied access to something (i.e: Coffee... as he is not allowed caffeine) rather than self injurious behaviors that exist at present.
Pay varies by region/county/agency. I am paid about $10.80/hour but that's after a raise. I started at $10. Pay is not too negotiable because of the way agencies are financed. We exist off of waiver dollars from the state and can only make a certain amount off of our time with each client which limits what we can make individually. Schedule for my agency is typically 8-4 but the way appointments go, it's more of a make your own schedule deal. I also plan a month ahead. Basically the goal is to get clients out as much as possible but we can only go out maximum of 20 hours a month with each client, which comes up pretty quickly for some of them.

Pros? I would say that the vast diversity of clients you get is one of the pros. I genuinely care about all of my clients and work towards their best interests and I have a hard time understanding why when it is so much fun to go out with them! I've been everywhere from hardware stores to amusement centers to casinos to bowling alleys. You get a companion who is basically excited to be there because frankly, it's one of the only times they get out of the house. As a grad student with night classes, It's also wonderful to make my own schedule. If I have nothing to do on a Friday afternoon, I leave! I think it's also great to be using everything I've learned in my undergraduate (I'm a Human Services grad) such as grant writing and fundraising. I am currently planning a fundraiser for my entire agency as we are only a dept within a larger organization.

Cons: Paratransit basically shows up whenever they want to in our county, which puts clients on the bus upwards of an hour each way if they're lucky. It can be really aggravating when a paratransit van shows up for the person's ride an hour or so late and you're supposed to meet another client elsewhere in 20 minutes or when you have an appt after work for yourself (luckily, this hasn't happened to me yet). Also, dealing with county regulators is a pain. They make some of the most arbitrary changes because... I don't know. It's supposed to be to improve best practice but in our county, policy makers are very disconnected from the practice. Recently, the change made was that we need to record outings down to the minute. Our agency also assists with toileting (which a lot of agencies don't do) so I have some poop stories up my sleeve. That can be a con if you're not into it but you really get used to it. If you've ever worked in daycare, it's very much akin.


Even with the cons, I would argue that this is the best job I've ever had. I am constantly making a difference in my client's lives and I can see it. I get paid to go out and do fun things like go bowling or watch movies, or even a simple walk and you find ways to make mundane things like walking fun- even if it's just to get a smile out of your client. Unfortunately, I am probably going to be vacating my position in a year because I will be doing an internship in school counseling that I need to complete for grad school but that's bigger and better things? I get to use my skills in this job to better influence the lives of my students!

tx5kr,1,2012-05-21,"Some useful revelations on my breakup 2 months ago and the relationship we had together, and some questions on where to go from here since she is moving back to the city and we are bound to run into each other.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/tx5kr/some_useful_revelations_on_my_breakup_2_months/,"Let me start by saying we are young, I'm a 21(m), she is 19 (f).

We met at a dive bar, I was in a lonely place in my life, I had been drinking too much, was failing school, and was generally in a poor way. She was really nice to me, even if I didn't think she was *that* attractive, and she was confident, in a lot of ways she picked me up. I'm a very shy person, so I didn't really make any moves, it took me several hours to get up the nerve to kiss her, and we went back to my place and had great sex. I told her it was only my second time having sex, and she was surprised.

We kept hooking up like that (her coming over late, having sex, and then leaving) for a few weeks. Then, when she was on her period, she said she couldn't hang out with me. I said ""why?"" and suggested we get dinner and see a movie instead, because I really liked this girl. I think it was ""Due Date"" which I didn't even pay attention to because I was so nervous about being there with her.

We both had come from rough families. I had been severely abused when I was 8 by my bipolar mother, she had an abusive father who had left their family. We both had trust issues, anxiety, etc.

About a month after meeting her, we discussed what we were, and decided to be ""official"" since we were already exclusive together.

Not long after, a few weeks, I told her that I loved her, and about 15 minutes later, she said she loved me too. It was the first time either of us had said that.

So, our relationship started in an odd way to say the least, but I enjoyed it, and in general we were very good to each other.

I took a semester off of school and basically did nothing, so I had all the time to dedicate to her. When I went back to class the next semester, I didn't have the same amount of time for her. I was basically a boring boyfriend, I smoked a lot, didn't ever go out really, made a big deal about walking her home (I walked pretty far to school every day, and I get shin splints sometimes), didn't buy her gifts except for special occasions, and was very possessive and controlling, but also very committed. A few times I joked about how I ""owned her"" because I paid for her dinner, and about how neither of us could do any better, and that we were good together because we ""put up with each other's bullshit."" All generally very immature and hurtful things to say, even if I was joking.

She almost never spent the night at my place, she never opened up to me completely about her abusive past, and in a lot of ways I felt she never trusted me completely, and I never respected her completely.

All in all, it was a very codependent, sex-driven relationship, even though the love was real, it was immature. We were both very complacent also. For example, when I met her, I was determined to stop smoking and go to therapy. Because I was so happy with the relationship, I dropped that idea entirely. Furthermore she had other things going on in her life, whereas I was pretty lazy and boring, and was very dependent on the relationship.

We spent a lot of time together, talked every day, and acted like an old married couple. One thing I noticed was that we would fight a lot whenever I wasn't smoking weed, which was on vacation or when I went to visit her house.

We were together awhile, we had our ups and downs, and then she went abroad to Israel (she has an Israeli family) and right away it started getting worse. She had always said I was the only reason she wouldn't make aliyah, which put me under a lot of pressure. She didn't Skype with me as much as I wanted to, and that made me very insecure and anxious, because I put a lot of time into staying and contact, and I felt neglected. She had said things like she'd rather be spending time with her new friends that spend time on the phone with me. When she decided to change the time she took her birth control at, I got upset because I felt that was something I should have known about, which was just a way of me venting that I felt like we didn't have enough communication, and she didn't care about me. One day, I found out she had been smoking cigarettes, which I had said was a deal breaker for me, and it also made me feel like my trust was betrayed because she could have told me and decided not to, I didn't yell at her or anything, I just told her I wanted her to not smoke. In hindsight, I should have told her the dishonesty was the problem, not the cigarettes. Before I went to visit her for spring break, I told her to make the trip about us, not Israel or her family, and she got really mad at me. She made me promise to be open to Israel, so I knew there were going to be problems ahead, because even though I'm Jewish I really don't like Israeli politics, and I don't identify with the culture at all. I didn't communicate this to her though, because I didn't realize how important it was to her.

Mid-trip, I flipped out on her because I was under a lot of stress, not smoking weed, and I felt trapped because I said I wanted to go back to the hostel, and she remarked on how I didn't speak Hebrew, so how could I get home (one of my triggers for C-PTSD is being trapped and controlled, especially by women). I yelled at her, and said a lot of hurtful things, because in all honesty, I felt like I had been betrayed, neglected, and used. It was a manic episode triggered by stress and feeling trapped. Being a habitual smoker, this side of me had never come out before in such force.

Looking back, we were really bad at communicating how we felt, and with such little contact, it was inevitable that we'd have problems.

She broke up with me the day after I got back over skype, saying that we had different life goals (I want to travel a lot, she needs more stability), I had disrespected her (I honestly did not respect a lot of her views, or her family and friends), and she didn't want to be with someone where there was a chance I'd flip out if I didn't have weed to balance me out.

**TLDR: Met GF at bad place in my life, fell deeply in love, we both had similar rough upbringings and issues, had a very immature and sex/control driven relationship, and she went abroad. We didn't communicate enough, stopped respecting and trusting each other, had some major fights, and she broke up with me over Skype.**

Going forward, I have drastically reduced how much I smoke, I work out a lot more, I go rock-climbing a lot (something I love but didn't do at all while I was dating this girl), I started seeing a therapist and dealing with my huge emotional issues relating to my mother, I started hanging out with my friends way more and actually socializing, started talking with my family more, my room is completely clean (it was a mess before, couldn't see the floor), and in general I'm a lot stronger and more balanced as a person, both physically and emotionally. I even managed to snag myself a great internship for the summer and next semester!

She has moved back to the city, and lives in the dorm where the gym (and rock wall) is located. It is inevitable that we will bump into each other again, which is a scary thought. I would be open to talking with her, but I think we also both need more time to heal. We hurt each other deeply, but in hindsight I realize that we both were letting our pasts dictate our futures. She wanted to go to Israel to escape her father/insecurity, I wanted to travel the world because of my issues with my mom, and at a core level we never trusted, respected, or communicated with each other enough. I realize that the only reason I would want the relationship back is for sex and stability, but I need to go out and meet more people, and figure out who I am, and who I want to be. I was genuinely insecure about only having had sex with two women, and now I'm free to explore. Furthermore she helped me realize a lot of things I didn't like about myself after we broke up, and I've improved myself as a person so much.

I guess I'm open to suggestions on how to deal with seeing her in a constructive way, since in the back of my mind, I want to take the time to talk about everything that happened and communicate openly with her about our relationship, but I don't think that she would want to do that, and I don't think it would bring any closure. Even though I've been going to therapy and working out my issues and learning to communicate better, it might just be better to just not have that conversation. In good time, we will have that conversation, but I don't want to rush into anything, because that would just be me trying to control everything again.

I am happy for him and I tell him he needs to take it. He already did.

But then he tells me that he needs me to move out there because he cannot stand the idea of doing long distance. But I told him I couldn't, I had a summer job here, on the east coast. And then he dropped the bomb and told me he had expected that I was going to follow him where he went since he had the more ""important"" career. Things escalated from that and we split up, it really was a horrible break up and both of us are really stubborn so neither of us have contacted each other.

2. Are there any particular skills or tools that I should be familiar with? I do a lot of work with Views, Drush, the command line, Vim, and lots of community contributed modules. Is there anything that is particularly important that might not be obvious?

tzjua,27,2012-05-22,Clueless Single Guy with Questions,Throwaway91216,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/tzjua/clueless_single_guy_with_questions/,"This is a throwaway account because I don't want too many details about this going public, but I will be happy to answer any specific questions you may have (to a certain degree) in a private message.

I am reasonably successful for somebody my age. When I was 16 I got a job at a large grocery store chain (60+ stores) and about two years later I got a job at their corporate headquarters making over twice as much money. This never happens for any other 18 year olds. Most of the people I worked with were at least twice my age (the next youngest guy was about 25 or so and even he was a little out of place). It is because of this job, unlike most of my peers, I was able to pay my way through the first two years of college without loans or scholarships. I've also been able to just buy things (books, computers, food, whatever I really needed) without worrying because I knew that I had the money to cover for it. I've even been able to loan money to family and friends while paying for school. Now I'm 20, and I left that job (again after about two years) in order to pursue an opportunity with a very large tech company making twice as much money as I did previously. This is technically only a summer internship but there is a high probability of full time employment after I finish my senior year of school (this fall and spring) and even if I don't get a full time job out of it having this company on my resume is a huge deal.

I am also successful academically (for the most part). During all four semesters in community college I made the dean's list. I also completed two directed studies, won multiple awards, and joined an honor society (which frankly turned out to be a waste of time but hey, it looks good on the resume). During my first of two years in university I had somewhat of a bad first semester (3.0 GPA) but it is somewhat balanced by my second semester (4.0 GPA). I chalk it up to having transitional issues going from community college to university (that's what the advisers say, after all), but that almost sounds like an excuse to me.

The last two paragraphs are to demonstrate that, at least from my perspective, I am able to hold my life together pretty well. Some friends have recently told me that they are envious of my position in life and I could really do is remind them that is wasn't easy. Sure, there was some luck involved, but everything that has happened has happened for a reason.

There is only one ""problem"" (I say ""problem"" because some people may not see this as a problem at all). I'm going to be 21 next month and I've never had a girlfriend. I've never had a first kiss and I consider myself lucky if a girl lets me hold her hand. It's a problem to me because sometimes I can't help but think about why I can't find somebody for what seems like days or weeks on end. I'm not even sure that finding somebody would solve this feeling that I have.

I used to chalk it up to weight issues. In high school I weighed about 260 pounds (117.9 kg). While in community college through diet and exercise I managed to get down to 173 pounds (78.5 kg), but that didn't last very long and I wound up maintaining 185 pounds (83.91 kg) for a little over a year. Since starting university I've gained a little more weight and I have been maintaining 200 pounds (90.72 kg) for going on a year now. I really believe that my current weight is due to me not having full access to a drum set in my current place of dwelling (I'm currently living in a condo and I've been playing drums for about 12 years; I bought an electronic drum set but it just isn't the same). The point is, I've always been self conscious about my body and I guess I've always felt that a girl would never go out with somebody like me. The problem is, this hasn't changed at all since losing weight. It's still as difficult as ever to talk to women I don't know.

My entire history with women is so short I can write it out right here. I've been on a grand total of (not including prom, which is a whole other story) one actual date. And some may not even call it a real date, we just met for coffee and talked for a few hours. I had just gotten off a night shift and was tired (I tried to hide it, which was probably a mistake), but we just talked about whatever until she had a meeting to go to (which I knew about before we met up). I'd say it went reasonably well, except at the end we just said goodbye and a few days later she deleted her okcupid account. I think I may have scared her off the Internet :(. That was my latest failure and at this point in time was a little over one year ago. Previous to that I had become good friends with a girl who I was in Calculus I, II, and III with as well as Linear Algebra. I tried to get her a gift for Valentine's day (a gift which referenced a moment of sorts we had in Calculus III) but she just straight up did not accept the gift (she wouldn't even look at it). She knew I was getting her something too, but she never told me that I shouldn't. One of my friends (who is a girl) said she was a bitch and to forget about it. Fast-forward and I'm giving said friend drum lessons for a few weeks. The entire time she's complaining about not having a boyfriend and in general we're very open with our conversations. I asked her out and she said no and called herself a bitch (I'm serious, we're still friends and it thankfully hasn't affected our friendship). Previous to that I had a prom date who I asked out after prom and promptly got rejected. She was really the first girl I've ever asked out not counting an awkward moment in 8th grade with a friend who eventually drifted away from me.

In order to pursue this opportunity I am traveling over 1600 miles away and living there for the summer (this company has offices all over the U.S. and around the world but &lt;INSERT FAR AWAY CITY HERE&gt; is where they put their best applicants and at the end of the summer they connect us with managers from around the country. Because of this far-away trip I'm leaving on I have made the decision to not try and make any connections with women until I get back. My friends (who only found out recently) think that that was a mistake. I agree with them to some extent, but not with some of their logic. One point was ""plant the seeds now and harvest them when you return,"" or, in their words, ""meet somebody and when you get back in town be like, `Hey, girl, I'm in town. Let's get together.'"" This at least somewhat makes sense to me, but then this happened:

&gt; Them: ""When you go to &lt;INSERT FAR AWAY CITY HERE&gt; you're going to be in an entirely different market!""  
&gt; Me: ""I'm going to be there for three months...""  
&gt; Them: ""No obligations!""  

That brings up a core point of what I believe. I am not interested in relationships with a set time limit. Maybe relationships that have a chance of failure, but I honestly don't see the point of being in a relationship where you can count down the days you'll be together. Regardless, my friends have been encouraging -- going to the point of saying something along the lines of ""You have so much going for you. You have a lot of money and have a killer job lined up."" Granted, those aren't the only things that matter, but it's nice to hear anyway.

And so, I've reopened my okcupid account (to ""plant the seeds""). It's going... meh. If you've gotten this far I'd like to thank you because this is /r/AskWomen and I haven't asked a question yet. So if I were to summarize this all into a question, it would be **""how can *I* be better at talking to women I don't know?""** Emphasis on *I* because although I don't like being the me-monster, I really need some personal advice.

Extra points:

* I am in a major composed of 92% men and 8% women, and the increasing trend is that we are getting more men and less women.
* I can only name two out-of-school friends who are girls one of which rejected me and one of which I'm sure would reject me. **EDIT:** Rephrasing this as two female friends and several female acquaintances.
* I listen to metal music. Like, hardcore metal music. People are generally surprised to learn this because I seem like such a happy person (because I guess happy people aren't aloud to listen to metal). I'm attracted to the drumming more than anything. The problem here is if a girl asks me what kind of music I'm in to and I say that I just went to a Meshuggah concert then 1.) they probably won't know what Meshuggah is and I'll sound like a hipster and 2.) if they [listen to Meshuggah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACRfpwzDLAQ) they'll probably think I want to murder them. I also listen to stuff like Chili Peppers, [Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB5AjHteU5o&amp;feature=fvst), [Panzerballet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wh_M3ohtxM), Paramore, and, on occasion, Halestorm. Despite these bands being in my library, my library is primarily composed of heavy metal music. Also, despite listening to metal music I am not into metal culture -- I had to unsubscribe from /r/metal because of how increasingly moronic it was becoming and I am not *usually* into the type of girls who go to metal shows.
* I am a self-described nerd / geek. I've created a few websites, only one of which is really up at the moment."

I'm doing an internship in Charleston and need a room ASAP! I'm kind of freaking out at this point because my start date is coming up so fast. 
I'd need the room from June 1, to mid August, along with my sweet lab mix dog, Sadie. 

I'm a law school student and I'll be interning in the Air Force JAG office. I don't smoke or do drugs and would be looking for a more adult atmosphere as opposed to a college/party house.

If you or anyone you know has a room to rent, would be okay with my dog and would like to help pay their mortgage or have a little income for the summer months, as well as have an awesome roommate (if I do say so myself :-) ), please consider me!

Thanks guys.

EDIT: One more arrangement fell through... so now I have one week! Once again, if anybody has something available please, please let me know!"
tyj52,0,2012-05-21,"Going in different directions, to recombine later, need some wisdom.",Someoneoldbutnew,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/tyj52/going_in_different_directions_to_recombine_later/,"Our world sucks sometimes, and we are the architects of our own undoing. I work in technology, my partner just graduated from a highly specialized program which has jobs, just not as many in the tech hubs. We talked about moving to a tech hub after graduation, and a year ago, before graduation, it was the plan.

Fast forward to today. The program is done, and my partner has an internship (one out of 5 in the nation precisely in her field) on the opposite side of the country from where I have a solid, exciting job offer in the tech industry. The other job prospects in the hubs have not improved in the intervening year. 

From my perspective, I've followed and supported my partner to further her dream, and taken a few hits of my own, career and sanity wise. I'd like her to take a chance and see what happens. I do feel bad that I've placed this clockwork in motion, and it's causing us some pain right now.

From her perspective, she needs to go where the jobs are to make use of the expensive and time-consuming education, but it's what she loves doing beyond anything else. The prospect of moving to a tech hub with marginal opportunities without lining up something is risky, and that's what is causing conflict right now. She wants me to be happy, just is very nervous and concerned about living and working where I will be.  

We're two weeks out from the moment of separation, what can I do to make things better in the short term and long term? Have any of you been in similar situations? I don't want to cut my losses on this one, she's a keeper.

I've been both the person venting, and the advice giver in the past few months. And I want to share something quick. 

In the past six months...let's see. 

* Car blew up and almost caused a head on collision. 
* Had semi-nervous-breakdown in student center from too many classes, not enough sleep. 
* Had my car illegally impounded and have to pay a fine even though my car was illegally impounded and the ticket had no legitimacy, and they didn't follow proper proces to take my car. 
* Pretty much hated every single classmate I had this year. 
* Oh yeah, traffic every morning in New Jersey hasn't helped that stress. 
* Stuck at a boring job that I had hit the maximum level at, in suburbia with stuffy suits I didn't enjoy working with. 
* My ex-girlfriend accused me of giving her a rather nasty...disease. 

In the past year 

* Started playing a new sport. I finally decided to pick up hockey. Great exercise, lots of fun. 
* Lost about 20 lbs by beginning to work out and eat better
* Attended two brony conventions, the first one being completely on a whim because it sounded cool. 
* Made friends with said bronies, enjoyed second convention. 
* Went to ridiculous brony New Year's Eve party that I don't remember half of. The half I remember was awesome. 
* Made awesome friends by going to Reddit meetups
* Went to two NHL playoff games which was an amazing experience. 
* Applied and took new internship at a startup in Manhattan where nobody wears a suit. 
* The other nice thing about Manhattan? No traffic! I'm selling my car this week - no more gas, insurance AND the money from the sale can pay down some debt and give me swag money for Bronycon!
* Oh, and then there's that thing I did Monday.

My point here is this. Life has ups and downs. Life without ups and downs is like riding a flat rollercoaster....weeeeeeee. Life would be boring if there weren't any challenges to overcome. 

Would you watch ponies if it was just Rainbow Dash and Twilight drinking tea and playing a board game? Fuck no. The whole reason I like the show that's apparently for little girls is that it's entirely relatable as an adult. 

Rainbow Dash is chasing her dream of being an athlete, rising above her fear of performing. And she has flaws, just like us - egotistical and arrogant. 

Fluttershy loves taking care of animals...but she could probably afford to be more assertive. 

Twilight comes out of her shell, goes it alone to Ponyville and has to trust others and open herself up...and she ends up making five wonderful friends. 

Rarity goes above and beyond for her friends....and then fails. Applejack fails, too. They aren't bad people. They're extremely talented. But even the best of the best fail. Michael Jordan missed 36 game winning shots in his career. He was great because he didn't listen to his critics and was never afraid to step up to the plate. 

I'd like to thank Fly (edit: actually, and Acer, and everyone else, and etc.) in specific since he talked to me while I was having a rough time earlier in the year. It would be kind of stupid if I only vented to places like Plounge...friends share in failure as well as success. 

To those of you in need of support: Everypony is here for you, but you are the person you have to look in the mirror everyday. Not us. You are the only one with the power to accomplish what you want to accomplish. 

If you have depression, or anything else bothering you, you're the one to seek help. If your fat, your the one who has to see the doctor and sign up for the gym. If you want to make new friends, you're the one who has to put yourself out there and open up to people. 

If your life was a cartoon, would you watch it? Would you watch Pinkie Pie moping around for 30 minutes, let alone 60 goddamn years? I wouldn't. 

Just like the show, we have obstacles to overcome. But just like Twilight, we can't give up. We look back where we began, the reasons why we're alive, the things we hope to accomplish. And there's failures and mistakes along the way, but just like Twilight, we rely on our friends - and ultimately, the spark within us that drives us - to overcome these things. 

Make your life worth watching if you were a character on MLP. Take chances. Step out of your comfort zone. Try new things. Persue new opportunities. Meet new people. You're going to die anyways. Your a monkey floating through space on a fucking rock. Might as well do something significant since your stuck here anyways. 

There's going to be Discord. There's going to be Gildas and Nightmare Moons and all types of other shit you have to deal with. But like Twilight and the gang you should derive something out of it. You should strive to overcome, and your friends will be there to cheer you on.

I'm 27F and I've been with my boyfriend 26M for a year. We are moving in together and have discussed marriage. We both love each other very much and want to spend the rest of our lives together.

But I have a lot of credit card debt. Several years ago, I moved across the country to pursue a different career and ended up taking an unpaid internship and then a shitty-paying entry-level job. In the process, I racked up a lot of credit card debt. To be honest, it didn't even bother me until I got serious with my boyfriend and realized I would need money to do the things that I want in life (like go on vacations, get married, buy a house, have kids, etc.)

So about 8 months ago, I decided to get serious about paying it off. I now have about $9,000 in debt (after starting at over $13,000). I have never had any delinquent payments and my credit utilization isn't actually too bad, so I still have a good credit score. If I continue to make very aggressive payments, I could have it paid off in a year. Realistically, it'll take closer to 18 months.

How do I break the news to my boyfriend that I have this debt? Like many people, I feel a lot of shame about being in debt. He thinks of me as a very responsible person, and I'm embarrassed to disappoint him.

We are moving in together, and will be submitting rental applications together and starting a joint checking account to pay for household expenses. I think I need to be upfront with him about my financial state, but am afraid of what he will think of me. To be clear, this debt is 100% my responsibility and I have every intention of paying it off by myself before we get married.

TL;DR: Moving in with my boyfriend, have a lot of debt, feel ashamed, how do I tell him about it?"

I am just trying to find my ""happy place,"" I love working with computers on my own time and tinkering.  I want to get into a career that focuses on this aspect.  I am thinking of getting into certifications for A+, SQL(i like the database admin idea) , and maybe networking or cisco as a supplement.  I was originally thinking of going 4 year degree for computer science but with work and life it may take a while to complete.  

I do work for a company that I may be able to get an internship if I get some education under my belt.  

My main question is, if I go for a certification path and maybe an Associates of Science degree (2 year) and some interning for experience will this be an O.K. start or will it turn out to be a waste of time without a 4 year degree? 

Thank you for helping a lost soul...:)

Edit:  Thank you all for the advice, it's great that there are ways to get help like this from complete strangers.  I wish I could travel back and slap my younger self, but alas here I am.  I can not wait to have kids so I can tell them the things to do differently so they can not listen anf make mistakes:)

u0wtn,8,2012-05-23,Any help with apathy?,Mane19,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/u0wtn/any_help_with_apathy/,"I've been apathetic with everything in my life for at least 6 months now. I don't feel like I've been happy or exited in something since the first months with my girlfriend.

Here's some background:

I'm graduating my bachelors with a psychology degree. I can't really get a decent job until after my masters. However, I don't know which field to choose. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. I love psychology and understanding the mind. But, I don't see myself working in the field. I love animals. And would love to be able to work in something related to them. But wouldn't know where to start. I'm lucky to have a father that is willing to pay for my masters program but for him to do that I need to make a decision now. So I made the decision of studying behavior analysis. Not a career path that I'm truly fascinated by. I have an internship in the field, working with autistic children and it's not too bad. But I'm not motivated to do anything, ever.  

I am also gay and haven't come out to my parents. This is eating me inside. However, I can't risk telling them and them cutting me off financially. 

I've been with my girlfriend a year and a bit now and she's great and has put up with all my shit. I don't want to lose her because of me being in a weird moment in my life. We fit too well together.

My self-esteem is gone because I feel useless and don't know what to do with myself. Because of this, I've gotten extremely socially awkward and constantly try to avoid being in social situations. The only true friend's I have live far from me. I'm bored with my life but can't seem to find the energy to change it. I have tried forcing myself into the world but it hasn't changed the fact that i'm unhappy. 

Does anyone know of something that I can do in order to make myself enjoy life again?

EDIT: I also forgot to add that I feel guilty quite often. I feel guilty for being gay and not letting my parents know while I still depend on them financially. I feel guilty for not knowing what to do with life. I feel guilty for being socially awkward, for being apathetic in life, and for not being the person I want to be. It all weighs me down a lot but I dont know how to change those thoughts."

One of my nipples has recently just started hurting so much, and I'm not quite sure why. I am thinking it might be because of my baby's thrush, but is it normal that it would only be the one nipple? It started the day I started my internship, last Wednesday. I thought I had a clogged duct when I got home (away for 3 hours) because the pain started from inside. Now, the nipple is cracked on top, and it is toe curling pain whenever she latches on. It's as bad as when she was a week old and learning to nurse, only now shes older so she likes to ""knead"" my breast and push at it sometimes, or grab it in her fist and I just want to cry it hurts so bad! I have been trying not to avoid nursing on that side, but I am in so much pain. Even when she is not nursing, that nipple has just stayed erect since the pain started, so it hurts all the time. 

Is there anything I can do? I just broke out my lanolin again, and I have even tried putting some of her nystatin on my nipple. Would a nipple shield help? What should I do? Breastfeeding has come so easy for us until now, I am at a loss."

At least until he gets back that is. He says he had gotten a text from my ex, saying that we had gotten together for a night (like hell) and he was just really suspicious. We figured that in order to break the jealousy, and to lighten the air, we're going to be somewhat committed while he is away. Thank you so much for the advice, and hopefully we'll still be together when he gets back! 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months now, and the last two weeks, he's been gone on vacation (he's doing some summer internship for another month), and things have been going okay until yesterday. 
    Yesterday, I woke up with my thighs and biceps sore. I have no idea why, and I'm not sexually active, and I don't exercise. I told him this, and he got really weird. He stopped texting me, and was doing the ""..."" texts whenever I tried to get him to talk. I told him that whatever suspicions he has, are wrong. He's still suspicious, and he won't even talk to me. The second time I tried talking to him, I told him,"" If I was cheating on you, would I tell you? I don't cheat. I don't have anyone else but you, and I love you. I told you I'm waiting for you, and that I want you to be my first. Do you not trust me?"" I know, the trust line is a low blow, but I feel really hurt. I was shaking and kinda crying (which is something I don't do). He was saying how he does care, and I got kind of bitchy and said that he didn't. Last conversation we had ended with

*  Him: Would you just stop 
*  Me: Fine, I'll just shut up and say I'm sorry to make you feel better.

Am I in the wrong here? I realize that some of the things I've said, are hurtful, but does he have a right to be so jealous and un-trustworthy of me?

TL;DR: I woke up sore, and he's accusing me of cheating. We're both 17 and in a 5 month relationship.

u2l7h,9,2012-05-24,"Unemployed, well qualified international student and forced to leave the USA as visa expires and quickly spiraling into depression. Need advise and support.",junkystuff85,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/u2l7h/unemployed_well_qualified_international_student/,"This is going to be a really long story. So I will try to cut out the details as much as possible. Heck, I am tearing up just writing this so please excuse my post if it seems long.

I came to the US to earn my Master's degree in biotech (molecular biology) as a top ranked student from India. I had a solid job offer back home in the IT industry which I turned down to come and study here. I applied to 5 universities in the US and got accepted by all 5 with offers  of tuition benefit with paid graduate assistantship. I selected a top ranked university and studied really hard to finish my degree in 2 years with top grades. I had a great mentor who tried to convince me to join a PhD under his wing. However, I was not sure about doing a PhD because of the length and commitment it takes especially in science. I mean there was a grad student who was in his 7th year of PhD and a postdoc who was struggling to get results on his project when I joined the lab. Both these people were well in their late 30's, underpaid and had failing relationships. I didn't want to end up like that and planned for a career in the biotech/pharma sector after graduating.

In 2 years, I worked my butt off as a graduate assistant, worked as a paid intern for a respected biotech company for a summer project and got a co-authorship in a major publication. Unfortunately I graduated in a recession. Despite this, I got a job offer in the University hospital from a research investigator who was impressed by my thesis defense. I liked his research, trusted him and joined his lab as a lab tech utilizing my student work permit (which is called OPT and extended to about 3 years). The student work permit is usually used to gain experience and then move on to a employer sponsored H1B visa. I realized immediately that he was a bad boss as he exploited me and made me work from 8am to 11pm everyday including weekends while paying me almost nothing. I felt sad and searched elsewhere for work. Then one fine day, I was laid off because the funding for my project was pulled when my boss' grant wasn't renewed. I applied everywhere and networked fiercely to land another job. No luck. In 6 months, I was completely depressed and was planning to leave the US. Then, 3 days before my flight, I was made an offer by another researcher in the same university hospital. He took me on promising me a H1b visa. I was a little reluctant considering my previous experience but he convinced me to take his offer. I worked really hard for him and single handedly got an almost abandoned project up and running for his lab. The week after the project was completed, he laid me off citing lack of grant funds. I felt shattered. My gut instinct told me I was exploited again and I became very depressed. However, I updated my resume, had it reviewed by a professional resume writer and applied everywhere I could. Networked fiercely, called up every recruiter and tried to land something. Unfortunately, my resume rang alarm bells because

1) I am an international student who required visa sponsorship in a tough economy and political climate.
2) I had two short job stints somehow implying that I wasn't a reliable long term employee no matter how I tried to explain it on a resume.
3) Even when I did get interviews, everything would go fine. Then, I would be asked my immigrant status and rejected on a made up reason afterwards.

I tried volunteering or a contract job but my visa situation doesn't allow flexibility as much as US citizens. The company I interned for doesn't hire foreign workers or even local for that matter ever since the recession hit. All my contacts in academia assured me of help but did nothing despite repeated attempts contacting them. Some employers tried to offer me a really lower salary compared to American peers without promising a work visa so I rejected them based on principle (I hate wage depression) and my previous experiences. Then there were consulting IT/healthcare analysis companies run by guys who sponsor work visas for desperate immigrants by faking resumes, and placing them in bigger corporations and skimming the immigrants salary for the entire duration of the work visa. Bigger corporations turn a blind eye to this as they avoid paying high salaries and benefits. It is really unfair and disgusting.

One company assured me that they would sponsor the work visa for the right candidate. They interviewed me, flew me all the way to their offices and were impressed by my presentation. In the final round, they said they wouldn't sponsor my work visa. And then as a cruel joke I was told by the contract recruiter of that company that they actually don't sponsor work visas at all for mid-level research positions. They flew me there because they had a certain amount in their budget they had to use up for recruitment by the end of their quarter and they thought they would use it on me and a few other candidates. I was completely heartbroken.

Basically no one would give me a chance at all despite my credentials. I understand that I shouldn't just expect a job in a different country when its own people are suffering. But, I worked hard, competed and studied equally well with my American peers here and am not a guy who just came here with nothing and am asking for something. All people did was exploit me here. Please understand that I have no anger against this country at all but just against my situation. All I wanted to do was work here for a while to gain experience and move back to my country as I miss my parents and home a lot.

I am now 27 years old and I have now been unemployed in the US for almost a year and will be leaving soon as my visa will be expiring. Going back I have to face embarrassment and humiliation from friends and family at being unemployed as the biotech sector in India is grossly underpaid and very nascent. Only the most experienced people get a good job there and I have no experience to speak of. My dad is so sad and depressed because he feels he ruined my future since he was the one who forced me to study biotech as he paid for my education in India. I did argue against it back then but in an Indian household there is only so much that can be done. My mom cries at seeing me depressed and I am crying myself to sleep every night not knowing what to do. I can't help looking back at my life and feel so depressed that all my achievements and accomplishments mean nothing now. I have sacrificed a lot so far. I gave up outings and parties with my friends to focus on my grades and research during school. I had a girl I really liked but had to break it off because I couldn't get a job. Despite many opportunities to take short cuts like cheating the immigration system to gain a job here I always took the right path and stuck by it. I am spiraling into depression and have trouble sleeping. I am trying hard to cheer up but I feel like I ruined my life completely. I know there are people worse off than me but I still can't help feeling depressed and I cry everyday. In 2 weeks time I will be leaving the US and am completely emotionally broken at how my life has turned out.

**TL;DR**

I have been unemployed for nearly a year after earning a Master's degree.

Will be forced to leave the US after trying really hard to get a job here as my visa will expire soon.

Feel completely depressed and cry everyday about my current situation. Deeply spiraling down into a dark and negative mood with no motivation at all."

2. How long does it usually take to get alterations done on shirts, pants, or suits? (By minor I mean shortened sleeves or hemming)

3. I have a giant god damn adams apple and long neck that makes my collared shirt choices hell (Eg: I take a small shirt but large collar.) Is it difficult to get a collar on a shirt altered?

u1vm9,6,2012-05-23,IT networking experience + BA: options for finding work in Japan?,renegade_traveler,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/u1vm9/it_networking_experience_ba_options_for_finding/,"I am a 26 year old Canadian in the Toronto area, looking to move to a major Japanese city in 2013. I have my Bachelor's in History, and I’ll be finishing a community college diploma program by the end of 2012 in “Network engineering.” I have entry level IT skills in Cisco networking, as well as system administration. By the time I graduate I’ll have my CCNA as well. I have a year of experience working for a major telecommunications company as a paid networking intern. In terms of my Japanese ability, I already have my JLPT N5 and continue to study almost daily. I have been to Japan twice during the past 2 years.


I want to pursue 1 of 2 paths:

1) Enter Japan on a working holiday visa (6 months + 6 months) and look for work in my field. Since my Japanese isn’t fantastic, I assume I would be looking for work with International (English speaking) companies in Tokyo, Osaka and the other major city centers.

2) Get a job through a private English teaching school (1 year contract usually?) before heading to Japan, and look for another job in my free time. 

My main concern is the job market for someone such as myself with my current N5 Japanese ability. I realize getting work with a Japanese company might be difficult if not impossible, but I was hoping there might be something with an international company requiring English speakers with some Japanese ability.

Realistically I could probably afford 6 months on my own if I chose the working holiday Visa. If I came over with a visa sponsorship I would almost certainly have to ensure I am placed in a major city to increase my job finding prospects, so JET is out of the question. Ultimately if I could not find work in my field I would at least come home with better Japanese skills, most certainly. 

Does anyone out there have any experience looking for IT work in Japan with limited Japanese skills?
What are my chances of finding something decent within 6 months?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, opinions, comments etc.

She just started a pretty stressful internship, and recently we've been getting in fights because she feels as though I'm not emotionally supporting her.

I've been doing my best to be there for her - calling/texting her when I can, telling her I love her, how strong she is, that I believe in her, things like that. But when she's feeling scared or sad, she has a tendency to lash out at me - blaming everything on me, asking why I can't just support her, saying I'm making her feel guilty. It generally progresses like that until I get really upset, and then she gets mad at me for being upset/standing up for myself instead of supporting her. She'll say I never really cared about her and keeps threatening to break up with me.

I'm not really sure what to do. This past week has been particularly rough because I've just had surgery on my legs so I've been in a lot of pain and kind of out of it cause of pain meds, but that hasn't seemed to matter. She got upset with me for taking my pain meds and falling asleep instead of talking to her.

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I just want our relationship to work out and I want to be there for her and support her the best I can, I just don't know what to change.

Essentially, I had an internship with a big company while I was in college. Graduated as a business major in May 2009, on the downswing of the crash. The job offer I'd received was rescinded three weeks before I walked across the stage, so I moved directly back in with my parents as I looked for serious work while working 15 hours a week folding towels at my gym. I got a job at GNC for a week; then they rebudgeted, realized they couldn't afford my salary, and fired me.

After several months of failing to find work, I moved to a motel (that, unbeknownst to me upon move-in, was a major weapons drop for multiple area gangs) in Research Triangle Park and became Durham's only bilingual business major Office Depot cashier and Papa John's delivery driver. I worked around 60 hours a week between the two jobs and delivered resumes to every business I could come across. I stopped counting after printing and distributing an entire ream of paper's worth of resumes. I did this for five months, living off dead pizzas (unclaimed or returned by customers) and shitty lunch meat sandwiches. I dealt with the extreme stress of all of it by drinking copious amounts of Olde English 800 foties, which caused me to gain tons of weight.

Eventually, I got a tip from an old coworker saying that I should apply to the document management division of a different business line of the company I had interned for. Two days before my interview, so much snow fell in NC that the governor declared a state of emergency. I drove a typically 4 hour trip over 9 hours in 6 inches of snow to make it back to the interview. The day of my interview, and I am not making this up, my Papa John's was robbed at gunpoint and one of my managers was non-fatally shot.

I didn't get the job I interviewed for, but one of the women on the board I interviewed in front of is married to the head of the IT department, and she thought I was charismatic and confident enough not to let me go, so she gave my resume to her husband. It got passed down to the head of Applications Support, who called and asked if I thought I could do IT work. I told him I liked computers, and that, if I sucked at it, I would save him the trouble and quit six months in. Otherwise, that they'd have to match my original job offer's salary.

He hired me. I started work Feb 15th, 2010. I met my girlfriend after moving into my own apartment in March 2010. Six months in, I got a 20% raise.  On March 9th, 2012, I closed on a three-story house, and last Thursday, I bought a [2010 Dodge Challenger](http://images.thecarconnection.com/med/b5-blue-challenger_100179668_m.jpg). I have a bar (with two-tap kegerator!), game room, gym, movie theater, band room, and *smoking lounge* in my house now. All of this at 25.

TL:DR; I do not take a single bit of my success for granted. I got one freak break, and it changed my life immensely. Be tenacious. Be ambitious. Be confident. No matter where you are right now, you may be only two years from having a basement bar and smoking lounge (or more!) in your house. Every single one of you can repeat this shit that I've done as long as *you* know that you can. And I look forward to reading a success story from each and every one of you. Good luck, wolves."

First off I'm so sorry that this update is so overdue. The box has cleared customs and everything and is finally on its way to England! It came on a mini adventure with me while it was in Rochester. I received the box from Mirgaine_Life who lives in Boston, MA. Then I finished school and moved everything back to Boston, MA for a summer internship I have here :)

Sorry about that everybody! I'll put some pictures up in a bit of what I took but here's some of what I put in:

- A nice chocolate black tea
- A raspberry green tea. There's another one in there right now but I thought more variety couldn't hurt!
- A vietnamese black
- A really great white tea... the name is slipping my mind :)
- An addition to the notebook (my handwriting is terrible)
- A maple black tea
- Another maple/spice kinda mix black tea

Unfortunately I had to trade out the box while I was at the post office as they wouldn't accept the box it was in :(. So I couldn't decorate the  box while I was there. I had some stickers and stuff to put on but now the box is fresh and ready to be redecorated!

u67f7,0,2012-05-26,"Need some advice, trying to figure out next steps. Don't know enough about game and not enough time to read. ",uberafc,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/u67f7/need_some_advice_trying_to_figure_out_next_steps/,"Throwaway account. - *KIND OF LONG AND A LOT RAMBLING


I am taking some summer classes at a local college. I already graduated but going back to school to figure out what i want to actually do. I'm 25, not working right now. 


I've never been great with girls and mostly i never tried after a few blowouts. 


So anyway i have a quick short summer class and I've been talking with a girl in class. need to know what to do next, don't have time to read a lot  of (game material) and all i know is snippets of what i have read from here and other boards. i prefer natural game, being myself and just owning it as opposed to trying to be something i'm not. Thats what i used to do in the past (try to not be myself) I'm a geek, and i'm a loser, and i don't care 


Don't have many interests and i'm mostly boring (don't like drinking, bars, clubs - do like movies/tv, music, video games, technology, gadgets,  - don't got much going in my life as i'm back in school trying to figure out what to do, she goes back to school out of state and only around for the summer. &lt;-none of that should have any effect though on my actions right???  

Though i'm trying to get my shit together - get fit, eat right, learn more, etc, actually find a career and make money, but the last part i'm just not fully invested in yet.  


Never had a real relationship, still clueless with girls - but i'm a little more relaxed, confident with age and i know there are things you should say and not say, just not 100% sure on what those are. 


Real quick - i need to know what to say, how to move to nxt steps, when and how to get things sexual and escalate, initiate kino (where and when - in class?), should i ask her out to lunch (we both bring our lunch but maybe we can eat together) or see if shes seen any movies lately and tell her lets go friday. I'm interested in a relationship - short term or long term. I know not to expect anything, but i don't want to NOT try.


Been super anxious lately because of all this - need to not be... worried about things not going well and then still seeing her in class - shes on my table. worst case scenario i'd like to just be friends (if all else fails i got to know a bit more and hang out with a cool chick) - changed my attitude here too from what it used to be. I'd get all lame if things didn't work out... but screw that, who cares, or atleast i try not to anymore. 


I'm mostly winging everything here, and any info would help. I have a lot of things going against me (broke, not that attractive, balding, no job and no life, ) but more and more lately i've just stopped trying to worry about all that shit. I work on what i can but some of it is simply out of my control or i'm just not ready for it yet. can't worry about everything. Not sure if this is a good atttitude to have but usually i just worried. I'm slowly trying to get my life in order and trying to find a career that i actually enjoy but still super unsure of whats going to happen. Now i'm just trying to do some of the things i DIDN""T do the first time around when i was too focused on my grades and just getting a job (even that plan was flawed because i should have gotten good internships or done more research - my lack of confidence doesn't help)

* being broke - need first date ideas? basically how can i move this out of the classroom. I don't like to party/drink, and i don't have too many friends. I'm not dying for friends either though. I do pretty okay, not lonely or anything.

* I don't want to have to CHANGE my current status, in fact i can't in short term either. Does that mean i should have all my shit together (be working, making money, super fit, ) before dating girls?

* How and when to escalate sexually?

* What things to say, what not to say? 

* What does it mean when she mostly talks about herself? Is that a good thing?

u5vf5,13,2012-05-26,"Seven days without fapping, time to make it official. Please, tell me how NoFap has changed your everyday life, your relationship with girls, and also with yourself.",FapOnStrike,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/u5vf5/seven_days_without_fapping_time_to_make_it/,"Hello hello everyone, 
First of all : I'm French, so I might make some mistakes while writing my text, which may be quite long. 

So I don't really remember how I discovered this subreddit, I believe it was on askreddit or something. 
I used to be a FapAddict. Two times a day minimum, and it could be in the morning, during the day, when coming back home, before going to bed, and even sometimes when waking up with a boner during the night.
I would most of the time watch porn, but I could also do it without, thinking about someone I know. 

My problem isn't porn : I have some sex from times to times, and I dumped my last GF in March. The thing being that I'm quite good at talking to people, and have some culture on my own (don't get me mistaken, I'm not here to explain that I'm better than others, but just to clarify my situation). 

I started fapping around 11/12 I think. At the time, some friends were talking about it, how they would have huge boners when waking up, and how good it was to fap like a monkey. I tried it, bla bla bla, and long story short, it ended up with me being a FapAddict. I used to be chubby until I hit 15 y/o, which might be taken into consideration to understand my problem. So until that age, I couldn't have GFs or anything, as I was seen as the fat working nerd of my school. 
Then I became 16, started loosing weight without even trying, and I started dating girls.  

The real problem with me, is that it's really rare that I am sexually aroused in my everyday life. When I see my friends, checking every girl they see, talking about how they are wanting to have sex, bla bla, I started thinking it was strange I would not be thinking that. I do like to check some boobies/ass in the street when it's beautiful to see, but never ended up with a huge boner because of it. 

At some point, I started considering I could be gay or something, thinking : ""Hey, maybe that's why I've always prefered skinny girls rather than ones with huge breasts and shit!"". But I never could find myself attracted to any man, and knew deep down it wasn't the problem. 

As I said, I've been dating and having GFs, but I never looked for it. Mostly happened by them falling in love with me. And the worst part is that when in a couple, I'm never the one wanting to have sex. (Yeah, I kept masturbating every time I was dating). I'm now 21, and the problem is not solved. 

So one week ago, I found this subreddit, and started reading your stories. Putting aside people doing it for religion, I read lots of things about how it could help overcome depression, start talking more to girls, feel more confident, bla bla. Because the fact is that when I'm out, I could have many chances with diferent girls, but never try, because I don't feel the need. Also, even if I have good friends, and am having a good time at school, people see me as the guy who ""doesn't give a shit about others"". One day, I can wake up and just turn my phone off for a week, living in my own world outside of everything. It's my kind of depression. Every 2/3 months, I just want to be alone, eat in my room, and stay there smoking cigarets and reading books. 

I knew I was going to a huge party tonight in a friends house, with people I've never met. So last week, saturday, I wanted to try this. One week without fapping, for the first time (record being around two days), and see if it might change something tonight. I know that if I don't do anything tonight it wouldn't prove anything, but if it does, it would give me some kind of confirmation. And the only change I want to notice is in myself, if I feel more incline to talk to girls and flirt with them. 

And as far as I know, I've been having job interviews for an internship this summer for the last three weeks, and the only one that went well and ended up with me being taken was yesterday, which give me my first good point for having stopped masturbation. I was more confident, and I knew it. 

And I hope tonight I'll notice some changes. Cause for the past two days, I've been dreaming of sex (I sleep naked, which might not help), and almost gave up today in front of my computer, thinking about a girl I know. I also know that anything you'll say might give me more strength. (And the fact of writing all of this already convinced me to not fap, at least for now). 

Thanks a lot if you read the whole text. Hope I'll have some answers. 
And this is not my real reddit username, but I have some redditor friends, and don't want then finding it for now, and make my life a nightmare. 

PS : Also, in a side note, been on a diet for the past 40 days. Already lost 5 kgs (you do the math :P). Another motivation for me. Trying to have the best summer of my life. :]

Cheers!

EDIT : Ok, the need to fap came back again. God I feel miserable, hah!"
u7lz8,18,2012-05-27,Having mixed up thoughts about suicide and worried I don't have enough paracetamol to do it...,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/u7lz8/having_mixed_up_thoughts_about_suicide_and/,"Sorry for the bold title. guess I know I need help but so far nothing is making me feel better.

My mother is a horrible woman to me, since I can remember she called me fat, even when my school got me to see a nurse because they were worried I was anorexic - when I told my mother this she laughed and told me to stop lying.

I'm now 22 and this hasn't improved. I've gone to university but am now living back at home with my parents as I am just an intern and do not earn enough to not live there.

So since living at home since March (I went and lived in France for six months after university) she's become a monster. I feel hopeless and sick constantly because of her. She went to the beach today with my dad, I didn't go, and when she came back all she's said is how fat and hopeless I am (I am 5'9 and a UK size 10) she chucked scales at me, asked me whether I wanted pure lard for dinner and now is just going on and on about how pathetic and useless I am to her, and how my dad is on her side with this.

My dad has said nothing in this argument, except to ask me whether I went to the gym.

I have attempted suicide in the past, clearly failed, didn't see anyone about it, just got through university without seeing anyone (various panic attacks throughout, particularly at the end of my final year where I drank and took sleeping pills, scared about going home again) I spoke to my doctor about not sleeping well due to exam stress and got given the pills, but I don't have them anymore.

I want to speak to someone, I do, but I don't get home until late and by then the surgury is shut, and I can't really take a morning off or whatever to go to the doctor as I'm just an intern and really want this job :(

Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading if you got this far.. I don't really  know what I'm going to get out of this post, but hey, feel slightly calmer for just writing it down."
u72fi,5,2012-05-27,how do I survive my parents?,sphagetti_throwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/u72fi/how_do_i_survive_my_parents/,"These are prolly just extreme first world problems :3 (and sorry for the wall of text and... well... randomness!!) Letting this out here so that I don't have to bother my friends about it. They already know most of this but I don't like ranting in person. Feel free to downvote or whatever you want, just needed to get this out on a throwaway.

So, I'm a rising college senior and 21. Spending what I hope will be my last summer at home, working part-time and taking two classes, which start in June.

First, my parents have a growing boutique vineyard on the side. I love the vineyard. I've put a lot of sweat and hard work into it. But I don't want to be tied to a place for ever, necessarily. Especially considering the land it's on is mortgaged to the hilt and I'd be taking over paying down a ridiculously big loan if I took it over ever. EEEEEEK.

I'm a woman, and am constantly told that I'm expected to live at home until I marry, and am expected to continue and expand the part-time family business in addition to (or, they're really hoping for instead of) my own career plans, as the oldest child. I don't want a giant amount of interest preventing me from saving money for when I get old, or from ever being able to afford a little budget travel, even.

I wasn't allowed to move out of the dorms for my previous time in college due to (again) being female. My mother was afraid that I'd be raped if I lived alone or with friends, and wouldn't let me get a part-time job with classes in session to pay for my own living accommodations (which would have been worked out and left THEM with less to pay and ME with less debt in future). Even though I could have gotten a nice cheap place, even alone, for easily 1/2 of what the dorms cost them per year. Yeah, they're paying for part of my college. I pay most of my tuition and books from my summer job, plus anything not covered under the dorm meal plan, and the rest of my tuition goes on a loan. They pick up the tab for my housing. For this coming year they want me to live at home and take commuter rail and then a bus for an hour and a half each way between our house and my school. I am in an engineering program. I will be commuting at 3 am, no joke. I will get no sleep, and then probably burn my whole hand off with a soldering iron in circuits lab or go into a coma from sleep deprivation or something.

I can't get any homework done in the house because people are always banging around and turning the TV on at full blast (thin walls ftw) or asking me to help with a project. Which is why the super crazy late commute. Last semester, I had homework that took until midnight or 1 am 6 days a week (including all day Sunday usually, leaving me with a few hours during the day on Saturday free). I'd get up at 5 every weekday, do two more hours of work, go work out for an hour, and head to my internship, which started at 9 am every day.

My dad also constantly makes these ""oh I can't wait until I have all these grandchildren around"" sort of references, and I just kind of have to look at him and go ""......"" (I don't necessarily want kids, especially not now, for pete's sake! maybe MAYBE maybe when I'm 30 or so....?! I want to get a Ph.D in engineering and work in a damn research lab eventually, I think that should maybe be taken care of first............ but hey, what do I know.) I do fairly well in school. It's not like my only life choice is to find some herp-a-derpin rich arse and seduce him/become a trophy wife... not that I'm probably even good looking enough to be a trophy wife, but you get the idea.

Furthermore, I had/have a large tattoo on my side (not visible with clothes on, even) for a dead friend. I was told I had a choice between being disowned and undergoing laser removal once my parents found out about it, about two years after getting it finished. So.... being the dutiful child I am... decided to undergo multiple sessions of a process that is literally more painful than anything else I've ever experienced, up to and including breaking bones. It makes me sick to look at it and think about what it was supposed to be. My mom keeps asking to look at it to make sure it's fading properly whenever she gets me alone for a minute and makes these little ""no respectable man will want you with a thing like that on you"" speeches. It just makes me grind the fuck out of my teeth.

So I guess back to being home for the summer. I'm used to eating maybe light breakfast and dinner on a less-busy day and working out seven days a week. My parents have a gym membership that my dad uses for yoga classes and my mom doesn't use at all, yet she refuses to transfer her portion to me while I'm home in the ""oh I might go next week"" sort of hopes. She's massively overweight and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Apparently she started putting on weight right around the time I was born. It's truly disgusting. I've not got a lot of money, though I work my ass off in school so that maybe someday I will. I won't be able to work at my part-time job more than 20 hours a week, and will barely be able to afford my part of my tuition + books in the fall. I can't really pay for my own membership because it isn't viable. 

I refuse to end up a fat useless bitch like every other fucked up woman in my mom's family. I go stir crazy if I don't exercise. So I run a few miles in the mornings, but we live in a rural area and I get shit for that too, in case, you know, a serial killer picks me up or a mountain lion eats me or some shit.

I will go to grad school, not just get a stay-at-home type job after my undergrad like my parents always assumed I would. Likely it'll be paid for via loans/scholarships whatever the fuck I can get but I'm not cut out for this getting fat and basically doped up nonsense, shit, I want to be healthy and happy! I have career goals that don't involve getting preggers or married right now! I might want to go to school out of state if I get into a program out of state that's really good in my area of engineering!

I'm lactose-intolerant, which comes from my dad's side of the family is really hard for my grandmother (mom's mother), who also lives with us, to wrap her head around. She likes to cook for us and everything has cream or milk or cheese in it and it makes me throw up or feel massively ill without meds. It's not like I chose this to happen to me, dammit. I'd eat the food and be quiet about it if I could. I take lactase tabs with every meal and it doesn't always completely help. I am miserable after pretty much every meal I don't fix myself. I've been accused of everything from being bulimic to making this shit up because I could eat milk products til maybe freshman year of high school. My other grandmother and half my cousins on my dad's side are also lactose-intolerant. 

Also, they watch television for a couple hours every night during and after dinner, and if I don't partake, they freak out and call me (on the phone or by yelling my name across the house) until I do. I don't watch television as a rule when I'm in control of my own schedule, cause I'd rather talk to people or work on shit or just... anything else really. Other than having the TV on, we don't talk during dinner. They love sitcoms and stuff that just doesn't appeal to my sense of humour. I'm sitting there wishing I could find How I Met Your Mother and Good Christian Bitches and even fucking Cheers funny. I just want to pass out. It's not entertaining for me at all.

As well.... I like a Guinness or whiskey sour or something every once in awhile at a party or whatever but they drink every night. It's always ""want a glass of wine/beer/etc"" and I'm just like ... ""I gained ten pounds in the last two weeks from alcohol alone even with running twice as far as I do when I'm at school every day, *hell* no"" in my head. They get fucking hammered every weekend. Like sorority-girl-college-drinking-record-breaking-keg-stand-drunk. I'm the one that should be getting hammered, but it's never really appealed to me after my first time being drunk. It's not fun for me. I don't understand it.

This endless cycle of alcohol and television is because my mom has no life/friends/whatever outside of her job and gives my dad no end of shit every time he goes to hang out with HIS friends. She has no hobbies. She doesn't make time for anything except TV and drinking and reading the occasional Danielle Steel novel. My brother and I usually have to argue with her for on average an hour before being allowed to go out or do anything outside of the house, including dates with our significant others, or time with friends. Though she's gotten a little more lenient about this, she also freaks out at me about ""boys who don't pick you up from your house aren't respecting you"" and I'm just kind of thinking ""I wouldn't bring home anyone I didn't have a serious relationship with. I've been in exactly one of those. It sucked. Hell no. Besides, subjecting others to witnessing this batshit crazy relationship firsthand would just be unkind.""

My grandmother agrees with and backs up literally everything my mom says, but outside of her quilting group at church, she also has no friends outside of the house and it's usually her and my mom ganging up on my brother and I, and sometimes also on my dad.

Add to this that they're straight-up hardcore Christian fundamentalists. Recall I'm technically not allowed to  move out until I marry. I'm seeing a man at present, but I've dated women in the past and might do so again. I'm fucking terrified of the argument that will result if ever this comes out around the house. Shit would hit the fan if they ever somehow learned I haven't been a virgin since I was sixteen.

Unfortunately, I have no plans to marry anytime soon.... I can't take the right wing politics, the alcohol, the television, the literal cheese, the insulting ""you'll be glad when that thing on your side is gone"" talks every three days, the whole fucking thing. It's like extreme culture shock.

*TL;DR:* bizarre/conflicted relationship with parents/grandmother. How fix/deal with?! I have to live here all summer, and possibly after that. I still love these people even if they're making my life way more complicated than it needs to be. I want to be a good kid and everything, it's just really fucking difficult sometimes.

Background


So, this all started back in September. It was the beginning of a series of life events that triggered a major depressive episode that I'm still trying to work my way out of. I'm 21, going to be a senior in college. Over the summer, my family found out that my step-dad was having an affair... my family's a big part of my life and my brother and sister are really small. My mom was so humiliated that she couldn't tell any of her friends, and was really relying on me to support her.

I was supposed to graduate this year-- was taking 18 credits in the Fall and had an internship as well. It was really a recipe for disaster and after only the first week of school I was already falling behind. I started going to psychotherapy because I thought it might help me keep it together better than I have in the past... but if anyone's gone through therapy they'd know what I know now: it gets A LOT worse before it gets better.


I was living in a nice house with 4 of my friends-- all girls. One of them I knew since middle school and considered one of my best friends, we'll call her L. One of the others I became really close with over the past year, we'll call her K. The other two were really friends of L and K but I knew them pretty well. It was the beginning of September when things started to get really bad for me, in terms of falling behind in school and my family falling apart. I wasn't around much and when I was I can't imagine I was very pleasant... but I had no idea what was coming. 


The 4 roommates called a ""roommate meeting"" and ganged up on me, saying I was no fun to be around and that my presence was a drag, etc, etc. They didn't like my boyfriend who was living out of town and came to stay a few times. I have no idea what gave them the sense of entitlement they felt to verbally kick me when I was obviously down... but by the end of the conversation I'd told them that my life wasn't going to get any easier and if it was affecting them so acutely, I'd have to move out.


I found a subletter right away and moved in with my boyfriend. The girls flipped out about the idea of a subletter and delayed the process of meeting the girl I'd found for months. They talked all kinds of shit on me to anyone who'd listen. I can't to this day understand why they were so upset-- I paid my share of them rent until JANUARY and I moved out in September. I don't think many other kids in my situation would have done that. I thought I did everything I could to accommidate them during a time in my life that I was having a hard enough time taking care of myself: I moved out when they complained about not liking to have me around, I took a lot of my limited time to make sure I found a good subletter, and I paid the rent until THEY decided the subletter could move in.


After all that, the girl I'd known longest, L, would text me every once in a while to see when I'd move my stuff out. At this point, I was 100% shit broke...I'd saved money from my summer job but had to pay rent at a place I didn't live at, and throw in for the apt. my boyfriend and I share... and had to pay out of pocket for therapy because I don't have health insurance. 

-----

What I'm so upset about:


I told L that I would move when I could afford the truck and my boyfriend and I could afford to take off of work. I couldn't go back to school in the Spring because I couldn't afford it and had only gotten grades for 3/6 classes. ...In short, I was extremely busy. The text got more incessant as the months went on, but I was barely making $250 a paycheck. So, at the beginning of May, L texts me and says that its not her fault I have yet to finish the Fall semester and that if my stuff weren't out of the house by May 31, she was going to throw it out.

So, on Wednesday, I moved my bed frame and dresser with a ZipCar my friend rented for me for a few hours. I texted L to say that she could throw away my mattress and boxspring and if there was any other stuff, I would be able to get it in a week when I had my grandma's car. She asked why I couldn't just get the stuff now. I said because my rental time was up. She said, very condescendingly, that we were going to have to set another deadline. I about lost my mind at that point-- I told her that she was a huge bitch and that she could go ahead and throw what was left away if she couldn't be even remotely understanding of my situation.


Then she sent me a text saying that she's fed up of dealing with me and all of my problems. I found that offensive because I had not once spoken to her other than her texted to see when my stuff would be gone since I moved out. And we used to be ""friends!"" She said that she didn't need to know about my grandma's car or about how much the ZipCar cost (??) and that she gave me a deadline and was generous enough to extend it. It still makes me so upset: generous. I've been nothing but generous with this girl since I've met her. I would drive her to work, she was always eating my food, using my makeup, and she strung me along for months before finally committing to moving in to that house with me.

I told her she was a self-centered brat and that her life must really be boring if she was honestly that upset about my furnature (which wasn't even in the way-- there was 10x as much stuff left by other friends who'd lived there before in the basement...). I completely burned a bridge with her, which I feel really terrible about because we were friends for so long. And now I feel really angry because I feel like she's ""stolen"" my friends... she lives with one of my best friends and all of my close friends I've met in college really like her. 


I feel like I need to completely start over with new people because everyone around me just seem like self-absorbed pieces of shit. I say that because I've been trying to reach out to people since I've been so hurt by L, but no one has the time of day. Furthermore, a lot of people seem to take L's side on this. I feel like this is a pretty black and white matter-- I did everything I could to make the situation as easy for her as it could be and she's having a bitch fit because things aren't going her way. I understand that I've been a downer because of my personal situation, but, who wouldn't be?? I'm broke, my family was/is falling apart, I am really behind in progress on my degree and now I feel like I don't have any friends on top of it. What would you do if you were me, Reddit? Am I looking at this the wrong way? Please MMFB :-("

I broke up with a girl I was seeing (of ~6 months) about three months ago. I've been doing pretty well, just starting working out regularly again, handled the rest of my semester pretty well, and recently landed a high paying internship in my field of study. 

The relationship was bad nearly from day one. We were born out of an almost cheating scenario, if it wasn't for my tact and refusing to sleep with her it would have happened. The relationship was full of fun romantic things and amazing sex, but it was inherently toxic due to her immaturity, to the point where she was downright manipulative. She even alluded to committing suicide when we broke up...!! Nonsense! She did a number on my self esteem, and for the first month or two of being broken up I was done for good and didn't give it a second thought!

Now she's hanging around friends of mine - friends she never even considered seeing until after we broke up - and it's driving me nuts! I feel like I can't be friends with the friends I met through her because I feel that they may have some distorted picture of me through her manipulation and victim playing.... it's ridiculous! I am a good man with nothing but positive intentions, I don't deserve to have that weight on me! I broke up with her because of her actions!

For some reason, I don't know what it is, if it's the sex or the romance, or what she made herself out to be when we got together, I can't seem to let go of this girl. For all intensive purposes, I should be done with her and moving on.. but I'm not! I don't know if it's her recent excursion with my friends (""friends"") or my jealousy about sex or what... but I just need to move on! I made this decision and it is seriously perplexing me why moving on has been so difficult. 

I don't want to rebound with anyone but it seriously seems like the only option at this point. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this or is currently going through something similar? I'm out of my mind here. Help."
u9dbz,1,2012-05-28,My parents and I [20F] are disagreeing..again ,thejennadaisy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/u9dbz/my_parents_and_i_20f_are_disagreeingagain/,"First, a little background. I'm a college student, just finishing my junior year and looking forward to turning 21. I'm staying in my college town to complete an internship for credit and my boyfriend (of over 4 years) lives in a town nearby while he's taking summer classes at his university. 

My parents are quite strict, but up until I went away to college I was the perfect little obedient child. Well, as obedient as any teenager can be. To give some perspective, my WASP parents are basically as strict as my Chinese friend's first generation parents. 

Long story short, my parents found out I'm having sex and are basically forcing me to ""stop"" and come home even though I just found a job that will pay me $10.50/hour back at college and I haven't been able to find summer work at home for three years. Problem is, I have no intention of stopping and I really need the money. I don't see how their opinion has anything to do with my sex life and what's more I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. But I can't tell them that, because it will just make them more angry and less likely to let me go back. Their explanation of it is ""if you were doing drugs we wouldn't support you, sex is the same thing"".

I guess what I need here is some advice to help me face my parents and make them understand that I'm not 12 anymore. I love them, and I am forever indebted to them for supporting me financially through college but I can't take this anymore. I need to be my own person and make my own mistakes. 

**tl;dr : Parents found out I'm having sex, want me to stop. But I don't share their beliefs and don't think I'm doing anything wrong.**

I would like to tell the story of how they got me home to talk about this, but I feel like this is already a text wall. So if you want to know, ask in the comments. "

I haven't really messed with linux of any kind in a few years, and was wondering what I've missed. Specifically, I last used Ubuntu in 2010, and gentoo/gnome? at school 2005-2009 for word processing, coding python/java/c++/etc.

I'm starting work as a FOSS development intern in a week, and will be using whatever coding environment they provide. Anything I should be expecting to jump out at me? Have things got easier or harder?

Or is saying something like ""what's changed in Gentoo/Ubuntu in 3 years"" totally crazy?

EDIT: Just installed Ubuntu 12.04 (wubi). Had to boot about 10 times and mess with GRUB to get it to behave with my graphics card, then spent half an hour in xorg.conf to get my mouse working. Seems pretty much like what I remember. Sigh..."
u980k,12,2012-05-28,Help With Anaphoric Macro,alexeistukov,lisp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/u980k/help_with_anaphoric_macro/,"I used to write CL daily but sadly haven't touched it in quite some time. I also don't believe I ever used macros so extensively (beyond with-x style macros). I also recall that extensive abuse of anaphoric macros is a bad idea.

However, I'm trying to inject some more CL into my daily routine, and had a particular case where I want to make use of anaphora. I have a CL instance running that I use to notify me of some things, run some jobs manually and/or automatically. I'd like to write these monitoring pieces using something more human than what I have now.

I have a function that, given some config values, outputs a list of assoc lists of current state variables:

    (defun get-state (conn line)
      (declare (ignore conn line)) ; removed to simplify
      '(((""Count"" . 7) (""Stage"" . 6) (""LastUser"" . ""Mary""))
        ((""Count"" . 3) (""Stage"" . 4) (""LastUser"" . ""Ted""))))

And I write something like the function below where I basically write something like below (I could use remove-if-not below, but this is a simplified form):

    (defun monitor-when-ted-modified (conn line)
      (let ((states (get-state conn line)))
        (loop for state in states
              when (equalp (assoc-value state ""LastUser"" :test #'equalp) ""Ted"")
              collect state)))

I have a few scenarios such as ""send all filtered results"", ""send if single result &gt; N"" (which can be stated as a sort of the previous scenario), ""send if results change.""

Before I get too far down the rabbit hole, taking the ted-modified example, what I'd like next is something more like:

    (defmonitor (""ted-conn"" ""ted-line"")
        (equalp lastuser ""Ted""))

I've implemented this, which assumes a single assoc list, for the time being.

    (defun alist-to-let-clause (alist)
      (loop for (key . value) in alist
            collect (list (intern (string-upcase key)) value)))

    (defmacro amonitor (alist &amp;body body)
      (with-gensyms (let-clause)
        `(let ((,let-clause ,@(alist-to-let-clause ,alist)))
           (let ((it ""ok!"") ;; testing ability to use ""it""
                  ,@let-clause)
             ,@body))))

    &gt; (amonitor (first (get-state 1 2)) 1)

    (FIRST (GET-STATE 1 2)) 
    Error: Cannot take CAR of FIRST.

Now, it appears as though the expansion isn't occurring as I expect for the assoc list.

I started playing around with the above but have clearly (imo) forgotten how macros work. In the interest of both educating myself and in getting off the ground, I'd welcome any tips/help on this. I have copies of PCL, OL, LoL, LOL, etc., so I will be re-reading up, but this is work-related so I'd like to come up with something so I don't end up just doing it in Python.

Let me know if this is better suited to a different subreddit.**

I am a 21 year old female college student, married to a 25 year old full-time working male. We've been married since May 2010. We both gave our virginity to each other after getting married (2 months after to be precise, due to some physical trouble).

I remember he was so incredibly into me before we got married and before we had sex. We're Christian, so we were trying not to do sexual things before marriage, but he was often the one to initiate contact at that time.

Soon after having sex for the first time, I was the one always begging for it and getting refused. His excuse was something about me getting upset and he can't get in the mood. That was because I had some trouble concentrating and actually feeling anything, but I was asking him to help me through it by being more romantic, touching when I ask and not too soon, etc. But he always took offense as if I was not attracted to him. On the contrary, he is the most handsome guy I have ever seen. I thought that the moment I saw him in 2007, and I still think that after seeing his entire body.

Up to September 2011, things stayed this way. I was the one asking for sex, and more than half the time, he would refuse. The only times he wanted it was when his body really needed to do it. I tried to buy sexy underwear and outfits to seduce him, but they never worked. I tried to do sweet things for him to show my love, but that never worked. We had even moved out of his parents' house a few months before, so we had much more privacy to do what we wanted.

I had already tried Googling for similar situations over the past year, but I was doing it yet again, trying different search terms. I kept coming across forum comments saying things like ""He must have a porn addiction."" All this time, I completely dismissed such an idea, that my husband could be looking at that kind of thing. Sure, he looked at it from a young age, but I was under the assumption he had stopped before we got married.

Jokingly, I asked him one night, ""Do you look at porn?"" To make a long story short, I was on the floor in the corner crying my heart out, more than I have ever cried in my life. I could have continued for a long time, but my husband was threatening to kill himself with our big kitchen knife, so I had to compose myself to stop him. We even had sex afterwards, but I have no idea why.

He had been looking at r/gonewild since he began browsing Reddit in September 2010. At first he said he only did it when we were mad at each other and I would go to bed early. But he revealed that he did it even at other times, perhaps when I was gone at my night classes, or at work on the weekends.

It completely broke my heart into bits and pieces. I couldn't concentrate at work or school anymore. I began looking at my husband in a completely new perspective. I began seeing him as an evil traitor. I had already been betrayed by my father in my adolescent years, and had been in an abusive relationship with an older man online who cheated on me constantly. I was finally becoming a more whole person, but finding out what my husband had been doing made me break all over again.

My husband made it clear I should never ever tell anyone else. I don't even have anyone else TO tell. The only person I talk to semi-regularly is my little brother, but he is not the supportive type. Both of my parents want nothing to do with me and live far away. So I have no one to get support from. My husband on the other hand, all his family is right there in-town and they have always spoiled him with gifts and support. And he even tries to tell me to just stop talking to my little brother, my last relative who wants anything to do with me. It makes me want to throw up.

So, ever since finding this porn thing out, I have felt hurt to the core. I can't forget about it, or even truly forgive him. Sure, it's not as bad as physically doing things with another woman, but according to the Bible, it's the same as committing adultery in your heart. (Even if my husband hadn't converted me to Christianity, I'd feel just as hurt, so I guess I'm overly sensitive to infidelity on any level.)

I continue to bring up what he did in bouts of anger when we have arguments. I have said increasingly cutting things to him. I feel like he cannot say I have wronged him after what he has done to me. I have been completely loyal, whereas he has been at another female's apartment until late into the night, and he goes with other females to lunch, etc and thinks I am so horrible for asking him not to do this. Not to mention I've been the one asking for sex and making an effort to improve our sex life, and all he has done is betray me. I mean, I even beg to give him blowjobs and he is 99% of the time against it strongly (I guess my mouth is too small or something).

Now, I am in another state for 3 months for an internship with a huge company. My husband is at home alone, so he can go back to looking at his girls all he wants. It makes me so afraid and he doesn't understand why I'm so concerned. I insisted on sending him nude photos of me so he has something to keep him from gonewild, but he said he ""feels bad"" looking at naked pictures of me. That was a real WTF moment for me right there. He feels bad looking at his wife nude, but has no problem jacking off to random chicks' boobs??

This weekend has been a real mess for us, and we've only been separated a week. We aren't even talking to each other. I can't talk to him about this anymore because all he ever does is threaten to cut/kill himself. He never makes an effort to show he is truly sorry because he was STILL refusing sex. And he still emotionally abuses me, sometimes physically (though not with punches, it's hard to explain). He always has to criticize me, especially on my looks, and he likes to make me feel dumb as garbage. I feel I am worth NOTHING to him. Of course, having no one to support me and my husband putting me down, I feel like I am worth nothing overall.

Anyway, I just want to know I'm not crazy for feeling so hurt. And I think the core of this issue is not being able to tell anyone at all, and just letting it all manifest inside myself. Add that with my lingering trust and mental issues from my childhood, and we get a major depression or some other screwed up mental state.

Just for extra detail, [here is a sketch](http://i.imgur.com/7EYyD.jpg) that I drew last night, the left reflecting the moment I found out, the right reflecting how I feel dealing with it. 

**TL;DR - Husband was looking at porn for 1 year of our 2 year marriage, starting soon after getting married. I can't seem to forget about it, especially since he keeps refusing sex like before, along with abusing me at some level. I have no one to talk to about it at all. We are now separated for 3 months for my internship and I don't know how to ease my fear of him looking again since he's alone, and overall anger at what he did.**"

I'm hoping I can find someone here who is familiar with French labor laws, or has gone through a similar experience and can provide some advice! I have been accepted into an internship for the summer in Paris which I am very excited about. I have Spanish residency (I'm studying there) that will expire next year so I don't have to worry about obtaining a visa.

A French friend of mine though told me to be more cautious. I will be working at the company for 3 months, unpaid (they are a new company and claimed they couldn't afford to. And I already accepted the offer regardless because the opportunity was so good). Additionally, I have not been told of any contracts I have to sign (so I'm assuming, for now, that they won't be asking me to sign a contract).

My friend seems to believe that if I don't sign a contract, that what I am doing is illegal, but he can't be certain because he doesn't know the law very well. I plan on emailing the company asking them of any contracts I have to sign, but before I do, I'd like to know what are my rights as a foreign resident of the EU working in France, and what obligations do companies have towards their interns? What are the risks of not signing a contract with said company?"

So a little background: I received an internship 1.5k miles from home with a great company for the whole summer (3 months). We've know about this since around February, but even with the notice, it was still hard to leave each other, family and home. My family decided to take a road trip with me a week before my move-in date to my apartment, but my boyfriend wasn't able to go due to work. So, since I've left until now, it's felt like a vacation that I'm returning from soon. It hasn't hit me yet that I'm gone, which is another problem in itself. Let's focus on the boyfriend.

While I'm excited for this opportunity and it's going to be great for my future career, my boyfriend hasn't been feeling that great. Since I've left, he's had stomachaches and other ailments. He finally went to the doctor and they told him he has anxiety, which he was given a prescription for. When he told me about the diagnosis, I told him I didn't know how I felt about it and that hurt him. I'm worried for him and today he told me that he has to force himself to eat sometimes. 

I feel bad, because missing him and my family isn't at the forefront of my mind. I'm trying to experience this new part of the country which I've never been to before and absorb the experience of living on my own with responsibilities. It's exciting and I want him to be excited too. We've made plans to see each other around his birthday this summer and he's going to fly over here to drive back with me. 

He also has jealousy issues (which I have too, I'm not going to lie) from being cheated on by a majority of his previous girlfriends. While over here, I'm living in a house with 2 guys and a girl. I have had drinks with one of the guys when his friend is over, but I'm not a stupid bimbo like his other girlfriends (sometimes I want to burn them at the stake). I am also in a major that is largely male.

How do I help him and how can he help himself?

**tl;dr: I am far away from my boyfriend for 3 months and he has developed anxiety issues. How can we both help with the situation and what can I do to be better support?**"
ub3nh,14,2012-05-29,"Today was the first day I realized I don't really care about her anymore, thank you r/breakups",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ub3nh/today_was_the_first_day_i_realized_i_dont_really/,"Since my ex-gf broke up with me, 2 months ago, I have gotten in better shape (I can actually look in the mirror now and be proud of who I am), secured myself a summer internship on my own, without going through my dad or his friends, I have improved my relationship with my family and friends, all of whom have commented on how different I am now, and how considerate and thoughtful I have become, I have met tons of new people, and I learned to better navigate social interactions in general. I have cut down on smoking weed a lot, and have started going to therapy with a great therapist who is helping me work through my intense issues (C-PTSD from childhood abuse from my mother). Also, I volunteer at a local shelter a lot more, so now I get to walk and play with awesome rescue dogs and make their lives way better whenever I want to.    

I am happy now, and before I met this girl I wasn't happy, I was in a dark place. I was settling for her in a lot of ways, and now I realize that even though I'd like to be on good terms with her going forward, I really don't care either way, she is just, as gotye says, ""someone that I used to know."" If I run into her, I'll share some kind words if I feel like it, but all that pain is in my past, all the ways we hurt each other don't matter anymore. I didn't have much respect for her, she was narrow minded and her situation would have limited my options in life.    

I'm going to change the world one day, but not if I was stuck in a relationship with the first girl I fell in love with. I was immature, I didn't know what I was doing, and I realize that now. I did not like the relationship, I liked being able to have sex and companionship without putting much effort in, and that isn't a relationship, or even healthy.    

So, I just wanted to say thank you, r/breakups, the advice, feedback, and kind words you have given me, as well as just having a place to vent, have truly put me on the path to becoming a better person. Even the criticism I have received from some of you has opened my eyes to how controlling and insecure I can be, and I'm thankful for your honesty and bluntness.    

No contact works, even though it hurts, as does working out, and hanging out with friends and family. Take the advice guys, and it will get you through it.    

A quote that someone else shared with me that hits home:    

""Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""

-C.S. Lewis    

Take it easy guys!

uax3b,1,2012-05-29,could use some tree-related relationship help if you all dont mind.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/uax3b/could_use_some_treerelated_relationship_help_if/,"Hey guys! long time lurker first time poster, not to mention long time ent! I'll try and keep this short, and if you're high and hate relationship troubles (I do) i won't mind you skipping this one.

I guess I'll shortly set it up like r/relationships...I'm 20M she's 19F were same grade/same school/live close at home and away. Dating near 8 months

All is well, but of course the big black hole of our relationship...you guessed it...trees :(

She has the D.A.R.E. imprinted mindset of trees obviously, she still is scared of them. She keeps specifically saying she thinks its 'dirty' overall...

That's fine to me. I don't judge, and i NEVER impose that she must use at all. Anytime she'll corner me as to why I smoke so much (almost daily, after all my shits done) I have to convince her I'm not addicted and I basically verbally repost what's on the front page of r/trees about how its not horribly bad for you/going to be legal soon. Right now we're at an 'agree to disagree but still love each other' standpoint.

Some things that are going to test whether we're together or broken up within the next 4-5 months are/were...

1. Her internship drug test. She was tweaking for a month straight about failing her drug test after only taking only a few hits a full month before the standard piss test. She just passed (I knew she would the entire time).
why that matters: after all her tweaking I'm almost sure getting her to try trees again is almost never going to happen. And she specifically said if she had failed she would have had to break up with me (fucking lame i know) so I see how quick to fire she is on the issue.

2. My apartment next year at school is going to be filled with me plus three other serious Ents, we're planning on smoking quite a lot. 
why that matters: if I don't confront her in some way about trees or get her to at least enjoy them she'll never come over and byebye gf.

After reading 1, you see she HAS smoked. Only a few times with me, but she's never gotten high. Or claims to have not. I've tried doing it with her alone, with her and all her friends, with her in a party setting. Part of the reason I feel this is even an issue is that she doesn't see what I get out of trees because she's only gotten the bad side of it (burning lungs from first time smoking, bad taste, bad first time smell, everyone else is high and she isn't, etc.) As of right now she's like a fisher who had a first bad couple experiences and stubbornly never wants to go fishing again.

My big question to you guys is where to go from here. Should I ask her to try smoking with me one more time, And make sure she gets high? Or should i just cut my losses and give up? Like I said I hate pressuring people, but I feel like she's missing out since she's so much like me :/  Any advice would be awesome.

**tl;dr**  Ent BF here wants GF to try trees one last time. Her good girl background/bad first few experiences/serious tweaking over a drug test she passed have her scared away from it. Need advice how to help a supreme tweaker that you love smoke and actually get high. Or just advice on how to get her to *want* to try it one last time. Not trying to force her. Thanks!

At a [0] now at work but I will be uptoking later listening to any and all advice!  "
uavfx,2,2012-05-29,Adopted IT guy needs help establishing server for small company.,[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/uavfx/adopted_it_guy_needs_help_establishing_server_for/,"So here's what's up. I work for a branch of a small company (around 15 people). I'm their ""communications intern"" who has also been adopted as the IT guy. I've been given a task I have very little experience working with. They want me to come up with a plan to establish a server(s) and/or internal network storage. I've come to Reddit to ask for your expertise regarding how I advise them in this. The needs are two-fold:

Firstly: We work with a lot of video and I mean A LOT. Currently the computer used to edit video is connected to seven 4TB harddrives. This, as you can easily tell, is not sustainable. That is why we are looking to convert to a server and/or network storage unit that can hold everything and also make backups of the info in case one or multiple drives fail. Keep in mind we will own grow going into the future. The primary computer accessing this information is an iMac so we need something that has Firewire compatibility (USB 2.0 is too slow). We also need it to be able to expand in capacity as we grow. It would be nice if it could be PC compatible as we have a lot of laptops that run Windows. Another nice option too would be if it were able to have multiple computers, both PC and Mac, be connected to it at the same time.

Secondly: The other purpose of this server, or another server all together, is for the HR needs in administration. She, the administrator, needs to keep her files (currently only 2GB) kept very securely but with the option of sharing them to people whom only she grants access to. These files need to be able to be accessed from the Internet and held with different permissions for different people whom she gives those permissions to.

Were looking to spend about $2-3K for the first task and have not set a budget from the second. These needs may be consolidated if possible but it is very, VERY important the administration's files not be accessed by ANYONE unless purposely intended.

So, what help/advice can you offer me?"
uame1,3,2012-05-29,In a semblance of a relationship with an Ex and need help deciphering his actions. I'm also moving to his city for work and I'm hoping for reconciliation. Would appreciate some perspective here!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/uame1/in_a_semblance_of_a_relationship_with_an_ex_and/,"My ex (25/m) broke up with me (25/f) about two months ago. It was only 6 months, but it was very passionate and things between us became very serious very quickly. We met four months prior to dating but grew to be close friends instantly and eventually FWB. I, of course, was very heartbroken about it ending. It was something he had to do as he was going through a stressful time, the relationship was a bit stressful for him (it was long distance and we saw each other monthly) and it was difficult for him to see a future together. Other than that, we were madly in love with each other and the relationship was perfect in terms of compatibility, just too complicated. (I want to try and keep this as short as possible, but I'll leave a small text at the bottom going further into our reasons for breaking up for those who want a better idea of what the reasons were)

We didn't go through the 'no-contact' phase. I rely on him and he still relies on me (although not as much as we used to when we were dating). Right now, it is a murky undefined territory for us in general. We talk almost on a daily basis (usually right before bed). Right now, he reads (and translates) a chapter from a book he wrote in his native language almost every night before bed. The sexual attraction between us is still very high (our sex was incredible) and we do have phone/skype sex occasionally, both of us send nude photos, things like that. I know he also is still very jealous of guys around me. I was invited to a pimps/hoes themed party and he asked to see what I was wearing to help assure me that it wasn't too hoe-y. After that, he 'slipped' and asked that I talk to him the entire time I'm there and then retracted saying he couldn't ask that of me. He is a very nice guy in general, but sometimes he does things for me that go above and beyond the call of friendship, and other times, he can be slightly distant. We send kisses at the end of our conversations, he tells me he talks to me more than anyone else he knows, he sometimes slips and calls me 'baby' but I ignore it assuming it's just out of habit. He had to change his password recently and couldn't use his other regulars as they had already been set. So I jokingly suggested he use 'super that-aint-right'. He took me seriously.

The problem right now is that in the moment of the break up two months ago, I hastily applied for an internship in his home city. I somehow managed to get an opportunity at an amazing company and I don't plan on letting the offer go. What I'm worried about is my relationship with my ex. He asked me not to come if it were just for him, and although I did apply with him in mind, I can't let this opportunity pass. Not only is the job amazing, but the city itself is exciting and new and I plan on doing a lot of travel cross-country while I'm there.

Once I found out I got accepted, I hesitated about telling my ex and waited a week before I finally let it out. He asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. And now he's become a bit more involved in this move than I had imagined. He asked me the name of the company I'm working for, the location, dates etc. When I told him I wasn't getting paid, he started getting defensive saying that I had to get paid (apparently it's a law there) and that he would go directly to the company for me and talk to them about it (The city is massive and this company is well out of his way). He's been asking his colleagues about what I can do in my situation, he's been preoccupied with this for the past two days working things out with me. This behavior confuses me immensely. Within this same time, he also started calling me 'his sweet that-aint-right', texting throughout the day. 

I still haven't gotten over the break up fully. I don't know how he feels about his decision to break up but if he ever wanted to get back together again, I would be really happy to go back to him. The issues leading up to our break up, though, make me a bit more realistic about what to expect from him. But his behavior is really confusing me. Most of the time, we carry on like nothing happened, and other times it seems like he is purposefully distancing himself from me

It would be really great if someone could help me decipher what he is thinking. I'm I reading too much into simple friendly help? Or could he possibly want something more? I'm sure this all must be confusing for him to. I'd also like some advice on how to deal with my ex while I'm there, given that we spend lots of time together now, and that he's already so involved in my relocation. (His involvement has lessened over the past few days because I think he is picking up on my hesitation about it). I want him to see how great things could be when we don't have to face the problems of a long-distance relationship but I also don't want to risk losing him as a friend or isolating him from my life. Welp.

**TL:DR** Boyfriend broke up a long-distance relationship with me 2 months ago because of doubts in the possibility of our future together. We continue to be friends but are maintaining a semblance of a relationship. Applied for a summer internship in his city and was accepted. Now I'm even further confused by what we are and what I want from him.

**Reasons for breaking up**
I'd just like to say that before we decided to date we fully acknowledged and discussed all the problems we would face and decided to date knowing fully the kind of sacrifices we would have to make. He lives 1000 km away and at the end of my school year next year, I might be even further away if I can't find work and have to move back home. Our cultures our different: He's European and I'm Middle Eastern. He's bilingual, although finds it difficult to articulate fully in English. I'm trying to learn his language (it's important to his parents). I also asked that we waited to have sex until marriage. We had a very creative sexual relationship but I'm a virgin (I use that term vaguely and don't feel as if virginity has the same importance that I used to place on it considering all the sexual activity we shared). Even without actual sex, he confided that I had been his most satisfying sexual partner. The hardest to deal with was the long distance aspect of the relationship; especially towards the end when he was going through a very stressful period with his senior project. It was very difficult for him knowing that I couldn't be there physically to support him. If you've gotten this far, you're awesome."
uahku,1,2012-05-29,Need help eliminating a city from my list,Zasix,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/uahku/need_help_eliminating_a_city_from_my_list/,"I had a (good) change in plans this summer, and instead of taking a month long backpacking trip, I will now be backpacking for about two weeks and then interning in England for a month afterwards. Since I will be visiting England and France with this internship, I have eliminated those parts of my trip. So now I have a city line-up of:

Rome
Florence
Venice
Munich 
Prague
Amsterdam

Between all of the Italian cities, I was thinking about 7 days. This leaves 7 days for Munich, Prague, and Amsterdam, which IMO is just barely not enough. (I have to go to Amsterdam either way because that is where my bus for London is leaving, but I could just go there for the sake of it being a point to depart.) The most logical city to eliminate, to me, is Prague, since it's more out of the way than all the others. I've heard it's simply awesome though, which makes me hesitate. So I thought I would get some outside opinion.

Thanks guys!"

ua4r9,1,2012-05-29,"GF left for SC a month ago, and staying there for 3 more months...",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ua4r9/gf_left_for_sc_a_month_ago_and_staying_there_for/,"Hello fellow redditors, 

I'm **21** and here's my story:

Well it all started like 8 months ago when my GF(soon-to-be 20) got into hospitality management school. We are both Lebanese, and we've been together for 2 years (before we actually broke up knowing that LDR doesn't actually work hoping for the best in the future). The thing is like a month before she left, I was hurting like hell, so  decided not to talk to her again, as part of forgetting her and avoiding getting more hurt... I told her about why I'm stopping and etc. Like a week later, her friends started talking to me asking me how I've been doing etc(in fact they never talked to me before on phone or IM, so it was like she was trying to find out how I've been doing etc.) then a week later she called me, we talked for 5 minutes about her brother(she said she just called to ask for advice about her brother) but the conversation went well beyond that and she said she missed me and we hang out 2 days later.

However, 2 days before she left, she called me and said I want you to come over, and cried saying she's going to miss me and it's also hard for her. and then a day earlier, she had a farewell party, and I stayed at her place until a late time helping her pack everything, until I finally had to say goodbye, and she burst into tears and starting crying, hugged me really hard and kissed me.

I was hurting a lot deep inside, but actually couldn't show it.

When she left, we had already agreed to keep in touch from time to time, and as she arrived she sent me her US phone number. I tried to keep in touch with her until recently (like a week ago) she said she doesn't want me to call her again, nor wants to keep in touch as this is hurting her a lot. I respected her choice and said ok I'm no longer going to call you nor message you, however if you feel like talking to me do. A week passed and she still didn't talk to me. she'll be back in 3 months, and in 2 weeks I'll be leaving for UC berkeley as part of my internship and summer sessions. 

I tried to book a plane to go see her on her birthday, or on any weekend, but I cancelled every reservation knowing that she doesn't want. It actually really hurts me, knowing that I had to break up with the girl I love and still love for a lame reason. But what hurts me most is that we're no longer talking together. What could she be up to? 

When I talked to her a week earlier I told her please if there was another guy tell me I would try to understand and seek for other things in life. She strongly denied having another guy and told me she wants to be alone for the coming months and wants to enjoy her life until she finally figures out whether we're meant or not.

I really can't wait for 3 more months (I believe I'm actually hurting a lot now because I'm having my finals and have nothing to distract me from that issue).

TL;DR: So is she seeing another guy and that's why she no longer wants to talk to me?
Is she actually hurting and doesn't want to to me because of that?
And what hurts me most is the fact that she could be doing stuff with other guys while I'm still waiting for her (I hope you know what I mean)

Sorry for the long post and please give me some advice... Thank you!"

u9w9a,2,2012-05-29,I have just requested a leave of absence from my Masters program. Why do I feel guilty about it?,theforemost,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/u9w9a/i_have_just_requested_a_leave_of_absence_from_my/,"I'm struggling with a decision I have made to take a leave of absence from my Masters program. My masters program requires me to live incarnationally among the poor, learn, and practice anything from church development/bible studies/sharing Christ to community economics/health care/education/advocacy. My program is through the U.S. but I am studying in a major city in India.

I need to go home and support my family because they are going through a lot right now. They tell me that they're fine but my mom is being attacked by her brothers (my uncles) for taking care of my grandparents. They are accusing her of trying to hoard favor from my grandparents and trying to take over property all of which my mom is NOT doing. All she is doing is caring for my grandparents out of love and respect on her own.

I don't feel supported by my local contacts/college here. There have been talks from my U.S. professors with my Indian professors to get them to more involved in my life and needs as a student with lectures, internships and house stays. The local Indian college hasn't done the greatest of job in this (to put it mildly).

I met a nice woman here that I have fallen in love with and want to marry. She has been a major source of encouragement and has helped me along as much as she can with my frustrations with my Indian college.

I want to work with my college here and do some work on my own in order to get myself return in line. I'd like to return in a year's time. I can't meet the satisfactory academic requirements unless I do this. It will be hurt if I stay with my program AND try to work out my academic issues. As the oldest son in my family I feel it is absolutely necessary that I be there and offer any help I can. The way I see that is by living with my grandparents and taking care of them while my mom takes care of herself.  I also want to mediate with my family. I think Christ will bless me in being a peace maker. I didn't plan on finding a woman or a woman that I would want to marry but I have and I do so I also have that to consider for a leave of absence.

My questions are...Why do I feel so guilty? Why do I feel like I failed or lost? I don't want to quit my program. All I know is that I want to a break so that I can take care of my family, give my local college the space to host me well, and to marry the woman that I love.

It's been a long process but I am trusting in God to take care of me. I have given him all my hopes and desires. I have been living abroad and serving him here. I haven't been neutral in serving him. I am trusting in him as I move forward and I am waiting on him when I need his blessing or can't move forward.

Did I fail by not being able to finish my program in the allotted time of two years? What am I going through right now. I feel like one burden has been taken and new one has been put on.

TL;DR I'm in an incarnational Masters program in India (I'm from U.S.). Requested leave of absence to take care of my family, get a better hold on academics, and get married. Somehow, though, I feel guilty/shame/anxiety. Why do I feel that way?"

u9tmt,3,2012-05-29,How to deal with unknown futures in an LDR?,ari7,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/u9tmt/how_to_deal_with_unknown_futures_in_an_ldr/,"Hi all.  I've been in a wonderful relationship with a wonderful guy for 6 months now.  We both go to the same university, but he's 21 and going to be graduating next year.  I'm 19 and graduating a year after him.  He also plans on going into a PhD program which can be 5+ years, but will not know where until next spring. 
We'll have some practice in distance in that we have to spend this summer (4 months) apart. The first month has been fine, and I don't doubt that we can make it work. The hard part is the unknown that comes after.

Next year, I'll get three months with him in the fall semester, spend a month away, three months for spring semester, and then he graduates and goes to grad school while I go away for a summer internship.

We have no idea where he'll end up for grad school, but chances are it will be a plane ride away.  We'll have to deal with that for a year, and thats even assuming that I can get a good job in the same area as his uni the following year.

He's asked me where I'd like to work in the future so he can apply to schools in that area, since I've had some great career opportunities neither of us want me to lose, but I don't want to ask that of him, because I want him to do whats best for his career as well. 

I'm worried about the sacrifices one of us might have to make, and just how being apart is so hard.  I trust him, but its hard to completely avoid feeling insecure with distance, and worrying about something that just might not work geographically.  I know that I should just focus on the fact that I love him, but the logistical side of me worries about juggling all these unknowns.
Does anyone have advice for dealing with this sort of situation?"

uc9z3,49,2012-05-30,How to motivate ones self,sigmasix114,TrueAskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/uc9z3/how_to_motivate_ones_self/,"So I'm currently a junior in college. I'm studying computer science and do *decently* well in it. I've had a couple internships and all that jazz, I play bass guitar and love to play dems videogames. But i've recently come to a fairly shocking realization: I'm not motivated to do **anything**. Literally anything at all.

 It's gotten to a point where the amount of effort it takes to get myself to class everday is just absurd. I've stopped playing bass for the most part (that was  a long time in the process, though). I don't really even play videogames all that much anymore, somehow the joy of it has just dissipated. When I do play some of my favorite games I get the feeling that I'm just going through the motions, desperately trying to regain that old nostalgic feeling.

I've tried to motivate myself to work on some projects, like design my own app or software or something to that tune, but all that ends up happening is I stare at a blank text editor, maybe define a factorial function (because why not, right?) and then save it and close it ""to be worked on at some other point"", which obviously never happens.

My lack of motivation/laziness has gotten so intense that I don't even smoke weed anymore. **That's right**, I've become so lazy that I don't even bother getting high. I didn't know that was something that could happen, it's like I've transcended stoner and reached some sort of meta-stoner levels of laziness. 

Simply put, nothing seems particularly appealing. I don't feel specifically depressed, I'm not in a dark hole of misery or anything along those lines, I just feel very bland. I don't really want to do much of anything, and when I do go out and ""do"" stuff it feels very forced. It's sort of like I'm making a deal with myself - ""If I go out tonight, then I can stay in and watch re-runs I've seen dozens of times without feeling guilty tomorrow night"".

I'm wondering how many other people feel the same way (I'm quite confident I'm not particularly unique in this lack of motivation) and if any people that did experience it eventually conquered it, how. Thanks guys."

ubbdi,5,2012-05-29,"Some lady advice, please.",[deleted],actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/ubbdi/some_lady_advice_please/,"I am a very femme woman, which already makes it a challenge to attract the ladies, because I feel like I don't give off the lez vibe at all, though I'm trying to alter this. But, I met this PYT in my class this past semester. We hung out a few times, and she's basically perfect. Gorgeous, funny, smart, etc. (I also have this problem with being able to tell if someone is into me, or if she's just being nice and friendly). Recently, she invited me to go visit her in DC, where she's doing an internship, because ""August is forever away"", which is when she would be back in town. Is it safe to say that she at least likes me a little bit? Also, should I go? because I would love to. I just don't wanna be led on or anything. idk if this even makes any sense, but I needed some outside perspective, because my friends are all spontaneous and tell me to go for it, whereas I'm always the cautious, play-it-safe one.

any advice is appreciated :]
p.s. I love this subreddit!"
uba2l,5,2012-05-29,"Just Met My S/O Today, Where Do We Go from Here? ",AnonymousRebel,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/uba2l/just_met_my_so_today_where_do_we_go_from_here/,"I guess I'll just dive right into this, then. Keep in mind, I'm 18, going into college next year, and my S/O is 17, going to be a senior in high school next year. Nobody knows about us except a few of her close friends, a close friend of mine, and my brother. This story is gonna be a long one, so apologies in advance.

I first met my S/O over Chatroulette last April.  She seemed really cool, we had a great conversation, but she had a boyfriend, so I just thought we'd be internet friends and that'd be that. Not that it was a bad thing; she was still really cool and fun to talk to. We talked a lot since we met, and eventually started texting back and forth. I had a couple IRL girlfriends during the time we were texting, from around April-August. After I broke it off with the second girlfriend, I started to develop feelings for my S/O. Not because of her beauty, really, but because of the way she was there for me each time I stumbled and fell. She didn't just leave me on my own like she very well could have. She was, she is, a great friend.

Of course, what could I do? She had a boyfriend, was happy, and I was just some kid who lived a thousand miles away. I kept my feelings under wraps for the next few months, during which time we kept talking more and more. I started dating another girl IRL last November, and said girl broke up with me on New Years Eve. That night, with no plans and nowhere to go, I stayed up and texted my S/O into the night. She was stranded in Washington state with her father due to flight delays, so she knew my pain, somewhat. We talked about all kinds of stuff, our mistakes, our regrets, how we wish we could meet each other... everything. And I'll never forget it. That night was when I knew I had something truly special with her.

Fast forward to February, we'd been texting/Skyping as frequently as ever. One night we were texting, and, long story short, she confessed she was physically attracted to me, that she wanted to have sex with me. The way she put it, if I lived closer, we'd be 'friends with benefits.' This upset me, but I didn't let it show. I kept on keeping on. One night in March, I couldn't let my feelings stay dormant any longer. We were talking on the phone, and I told her that I was in love with her. She was somewhat shocked, and said she'd have to think about it. A few days later, we came to the conclusion that, though a relationship was out of the question now and that she doesn't feel the same right now due to her feelings for her  then-boyfriend, a future relationship could be possible were we closer. I held onto this hope, and was relieved that everything was out in the open.

Fast forward to May (this month), we'd still been talking and texting regularly. I had been dating an IRL girl from mid April up until the beginning of May. And in the second week of April, my S/O told me she was beginning to fall for me. I was shocked, and this set off a whirlwind of thoughts in my mind. Do I really love her? Why not just settle for your IRL girlfriend or find someone closer? All of these and more were going through my head.

I broke up with my IRL girlfriend, much to my S/O's relief (keep in mind she was still with her boyfriend, though she confessed things were not going well between them). Soon after, they broke up, and my S/O made plans to visit a local college in my area for theater/performing arts. And that leads us to today. I met my S/O for the first time today. We talked, had lunch at a local diner, and generally tried to get over the initial weirdness of seeing each other for the first time. We sort of did by the time we left, though it was still there. As were walking out, we had our arms around each others' waists, and right as we were about to get to my car, she stopped, and kissed me. I returned the favor for about ten seconds, until we realized people could see us, and then we proceeded to get into my car.

We drove to a more secluded place, where we kissed even more, and, most important of all, my S/O finally told me that she did, indeed, love me. I was overjoyed, and the next hour was among the best I'd ever had. We didn't even have sex like in those movies, we just kissed, embraced each other... yeah, I know it sounds weird, but it was awesome.

As great as today was, I have a few questions. First of all, my S/O has a summer internship in a small town in Virginia. She has three days of free time away from work. This town is about ten hours from where I live, so I was hoping I could find an excuse to see her without telling my parents about it. Or should I just tell my parents and hope for the best?

Second off, how can we keep this going until if/when she decides to attend the college in my area and we can be together? It'll be tough for both of us to resist the temptations of other women/men in real life. Also, should this be a full-fledged, committed relationship? Or should we wait until we're actually within reasonable distance of each other to make it 'official?' She told me that no other guy, in her eyes, can really match up to me, and I feel likewise about her. Nonetheless, the temptations are still there.

Again, sorry for the long post, hope somebody decided to read it and is willing to offer advice. Cheers!"

I'm 21, and I often go back and forth on whether or not it's worth it for me to transition. Specifically, I wonder if I can keep my career intact if I do decide to transition. I'm a Computer Science major and I'm more than halfway done the program. I desperately want to be female, but I've already done a lot of networking through internships and such, so I wonder if it's really possible for me to start over.

I was pretty close to going on hormones a few months ago, and the above is one of the things that really made me reconsider. Instead of trying to face this, I've been telling myself that all I really wanted from transitioning was attention.. but I don't think that was the case.

People who are supportive of homosexuality, especially in the northeast US where I live, are certainly in the majority nowadays. But there's still a stigma towards transgendered people. If I transition and DON'T pass, how likely is it that anyone will even want to hire me?

Thank you for your time."

I need an opinion now pleeease.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/uel95/fellow_ents_i_quit_consuming_trees_a_month_ago/,"As the title states, I quit trees about a month ago to get a Software Developer Internship position at my university, which lasts for a mere 2 months.

I officially got the position last week and filled out all the necessary paperwork three days ago (tax stuff, background check agreement, direct deposit, etc). I was told by my future boss that there is no dress code (wear whatever is comfortable), I can choose my own hours as long as I work 35 a week, and I will be sitting behind a computer all day. 

Nobody has even hinted at the possibility for a urine test, but I still haven't consumed as I am just trying to be safe. I am aware that each company has different policies, so I don't expect a perfect answer. But in your (probably) expert opinion, should I be in the clear? I have a quad of Pineapple Express to get through, and I don't know how much longer I can wait.

Great grades through high school, landed the Honors Program in college, then things got tough.

My freshman year, the problem of not having taken Biology since freshman year of high school came back to bite me. Not really my fault, or anyone's- that's just how my HS worked. Those in the Honors track went Bio-Honors Chem-Honors Physics-AP Something. Biology was full, so I went AP Chem.

Got a C and a C- in Biology for my first year, ended up repeating Bio II over summer to get my GPA up. Ended up wiping the C- with an A.

I got to Junior year with a 3.4 on the rails, and started applying to med school. My advisor told me not to- she said my grades weren't good enough. I got an interview at my top choice, but got waitlisted and declined. Graduated with a 3.55, still somewhat lost as to what to do, but the dream of the long coat was still there.

Took 2 years of post-baccalaureate courses to beef up the resumé, pulled over the 90th percentile on the MCAT, and got into a 1-year Master's program that had at the end the promise of an interview to the attached med school.

Nothing lower than a B over the Master's, got into med school, and for 2 years, all was great. As, Bs and the occasional C, but no sweat.

Then came third year- clinical duties. I fell into a depression, and was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder. I started failing exams, just because my brain wasn't working right- I'd know it in practice with my advisor, then blow it on the exam.

After a year, and failing 2 of the 6 clerkships, I had to appear before the school's promotions committee- they decide for students in trouble if they are allowed to continue. I was recommended to take 6 months off. I later found out one of the clerkship directors recommended I drop out, and it was only my advisor arguing for a second chance that got me the sabbatical over dismissal.

That brings to last July. Two more required clerkships, Neurology and Surgery, remediating the two failed ones, Peds and OB, my acting internship and the big exam- Step 2CK.

I nailed Neuro on the second try, and decided to take Step 2CK early while I was on a roll. Busted my ass for a month, took it during OB, and nailed them both to the wall. Peds took two tries, but it fell as well.

Commence applying to residencies. Applied to 35, got 4 interviews.  9:1 is a fairly normal ratio, so I was feeling okay. Match Day, when we find out where we go for residency, fell during Surgery.

Next to go, Surgery. I hate Surgery. I hate the blood, the gore, the smells, the sounds, I just feel helpless. I gritted my teeth, met it with a snarl and took it to the ground. Panic attacks? None. Depression? Gone. I was on a mission. The exam? Passed, first stroke. The Match? Not my first-choice program, but a program. Better than a lot of folks do.

The last barrier? The acting internship. That's a month of meatgrinder, where a fourth-year student is treated like a full MD. Long hours, lots of responsibility, but once it's done, it's all over. Making it better, my AI was at the same hospital where I'm doing residency.

Got the score back: High Pass, a B.

It's over. 8 years since I graduated college, a Master's along the way, and tomorrow I do what they said couldn't be done. I get my MD.

Never believe them when they say it can't be done. It can be. You just need to want to fight hard enough.

udykj,17,2012-05-31,"How to Beat the Slush Pile (or how to make first readers fall in love with you, and why submission guidelines are really, really damned important) [xpost from r/writing]",danceswithronin,shutupandwrite,https://www.reddit.com/r/shutupandwrite/comments/udykj/how_to_beat_the_slush_pile_or_how_to_make_first/,"Okay, here’s the deal. First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader. 

* **Don’t try to be edgy.** Same premise as the previous point, but the opposite. If your main character says “fuck” every other word and is generally a bad-tempered *Catcher in the Rye* knockoff, the first reader is probably going to roll their eyes and move on. 

* **Make the first page of your story the strongest in a narrative sense.** If there is anything boring in the first page of your story, it better not be there by the time you get ready to send it in for publication, because if there is, the first reader is going to assume the rest of the story is boring too, and move on to the next thing in the slush pile. 

* **Read the submission guidelines.** If the submission guidelines say that they want the manuscript in Arial, triple-spaced, every other word in bold, by-gods if you want to publish in that magazine you will do exactly what they say. Because here’s a secret: sometimes ridiculous submissions guidelines are a test. They are a test to see how well you pay attention, or whether you’re someone who thinks that the rules don’t apply to you (the latter is a group of people that editors hate to work with). They are a test to see how bad you want it and how professional you’re capable of being. Flaming hoops of formatting guidelines is part of that process. If you want to be published, you will follow every single instruction that is given to you. 

* **Impressions are important.** If you make a good impression or get published in a magazine, any further submissions may be flagged for a higher priority of consideration than others in the slush pile. This is a very good thing for you. If, on the other hand, you make an ass of yourself by not following any of the rules above, the first readers will remember you, and not in a loving way. Don’t let that happen to you.  

* **Don’t send simultaneous submissions.** Granted, *some magazines don’t mind this,* and will make a point to say so in their submission guidelines. If there is no mention of “simultaneous submissions allowed” in the guidelines, do not submit to multiple magazines at the same time. Simple as that. Wait for a rejection letter before sending your work out to someone else. Nothing makes an editor shake their fist at the heavens more than to go through the cut rounds, pick a story they really like, only to see that that story has already been accepted elsewhere. It’s bad form. Don’t do it.

* **Consider the person on the other side of your submission.** They are usually unpaid, tired, eyesore, hungry, thirsty, and in dire need of a stiff drink. They are in the literary business because they love good writing, the same as you do. They are not the blackhat gatekeepers who are sabotaging your efforts at traditional publication. They are just doing their jobs, which is to make sure that they get the very best stories for the publication they’re working at. They have pride in their work, and they want you to have pride in yours too. "
udyg4,117,2012-05-31,"Ten Ways to Beat the Slush Pile (or how to make a first reader fall in love with you, and why submission guidelines are really, really damned important)",danceswithronin,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/udyg4/ten_ways_to_beat_the_slush_pile_or_how_to_make_a/,"Okay, here’s the deal. First readers are the people who will see the work you have submitted to a literary magazine before the editors ever will. These are the unpaid minions (usually interns) who go through the submissions before they are culled into a smaller pile for the editorial staff to pick and choose from. **They are the real gatekeepers you have to woo – not the editors.** For the most part, unless you catch the eye of a first reader, the editor will never know you exist. 

Depending on the size of the magazine, first readers (or slushies – *mush slushy, mush!)* will have to go through hundreds or even thousands of submissions a week. That is *millions of words.* Do you think that they actually go through and carefully read every one of those millions of words? Hell no. Because that is purgatorial and a waste of time. 

The truth is, a first reader can usually tell from two things whether a writer is serious about submitting or not:

* **The query letter.**

* **The first page of the submission.**

With that in mind, here are ten pieces of advice that will help make a first reader fall in love with you:

* **Proofread.** For the love of gods old and new, proofread. Competition is fierce. If there is a typo in your query letter or the first page of your submission, there is a 99.9% likelihood it is going in the trash.

* **Be humble.** You have not written the next *Grapes of Wrath.* Yours is only one of the dozens or hundreds of submissions a first reader will see in any given day. Saying anything to the effect of, “Oh man, you must publish my story, it is the best thing since *War and Peace* and together we will win a Pushcart with it and you would be a moron not to publish it” is going to get your query letter passed around the editorial office and laughed at. True story.

* **Revise.** Once you have finished a story, set it aside for a week or two and work on something else. Come back to it with fresh eyes. Rework it. Do an extremely thorough **self-edit** or proofread. Get someone to **beta read** it (preferably someone who is not your mother) for a subjective second opinion. **Revise it some more.** Cut the fat. Expand parts that are sparse, but keep in mind – especially if you are submitting a short story – that it is important to keep your work as tight as possible. There is only so much room in any given magazine and you are competing ferociously for it. If a first reader finds typos and grammatical errors in the first page of your story, you can be sure they will not read past the first page. 

* **Read the magazine you’re submitting to.** Get a subscription if you can. Most lit mag subscriptions are laughably cheap. Not only will you be helping to support and uphold the industry you are trying to get money and recognition out of, it will let you know the general tone and style of the stories the editors pick, so you will be more likely to get a positive response by sending a story along the same lines. 

* **Don’t try to be cute.** It’s okay to be charming and show a little wit in your query letter, but there is a fine line. Having a sense of humor is okay, coming across as a smart-aleck assclown will not endear you to your first reader.

I am getting my hair cut short this weekend, short enough that I can rock a faux-hawk, recently bought some killer rainbow gauges, snagged an internship in my school's BRAND NEW LGBTQ Resource Center for the fall... oh, I am also in the process of losing weight and taking better care of myself. I lift weights and have lost almost 50 pounds so far.

I'm not sure what else to do. I live in Green Bay, WI, which is not the most inviting place for gay people. I mean, it's 2012 and my school just formed an LGBT group this year, and it'll be my job as an intern to expand it next year. I really, really want to meet some girls. I know I sound like an adolescent teen boy when I say that, but I am nearly 20 years old and would like to get into the dating scene. I have only dated males in the past in an attempt to suppress my sexuality, but now that I finally accepted it, it's like being stranded in a wasteland. 

I'm not sure what I'm asking for, really. I'd love some advice and encouragement from the older lesbians in this subreddit for sure, as well as some of my college-aged peers. 

I plan to move away for grad school, and I'll make sure it's in a gay-friendly part of the country. I don't want to have to wait 3 years for that to happen, though. "
ud2h3,6,2012-05-30,Mixture of Gaussians with TFIDF sparse vectors,ColonelHapablap,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ud2h3/mixture_of_gaussians_with_tfidf_sparse_vectors/,"Hi guys,

I'm a complete newbie when it comes to Machine Learning (and CS in general, I've only had 2 semesters worth of courses).  I'm trying to write an algorithm for document classification for an internship and I'm feeling out of my league.  

Right now I've got approximately 2000 documents I need to classify and that number is expected to grow over time.  I've got tfidf weightings for each documents, so right now I'm trying to write a Mixture of Gaussians mixture model using the sparse vectors of each documents tfidf weighting (right now there are about 44000 unique words after normalization, so that's how many dimensions I've got).

Things seem to be blowing up, though--I can't reasonably computer a 44000*44000 covariance matrix for each gaussian per iteration, so I'm just doing diagonal matrices (the variance of each term).  But then the variance turns out to be so small that when its time for doing the exp() part of this function: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Non-degenerate_case,
 multiplying by the inverse eventually makes the resulting scalar too huge to compute.  Right now I'm trying to standardize my ifidf scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, but that hasn't seemed to help with the resulting scalar size. 

I really don't know what I'm doing.  Is MoG the wrong approach to this?  Apparently LDA is the best thing for this sort of thing, but from what I understand that would definitely be out of my league.

I guess don't know what I'm asking, exactly, but if anyone could provide some insight as how I'm approaching this incorrectly or what might be a better strategy, I would really appreciate it."
