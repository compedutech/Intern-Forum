1ppztz,1,2013-11-01,I've been denied for a internship for the 5th time in a row - now i feel suicidal once again,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ppztz/ive_been_denied_for_a_internship_for_the_5th_time/,"I am currently in my 3rd and final year of a education I love and thought i was good at. The 3rd year is the year of our internship, we're supposed to be on our internship 4 days a week and go back to school 1 week. 

The situation i'm in right now started at the end of the 2nd year, the moment we heard the name of the company we were going to have our internship if we get accepted after applying for said internship.

I've been feeling depressed since the age of 6 – my dad got his depression around that time and toke it al out on my mom and me. I can't remember a moment I didn't feel worthless until a year ago - I finally started to get a grip on myself without any professional help, which I don't want so it won't worry my parents -. Because of all these feelings i've always been scared of meeting new people which would take their own opinion about me.

Back the the last bit of my 2nd year, I freaked out when I hear we actually had to start applying for our internship, I cried my heart out in the middle of the class out of pure fear of what was going to come. My teacher tried to comfort me by saying she had an amazing company for me and that I was going to have the year of me life – she didn't realize how wrong she was.

All my classmates have gotten their internship on their first try, including the people that barely know where their ass is because they're always drunk and stoned. But me? Of course not!
Today I got the news i've been denied for the 5th time in a row – and all I could think was how much I wanted to end my life.

I feel worthless. I'm doing a education I love and I thought I was good at - even though i'm not so sure about that anymore – if I really was as good as I though you'd think I'd have an internship by now. I've been talking to a really good friend -which happens to be a long term crush of mine- about this and I ended up irritating him like there's no tomorrow – he felt like I was over it and didn't expect words like “i want to kill myself” to come out of my mouth ever again.

I don't know what to do anymore – The first thought I have is that I rather die then going back to the 
group of people without internships -some got kicked out because they didn't care – others never applied because they didn't care. There's now an temporary solution for us to get the “internship” hours necessary to get our diploma. I feel like i'm going to get laughed at – everyone thought I wasn't going to return to that group because I applied to the new internship which denied me.

What can I do? I absolutely hate this year - it's making me feel worthless and suicidal all over again – I don't want to be suicidal – and makes me doubt my skills."
1ppyib,2,2013-11-01,I'm in love with my best friend. (x-post r/advice),throwaway284123,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ppyib/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend_xpost_radvice/,"I'm using a throwaway account on this. It's a long read, too. So bare with me on this.

When I was in 16, this girl from my high school and I started dating. At first it was the typical high school relationship, but after about a year we started to fall in love with each other. Then, like typical high school relationship stuff, it fell apart.

My senior year of high school is when we broke off and I started dating another girl right before I graduated. Looking back on it, that really was a rebound so I wouldn't really feel anything after the previous relationship ended. While I was dating this new girl, my now-ex and I didn't talk for awhile and didn't start talking again the summer going into my sophomore year in college.

In the fall of that year, the relationship I was in ended. Being the emotional wuss of a man I am, I took that one hard too. But I also had recently got back in touch with my ex from high school, who was at a college two hours from the one I go to. We worked back to making a friendship, and it eventually has grown to where it is now - as best friends.

During the time from us breaking up until the last month of my junior year, she was dating another guy. Wasn't very fond of him because I knew he was cheating on him, though I don't have much ground to stand on, which I'll explain in a little bit. When she and I got back in touch, she was still with this guy. Our spring breaks are at different times, and during mine my sophomore year in college, she and the guy she was dating were going through a rough strip. She asked if I would pick her up at her college and drive her back to our hometown since I was leaving for there. I did. It was the first time really since HS that I was around her for a long period of time.

On the drive, we decided we would hang out that night at my dad's house since he wouldn't be home. So we did, we watched movies, raided the liquor cabinet and just had a fun time being around each other again before falling asleep in the same bed together. There wasn't anything physical - promise, I wouldn't lie to you guys about that.

Fast forward to the following fall. She was up at my college visiting friends she has here. But for a reason I don't remember, the friend she was staying with couldn't house her the last night and needed somewhere to stay. She asked if she could stay at my apartment. I let her, only this time we ended up making out. Which I felt bad, confused, and on a high at the same time because I had developed feelings for her again but she was in a relationship.

We stayed close after that happened, and even when she and her boyfriend at the time we're on the rocks, we discussed the possibility of getting back together. But we always got cold feet.

Right as my fourth year at college started, I got into a relationship with another girl. I knew I had to put away any feelings for my best friend if I was going to be in a relationship. Which I was able to do. But that relationship didn't even make it to the New Year. So pretty quickly I was back to thinking about her.

Fast forward to this summer, I ended up getting an internship in a town about five hours from our hometown. But, her mother's side of the family lives in this same town and it's where she has spent her summers ever since I've known her. So basically her and I were in the same town for 10 weeks. I couldn't describe how excited I was. We saw each other nearly everyday after we got off work. And our friendship is weird that we can spend the night with each other and nothing happens now.

Until about 3 weeks into us being out there, we stayed the night with each other and somehow a mood was created and we ended up making out in only our underwear. The next night, we did everything but have sex. That happened another time before we both knew we needed to talk about what was happening. She told me flat out she didn't want to have emotions involved if we were going to be physical. I was heartbroken. I had thought maybe this was us working toward a relationship again.

We cut off being physical because I just couldn't keep doing it and not have emotions involved. I was in love with her and didn't want us to be fooling around if it wasn't meaning anything.

Now since we're back at both our schools, she's recently started talking to another guy. When she told me about the guy, I think I took it worse than any of my breakups. I realized then I'm still in love with her even though we broke up years ago. I realize that having been physical with each other probably wasn't the best thing for my feelings.

I don't know how to just stop being in love with her because I shouldn't be if she's with other guys. Nor can I just remove her from my life because she's a best friend. But she isn't interested in being in a relationship again.

I know I threw a lot, but if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this. It'd be much appreciated.

The internship is for community college students which is pretty awesome. I'm really excited because it's EXACTLY what I want to be doing in the future. I was hoping you guys could give me advice on the application process. 

They ask about familiarity with programming languages. I've done some stuff on codeacademy but other than that I'm really not very familiar. So that is one area I'm pretty worried about. 

Thanks!"

It was suggested that I use a smartphone (Surprised me). I downloaded the Lambert strike/dip app for my Iphone which I have been using to plot the orientations of the structures. 

There have been only a few articles on the accuracy of the internal compass, and then you have to account for the code which converts all this data into measurements. I was truly excited to break away from a Brunton for a while because the app is awesome. It gives strike/dip/plunge/bearing of lineations and structures, plots them on a steronet for you, and even records the location (In longitude-latitude). I've noticed sometimes the reading can be a bit off, but moreover, I've noticed the coordinates of each reading are WAY off. I'm talking about 30 meters or so. Two structures that I measured which are actually about a meter apart were distanced about 20 meters apart.

Any input?"

1po23y,2,2013-11-01,College is making me miserable,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1po23y/college_is_making_me_miserable/,"I don't care if no one ever sees this I just need to rant so hopefully I'll feel better. So I'm a junior in college and I fucking hate it. I hate everything about college. I hate the students, I hate all my classes, I hate my professors, I hate my living situation, I hate my housemates, I hate that I have no food to eat at my house, I just hate everything. Ever since I started college, I've always had trouble making friends. Maybe it's because I'm extremely lazy and don't have the energy to maintain friendships. I don't know. And I don't care. I just hate everything about my life right now. 


When I graduated high school, I wasn't even sure I wanted to go to college. But thanks to my parents pressuring me, I went to fucking college. Now they're pressuring me to find a fucking job and I still have 2 years of school left. Anyway, so basically I feel trapped. I'm always stuck on campus all the time and I feel trapped because I don't have my own transportation and I hate taking public transportation so there's no way I can ever ""explore the city"" and shit without walking a million miles and spending a ton of money I don't have. So I'm also poor which means I can't do much. I can barely afford to feed myself.

 It also doesn't help that I'm a very impulsive spender and horrible with my money. I'm trying to get better at that but I'm always looking for instant gratification. Which is not good.


Also, I just feel like the students at this school are very judgmental. Most students are Caucasian, super athletic and fit and come from wealthy families. Since I'm not Caucasian, rich and barely exercise, I don't fit in with any of the students. It doesn't really bother me except for the fact that I have to overhear their annoying fucking conversations every day about how drunk they were last night or some bullshit sorority/frat drama. And because I ""look different"" (because I'm ethnic) I feel their eyes going all the way to judgement city whenever I'm on campus. You name it, they're judging. When I'm walking to class, going to the library, whatever. I hate it. I desperately want to find a niche of accepting, nice people but I just feel like it's so hard. So I'm lonely and don't have many friends. 


The ""friends"" I do have are all the same ethnicity/race as me and they tend to flake out when I try to make plans with them. And whenever I'm out around campus with them, I can feel every other person just judging me. So that's hard. I know people always say, ""join clubs"" and stuff but I just dont have the energy to commit to a club. I always tell myself at the beginning of every semester that I should commit to a few clubs but I never do. It's hard. And I'm lazy. And tired all the time.


Also, I just feel like a failure in general. My GPA is not exactly the best and I've been trying to raise it up. I had to appeal my scholarship twice because my GPA didn't reach the threshold, and my parents weren't too happy about that. I just feel like I've failed my parents in that sense. I try so hard to do well in my classes but I have so much trouble paying attention in class. I get distracted by my phone every 5 seconds or I'm always thinking about something else. I've been trying to attend all my classes this semester and not skip, since I'm only taking 4 classes, but still, it's really hard. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how much work I put into writing this essay or no matter how much I study for this exam, it's never good enough. 


It's never good enough for the professor and it's never as good as other students' work. It's always C or C+ material, NEVER A. I've seen other students put in less effort than I have and they always have the better grade so naturally, it makes me feel like absolute fucking shit. And there's also the pressure for me to find a good internship. And that's just way too hard for me. I did have an internship last summer but it was for some startup organization that didn't even have an official office and most of the work was done on skype.


 My parents considered this internship a ""joke"" and I do too, kind of, but I'm trying to get all I can out of it. So even though I've emailed my internship supervisor for a recommendation letter so it can help me apply for future internships 3 TIMES she hasn't responded. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO RESPOND TO A FUCKING EMAIL IT TAKES LITERALLY 5 FUCKING SECONDS. All she had to do was say something like "" yeah I'm working on it"" BUT NO. NO FUCKING REPLY AT ALL. So that's been angering me too. 


I guess to sum it up, I've been absolutely miserable since I've started college. I've felt like a failure multiple times, I've considered suicide many times (even though I'm not suicidal, it does cross my mind at least once a month) and I've been more depressed than I ever have been in my life. I can see no benefits to attending this miserable place but I feel like I must finish since after this semester, I only have 3 left. Then I have to find a fucking job. Yay that's going to be a lot of fucking fun. 


Sorry this is so long and if you've read this far, thanks. I don't feel that much better but I do feel a little better. I know I'm not the only one who feels miserable at college. I don't know what to do but I guess the only option at this point is to press on. Also, I'm a huge procrastinator so I'm sitting at the library trying to work on this paper for the last 6 hours but I haven't even started. Instead, I'm on reddit ranting about my shitty life problems. Sigh.

1prph5,3,2013-11-02,"Me [17 M] with my friends ex [17 F] 3 weeks, Was the rebound guy, prepare for a long story",throwaway423p,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1prph5/me_17_m_with_my_friends_ex_17_f_3_weeks_was_the/,"Hello reditors, I'm sorry for this long-ass post, but I had to vent this somewhere, and I know no better place. I'm 17,and this was my first relationship. Not sure what to do now. Need Advice!!!

I've had 2 simultaneous crushes throughout high school, and one of them happened to be my good friends gf. 

Started to hang out with her a few months after the friend had to move away (was still in an LDR with her though).

He started to lose interest in her though, she noticed and came to me as a shoulder to cry on. I supported my friend, uplifting him, but she kept giving subtle hints as that she was trying to choose between me and him. I dismissed these hints at the time and did not realize these until some reflection later on.

I helped discuss stuff with her and found out that she'd just had her 8th breakup (yep :| ) with him, and there were many before he moved away. She'd complained how he was extremely manipulative, very hurtful at times, that he'd trodden all over he and she wondered if he was bi-polar. Her main point was that she wasn't sure if she could trust him because he'd often said something and never followed through.

Anyways, I had been hanging out with her for a month after the breakup and eventually joined her on what became a date (because a friend of ours didn't show up to the movie).

I watched the movie with her (The internship), and cuddled up to her, as I'd done many times before while hanging out (we were really good friends), She did likewise. I walked her home from the movies, waving goodbye outside her house, but she joined me at the bus-stop (which was 200 meters away from her place).

It was at that point that I confessed my feelings to her, there was no awkward silence. She just replied with 'I like you too'. What followed was a lot of embracing and a short kiss (my first) before my bus came.

I talked to her a lot in school, but we didn't make things obvious to any our friends. But a mutual friend of ours started talking to us. Lets assign a name to my friend (now gf I guess?): Emily(17,F) (not the actual name), the mutual friend is called John(16,M) and the friend in the other country is called Greg(17,M).

Now Emily has been talking to John about the night we both kissed. He talks to me about it, confirming it after an hour of constant questioning. I say that I'm not going to stay as bf because I like her too much to ruin our friendship with a relationship. He tells me that I shouldn't, saying we're great together, that good relationships come from friendships and that it would decimate her if it wasn't at the current level of relationship. And he tells me that I should tell Greg, to which I respond 'when the time is right'. I'm still distant friends with him and value the friendship. I told John I didn't want to cause any kerfuffle.

I agree with what he says, I continue to hang out with her after school (although no kissing) and we talk about all kinds of stuff. On the weekend (a week after the first kiss) I invite her out to join my friends and I for movies and small house parties (just 10 of us). My friends love hanging out with her, and notice that she's really close to me. My drunk friend points out that we should date (none of them know at that point). I walk her home, and the doubt of the relationship comes back to me, I start hinting her by talking about how high school relationships ruin friendships, she takes no notice and I forget about this doubt as hormones rush while we kiss for about half a minute before I say I have to go.

This pattern continues on for another 2 weeks (Emily's friends had even made a bet between another guy and I (Emily's crushes), my friends are still quite clueless, but getting there) with me also talking to John until the 3rd weekend after the first kiss, she leaves with her family and I ask her out for coffee before she leaves, we discuss the 'gay best friend' idea, of which I'd proposed a week earlier (she'll be away for a week and a half).

I'm on facebook talking to her as her plane leaves, she packs up and goes, leaving me to continue with normal life (holiday homework/studying and video games). 2 hours after she leaves on the  plane, That's when I get a message from Greg.

This is a few hundred word message directed through Facebook at me. I also notice that he's blocked me on all possible forms of social media and instant messaging software. 

Gist of the message: Greg blames me for the 8th breakup, says I dated it because of sexual pleasure, that I spied on him and back-stabbed him, that I had bad-mouthed him to Emily, that he had been ready to make the biggest pledge of his life (for the 9th time). He signed off with 'goodbye old friend'. 

I was shocked at first. I'd expected him to be surprised that we were dating. But this was a full on attack as if Emily had been his wife. Because Emily was in the air at that moment, she had no access to this mess of a situation and I held back on attempted communication to Greg through other friends, because he'd reacted similarly in the past, but not this powerfully and the arguments were never over a girl, and I knew that anything I said would only piss him off further.

Through friends I get messages he's slowly cooling down and would like to talk to me. By which time I publicly admit Emily and I are dating and I'm angry at the fact that he isn't happy for us both. He becomes pissed off again and rages over why I'm not saying sorry. I'm confused, this gets passed through to Greg, who responds with another few hundred words over Skype as to why he was pissed.

Gist of the message: Emily and Greg were still talking affectionately over facebook (even after Emily had told me she'd broken up) and he had text evidence. She never really liked me, but was using my as a physical side of the relationship while the mental side was the LDR between Greg and her, 'I was her fuckbuddy' as he'd said. She's been slowly seducing everyone in our social group.

I instantly closed my computer and cried for a few minutes before I decided to take a walk. I came back a few hours later, from which time he was offline (time zones) I'd settled down. I just sent a message back to Emily saying 'enjoy your holiday' and avoided reading any messages that popped up afterwards, of which many frantic messages appeared after she found that Greg had revealed the messages between both of them. But I was having trouble accepting this. I was trying to convince myself that this wasn't happening.

When she got back I tried to ask her to join my friends and I for a party (I really wanted to sit down and talk things over, I didn't want anything to go bad with our friendship). She said that Greg wouldn't allow her to do so. That's when it hit me. They were back together. I had been the rebound guy, I had betrayed a friend (albeit, without knowing) and had cornered myself in a box of despair.

I have talked to her in school a few times. She has told me that she does like me, that I was not her physical side of the relationship. But that there's just something that draws her back to Greg. She's not sure what it is. I have given her the definition of insanity: completing the same actions over and over again but expecting a different outcome. She admitted she was doing this, but in hope that Greg might actually act differently this time and not ignore and become bored of her after a period of time

But John (the mutual friend) had actually been informing Greg of the relationship the entire time. Not only that, but I had been giving John updates on what's up because he was our innocent friend who everyone loved, well not anymore, as everyone (in our social group) is now angry at him. Emily's best friend approaches me and tells me that she thinks Greg is manipulating Emily into staying with him, as he used the entire episode to guilt trip Emily into staying with him. She also mentions that Greg may even already be dating another girl in his resident country, but no-one can be sure.

But this wasn't to stop anything, I still (what had now become love) loved her, upon my definition of: 'never want to leave their side'. I am trapped between feelings of anger at her, feelings of resentment at myself for not forcing a friendship between us sooner, as this would have kept things working. Greg is also waiting for an apology, of which after 2 weeks of consolidating, I am ready to swallow what little pride I have and give it to him.


---


tl;dr: Was the rebound guy for my friends ex(friend moved to another country) in another country in a failed LDR. Started dating his ex (who I have a crush on), who ended up been in love with 2 people at once (My Friend and I). Not sure what to do, need advice!!!

**Background info:**

I moved to South Korea 4 months ago to study Business and Korean at a University. 
I was originally planning on surprising my parents by taking a flight back to the US a few days before Christmas because; my sister is pregnant and will have her baby before I return to America, I know my Dad misses me a lot (from our video calls and what my mom has told me), and I really want to see my family as well.

However I was offered an internship at one of Samsung's corporate offices during my Winter Break.(Winter Break is 10 Weeks long here)

My concern is if I don't do anything special during my time here, my Dad will be disappointed with me for wasting my time and his money. I think this because my Brother studied in New York but doesn't use his degree anymore, and my Dad always complains that my brother should have never gone.


**TL:DR** Should I visit my family for Christmas, or do I work an internship Abroad? "

1pq0wt,3,2013-11-01,"I've been denied for an internship for the 5th time in a row, and it's upsetting me a lot.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pq0wt/ive_been_denied_for_an_internship_for_the_5th/,"I am currently a 20 year old girl from Holland in my 3rd and final year of a education I love, and thought i was good at. The 3rd year is the year of our internship, we're supposed to be on our internship 4 days a week and go back to school 1 week.

The situation i'm in right now started at the end of the 2nd year, the moment we heard the name of the company we were going to have our internship if we get accepted after applying for said internship.

I've been feeling depressed since the age of 6 – my dad got his depression around that time and toke it al out on my mom and me. I can't remember a moment I didn't feel worthless until a year ago - I finally started to get a grip on myself without any professional help, which I don't want so it won't worry my parents -. Because of all these feelings i've always been scared of meeting new people which would take their own opinion about me.

Back the the last bit of my 2nd year, I freaked out when I hear we actually had to start applying for our internship, I cried my heart out in the middle of the class out of pure fear of what was going to come. My teacher tried to comfort me by saying she had an amazing company for me and that I was going to have the year of me life – she didn't realize how wrong she was.

All my classmates have gotten their internship on their first try, including the people that barely know where their ass is because they're always drunk and stoned. But me? Of course not! Today I got the news i've been denied for the 5th time in a row – and all I could think was how much I wanted to end my life.

I feel worthless. I'm doing a education I love and I thought I was good at - even though i'm not so sure about that anymore – if I really was as good as I though you'd think I'd have an internship by now. I've been talking to a really good friend -which happens to be a long term crush of mine- about this and I ended up irritating him like there's no tomorrow – he felt like I was over it and didn't expect words like “i want to kill myself” to come out of my mouth ever again.

I don't know what to do anymore – The first thought I have is that I rather die then going back to the group of people without internships -some got kicked out because they didn't care – others never applied because they didn't care. There's now an temporary solution for us to get the “internship” hours necessary to get our diploma. I feel like i'm going to get laughed at – everyone thought I wasn't going to return to that group because I applied to the new internship which denied me.
What can I do? I absolutely hate this year - it's making me feel worthless and suicidal all over again – I don't want to be suicidal – and makes me doubt my skills."

1pu6dw,1,2013-11-03,Intern looking for advice,[deleted],Dentists,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentists/comments/1pu6dw/intern_looking_for_advice/,"I am currently interning as a dental assistant.

I have been to over 10 different intern locations, general, pediatric, surgery, orthodontics and other specialties.

My class has 24 students also interning but the majority of them have already gotten job offers. I feel I am the only one who has not had one while others have had 3 or 4 offered to them. 

I understand my skills are not up to par yet.

While interning I am professional and friendly towards the patients and staff.

 I am a diligent note taker looking to learn as much as possible. I ask  questions after the patient has left unless the doctor allows questions during the treatment but I never question the doctor on why he is doing this or that. 

Whenever the staff or doctor try to correct me on a skill or something I do not take it personally, I thank them for their advice and try to refine my technique. 

In one of the places that I interned at I was told that interns are not allowed to take x-rays, call the pt back, or assist on a child if the parent was in the treatment room, a classmate went to the same place and she was asked to take x-rays, call the pt back and assist. That office never gave me a chance to show my skills. Why would one office tell me I can’t but allow another intern to do it? 

I hope the next office I intern at will give me a chance because I know I can be a great asset to their practice. I am such a hard worker (I have had a job for over 6 years, I have won awards for my hard work and dedication, I have had letters written to my boss about my helpfulness, I never call out, etc. but I cant mention “non-dental” things in the dental office, especially as an intern.) I feel the dr and staff cant see that because I am learning a whole new skill (assisting) and my passing isn’t the best yet. Every office I go to has “their way” of doing things and I don’t know how to read the Dr’s mind yet to know which instrument he wants next. 

It’s hard for the dr. to get to know me because so far my experience has been at every office, the dr locking himself in his office after each pt. 

A couple of the places have told me they were not hiring at the moment and then a couple of weeks later a classmate of mine has been offered a job as an assistant at their practice. What tips do you have to help me improve my skills and land a job offer before my semester ends?

Had a nasty break up with my ex of 6 years 8 months ago. Worked on my inner and outer game the summer. Started to work out, rekindled old friendships, started to hit and game women again (with moderate success).

Also I'm currently hitting a horrible streak. Girls keep flaking, my hunt for a new appartment has stalled, I havent been working out the last few weeks. Went clubbing on Halloween and struck out. AA kicked in, I only opened on set of three girls. The conversation was friendly but went nowhere.

So guys I need to hear some nice words. I know kinda the necessary steps to get out of this funk (finding an appartment and start to hit the gym again and approach way more girls) but I can't seem to get going. Help a brother out with some advice, motivation and encouragement

1psgff,1,2013-11-02,I Feel So Guilty,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1psgff/i_feel_so_guilty/,"I have a fantastic, brilliant, supportive and beautiful girlfriend. She's done wonders for me, helped me work through things and inspired me to do things that I've only talked about doing for years.

But part of what I wanted to do for years was move to a big city, 400 miles away from where she is. I've since found a job and settled into a life I literally never thought I'd have. Good job, great pay and I've sort of just come into my own since being here. Changed up the way I dress, gotten more confident, feel more stable and relaxed.

While she's back home, she's doing an internship that may lead her to another major city. Not my major city. It's a dream job for her, one that her mentors are begging her to go after. She's gone to school for 10 years now to get to this point and it would be a total career changer for her.

The plan was for her to move here upon graduation, but now she's asking me when I'm moving to her city. I don't want to be there and I've been clear about it. I love where I'm at. I've worked, saved and delayed gratification for years so I could get to where I am-- as has she. 

With that, I'm really uncertain about our future together. I won't keep her from pursuing her dream and I can't give up mine. Digging deeper, she's talked more about kids and marriage recently and I'm FAR from that mindset. Do I really want to ask her to give up a dream job, move to a city she doesn't love on the basis of a relationship that I'm not sure about?

But what I feel most guilty and ashamed about is this: looking at other women and wanting to be single. The city I live in is home to models and literally the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I've been told on numerous occasions by my almost all female office that if I were single, I'd be overwhelmed with beautiful, single women because men here are either A) gay or B) assholes (according to them). One of my male co-workers (and sort of mentor) sat me down and basically said to me ""You're 24. What are you doing in a relationship while living here?""

With all of that in mind, it's just gotten me so focused on being single. I love my girlfriend and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I've never been a desirable, financially-stable and confident guy to the extent that I feel I would be in this city. I wasn't cool growing up, I wasn't popular or great with women. I've never had the opportunity to just see how I'd do as an eligible bachelor in the city. It's pathetic and pretty sad, I feel, but I'm genuinely curious. I miss the excitement of being single. I miss being able to hang out with whoever I want without it being weird. 

That's been plaguing my mind for a few weeks. Off my chest now.

the good:

- I'm and incredibly picky person in that I never find people that I feel emotionally AND sexually attracted to. My boyfriend is one of maybe two or three such people that I've ever met in my entire life. 
- I love his family. Theyve become nearly a second family to me.
- He is incredibly responsible and thats something that you don't find that often in a 20 year old guy.
- He doesn't drink or smoke, which is nice in that I don't feel the constant pressure to go play beer pong with him at some frat party.

the bad: 

- I spent about 2 weeks living in his apartment over the summer because of housing issues and had a HORRIBLE time. I mean like breaking-down-in-the-shower bad. I had expected it to be talking, cuddling, sharing our days, sex, etc but it was none of those. I would get back after a 16 hour day (work + internship + two classes + volunteering = long ass day) and want to rant about crappy landlords, only to have him interrupt me MID-FUCKING-RANT to yell at the video game he was playing. this is a red flag to the extreme; if I cant spend 2 weeks with him what does this mean for our future?
- I often have little ""friend crushes"" where I get a weird fasination with a guy and begin to wonder what it'd be like to date him. I have never even remotely persued anything, but the fact that I think about it makes me wonder if thats healthy.
- He and I are complete opposites. I often feel that he doesnt get excited about the things that I am into and just shoots down my ideas about cool dates (ex: LETS GO GEOCHACHING! his response: ""that sounds like a murder plot in a movie""). We often find ourselves doing nothing but watching movies (though this might be because we rarely get more than a couple hours together at a time, and there isnt much else to do)
- I am vegetarian and I like to try new foods. He vehemently refuses to eat anything that has any kind of vegetable in it and is incredibly picky about food, to the point that I get legitimately angry over it.

I have a really strong attachment to him, though that might be because he is the only ""real"" and intimate relationship I've had. The thought of leaving him makes me want to cry, but I can't help wonder if I'm wasting my college years on someone that isn't a good match for me. It doesn't help that (tooting my own horn here, forgive me) there is no shortage of men interested in me. Occationally I desperatly want to be a typical college girl and oogle random guys, and flirt shamelessly, and maybe even sleep with more than one person in my life. But then I wonder if I'd regret leaving my boyfriend over some dumb desire to sleep with one of the many incredibly sexy guys that hvae shown interest, and I doubt I'd be emotionally into any of these aforementioned attractive guys.


I guess I'm just really torn..... any advice/words of wisdom/ experiences appreciated

1pwr7t,0,2013-11-04,Joker is the father of Harley Quinn (spoilers?),Gemini911,FanTheories,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1pwr7t/joker_is_the_father_of_harley_quinn_spoilers/,"Harleen Quinnzel becoming Harley Quinn

Harleen Quinnzel is an intern at Arkham Asylum who becomes infatuated with a patient, that particular patient being Joker. She has a promising future in both education and gymnastics.  She wanted to examine him so bad for some odd reason that it took her three months for special clearance to do so. He was able to gain her admiration and both began a deep relationship. She helps him escape from the asylum and her license was revoked. She then becomes a patient and final takes on the Harley Quinn persona when an earthquake hits Gotham.
Quinn and Joker's relationship
Their twisted relationship is both comedic and abusive/ manipulative. It is also seen as a marvel that Harley was able to form a long term relationship with the sociopathic villain that is Joker. He genuinely accepts the relationship but sometimes tries to get rid of her finding that it is intruding upon his personality.
Joker's Background

In The Killing Joke, It is revealed that Joker was originally a regular man who was forced to commit crime to support his pregnant wife Jeannie. He takes on the identity of Red Hood to try to support his growing family. He is stricken by grief when he learns his wife had died in an accident and attempts to back out of the chemical plant robbery. The criminals still persuade him to do so and when chased by batman, he falls into chemicals becoming Joker. 
Harleen Quinnzel: Daughter of Joker

Joker is notified by the police  that his wife died in a household accident. Actually she died in the hospital where the baby was able to be saved by the doctors. The baby was kept in an incubator due to beliefs that the baby may die. Joker was grief stricken by the idea that they were both dead and followed through with the crime. When the doctors were able to nurse the baby back to health, the crime was already carried out leaving the child as an orphan so a social worker was arranged to relocate the baby to a foster home. The baby was then adopted by a more wealthy family in which she received a good education and encouragement of extracurricular  activities. When old enough, she is told of her actually mother and father and begins to try to find what happened to him. She learns of what happened to him by newspaper articles and becomes determined to find him. She has to contact him secretly because she can not risk her future by letting everyone knows that she is Joker's daughter. She pursues an internship to get close to him and finally tells him the truth about her. When finally this is revealed to him, Joker is shocked and begins to grow a deep relationship with her. She attempts to help him break out so that they can connect. Seeing this happen, the authorities of the Asylum make her a patient. When she breaks out, she wants to reconnect with her father by becoming Harley Quinn or harlequin, meaning servant but signified as a clown. Joker is abusive and manipulative because he attempts to act as a father towards her but is frequently overwhelmed by psychological obstacles. These obstacles try to reject the idea of love for his daughter causing him to try to rid her from his life. Harley Quinn can't help this setback and tries to make a connection with her father. In one scenario, Joker sends her on a rocket that crashes into the park where she is found by Poison Ivy who plans to murder her. Harley Quinn, in resentment of her decisions to reconnect with her dad, has no fear leaving Poison Ivy puzzled. Poison Ivy then provides her leadership by opportunity of killing Joker and Batman. She attempts to throw him off a building but Joker apologizes and since she cannot just kill her father who is truly sorry, she forgives him for the murder attempt. 
(adopted family)

In Gotham City Sirens, she visits her adopted family. Her brother is unemployed and has no interest in a job because he is given money by Harley. Her mother regrets the fact that she told Harley of her past, and tries to persuade her away from a life of crime. Her father is in prison which is why the family does not live as they used to. The father shows signs of a corrupt and greedy individual only using Harley to get money from her. This forces her to resent her adoption family completely and avoids them. This ensures her that she made the right decision of reconnecting with her biological father, Joker.
(I am fully aware of other joker story arcs but wanted to base my theory off of one speciific and common one.)"
1pwia9,2,2013-11-04,Can you help an assistant intern out?,[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1pwia9/can_you_help_an_assistant_intern_out/,"I am currently interning as a dental assistant.

I have been to over 10 different intern locations, general, pediatric, surgery, orthodontics and other specialties.

My class has 24 students also interning but the majority of them have already gotten job offers. I feel I am the only one who has not had one while others have had 3 or 4 offered to them.

I understand my skills are not up to par yet.

While interning I am professional and friendly towards the patients and staff.

I am a diligent note taker looking to learn as much as possible. I ask questions after the patient has left unless the doctor allows questions during the treatment but I never question the doctor on why he is doing this or that.

Whenever the staff or doctor try to correct me on a skill or something I do not take it personally, I thank them for their advice and try to refine my technique.

In one of the places that I interned at I was told that interns are not allowed to take x-rays, call the pt back, or assist on a child if the parent was in the treatment room, a classmate went to the same place and she was asked to take x-rays, call the pt back and assist. That office never gave me a chance to show my skills. Why would one office tell me I can’t but allow another intern to do it?

I hope the next office I intern at will give me a chance because I know I can be a great asset to their practice. I am such a hard worker (I have had a job for over 6 years, I have won awards for my hard work and dedication, I have had letters written to my boss about my helpfulness, I never call out, etc. but I cant mention “non-dental” things in the dental office, especially as an intern.) I feel the dr and staff cant see that because I am learning a whole new skill (assisting) and my passing isn’t the best yet. Every office I go to has “their way” of doing things and I don’t know how to read the Dr’s mind yet to know which instrument he wants next (and some Dr's really have no patience for interns!)

It’s hard for the dr. to get to know me because so far my experience has been at every office, the dr locking himself in his office after each pt. The staff doesn't want to help me learn (they think I should just ""know"" it.) 

A couple of the places have told me they were not hiring at the moment and then a couple of weeks later a classmate of mine has been offered a job as an assistant at their practice. 

What tips do you have to help me improve my skills and land a job offer before my semester ends?

I am a currently doing a paid internship for the government. I get paid bi-weekly an average $540 (before taxes) and it's a lot of money for me. I have never seen this much money go into my bank account in my entire life. I think the most I've seen is $250 every two weeks. 

I've had a bad history of spending my money wrong and I have taken initiative by looking into better methods on how to spend my money wisely.

Here is exactly where I stand when it comes to paying for things:

- I own a Jeep Liberty 2002 / Spend $60 for a full tank of gas which lasts about two weeks /  $120 in total a month
- I pay for car insurance / $100 monthly
- I pay my cell phone bill / $60 monthly
- I have a gym membership / $35 monthly
- Netflix for the family / $8 monthly
TOTAL: $323 every month
---
That is all I have to pay for when it comes down to the end of the month.

Of course, me being 21 I do enjoy going out on the weekends to drink, I have a girlfriend I like to take out to eat (Chipotle, Panera, you get the idea), and I am in need of a new wardrobe because I have not gone shopping for clothes since 2011...

Where exactly do I find a balance here? I want to start saving money as early as possible but I'd like to maintain a balanced life as well.

A little help?

1pwcmf,13,2013-11-04,Not sure if I have existential depression or not..,existenz1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pwcmf/not_sure_if_i_have_existential_depression_or_not/,"To give a history/symptoms, first I think with the full realization that I have completed college and hopefully landing a job soon, I just realized that there are so many things that seem to last a while (such as schooling, maybe a summer long internship etc) that have already passed. I guess this led to the whole feeling of ""oh you'll be middle age before you know it etc"", even though I am only 22.

Then that led to the inevitable thought of death/what lies beyond. Now I am an agnostic that is open to religions/paranormal things being true, but for example I am pretty much fully confident that none of the big/main religions have any chance of being correct BUT I feel I have also had some paranomal experiences and believe in ghosts if you ask me. So obviously the idea of possibly not existing is terrifying.

But at the same time, the idea of eternity is also terrifying. I realize that all of my and each other's thoughts are from a human related point, so the rational part of the brain goes ""eternity would be horrible because eventually one would have no more stimuli, nothing would lead to dopamine being released and one would be bored of everything etc"" but still. And the really strange part to me is that in a sense it seems like to each individual that we've been around forever because we don't remember before the age of 3 or whatever. So the idea of eternity is terrifying, but at the same time I don't want to die anytime soon.  It seems weird to think that most people's plan/method of coping would just be not to think about it and ""put it off"" hopefully for ironically forever, but forever in itself seems like a bad thing.

So like I said I'm not sure if this would classify as existential depression because I am not really concerned with ""the meaning of life"" or something subjective like that. I also have a passion for music, so it's also not like I feel directionless or something. 

The thought of resetting/reincarnation or something where I could in a sense live forever but not realize it seems like the best answer (as we could have experienced past lives already and not know it) but it still doesn't help currently, as I can understand right now that it would still be eternal and hurts my brain trying to grasp it.

So TL:DR; can't stop thinking about the eventuality (which creeps closer every second) of what seems to be two horrible outcomes.


Any help/advice?"
1pv2wf,9,2013-11-04,"Need to Vent, Need to Unload",Lear_King_Of_Britain,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1pv2wf/need_to_vent_need_to_unload/,"I just have to vent here.  No throwaway.

I hate myself sometimes.  I have been dealing with depressing for over a decade now.  I'm hitting my mid twenties and I just go through phases of depression.  Hell, I won't even finish school until I'm nearly 26, that's a bachelors.  I am so cyclic I hate it.  I am a slave to my environment and my own poor choices that I just can't seem to ever change.

Here is one thing on my mind.  I have depression and I know I'm supposed to treat it.  I have a counselor and I have mediation.  Yet even though I set out a week's worth of med's in a pill box I just don't take them.  I do everything I can to make it easier, I lack total motivation.  I will get a month's prescription of daily med's at it can last over 3.  I never take it consistently and never long enough to have an effect on me.

I never go to my counselor anymore.  I make excuse after excuse.  I know they help because I can be totally open without having to lie about how I feel.  I don't go tho.  It is free and I just need to make one phone call to schedule.  I have been putting it off.  I told my self and promised I would about 2 months ago.  Did I do it?  No.  I just feel worse off.

I can't change my pattern no matter how much I try.  I renew my meds and see a counselor and do okay for a couple weeks and then I fall back into my shitty life.  Depressed, staying up late, sleeping in and feeling tired.

My performance is lackluster.  I am about to fail a class, my first one ever.  My other classes I work hard in and still get decent grades, but I know it isn't my best work.  My lack of sleep makes me to tired to stay awake in class.  I fall asleep every day and can't help it.  I have basically stopped showing up to work and blame the person I work with for not providing what I or because I am to ""busy"" with midterms.
needed when in reality it is because I can't get out of bed.

I feel like I cannot give any amount of attention to anything.  I'm constantly jumping around.  I can't sit still or focus on a single task for more than a few minutes.  The only thing that helps is redbull and a panic attack.

I've made huge mistakes.  I got drunk a couple weeks ago and forgot to turn in homework.  I ended up puking all over and felt disgusting for a couple days.  I had never even considered drinking before and I won't ever again.  I procrastinate chronically.  I finish papers with shitty all nighters instead of ever doing real work.  I'm always rushing from deadline to deadline.  I spend all day on the internet.  I can't even play video games anymore.  They require to much interactivity to be enjoyable.  I just state blankly, watching and clicking.  I can't get anything done because I think I am literally addicted.

I eat like shit because I am too depressed to cook.  I've gained like 40+ pounds in a less than a year.  I never exercise.  My life is going to shit.  Why can't I be happy with myself?  Why do I fail every time I try to make positive changes?

I have lost religious faith and have no crutch there but am still controlled by its influence.  Family, peers and school are all dominated by religion.  I live a lie and wish I could believe again but my hate and bitterness robs me of my childhood crutch.

I should be happy.  I have college paid for, a good job and an internship coming soon.  I wish I could fix myself and feel happy.  

Why can't I make any changes?  Why am I chronically procrastinating?  Why can't I even do small things to change me life for the better?  Why must I lie to myself so much that I start to believe it?  I can't even focus on the important things or do the things I once enjoyed.

The only reason I'm alive is because I am to lazy to change that fact.  I am a lazy coward who never does anything.  I fear pain and hurting others and I can't bring myself to take drastic measures.  Yet, I can't even bring myself to make small changes.

Thanks for listening, I just feel like shit tonight and have been feeling especially shitty for 10 months now."
1pv1km,6,2013-11-04,Experimented with cousin--jealous of his life,throway100000,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pv1km/experimented_with_cousinjealous_of_his_life/,"I am not even sure if this really happened anymore. I was around 7 at the time and thought it was a game we played until I was 15 and I took sex ed. Realized the gravity of what we were doing. Now its been so long that I am not sure if it really happened or if I imagined the whole thing. The memories seem to real to be imagined.

He is only 2 years older than me. I know kids experiment and I think he wanted to emulate what he found in his dads porn stash. He initiated but I actually enjoyed playing (makes me sick to say). My rational side doesn't want to blame him for what we did but my emotional side wants beat the shit out of him. It didn't occur for very long; after a few times of this happening, I tried to initiate the game (which makes me sick) he refused saying he didn't want to play anymore. Never spoke about it again (to anyone) and our relationship was never negatively affected by it. He has always treated me like a brother.

But lately I am wondering if this experience has affected me more than I think it did. I have been incredibly shy my whole life, anxious, and anti-social (or maybe awkward would be better to say). However, today my dad was telling a story of when I was 4/5 and how I was an outgoing kid. Made stupid faces to make people laugh, always trying to venture out and explore on my own, talked to anyone and everyone. I have never been like that for what I can remember, I have never had a friend, always felt alone, irrationally afraid of anything new or remotely dangerous. 

After asking my dad when I changed from, I guess friendly/outgoing, to my shy demeanor I discovered that it wasn't too much after the experimentation. (Within the year at least). I don't see how a kid could change that drastically in a year or 2. My dad would even joke that he maybe he switched me with another kid at a park the change was that drastic.

After figuring this out I am filled with so much anger at my cousin over what happened and myself for not being aware of the situation. It never once crossed my mind that I was scarred or damaged from what happened. I read online that it was common and accepted that it happens, no big deal, just move on with it.

With that said here I am, alone, hate myself, a failure in everything I have ever attempted. Everyday there is something new that I hate myself for. My short term memory is going, my enamel is going, I am balding, my body is somehow becoming scarred with I don't know what (best way I can describe it is a cross between a pimple and a bug bite), losing my hearing/smell and especially vision at an alarming rate, when I talk I am stuttering more and can't going a few sentences without struggling to recall the name for an object or word to describe what I want to say, drawing (which I actually won a few high school awards for) are getting worse and worse, no siblings to try and talk through what I'm feeling, hell even my dog doesn't want to interact with me. For years I've had low-self esteem but took solace in the fact that physically I was pretty good looking. Not great, 6/10, maybe more if I cleaned myself up but with confidence touching the floor I must've looked like a 2. I believed it was only a matter a time until I took the raw materials and molded myself into something...good. but now my body is deteriorating. I'm in my early 20s, this shouldn't be happening. My cousin is not too blame, but every year he gets better looking without trying while I'm drowning.

I work at a shitty CVS job even though I have a degree in Electrical Engineering. As much as I wish I could blame my school, the fault lies with me. My degree is nothing but a lie about my credentials. I tried studying material outside of the classroom but felt overwhelmed and was only able to comprehend high level abstractions and not the details of how those said abstractions work. I could pass a test no problem, but it felt like after every test all the knowledge would disappear. 

In addition to spending hours on my studies I spent an equal amount of time trying to make friends. I tried faking confidence but I think it came off as off putting to people. I joined clubs in college and ended being the workhorse for those clubs. i.e. I would help set up fundraisers, create and send fliers to sponsered parties, oversee the club websites. But I never felt connected with those people. I gave everything I had to try and make connections, asked people if afterwards they wanted to hangout or get a drink and was always given an excuse. I would go home look at their facebook and instead of studying for a test they were gong out to a bar. I have spent years looking things up on the internet to connect with people and fail. Even on reddit. In /r/r4r I posted some interests hoping I could find someone similar enough to be friends with. A few people responded to my posts, fewer sent me their email so we could chat. After 3 or 4 emails they stopped responding and I got the message. Even on the internet I can't hold a conversation.

I maybe rambling, but this is how I feel everyday. I have hated myself for how I am as a person and for the results I have accrued in life. That being said my cousins life, unlike mine, has been fucking fantastic. He may have some issues of his own that I don't know but I know they are fucking nothing like mine. He has is charismatic, he draws people to him, makes guys want to buy him a beer and women want to fuck him. Growing up my family would prefer him over me, telling me to get out of pictures so they could have a couple of just him. I don't mean a couple of just him, I mean going on vacation where family pictures were being taken, no one wanted one of me, so I ditched my entire family to go back to the car and no one noticed until it was time to leave for the day. I was 9.

He had a huge group of friends and hookups in high school, star athlete, incredibly good looking and confident. I never had a negative thought about the guy. I would talk to him about my loneliness and he would invite me to parties, help me out with women, talking to people. Never had success but I appreciated his efforts and felt nothing but gratitude.  Growing up I idolized him. 

However, my opinion changed slightly after highschool. He wanted to party, so he worked at a dead end job. Thought college was for chumps. Meanwhile I went to school for a great major I hoped would help me lead a successful life. I expected him to have his fun but eventually realize his mistake and lead an empty life. On the other hand, I would have a job that would allow me to have the life I always wanted. The life where I never had to worry about money, I could go on vacations to exciting places, have a nice home with a backyard and picket fence, after the stress of college learn more about myself, try to get a small core group of friends (like the Friends or HIMYM).  I will admit a part of me was happy to know that my hard work would pay off (and I busted my ass for those shitty classes) meanwhile his cavalier attitude would cost him. 

But now I look at how our lives ended up. He had his fun, getting high, partying with friends, etc., and even realized his mistake and going to community college for marketing. Good choice, he definitely has the personality. I expected his future to turn out like how I envisioned mine would but it's happening much faster than I expected. He is only a year in school but he already has a job in marketing making a ton of money and locked the job in his short time there. He got the job by making connections with local ""celebrities"" while partying. My cousin told these celebrities his life change and they informally introduced my cousin to a marketing manager they knew. The manager originally was doing the meet as a favor but was charmed by my cousin that he decided to break protocol and hire my cousin as an intern. He has only been there a couple of months but the manager and employees like him so much  that they are giving him a guaranteed job and will wait for him to graduate. In 3 years he will be making 80k salary, stock options, and more. With virtually no debt, and in his words ""glad I got all that partying out of my system."" Later that day my dad told me his stories of me as a kid.

Meanwhile my life...in 3 years I will probably still be working at CVS. Still living at home, still alone. I can't fucking believe that while I worked my ass off and failed at making friends in college and learning my major that all he had to do was just charm his way into getting an incredible job. Experimenting as kids as being the reason for fucking me up to the degree that it shaped my life is probably an exaggeration. It's probably a reaction to my cousins news. Every shitty aspect of my life I have brought on myself, kind of a fucked up childhood, but at a certain point you have to accept that a persons life is a result of their actions and efforts. I should have tried spent the time trying to make friends to my school work. Or just gotten over my fears in life, or just learned how to imitate peoples social behavior. I feel it's too late to change anything. I am too in debt to go back to school, my body is crapping out on me, and I am crying my eyes out with how my life turned out. I have been drinking for the last 2 weeks to numb my pain and it's not working anymore. Everyday I have to drink more than I did the previous day to function.

I originally wrote this in /r/confession but it has turned into nothing but me bitching. Not a true confession. I have to be up in 4 hours, I don't care about grammar or spelling. I hoped this would be therapeutic but now I feel worse than before. I'm not sure if I am going to keep this up but if anyone decides to post please don't be too harsh. Normally I welcome blunt, rude, constructive criticism, but right now I am mentally on the brink of...I don't know."

I've been with a company part time since June doing graphic design work and some web design for them. I was hired as a paid intern but have been working as a part time designer since end end of the summer (when my internship technically ended.) I work independently designing and coding marketing emails, infographics, various marketing assets, and print material. I am however, still getting the pretty low hourly wage I started off at as an intern. 

This past week some work I did for them was featured as an example of ""Brilliant Email Marketing"" on Hubspot's blog. I'm well liked by HR, the CEO, and at least one of my managers. I am employed there indefinitely and work well with everyone else. 

I'm wondering if I should ask for a raise. I could make similar money waiting tables. I love what I'm doing and I'm passionate about it but don't want to push it asking too much or going way off base.

I doubt anyone has had a similar experience but I'd love to get some opinions from other designers about this. Thanks!

I found out quickly that my job places a heavy emphasis on calculating uncertainty, identifying trends and other data analysis (lots of data).  I also use a lot of spatial statistics (kriging, sequential simulation etc.)  I took a graduate level statistical methods course this fall and I really liked it.  I'm now considering continuing on with a graduate degree in statistics.  It needs to be online and I'm not concerned about the price (I will be working and they will pay for it).  I think my concern is that while I'm sure to pick up a few things in a graduate program, the majority of the program won't be applicable to engineering.  I'm not wanting to become a statistician, just a better engineer.  So here are some things I think I will learn and I'm hoping an someone can give me some feedback:

-Regressions: I am constantly dealing with some response variable that may or may not be a function of 100 different things.  I want to learn more about how those variables effect my output.

-Uncertainties: I am constantly fighting a battle of not enough data.  If I fill in some blank spots (possibly from a distribution), what type of uncertainty will that create?

-Graphics: I learned quickly that it doesn't matter how good your idea is, you have to be able to convey complicated ideas to management and I like some of the graphical tools statistics offers.

This look hasn't done anything for me, but I've never been in a position of authority before.  I'm already very young for my new position so my look needs to command some respect.     
      
**The opportunity:**  I start my new job (at a new company), and have some time &amp; money to go shopping.     
     
**The problem:**    
    
Firstly, **boots**:  I need a pair CSA approved steel toe safety boots.  Safety boots are ugly and the women's selection is dismal.  If you have suggestions I would be delighted. I also need a pair of snow boots just for the ""office"".  Obviously business casual will not work - more like construction management (is that a look?).      
      
Secondly, **jeans**: I don't know anything about the different jeans types.  Currently I mostly wear skinny jeans, although they look comical with my giant ugly safety boots.  

Lastly, **shirts &amp; sweaters**:  I really struggle with this one the most.  I like hoodies, but they make me look like a teenager.  I like cardigans but they're not warm enough.  I don't like figure hugging shirts because belly.  Any suggestions for my body type?    
      
Please help, I don't want to look like the intern anymore.     
     
**Edit:** Thank you for all your help and links!  I am planning to go jeans shopping today, which I think is probably the most important component of my wardrobe.  I usually look terrible in button downs, but I haven't tried to wear one in years and will give it another shot tonight.  "

Wife and I met each other during high school. We started dating then and made it our goal to get married after graduation. Back then none of our parents really told us not to get married in fact they actively encouraged it. 

We both went to the same college together I got into better schools but I stayed close so I could be with my wife. I don’t know what the reason was but by our sophomore year wife was doing terrible in her classes. I tried my best to help her throughout everything but she kept on saying “college wasn’t for me, I am not cracked out for this.” Eventually she dropped out, I transferred to my original dream school graduated. After moving to the other school this is where feelings of “I could do better” initially crept in. 


I started looking at my wife as being a lower ‘class’ than me in a sense not as much cultured. I did my best to repress these feelings but it was everything the way I dressed as opposed to hers. After graduation we moved together, I did my best to try to “culture” my wife. I started working a job from an internship, I was already making great money for a recent college graduate. Wife on the other hand I was able to weasel her way into a job making copies for the company I worked for. 

After a couple years, those feelings started coming back again. It was more so when we had enough money, and my wife was looking into buying our first home together. Those feelings of me being better than her came up. That coupled with me starting to get a lot more attention from women too only made things worse. I realized I was becoming an asshole to her when she hadn’t done anything to me. I did my best to try to talk to her she was apologetic the entire way through which she shouldn’t have since it was my own demons. I tried marriage counseling but it was me that had the problem. I kept on telling myself I could do better when I had a loving caring woman in front of me. It eventually got to the point where I was embarrassed of introducing her to my colleagues, at functions from work. 

After a while I told my wife I wanted a divorce, she was heartbroken but I thought it would be the best for her since I was being a complete asshole towards her. We separated but my wife didn’t really have a car so for a while she needed me to bring her back home from work. It got to the point where when I’d go to drop her off at her place, I could hear her silently crying. About a couple months later she got a car so I only saw her rarely at my job. 
I ended up going through a slutty phase myself and afterwards started seeing a woman that I viewed “on my level.” I started to realize after being with this girl how much I missed my exwife. How my exwife was so simple. I guess my exwife found out that I was with someone else because she started asking me to come over to her apartment to help her out with things. Afterwards she’d usually have something prepared we’d eat. Catch up for a bit then head out. I could tell she still wants me back.

I want to get back together with my exwife I still think she wants me back but I don’t know how to do it. I wronged her so badly, I was an asshole I made her feel like she was below me. I don’t even know what to do.  My heart tells me to get back together with her but than the other part tells me I don’t deserve her. I really need help on what to do now :( .

**tl-dr – Married wife young, thought I could do better, realized wife was there all along. Now I want to go back to wife but I don’t feel like I deserve her after wronging her.**

Under the wing of Kenneth Branagh the film, simply titled ‘Thor’, was the fourth installment of Phase One in the Marvel Cinematic universe that had previously featured ‘The Incredible Hulk’ (with a global box office of over $200 million) and ‘Iron Man’ (that reached over $500 million globally) in 2008. Then in 2010 Robert Downey Jr shared his suit for the second time in ‘Iron Man 2’ taking over $600 million at the box office. Then in 2011 – it was hammer time. Grossing just shy of Iron Man’s $500 million, it became in instant hit winning over the critics, the loyal comic book fans and, with the introduction of Chris Hemmsworth, the women. Soon after the smash success Thor hit cinemas, launching the young career of Hemsworth and putting talented Tom Hiddleston into the much deserved lime light, in April 2011 planning of the sequel was announced. Kenneth Branagh withdrew from Directing the sequel and the job went to Alan Taylor, in January 2012, after initial production had started. Alan Taylor is known primarily for his award winning work on the HBO series Game of Thrones. After the incredible success of Joss Weadon’s Avengers Assemble, buzz had already started revolving around the future of Marvel films. 


The beauty of Thor : The Dark World, apart from Tom Hiddleston, is the audience it opens out to – everyone. It simply works on so many levels and can make everyone happy in one way or another. Whether it be the romance side, the action side, the drama side, or the Natalie Portman side. It is pure entertainment.

There is little one can criticize about the film. The script, written by the talented Robert Rodat (known most for his work with Spielberg and film such as Saving Private Ryan) and Don Payne who died of bone cancer in March of this year, is great and rife with the slightly cheesy yet still emotive lines and humor by all of the cast. The story, despite the slight simplicity of it, gives the right about of character development, heroic gestures, hammer throwing, twist and turns. 

The film revolves around the recently awakened Dark Elves – led by Malekith, played by former Doctor Christopher Eccleston – that come from a time before the Universe (if that is even possible?).  Wanting revenge on Asgard and more they come to reek havoc, meanwhile, Thor has still not returned to earth after New York and has some unfinished business. 

There are no weak roles or performances in the film and every character is believable, however, what is outstanding about the film is the interactions between the characters. Thor and Loki (who is possibly one of cinemas best villains, with a performance by Hiddleston that makes the character both evil and likable) have routinely fun banter and the relationships in the film are interesting and fun.

There are some unlikely outstanding performances such as Rene Russo’s Frigga (Thor’s mother) and Jaimie Alexander as Sif, whose relationship with Thor, as well as an thought provoking scene after the credit, makes you yearn for more of her – which we could be expecting hush hush.

A small gripe I may have with the film is Kat Denning’s character Darcy and her intern, Jonathan Howard. It is not that their performances are bad, however, they are slightly unnecessary and, apart from created some – undoubtedly funny – comic relief, the film would be no worse or better without them. On the other hand, they could be considered contrasts to the Gods, the simple mortal relationships a counterpoise to the Gods of Asgard.

Christopher Eccleston does a wonderful job as the main villain Malekith but I do think he was slightly under used and needed for screen time and interaction with the main protagonists. 

What is surprising about the film is the quite beautiful cinematography, despite the film being special effects heavy; there is no CGI that draws you out of the moment. It was filmed on location in Iceland and London, with some absolutely incredible fight scenes, which is not a surprised with a director like Taylor. The combat scenes would cause a hell of a lot of paper work though.

There is the routine cameo featuring Stan Lee, that is guaranteed to raise a smile and one other hilarious cameo that I will not spoil for you here but I urge you to go see who it is. 

The film opened on the 30th October worldwide (apart from a America that opens on the 8th  November) and achieved a hugely impressive $109,400,000 but the question is, will it be able to dethrone Iron Man 3’s box office total of $2.7 billion? 

Overall this is a stellar film and I highly recommend going to see it, it will make you laugh, cry and will leave you stunned and craving a bit more Marvel. It is un common that a ‘pop corn’ film is such a work of art but thoroughly deserves the high rating. After all cinemas’ aim is to entertain. Watch till the very end, there are some surprised.

★★★★★

The next in Phase Two Marvel is Captain America : The Winter Solider that opens on 28th March 2014.

For the longest time I was in the classic, guy is too much of a pussy to be clear, therefore ends up ""friendzoned"" situation. We were pretty much best friends. I managed to turn that shit around last year and asked her out. We dated for a few weeks then mutually broke up on good terms because she had an out of state internship to attend, and we figured long distance would suck. We had plans to get back together after she came back, but never did. 

Fast forward to last week, we go to a party together and as she's drunk as fuck hugging the toilet, she tells me she's pregnant. It's definitely not my kid, we never had sex. I'm still sober at this point, just got off work, but she had been pre-gaming a little too hard.

Well fuck, guess it would be my responsibility to take care of her and make sure she's safe. So I make sure she's alright, and take her home. I end up staying the night there to make sure she's fine. We cuddle and share a bed, but that's it. 

I had already seen her a few times before this incident, and I've also seen her a few times since. Mostly just grabbing lunch or seeing a movie, that kind of stuff. 

I'm 19, I can't possibly raise a kid. The dad certainly isn't stepping up either. It would be a pretty shitty thing to just ditch her, but I don't exactly want to get more involved. "

1pyazh,0,2013-11-05,"I (20F) cheated on my boyfriend (25M) and feel terrible, do I confess or not?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pyazh/i_20f_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_25m_and_feel/,"I’m together with my boyfriend (Jacob, 25) for almost 9 months. He is good to me, he makes me happy, but I sometimes have doubts because he is my first boyfriend and I’m afraid that I’m “missing out”. I’m not sure if he’s the one, even though I do love him for now. What adds to that, is that he is in a different country right now for an internship (for 6 months), and I’m not sure if our relationship will survive that.

One month ago, a guy I met earlier (Chris, 21) started approaching me. It was obvious that he was attracted to me, but I told him that I already had a boyfriend. We still went out two times with a group friends, as there were other people there, and as I wasn’t really interested at first, I didn’t think that that would do any harm. I also thought that he’d never make a move, knowing I have a boyfriend.

On the second 'date' though, we ended up alone at his place (the friends left earlier) and talked for a very long time. I had had a lot of fights with my boyfriend that week, about him leaving for 6 months for an internship in a different country. We were stressed and afraid that our relationship might get hurt. He also denied me for sex two times in that week, which normally doesn’t ever happen. I told him all about it and he was asking me if I really wanted my boyfriend, if I was sure that our relationship would survive the time apart. These were doubts that already were in my mind, so I was convinced at that moment that I was going to break up with Jacob. We kept talking and I was so charmed by him and then we had sex.

I kind of fell in love with Chris and I was considering breaking up with Jacob, but I couldn’t do it (he left the country 2 days later). Since then, I’ve kept contact with Chris and he told me that he had feelings for me and that I was the only girl that had mattered to him in a long time. He tried to convince me to beak it off with Jacob and to start something with him. In the meantime, Jacob was handling the distance really well (sending sweet texts, not acting jealous). I decided for myself to stay with Jacob, but didn't tell Chris about my decision.

Then, last week, Chris got mad at me for something stupid and we decided that we aren’t fit for each other, so we won’t keep in touch anymore. He handled this as dickish as possible, insulting me, saying he actually can’t stand me anymore, confessing to the fact that he has slept with 3 other girls after we had sex (in 4 weeks, that is). He also said that he’d never actually felt anything for me, that he hadn’t been in love since breaking up with his ex two years ago (she was 15 years old and he was raving about the fact that she was so young and innocent and still a virgin).

After hearing those things, it suddenly dawned on me that I made a huge mistake and now I feel extremely guilty. I felt lied to, even though I cheated myself. It also appeared that I didn't actually love Chris, I just wanted to believe that, I don't really know why. The things he said did hurt me to some extent, but not in the way they would hurt if someone I really cared about said them.
I’m disgusted with myself and I feel like I need to throw up the whole time ever since the fight with Chris.
This situation also made me realize that I do love Jacob and that I’m apparently not missing out on anything. But now I don’t deserve him anymore.

I’m going to visit Jacob on his internship this Sunday, so I feel like I need to have sorted this out with myself before I go there. The ironic thing is, we're celebrating our 9 months together this weekend. We already bought gifts and we're both very excited to see each other again.

So I don’t know what to do, do I confess to Jacob or not? I want to confess but for selfish reasons: I need to get this off my chest. He’ll never know about it if I don’t tell him and maybe that’s for the best? I don’t want to hurt him. And this won't ever happen again, it was a mistake that I won't repeat. And if I do confess, when do I do it? Do I do it right now over the phone or after the internship, when we can talk face-to-face?

TL;DR: Cheated on boyfriend, thought I was in love, wasn't in love after all, realized I love my boyfriend. To confess or not? 

EDIT: I'm looking for advice about the question I posted, not for insults! And therapy is not an option."

So a bit of backstory.  She moved into my neighborhood when we were little kids so we grew up together and became very close.  Our neighborhood consisted of 10 kids all around the same age so we were together all the time.  After about 8 years of knowing eachother I started to fall for her,  she was always the flirty type so I thought she was interested in me.  My senior year of high school we dated for about 5 months, but I felt like I was the one that wanted to be in the relationship so I got scared and started to become too clingy.  Which I know is what ultimately caused her to get drawn to someone else.  I was young and immature and I thought I was in love so I was heartbroken.

Fast forward to us going me going to college the following year and deciding to cut off contact with her because she crushed me.  With us being neighbors however that didn't last too long, we eventually became friends again around Christmas last year (3 years of barely interacting).  She had a serious boyfriend for about 2 years and I was fine with that, I essentially just wanted my best friend back.  A few months later they broke up, but I never pestered her for details about it.  However it was known from her, along with her sister and friends that she was still madly in love with him.  I also found out from her sister that he was verbally abusive to her and she would constantly come home crying.  

The start of last summer was great, we hung out all the time. I spend a week house sitting for my cousins and everynight she came over to hang out since I couldn't leave(They had 3 dogs, 1 being and puppy and another close to dying).  We would just hang out and watch movies and play with the dogs.  Nothing ever went further than a hug goodnight when she would go home, we lived about 5 minutes away.  I would see her texting her ex those nights so I eventually asked her about it.  She told me they were just trying to patch things up and to not worry about it, so I did just that.  As we hung out more and more I could feel my feelings for her coming back which started to scare me because she just got back into my life.  I promised myself I wouldn't act on them and only wanted to stay friends.  Towards the middle of the summer I got an internship so our schedules wouldn't exactly work out to hang out.  The thing is we would always ask eachother to hang out, her ask me or me ask her.  Once I started working though she never asked though.  Whenever I would ask her she would say she would want to hang out then last minute she would bail on me.  I eventually got on her case about it and it turns out she had started hanging out with her ex again and he didn't like how close we had gotten so she essentially chose him over me.  Which really hurt.  As small as it seems she forgot my birthday, which has never happened.  A few weeks before summer ended we were at one of our neighbors graduation party and she left in tears because her ex had allegedly slept with someone and proceeded to tell her about it.  

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, she texts me asking if she can come up to visit one weekend.  Thinking nothing of it and wanting to repair the great thing we had over the summer I told her to come up.  We end up having a decently sized pre game party at our house and get pretty drunk while just hanging out and having a good time. Later on we split up from our group and go to one of the local bars with her friend and one of my roommates.  As the night went on we started dancing and drinking more(I've never been one to really dance, but in my state I just said screw it).  She was grinding up on me and when she would talk to me she would get real close to my face and just stare at me smiling.  After awhile I just said screw it and we started making out, this happened about 5 times throughout the night.  At one point she just smiled at me and said we haven't kissed since high school and just pulled me in again. We eventually went back to my place, we didn't do anything there just passed out.  It was around 4 in the morning.

Last weekend I went down to her college more so because my roommates and I went to go visit our friends for the weekend.  I saw her on Saturday where we went to a one of the many bars down there.  The bar had a dance floor so we went up there to hang out.  Right as we got up there I thought I spotted her ex, but didn't think anything of it since I knew he didn't go there.  It was him though.....once she saw him she lost it.  I pulled her far enough away where he wouldn't be able to see her or hear her.  She kept yelling at me to let her go and show him she was there and didn't care he was but I wouldn't let her.  She started hitting me, not hard just smacking my chest, I let it go because I knew it wasn't directed towards me.  Eventually I got her out of the bar where we sat in an alley for what felt like ages with her yelling and  crying hysterically about how she knew he cheated on her when they were dating and how she hates him.  She did the typical girl thing when it comes to an ex, saying how she'll never find a good guy, why does she love the assholes, no one cares about her.  All the while I'm holding her in my arms trying to to lose my cool seeing one of my oldest friends and one of the people I care about most completely losing there mind.  

Here's what stuck me the hardest and what I'm having issues coping with now.  She revealed to me that she cut herself because of him.  I asked her who else knew and she said only me, which now puts a huge weight on my shoulders.  I feel like now I'm going to constantly be worried about her now and I don't know how I should deal with this now.  I talked to her in the morning about it and she tried to pass it off like it wasn't that big of a deal because they pretty much healed, which really bothered me.  I just want to help her somehow.

I guess what I'm asking is advice on how I should help her get through this situation.  I feel like I got very sidetracked throughout this post, I also would like to point out that I still have strong feelings for her, but none that I would ever act on them. The night at the bar was a mistake in both of our minds I'm pretty sure.  Sorry for the long post, thanks if you made it this far.

tl;dr  One of my oldest friends/ex, that I still have feelings for, revealed to me that she cut herself over her ex.  Need advice on how to help her."
1pxdjx,1,2013-11-04,Ugh I this girl seemed special but now I don't know where things stand,I_Am_Keith_Stone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pxdjx/ugh_i_this_girl_seemed_special_but_now_i_dont/,"I don't know where we stand. I have been friends (not very close) with this girl since high school. Starting in the summer we began to flirt a little. At first it was just flirting no real communication follow up. Right around the end of summer we began to text a little more. Many of the conversations were started by her which was nice for a change.
Unfortunately as she was moving back to school in Ohio was moving to Florida for an internship. To my surprise we continued talking even after I moved to Florida in September. In fact we began talking almost every day. Mostly text messages, but there were a hand full of 3-4 hour phone conversations. The conversations were pretty light in nature but the more we talked the more we had in common and the more I enjoyed talking to her.

Eventually it came up that I should come visit.. at this point i was a little hesitant to shell out the cash for a flight without knowing where we stood, so I double checked the dates with here and gave her an easy out if she didn't actually want me to visit. She almost insisted I come visit. So I did.
I visited 2 weeks ago. This is where things got interesting. When I arrived it was a little awkward because I was unsure what we were (friends or dating). We went out for a nice dinner the night that I arrived, everything was going well a lot of eye contact during the conversation, smiling over all a good dinner.

Then when we went back to her apartment to get ready for bed, she went to the bathroom to change out of her clothes (I thought this was a little odd) but whatever. We laid in the same bed and watched a movie. I tried to move closer and snuggle but didn't get much effort on her part. I did the thing where I ran my finger up and down her arm and she just put her hand on my shoulder... bad news I know. So at that point i just called it a night and sort of went to bed next to her. The thing that was odd was that in the morning after i went to shower i noticed her shorts on the ground (from her shower) and she had a red lace thong on the whole night.. in my mind no girl would ever choose to wear that to bed unless she was expecting me to take it off. (maybe just wishfull thinking)

Next day we go for a tailgate and are drinking. We made out a little in the hallway but we were both drunk. Day was full of fun. Night time rolls around and it is very much the same treatment. I tried moving in but Didnt really get much in return. so I backed off again. We did spoon for a couple of hours in the night but when I rolled over because i was hot, she had no reaction.

The next morning it was time to leave. She dropped me off at the airport shuttle and we hugged goodbye (I am mad I didnt try to go in for a kiss to make her think). Anyways she texts me the whole time I am traveling home, and everything seems to be back where we left it. So I decided to send her flowers to make my intentions more clear, and to see how she would respond. The response I got was a text message ""OMG THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!!"" ""YOU ARE SOO SWEET!!"" Texting remained about the same.. but then slowly began to taper off. She was slower to respond in the following days and now she has not responded to our last two conversations (short conversations, 4 messages each: back and forth).

I really want to know where we stand, and why she is distancing herself. I know long distance relationships are tough but what would cause such a sudden change. I would like to know if I should call her and ask what is wrong/what changed.. Or if I should just abandon ship and give her radio silence. I am just afraid if I give her silence she will just move on and forget about me, which is why I would like to confront the issue and see if anything can be done.. Advice?"
1pxb5s,2,2013-11-04,[20/m] I want to know how to find out where my relationship stands.,I_Am_Keith_Stone,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pxb5s/20m_i_want_to_know_how_to_find_out_where_my/,"I don't know where we stand. I have been friends (not very close) with this girl since high school. Starting in the summer we began to flirt a little. At first it was just flirting no real communication follow up. Right around the end of summer we began to text a little more. Many of the conversations were started by her which was nice for a change. 

Unfortunately as she was moving back to school in Ohio was moving to Florida for an internship. To my surprise we continued talking even after I moved to Florida in September. In fact we began talking almost every day. Mostly text messages, but there were a hand full of 3-4 hour phone conversations. The conversations were pretty light in nature but the more we talked the more we had in common and the more I enjoyed talking to her.

Eventually it came up that I should come visit.. at this point i was a little hesitant to shell out the cash for a flight without knowing where we stood, so I double checked the dates with here and gave her an easy out if she didn't actually want me to visit. She almost insisted I come visit. So I did.

I visited 2 weeks ago. This is where things got interesting. When I arrived it was a little awkward because I was unsure what we were (friends or dating). We went out for a nice dinner the night that I arrived, everything was going well a lot of eye contact during the conversation, smiling over all a good dinner. 

Then when we went back to her apartment to get ready for bed, she went to the bathroom to change out of her clothes (I thought this was a little odd) but whatever. We laid in the same bed and watched a movie. I tried to move closer and snuggle but didn't get much effort on her part. I did the thing where I ran my finger up and down her arm and she just put her hand on my shoulder... bad news I know. So at that point i just called it a night and sort of went to bed next to her. The thing that was odd was that in the morning after i went to shower i noticed her shorts on the ground (from her shower) and she had a red lace thong on the whole night.. in my mind no girl would ever choose to wear that to bed unless she was expecting me to take it off. (maybe just wishfull thinking)

Next day we go for a tailgate and are drinking. We made out a little in the hallway but we were both drunk. Day was full of fun. Night time rolls around and it is very much the same treatment. I tried moving in but Didnt really get much in return. so I backed off again. We did spoon for a couple of hours in the night but when I rolled over because i was hot, she had no reaction. 

The next morning it was time to leave. She dropped me off at the airport shuttle and we hugged goodbye (I am mad I didnt try to go in for a kiss to make her think).

1pxa5o,6,2013-11-04,Getting an internship in Audio Post-Poduction,Polystyring,AudioPost,https://www.reddit.com/r/AudioPost/comments/1pxa5o/getting_an_internship_in_audio_postpoduction/,"So the short version of this story is that I graduated from a great audio production school in NYC about 8 years ago, and though I have been using and growing that education on my own pretty diligently during this time, I don't have any real work experience to speak of. 

After some consideration I have decided that my current field of work is slowly eroding my soul and I want to continue the path I started when I enrolled in audio school. I have contacted my school and they are helping to set me up with an internship at an audio post studio, but so far I haven't had any responses.

I think my resume needs some work (they have an untweaked copy I had been using to apply for jobs in my current field).

Does anyone have any tips on resume writing for post audio, for someone with no real experience to speak of? I have mentioned the DAWs, plugins and hardware I have experience with. But I also don't want my resume to become just a list.

I do have some songs that I recorded with a friend. The music isn't the greatest ever head, but they are well-recorded, mixed and even ""mastered"". I would like to mention those, but is that a good idea? The songs haven't been released in any way. 

I also read a lot. Would it be weird to mention books on the subject that I have read? I want my resume to give the impression that I'm deeply interested in the audio field (which I am), because without any real experience or a portfolio that's all I really have going for me. I do have good non-audio work experience and some fantastic non-audio references.

Also I was thinking about adding an objective statement on my resume. I know they are mostly frowned upon, but I feel like I need some explanation as to why I'm pursuing an internship nearly a decade after completing my education. I am guessing most interns are fresh out of school and I feel like my resume probably sticks out in a bad (or at least confusing) way. I don't know what kind of cover letter my school is adding to my resume but I guess it's probably a stock letter they use with all their students. Would an objective statement be helpful here?

Is there anything else I can do to help get an internship at an audio post studio? While it's nice to have someone else sending out my resume for once, I am feeling a bit restless just waiting for calls to come in.

Thanks for any help you can give! "
1px7uh,0,2013-11-04,We've been together for 5.5 years and me (f/25) and my boyfriend (m/27) have never gone on vacation. I get jealous of other couples who do.,flyingpinkmonkeys,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1px7uh/weve_been_together_for_55_years_and_me_f25_and_my/,"I know I sound like a really terrible person, but I get incredibly jealous of couples who post vacation pictures on facebook.  Why?  Because my boyfriend and I have never been on one.

It's not like we're hoarding money away for a big purchase like a house, but life always appears to get in the way of us going somewhere.  We met in university and I took paid internships while he never did.  Then after university, I had a really hard time finding a job and didn't have a job for almost two years.  I took a lot of part time work to help with expenses while I lived with him.  Now that I have a job, my boyfriend just quit his.  If you look at the whole picture, there has been very little overlap time where the two of us were making money.

It really sucks because I get insanely jealous of other couples who post their pictures.  I've tried by going on vacation on my own, but it wasn't as satisfying.  I still have fun, but it's not the same feeling as having someone special with you (I was often with my family).

We've tried to plan vacations like Cuba and in the back of my mind I started the thinking process of, 'Why bother plan this?  Some obstacle is going to come up and we'll have to cancel anyway.'  and I don't bother going through with it.  I feel a lot of resentment even when the topic of vacations pop up that it's difficult for me to even want to plan.

TLDR; My boyfriend and I have been together for 5.5 years and we have not been able to afford to go on vacation together because we've never had an overlapping period where the two of us made money.  I get really jealous of other couples and it really hurts.

*And oops it should be my boyfriend and I.  Sorry for hurting your eyes! :)*"

(m24)(f19)

**TL;DR. GF of 2 years slept with some faggot after a night out clubbing, which was a 'drunken mistake' that will never ever happen again she says. I put everything on the line, possibly moving to London for a work visa, quit my job in December, then this all happened and feeling confused and worthless. She's been blowing up my phone, facebook, calling my real number, my skype number, apologizing, regretting, but i'm just holding my ground for now, but texting a bit here and there. Super confused and lost.**

When we started talking we just hit it off and haven't stopped talking since, we quickly fell for each other and things have been getting deeper since. She seemed like the most caring and sweetest girl. Her mother left her when she was a child when she had an affair with her dads best friend, whom are now married. When she hit a down fall in her early teen years, her step mom told me she was very 'vulnerably easy' and subconsciously filled that gap of emotional distraught and abandonment caused by her mom, even though they had some sort of relationship on the weekends growing up.

I've always been.. 'restricting' as she puts it. More so on one thing in partciular I don't really want in someone I want to marry, but I can't help that this is the girl I fell so hard for. She's really into drinking/clubbing, one thing I do not put up with, one thing I think is very wrong when in a relationship, one thing that is a deal breaker for me when I find out the female is into that. However, during the first half year of our relationship I put up with it, I just couldn't walk away that easily, and I never could handle it correctly, I'd always rage and the nights wouldn't ever end good. However, she kept going out. I understand that it takes trust to let people do that, and even though I can trust and all that, it's just not something I agree on. It got so bad that I left her for over a month last year. We worked it out and got back together.

We met a couple times since then for long periods and have strengthened our relationship. Fast forward to last month, I had just got back from visiting her. I put everything on the line, I'm ready to make this girl my fiance in the next coming year. I got an internship at one of my dream jobs in January. I've put in my final date at my job in December, I was going to take a month off work and be with her while she's at her Uni. Then start back to work in one of the worlds best restaurants for a couple months, see her on the day offs, come on and go from there. I've been saving hard and living extremely frugal to make my dreams/goals happen and she's been fully supportive.

However, since I got back it seems as if we've been arguing more, like we have gotten more serious and the distance has been harder to deal with. Did I mention that since this January she hadn't gone out once when we got back together? Until the day I came home from seeing her last month, it was her first day of Uni, and within the first week she was going out and getting way drunk again. Cancelling our skype dates last minute, taking a 45 minutes or over an hour to reply when it used to take seconds. I had just come home on this high of blithe and then the next day it's like night and day. I was getting hardly any communication, no attention, and it was the first time I ever felt that and I felt like I was bitchy a bout it. I addressed it, we talked a bout it, I hated she was going out, after a few weeks it finally hit home and she stopped and the communication got better.

Then little bickers started happening more. Come last monday, we had a skype date planned, and she decided to go out to this concert when she said she wasn't going to go out and drink at these kind of things anymore. She sneakily said it wasn't going to be at this one club, but it was, well it was attached to the same building. And some of the nights out before she drank behind my back. When she goes out, I get no communication, no check in text or call, maybe one or two if im lucky, but it's ignoring everything I've texted to say 'o lpve youui' .. how ugly and off putting. I've explained that if I'm going to try to be comfortable with it, I need communication. .. Back to monday, I got ignored all day/evening when she said she wouldn't be long and would be back early. around 330 AM her time I get a text saying she got home, phone died and she fell asleep, texting wasn't gibberish it was clean, but I just had this weird feeling. We ended up breaking up tuesday night over me being so mad a bout it because something was just fucking fishy. She said it was because she can't go be her self going out and blah blah.

Of course I go into get this girl back mode, I plead, I beg, I try to communicate, I try to ask for a chance to prove myself to be able to be more comfortable, I had flowers sent to her thursday morning in which started her to be more open with me and wanting to give it a chance. Then she admitted she kissed a guy, which then I had to get out of her that she ended up sleeping with him. I guess towards the end of the night two guys came up to her and her friend and danced with them, they were all gunna take a cab back home, but then a friend drove them to the guys place. Her friend hooked up with a guy, and then she was alone left with a few guys and was talking to one, who started kissing her then he took her to the room and they had sex. She said she was still pretty drunk when they left and drank more when they got to his place and also smoked weed (which I know didnt contribute, because I've been smoking weed for about 10 years almost every day). How credible is that? When she even had the nerve to text me at some point before she got to his house and the texting wasn't all fucked up.

The moments after she told me are a blur. I felt like my heart wasn't exactly done, when usually I would've got the hell out in a heart beat. I remember that for two days I kind of wanted her back now and then until it really sank in, but she was being defensive and said we are too fucked to make this work, how can we get out of it, I was paranoid before how will i be now. Even thought she didn't want me going out because she was afraid I'd be the one to meet someone, or meet someone at all my new jobs, and then fuck them, look who's talking now.

So I finally said alright, if you don't see this working and aren't in this and don't want to see how it'll go with us in December, don't contact me again. So I 'checked out' and took space away from her. For the first time in two years I hadn't talked to her in a full day, then it became 2 and a half.

During those 2.5 days she completely flipped. Instead of playing with me saying she was in this, and 30 minutes later saying no. The first night she knew I wasn't messing around this time when I said goodbye, she started giving in a little more. Her apologies went further than just ""im sorry"".

The tables turned, it was no longer me fighting for her, she was chasing for me. She was saying how she fucked up, how shes so pathetic and shouldve listened, how I'm always right in the end even when she disagrees and it annoys her how I'm hardly ever wrong. How she wont put herself in situations like that again, she'll do whatever it takes, she wont go out anymore she will firmly tell her friends no, she cant lose me, she was drunk and wasnt thinking.

In those two days she was speaking to her step mom who I'm close with, and also my mom who isn't judgmental at all and helped both of us. It was the first time she had spoken to my mom. Both my mom and her step mom were telling me how horrible she feels, how it's killing her I'm not talking to her, that she fucked up everything and our future for a childish mistake.

I'm having a hard time trying to come up with anything to say to her now. I'm past yelling because that's not going to change anything, I'm just speechless. I can't tell her I love her or I miss her, when I do terribly. I don't want to hear her voice, but when she sent me a voice clip she sounded sorry, she was crying hard and having trouble breathing, well she was breathing fine but you know that noise.

I applied for the restaurant for a work visa which I may get for two years.. but now this shit happened. I'm still chasing my dreams.. but I put everything on the line for this girl. I am now feeling confused. Am i not enough that I couldn't fill that emotional damage, I was there for her all the time. Is she lacking something in this besides the physical touch whenever she wants? I am questioning everything. I am so confused, one minute I'm saying fuck any cunt who does that to me, on the other hand how can I just give up something I've invested so much into. When I still see a future and also think we can work this out (challenges really turn me on and I always tackle them if I know I'll have a very good success rate) ... but I just don't know how good the chances are because WHAT IF she fucking does it again?

I got her passwords, I told her if I'm going to be able to trust her to go out again, that at this moment I don't want her going out to drink or to a club or it's an automatic deal breaker for good this time. Going out to eat and that stuff is fine, but drinking and coming home at 4 am? NOPE. She has to prove herself if I'm willing to do this again, and so far she said she's so desperate she will and she'll do anything. And when and if that does happen, her going out, I want texts and maybe a call or two while she's there, and when she gets home, and that she's getting home at a reasonable time. Am I fucked for requesting that when I'm ready? I think I'll be able to forgive eventually.. but forget? I just know that I can't bring it up when we argue.. but am I ready to jump back into this? I need some more time to think, I can't let myself foolishly jump in. She needs to sweat a little, i need some more space, and I feel like I need to see more from her before I make up my mind to see if she really appreciates me and what I have to give her.

I just don't know what to do.

I know the decision is ultimately up to me now.. but.. fuck.. you know?

Stay in for the read, I'd really appreciate it.

So, a few weeks ago I was hired as an intern at Course Hero. If you aren't familiar with Course Hero just google it, it is an online database of documents for high schools and colleges across the country. Course Hero hires interns like myself at different college campuses across the country. Our job is to get our friends to upload documents to the site. For every ten documents uploaded one book is donated through Course Hero's partnership through Books for Africa (google them too if you want). That is supposed to be the selling point for us interns, the philanthropic aspect of uploading documents should be enough to sell kids on uploading old high school notes and such. Unfortunately that proved not that effective and I decided that I would sacrifice some of my commission based pay ($10 per 10 accepted documents) towards getting people to upload documents. Two weeks after I started paying people $.50 for every accepted document they uploaded I had nearly 1000 documents approved, and almost 100 books donated. Good work, and $500 in my pocket. 

I go to the University of Pittsburgh, with an undergraduate class of 18,000 students. If each student uploaded 10 documents that would equal $90,000 in cash for me, $90,000 in cash for students, and 18,000 books donated through Books for Africa. 90,000 is nearly enough to pay off my college education, of around $30,000 a year. In my attempt to get every University of Pittsburgh student to upload documents I have walked campus passing out flyers and solicited my friend to help me. None the less only 38 students have joined my group. 

That is why I am here reddit, to ask for your help. If you are in college or high school and you have ten pages of notes from any class and the time to upload them to the web you could pay for my college education and donate a book, and make $5. The link to upload documents is right here: www.coursehero.com/knowledgedrive/pittsburgh-zachary-shefska/

Also, here is some proof of me walking around campus, handing out flyers: http://i.imgur.com/FcR3I7I.jpg

I'm not going to get into the payout process here because I really do not want to break reddit rules or etiquette, but know that if you sign up I will get into contact with you (interns have access to the email addresses of the members who sign up to their group).

Thanks guys, I really appreciate it. "

When I still see a future and also think we can work this out (challenges really turn me on and I always tackle them if I know I'll have a very good success rate) ... but I just don't know how good the chances are because WHAT IF she fucking does it again?

I got her passwords, I told her if I'm going to be able to trust her to go out again, that at this moment I don't want her going out to drink or to a club or it's an automatic deal breaker for good this time.  Going out to eat and that stuff is fine, but drinking and coming home at 4 am? NOPE.  She has to prove herself if I'm willing to do this again, and so far she said she's so desperate she will and she'll do anything.  And when and if that does happen, her going out, I want texts and maybe a call or two while she's there, and when she gets home, and that she's getting home at a reasonable time.  Am I fucked for requesting that when I'm ready? I think I'll be able to forgive eventually.. but forget?  I just know that I can't bring it up when we argue.. but am I ready to jump back into this? I need some more time to think, I can't let myself foolishly jump in.  She needs to sweat a little, i need some more space, and I feel like I need to see more from her before I make up my mind to see if she really appreciates me and what I have to give her.

I just don't know what to do.  

I know the decision is ultimately up to me now.. but.. fuck.. you know?

1q1bjs,9,2013-11-06,Just looking for an ear.,justgottavent,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q1bjs/just_looking_for_an_ear/,"I don't know if I'm struggling with depression, or what. It feels like shit has been hitting the fan as of late, and I can't tell if it's just me taking things personally, being moody, whatever. This might be a long post.


Several people in my life, with whom I'd become very close, shut me out without real warning. Misunderstandings would pass between us, but rather than talking about it, they told me that I wasn't worth it, that I was a horrible person, etc. Now, these people also struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts and have been known to meltdown before (I wasn't the first person they shut out of their lives). However, getting told those hurtful things, repeatedly... one wonders if they aren't true. One case involved a former roommate who thought I wasn't hanging out with her enough, or making enough effort to see her. Another incident involved a girl who expected me to act like her nanny and when I got mad after an accident in which she was involved sent me to the emergency room (and she didn't offer to help me with any of the bills and didn't act like it was a problem at all), quit talking to me. And another friend, who I liked for many years and who supposedly liked me but could never get his shit together and when things finally started to go somewhere, he cut me off and then got mad and told me I was terrible when I moved on and started dating someone else, well... it's all just a little much. These have been incidents over several years, though. Except the last one... that was a few weeks ago. 


Before, I had a long-term boyfriend... I thought he was my soul mate, I thought we were going to get married and live happily ever after. Then, I realized I wasn't very happy in the relationship. But instead of working it out, my young-twenty-something mind said ""no, better just to cut losses. get out!"" it had been 3 years that we were together and I thought that the potential for change was minimal. Plus, shouldn't I be exploring my options at this young age? Now, a year and a half later, I'm wondering if I've made a huge mistake. He was a very kind, generous, and stable guy. I wasn't happy because we weren't running around going out at night, traveling, etc. He was happy to sit at home with a video game or a movie. I wanted to go dancing, go see the world. He did those things with me, but a bit begrudgingly... he never seemed happy. But now I think I might've been too quick to just break up. Maybe I should've worked harder on fixing things. But it's too late now, and it's been months since we've spoken. 


At the moment, I'm dating someone, but the thoughts above (about my ex) make me doubt my happiness in this relationship. The guy seems more in love with his dog than with me (and during a fight has said ""why can't you be more like my dog?!"" ... ). Of course, we all say stupid things that we regret during fights... but I don't know. I think he's just emotionally immature. I don't know if I can or should want to handle that. 


And my family. Last of all but maybe most important of all. My parents are divorced and my sister is struggling with a chronic illness. This illness has forced her to go live with my father, since my sister needs constant care and my father's wife is a stay at home mom. My parents have been divorced nearly my whole life, but lately, it's been awful. My father refuses as much as he can to speak to my mother. They both go through me as an intermediary to communicate. My father won't allow my mother into his house to check on my sister, and my mother has been the person all along who has been there for my sister. She has taken her to all her doctor's appointments and made sure that she's feeling all right, has food, etc. But my mother works full-time and can't be at home to take care of my sister. And my father is being selfish and only considering himself, not my sister, not my mother, in not allowing my mother into his house ~ not to stay, not to sleep, but simply to spend a few hours with her when NO ONE IS HOME. My father's family is going on vacation to Europe for a week, and my mother wanted to come visit my sister at that time to make sure she's ok. She is going to stay in a hotel near my father's house, not wanting to sleep there, but thought it'd be acceptable to come in during the day when no one else is home. My father does not even accept that. And I'm stuck feeling so angry towards him for only thinking of himself and not thinking of my sister or my mom or the whole situation. I should add that my mother was ""innocent"" in the divorce ~ she didn't want it (and had done nothing like cheating or anything that could warrant such a reaction from my father). 


Then, the pharmacy screwed up my birth control prescription the other week and the new pill I started taking really messed me up. I got it changed back to the right one, but I can't help but wonder if some of this frustration, sadness, whatever, is due to that? 


I'm not really sleeping well. I wake up in the middle of the night, I wake up early in the morning. I feel ill at ease, completely upset. Like I might start screaming or crying at any minute. But I know I can't because I have school, I have to find internships, I have to keep on keepin' on. 

But it's hard and I don't know what to do. Thanks for listening, reddit ~"

1q19d6,5,2013-11-06,Guy Advice,coolbro88,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1q19d6/guy_advice/,"Hey! I just wanted to get you guys' thoughts about a situation that has really left me confused for the past 1-2 months. I've never been in a relationship and had very little dating experience. I had just started a new job in a new city, and to be honest,I was lonely. Either I'm not that appealing to a lot of guys or they're intimidated by me, but I've never been one to attract attention from a lot of guys.  I got a match.com account, an OKC account, but really wasn't having much luck. I noticed a guy had visited my profile that seemed attractive and I decided to send him a message, thinking that it would be another one of many non-responses. In reality friends or a relationship is ideal for me. But...he actually responds! So I began chatting with this guy in late April that was in grad school far away (Cali-1900 miles). Turns out we both knew somebody that I grew up and went to school with. We immediately connect and in 3 weeks are practically texting/Skyping all the time. I suggests coming to visit for Memorial Day and end up doing so. I was so nervous because this was the first time (and probably only) time I'll ever do something like that again. It turns out to be an amazing trip; everything was absolutely perfect. No sex or anything, just a genuine connection and I wanted to feel out the entire situation. 

So we continue to talk and become closer. It's getting towards the beginning of summer and he going across the country (NYC) for an internship. On his way across he decides to stop by my city for the weekend. Once again, it was a great time. We seemed to enjoy each other's company. We get more intimate, but there is no sex.

Afterwards, we decide to talk, but go out on dates with other guys, which I am totally fine with. I end up visiting him twice in NYC during the summer. Once again. Everything for the most part is great. I realize at this time that what we are isn't really sustainable because A) I'm moving to another city (new position) B) he starts school in Sept. I start to notice things like he gets upset when I respond to a text from my sister that asks who I'm with and I reply"" a friend"" instead of my bf even though we never agreed to being in a relationship. This may seem very shallow, but during my visits, we took showers, etc. and was turned off by his body and physical shape. He wears it well, but I'd prefer somebody in better shape. We end up traveling so more and for the most part, everything is great. I really enjoy his company and just having somebody to talk with. No sex; a little cuddling and kissing, but that's it. I'm moving soon, so I suggest after Sept., we take time off from seeing each other so I can go on dates in my new city. We agreed and I had no problems maintaining communication with him. He didn't think that it was  appropriate. We compromise on sending each other letters (no Skype, phone, Internet, etc); I reluctantly agree. 

So the break starts and he and another friend told me about A4A in previous conversations, so I make an account. It's kinda raunchy, but whatever, I should be able to enjoy myself. Plus, I rarely hookup and just use it to see who's around and if they're attractive, maybe meetup. So I start talking with a guy on A4A and he's wanting to hookup, but he's asking a lot of probing questions about my sexual history...like ""how many sex partners I've had, when's the last time I had oral sex, what's the biggest you've taken, how many times have u had sex, etc."" so I'm in bed getting ready to go to sleep and at this point just chatting and messing with the guy telling him to come over (even though I wasn't up for meeting). As soon as I put my computer down and get a text from my friend saying we need to talk. Turns out he created a fake profile, looked me up, and tried to not only bait me, but get information about my sexual history. It totally damaged my trust in him.

We had some discussion on sexual history prior to this situation. I told him how many sexual partners I've had and approximate dates. He used the info I told him in the fake A4A profile to say I wasn't honest with him, even though I was actually making stuff up and exaggerating claim when chatting with him.

 What should I do? What should I make out of the situation? At this point there is definitely zero probability of getting into a relationship with him. Friends most likely. On the other hand, this is the first guy that has genuinely liked me."

This is my first time in this subreddit, but I wasn't sure what to do. So let me share with you a story.

I'm 23 years old, I still live with my mom because her and I have been struggling to make ends meet since I was 6 years old and they had a hiring freeze at the company she worked at. It was an electric company that was mostly government owned. When I was young, my mom ended up having to step down from her position and take a smaller one due to downsizing.

From then on, we really had to do a lot of things that restricted our lifestyle. We had to watch what we ate, Mom worked ridiculous hours, and I continued to go to school. When I was 16, I got my first part time job at McDonalds to help me and my mom out while in school. I worked there for 3 years before getting a different job at a meat shipping warehouse.

After a few months there, I ended up getting let go because of costs. Mind you, these places weren't very nice to me. But not once did I let them or the customers I served down. Right after that, I finally got accepted to go to college to be a Network Administrator. And I'm in the second year of my program now.

In the meantime I've been working at Walmart to help me and my mom out, and just now I finally got a position at the local University to be their intern for a System Admin! They want to keep me!"

1q0e28,1,2013-11-06,How can I [22/m] save a college romance that is now a LDR,lostlongdistance,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q0e28/how_can_i_22m_save_a_college_romance_that_is_now/,"My girlfriend and I were together for nearly 5 months in college. We both graduated in June. She took a job in New York City and I have been unemployed and living at home in Maine. We have been able to visit each other once every few weeks. When we graduated we were both (especially her) adamant about staying together. At first things were good, we were happy with each other and our relationship continued to grow. We called and skyped each other often. Then things slowly became harder for her and now she has told me that she might not be able to continue.

Despite how short our relationship has been I am deeply in love with her. The time I spent with her at school was the happiest time in my life. Our relationship at that time was healthy and balanced. I can't imagine a more perfect partner. For the majority of our relationship I believe that she felt the same way. Now she seems to have mixed feelings about me. She is more reserved and cautious with her feelings and she struggles to accept how strongly I tell her my feelings are for her. When I'm with her she is usually very kind and caring but lately she has a tendency to become extremely aggravated with me very easily often without a rational reason. We have talked about this and we both see it was a bad sign. She is fairly unhappy with her job and her living arrangements and is often extremely stressed. We are both under the impression that this stress might be effecting our relationship.

The last time I spoke to her she said that she was very unhappy and she needed her life to change. She said that our relationship was the one thing that she has control over. She wants to avoid communication with me for a short period so she can think about things. After which it is highly likely that our relationship will end. I know that a large part of her still loves me and I think that there is some hope to salvage something.

I have applied and interviewed for many positions in NY but have not had any luck yet. However, I do not have a strong desire to live in NY other than her. I'm afraid the only way to make this work is for me to move to NY in the somewhat immediate future. I have no money and would need a job for that to be possible. Her apartment is extremely small and living with her is not an option.

I have just recently been offered an decent internship in Maine that I would be fairly happy with. 

I am mad about this girl but I also need to think about starting my career in the right way. I don't know what to do. What can we do with no real idea for an end game on when we can be together? What can I say to her or suggest we do to find a solution for now and the future? Has anyone been in a similar relationship that ended and been able to relocate and pick it back up after months or years apart? Please any words of advice would appreciated.

TL;DR: I'm about to lose the girl of my dreams.

1q02s7,94,2013-11-05,Ryan Duffy gets off easy in r/iAmA,jamie_byron_dean,circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1q02s7/ryan_duffy_gets_off_easy_in_riama/,"At the risk of making this a ""stop liking what I don't like,"" I will say that I *do* think VICE is an entertaining media outlet, but do *not* consider it good journalism. But don't take my opinion too seriously. Or any of this.

In today's [IAMA with Ryan Duffy](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/), reddit more or less sucks Ryan Duffy's ego for thousands and thousands of upvotes. A slew of other minor circlejerks arise, only tangentially related to the topic. 

The criticism for him and his organization is very muted, unlike when other sensationalist media figures come around - (not talking about Ann Coulter, definitely *not* talking about Ann Coulter) - although there are some ""pointed"" questions bringing up why one might reasonably *not* like VICE. 

At the highest level of comments, the AMA consists of a basic, good-natured love affair with Ryan Duffy.

&gt;What did Kim Jong-un's hands feel like? Rough? Soft? The world needs to know.

Top comment, top lel, etc.

&gt;I'm interested to hear a bit about your path to this job? How did you get into VICE or did VICE find you? did you always want to be some sort of reporter or was it more like 'I want to experience some crazy shit and need to find a way to afford it""?
thanks!

This is a real question, which is cool, and Duffy gives a pretty real answer, which is cool. But there's a touch of this ""wow ur so cool so crazy"" adoration that runs through a lot of this thread. People swapping buddy jokes (aka dick, pedophile, and bestiality jokes) with him, or telling him how awesome he is. 

I mean, he *does* have a pretty interesting job. But...

----------

**Side jerk: internships** when it comes up that VICE has unpaid interns, suddenly reddit thinks unpaid internships are great - ""It's perfectly legal as long as the interns receive college credit."" Not that I agree or disagree, but 9/10 comments on reddit about unpaid internships condemn them and the businesses that have them. 

------------

&gt;Hi Ryan, huge fan of the show. I'm a reporter as well (in a much more boring capacity, unfortunately) and I'm quite jealous of what you guys get to do.
Is there anything too extreme in terms of coverage? In your editorial meetings, have you had to turn down something that's too intense? Cheers.

This may be the cynical ex-journalism student in me, but I feel like this is kind of a sad sentiment. If they're a real reporter in any capacity, they're at least doing real reporting. Serving a ""boring"" community in a real way is 100x more important than serving the internet ""extreme"" coverage about donkey shows. But now a generation of hundreds of redditors are going to walk away from this thinking VICE is the dream journalism, not that old-fashioned Walter Cronkite nonsense.

But what's *really* funny about this is Duffy's response:

&gt;We don't pass on stories because they're too intense; but we do if that's the only reason to go. Shock value is fleeting; real stories that are underreported are what get us excited.

""Shock value is fleeting; real stories that are underreported are what get us excited."" 

Geez. Coming from VICE? The next commenter calls Duffy out on this bit:

&gt;… So that's why you did a story on donkey fucking. It was a real, substantive story about a highly important yet unreported issue. Thanks, VICE!

which immediately derails into some bestiality/DAT USERNAME bullshit I don't care about.

-------------

**Side jerk: AmeriKKKa** 

&gt;Hey Ryan, Love Vice. What was the worst place you have been to? Do you also have to get different shot/vaccines before going to these countries

&gt;&gt;North Korea, hands down. There are places I've been with more clear &amp; present danger, but I'll take a gang of dudes with guns over the feeling I'm being watched 24 hours a day.

Which leads to such enlightened comments as: ""Wow, I wish the democrats thought like this,"" ""So its like America, thanks Obama,"" ""you are aware you live in the US right...?"" ""And how is that different from living in America?"" and ""So you stay away from North America as well then?""

---------------

A bit about how VICE &gt; TV sprouts up in the following exchange:

&gt;i really enjoyed the japan sex story, was there any other places that you went to that didn't make the cut? one more question, where does vice go from here? can we expect more long form documentaries over time? i hope you all keep up the good work.

Duffy answers,

&gt;&gt;We went to a slew of the host/hostess bars, but only showed a few. You can also buy a date by the hour, which I did with a girl dressed up in an anime costume for a stroll around the mall.
Expect a TON more long form documentaries on VICE.com as well as our YouTube channel, the launch of our brand new News channel, and S2 of the HBO show...to start.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Fuck yeah!!! Vice news channel!? I might start watching TV again.

This sport can't contain their excitement to watch REAL TV again, not that sensational tabloid old-world garbage about ""domestic politics"" and ""the weather,"" but REAL news, about donkey shows, abused drugs, and Balkan slums!

Whether you like VICE or not, you have to admit, this is pretty stupid. To contrast traditional TV sensationalism against VICE-brand sensationalism, and think VICE comes out on top?

&gt;&gt;Can this please be online, I've cut the cord

No, wait, turn your turned-into-TV content back onto the internet for me, I've **CuT tHe CoRd!""

-------------

**Side jerk: Mack[le]more**

&gt;You have a great haircut. What do you use to describe it when you go to get it cut?

Literally just throwing compliments to the guy about how handsome he is now.

&gt;&gt;Give me the Macklemore, but less weird. 

------------------

And now, the true beacon of reddit's slanted view of modern journalism, the comment which roused me from my weary slumber to report on the days' circlejerks:

&gt;This is a broad question:
To me, VICE feels like one of the last bastions of real investigative journalism. When I watch the videos or read the articles, they are presented in a way a young person may actually perceive and experience the topic at hand.
Ryan, how do you feel about the current state of journalism? What can/should other organizations do? Are you optimistic?

This is a **jerk** of a comment. VICE is the ""last bastion"" of *real* investigative journalism. Someone actually said that. Someone was thinking that, and they said it, and people upvoted it. This is like the maximum implication of the sentiment expressed earlier - comparing VICE to ""boring capacity"" reporting.

I mean what experience of ""real investigative journalism"" does this user have to turn to *Ryan* (Just ""Ryan,"" btw, first name basis of course, this is reddit after all) as an authority?

This comment is followed by a (once gilded!) comment about how shitty VICE is. [Link.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pys9t/i_am_vices_ryan_duffy_ive_been_shot_on_purpose/cd7j50n)

And here's Duffy's response: 

&gt;There are a lot of reasons to get negative - turn on your TV this evening and take your pick - but yes, I'm wildly optimistic. There's a misperceptions that young people don't ""care"" about the news; that's wrong. There's just no one delivering it to them in a voice they can relate to.
I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by people at VICE who understand this, and are working to change it every day.

""You're right, TV sucks, but we *rock.*"" It's fair for him to feel that way, but it's still a stupid series of comments. ""There's no one delivering it to them in a voice they can relate to."" You mean fucking youtube videos about obscure drugs and animal sex? 

---------------

**Side jerk: Beastiality**

&gt;Did you pop a boner while watching the Colombian guy fucking the donkey? I know I did

----------------

Anyway, I don't mean no disrespect to Duffy or VICE. They do a lot more than I ever do, and I wouldn't mind having some of those experiences. But Jesus Marie, they aren't ""real investigative journalists.""

And no matter how you feel about any given facet, there sure are a ton of circlejerks flying around in that thread.

1pzrlz,3,2013-11-05,Girlfriend (24/f) of 4 years just told me (28/m) she cheated... within the past week,Ughhman,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pzrlz/girlfriend_24f_of_4_years_just_told_me_28m_she/,"Okay, so I never thought I'd have to make a throwaway account for this, but... yeah.

She moved to a different city about 5 months ago for a job that was much more fulfilling than the one she had where I live. At that time she mentioned maybe going on a break, which I didn't understand and said was not necessary. She's had a few issues with our age difference and wanted the change to be independent and prove things to herself before she had to 'rely' the rest of her life (me). I was sure she could do this by just moving, and didn't need a break. I would support her in any way that I could and give her some space, and I did.

So again, we've been in a long distance relationship now for 5 month, and she is doing really well at her new job, feeling good about what she's involved in and making a lot of new friends. But I noticed that she had started to hang out with one guy in particular much more than anyone else and this made me slightly uneasy. I'm not really a jealous guy and don't like to make something dramatic out of nothing, and she insisted that going to movies and having dinner was no big deal, she's just making friends. 

Very recently, this idea of a break came back up, I was totally floored. She insisted that work, on top of worry about money, on top of feeling relationship pressure from me was just getting to her and she was overloaded and thought that a break would help her get in the right place. I was so so so SO reluctant because I knew about this dude and was SO afraid that by letting us go on a break, I'd basically be driving her straight to him. But she insisted this guy was no more than a friends and that that had ZERO to do with it. 

Well, stupid me gave her my blessings and said, 'do what you need to do to and take your time, I'll be here and I support you'. That was on Monday. By Thursday, she had sex with this dude.

To make it worse, I visited her (2 days later) on Saturday (even though we were on a 'break', we had a wedding to go to, and I just wanted to see her) and we have sex twice over the weekend. I go home on monday and all is well. I even think that things might actually work out for the best. But today I called her and talked about how this 'break' still doesn't make sense to me and after wrangling her a bit, she admits to cheating. This is only after she lied multiple times about whats actually happened with this guy (she started by saying that he kissed her, and she let him and that was IT).

She says that this guy was not the reason she wanted a break and that her cheating was NOT premeditated, it just got out of hand. Of course this happened right after she told him that we were on a break... so...

I guess I have a few questions for anyone still reading. Does it not count if we were 'on a break'? Secondly, should it matter if we were on a break anyways? Do I give up?

I really dont know what to do. I love her and she seems destroyed by it. I found out about this, literally an hour ago, so I'm just typing like crazy and feel a bit numb now. The emotions are really crazy and weird. I don't know if its completely idiotic for me to even think of staying with her. I just dont know anything.

I want to add that before we were officially bf/gf, 4 years ago, I slept with my ex. It was horrible and I still feel bad about it. We may not have been official at the time, but I should have known, and did know that it would hurt her. It's hard for me to compare the two though, cause I had known her for maybe 4 months at the time and what she did was 3 weeks before our 4 year anniversary (I still can't believe it). Also, when she was on an internship 1.5 years ago, she had a bit of a flirty thing with a guy she met there. I found messages in her phone (I feel bad for looking, but I KNEW something was up) that indicated that if 'things were different', AKA if she wasn't with me, that she would maybe want to be with him.

FUCK. help?

TL;dr: GF of 4 years cheated on me 3 day's after we go on a 'break'. I don't have a fucking clue what to do now.

I had poor medical care at the time of my injury (they gave me an crutches and an inflatable brace….all the ligaments on the outer side of my ankle were snapped…I wish I had had the sense to get a second opinion), so now I experience pain (not just discomfort) when I try to run. I will limp for a week after each run, with that leg buckling at the ankle intermittently and without warning. I have switched to a treadmill and bought some vibram trainers that are supposed to teach you to run more on the front of your foot. It is so disheartening because mentally I want to push myself way further but then my ankle is collapsing and in so much pain, even though I am trying to push through the anguish. The joint is obviously unstable, but I have heard if I wrap it or use a brace, it will never get stronger and the wrap will become a crutch. I don't know if a doctor can help, because I don't actually know what's wrong, or if this is something I can remedy on my own by using targeted exercises. 

That is my biggest work-out challenge. I don't believe every work-out should leave me feeling horrible and almost in tears from pain and frustration. It makes me feel like a wimp. I know I am not, but my performance is giving me very negative feedback about myself and hurting my confidence to keep on keeping on. Working out in the past left me feeling great and powerful and proud, and now I just feel crappy. Can anyone prescribe a workout regime that focuses on but doesn't stress knee or ankle joints, so it can get strong and I can get back in the game? Also, I would like for it to build up in intensity/duration. 

My mid-long term goal is to get back to at least 6 mile runs/day in the next few months, and hopefully play soccer again eventually. I would also like to try out lifting, and give (real, instructed) yoga a go (right now I try to do it in my room watching youtube videos but I am pretty sure what I am doing would not be considered yoga :P ) 

My sister was a trainer in high school and she recommended dance classes to strengthen my ankle and increase flexibility. 

Aesthetically, I would like to (re)build mass in my legs and bottom, and flatten my lower abs. I used to have a bubble butt and thick legs and now I am just skinny-fat all over. 

Can anyone tell me where to start? I am open to any suggestions, as it really is a weight on my shoulders that this injury is still a wedge between me and running several years later. It doesn't affect me when walking or any other activity, other than running and soccer. 

I don't know if it matters, but I am 5'6"" 125# (+/-2). I try to eat primal but I cheat (a lot), as I am in college with an internship and sometimes you have to choose between Whataburger or skipping lunch. I graduate in December and will have a much better track record after there is some stability to my life in the 'real world'. 


Thanks you guys!!!!!! "
1q4dv0,0,2013-11-07,How should I 21/F handle my lover's 22/M peculiar ways so that my heart doesn't ache any longer?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q4dv0/how_should_i_21f_handle_my_lovers_22m_peculiar/,"So there is this guy that I met about 10 months ago. From the first instant there was a connection I've never had with anyone else. It felt so... natural, and intense. We stopped talking after that, until a few months later when we reconnected. The connection was still there, and I felt sure that we could be great together. Yet again, He left for California for four months and we lost contact. We made plans to visit each other, but they fell through once college started up again, considering while he was away for the summer I had moved two hours away to transfer schools.
He is out of state climbing every weekend and finishing up his last year of school. I am busy with school, work and an art internship. Anyways, he contacted me again recently, since our plans fell through a few months ago. He came down to visit me for the weekend and the whole time just kept saying the greatest things to me... it was so genuine, so sincere. When we kiss it feels like our mouths were made for each other. Other people have told me how he always brings me up just to say such nice things about me-like how we have such a good connection, that I am just so cool and all this other stuff.

He came down to visit me and right away started apologizing for falling off the face of the earth, saying how he thought about me a lot and putting his arm around me and just being really sincere. A few days ago he found out that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and that she needed surgery. He told me that i was the first person he thought of when he heard the news; that he only wanted to talk to me about it. That it made him realize just how much he missed me. I have so much passion for this guy, and I can see in his eyes and his behavior (when we are together) that he has an insane passion for me, as well. However, I know he got burned really badly in the past.. his girlfriend cheating and then getting raped and turning into a lesbian and all sorts of crazy stuff.

Why would a man who is seemingly soo into me when we are together go silent when we are apart?  Why do we just not talk for months, and then reconnect, only for the flame to be brighter than ever?

I feel like he is going to disappear again for months, spending his time climbing and living his life two hours away. I feel like he came here to tug on my heart strings, only to disappear until it is convenient for him again. I just can't believe that he is lying to me when he says things about our wonderful connection.

What do you think? What should I do with a man who treats my heart like gold when we are together, and then disappears for a few months and leaves me feeling like the whole thing was a dream? Should I just not let him back into my life the next time he tries to conveniently feel the loving for one weekend? 

I can't handle the aching that i feel after I see him, knowing that it will be so long until I see him again and that there is nothing I can do about it. what do i do?  Just block him from my life...? or accept what we have and be ok with it..? I just don't know.

1q3zee,2,2013-11-07,GF (28 - in therapy for depression) broke up over phone after 8 years (4 years LDR). Down from daily talking to no contact in one day. I (28) haven't heard anything from her in 2 month. I'm going crazy...,TalkToMePlzzz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q3zee/gf_28_in_therapy_for_depression_broke_up_over/,"Ok - so this is a long one and I never really thought I would post such personal information on reddit - but here we go (maybe writing down all that stuff will help me understand). Any talking will be great and I will answer every message as soon as I can

We were together for 8 years. We met after school and during my studies she became a nurse. We had a really great time and a lot in common. Sports, Movies, Friends, Cooking and I would say we were really happy. 5 years ago she decided that she wanted to study and we decided on a long distance relationship. It took 3 hours by car to reach her place for me and she does not have a car.

We were on holliday together and had a really messy fight where we both needed some cooling of. She hiked I went by bike into the mountains. Afterwards we talked and settled for not driving home and finishing our holliday together. We had some great remaining days - as far as I can tell. 2 Weeks later she had birthday and I prepared a really great gift (it would have knocked here out of her socks - i know). She had birthday on a monday a pretty tight schedule due to an internship. She said that I don't have to come over to her place and that we can meet at the weekend (as we always did). the day after her birthday we had a really messy fight over the phone, where she stated that she isn't sure about US anymore. I stated that I don't want to be with someone that is not ""sure"" and we ended our call without really finishing the dispute. The next day she called and told me that she already told her parents that we split and we had the best phone call since ages. We could laugh, we had fun and we talked a lot about issues and misunderstandings. She stated that the break up sill is her choice and that we will meet 2 weeks later when she visits her parents. I wrote her an email the following day - I had to send her something apart from the breakup - and finished with the sentence that I'm looking forward to seeing her and that I'm hoping for a decision. She called the next morning and told me that I should not wait for her to change her mind. She was really emotional and cried a lot but said that she feels that this decision is what she need rights now. She still wants me in her life and she still wants to see me.

Fast forward 2 weeks: no call no text, i write her whats up with our meeting. Her answer: She's already meeting her best friend and seeing me would be too much for her. She asked me not to be angry with her. I was really pissed. But I kept my calm and wrote her that I feel really sorry and that I wanted to meet her in person at least one last time. No answer. I couldn't keep my calm and wrote her a letter (by hand of course) and threw it in her postbox that night (4am).
The letter wasn't negative nor did I plead for forgiveness. I wrote about my thoughts - my feelings and what I have always felt for her. That I admire her willpower and her temper and that I always wanted a future with her - together. I finished by saying that I don't want this to be the end and that my biggest fear is that she is happy with not having me in her life anymore.  I wrote her a text where I placed the letter and asked her to read it. Its not in english, but I will give you a summary. Since then I had no contact at all. No answer to my letter, no text, no mail and no call. I spoke to her sister (they are pretty close) and the sister told me only 2 things: She feels sorry for me and knows that the situation is messy but she recommends living my own life and forgetting her sister for good.

Now a bit more detail to us:

During her last period of university tests she developed a severe depression. It got to a point where she thought about hurting herself - something she did during the final week of high school - but never did when we were together. She has always suffered from slight depression and the thought of beeing ""not enough"" for her parents, me and for herself. I could not understand this thinking because I'm more of a positive person and try to find the good points in bad situation. I always tried to show her this point of view and that some problems resolve themself once you actually stop thinking and start doing something - not all of course.
During our last calls she let me know that she always thought I would take her serious. She also felt like the weak link in our relationship. The one person with trouble and issues. I aced my university degree without ever really struggling and she was more of a 15 hours a day learning type. The problem was: she also aced her tests. But she always said that I don't have to work as hard as she has and was angry at me for that. I was working but I learned in my early teens that working with a smile helps. I tried to make it look easy...also because I didn't want to give additional problems for her to think about.
Anyhow: She started a therapy treating her depression 2 month prior to our breakup and I thought things were going better. She was more positive and she had fun doing things with friends at her place. Something I always told her to do: university isn't learning only. We went to some parties together and she enjoyed herself and the time with me. But during our breakup she stated that she is at a point in her life where she needs to be alone to find herself. She said that she missed a lot of stuff during her studies because she was so eager to be enough for her parents and to not fail her tests.

The problem was that I was having a hard time myself. I had a lot of pressure at work (phd student) and my couldn't do a lot of sport. I gained a lot of weight and was very unhappy with my looks. Also I have a lot of hobbies and friends and I'm always doing stuff. I have a band, a job, sports and social engagement and giving private lessons in mathematics. I did all this stuff but I had no fun...and I grew tired of all that stuff. I had bad mood and no motivation to talk to anyone (not even her) or call her late at night when I came home. She was really angry a lot of times because I wasn't reachable. When we met in person I was tired - as I always was - and preferred watching DVD or sleeping in. She - on the other hand - always planed our weekends and was very eager to have some perfect days. Slight distractions of her plan would instantly kill the good mood and we would start a fight with me telling her to be a bit more relaxed and her telling me to be more active. During the breakup she said that it seemed to her that I live my life and don't want her to be part of it. AND I HATE MYSELF to realize that it must have looked that way. I rips myself apart that I gave her that impressions - these feelings that I experience myself right now. I hate myself for that...

She also thought that we don't have a common goal in life. She assumed that I don't want to settle with her and that I want to force her to live my life wherever I want. But that is not the case. For me there was never really a question that we grow old together and have kids. And the problem I have is: I don't talk about stuff that is a no-brainer for me - with no-one. I just talked about going on a long trip after my phd and visiting all the cool places like I did before. And she thought I would go alone (like south america and Singapore where I stayed during our LDR for a short time).

Now what happened after the breakup: I am shocked that I came to realize that she was so right with so many things. I changed - a lot - and I thought and did more stuff in roughly 2 month than I did in the last year I would say. Not only do I take care of myself (lost 20 pounds, climbing harder routes than ever - no worries: I eat healthy. I'm not starving myself) bought clothes that fit. Regaining my self respect in general. I was never happier with myself the last 3-4 years. I could go on and on but in general: I love my life again. I love the things I do and I dropped the things I hated about myself and my life. I know I'm not finished with this and the process will continue to make me happier from day to day but as time goes by the more I feel what I have lost.

The only thing I can say that is her fault: not talking to me about it and breaking up without a warning...she said that she is really sorry for not talking to me earlier. She said that maybe something could have been done but at the point where she was the only choice for her was the break up.

To make a summary: I think I found myself - the person I was - over the breakup - but I cannot handle the price I paid. She said that she misses this guy she met nearly 10 years ago. Losing her is too much for me and I cannot think of anything else for the last 2 month. Hearing nothing makes me crazy and I would gladly hear anything - even that she is happy with another guy. I can live with blowing my one chance and realizing that I am too late...but I cannot live without knowing she is fine. I talked to her best friend and her sister and they both say the same...as if they sat together to check what to say to me once I try to talk with them…

After re-reading the whole story I realize what a huge clusterfuck I created and that I should be grateful that she didn't leave me much much earlier... What do I want? I want to know that she is fine in the first place. A chance to get everything going again. A phone call, a meeting - talking. And maybe we both feel that there is more between us than friendship.

And this is where I am now. All my friends tell me to move on and that it is for the better because we never really matched in the first place. And I'm sitting here thinking that I forced my soulmate out of my life. I cannot understand the fact that this should be the end of it...

**tl;dr**: GF of 8 years (5 year LDR) broke up over the phone. No contact since then. I'm losing my mind over how stupid I was during our relationship. What to do? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? What could be done?"

But, I'm finding that a) the district I teach in actually has money and b) I actually like teaching and wish to have my own class. 

Currently, only one school in the district has video production classes, and the other 3 do not, but when I got hired as a sub I remember the superintendent told me that they were looking to get it in more of their schools (this district is composed of only 4 high schools). 

The thing is, even though they have the money for it, having a video production class is going to cost LOTS of money, so they may not be down for it, right away. I was thinking if I went to the district proposing either a history of television class, a class that analyzes media, or a scriptwriting class might be a better way to start. That way there's no equipment needed yet it could be really great. I also remember in college taking a class that just studied American television documentaries that was neat. Hell, surprisingly, these schools don't have any form of film study class! 

I found out in California, you can get a credential by proving 3 years of experience in the field, and they said if you have 48 semester units from college, that you can count it as 2 years (which I do have), and I definitely have the other year of experience from internships and the occasional freelance job.  

Who would be the best person to go to about asking to start classes like the ones I mentioned? It still may even be a long shot since they classes don't currently exist, but, it's worth a shot and I want to ask the district about my chances of this becoming a reality before I go getting everything together to get the credential. Would it be the superintendent? If not, who? And what would be the best way to bring it up? (phrasing help?) 

I was also hoping to talk to the one video production teacher in the district to ask him how he got there and if he knows the process at all, but, I just haven't been at that school in a bit, but likely will soon.

I met an awesome guy who's 25, and Egyptian (I'm American).  He's doing his masters program about 40 minutes away from where I live, in the major city in the area.  We're both at very good colleges, and have a ton in common.  We're both big partiers, travel a ton (we've been to most of the same places), like the same music, and just instantly clicked.

I went home with him and we had amazing sex, and he was great the next day.  He made me breakfast, gave me money to get home since I lost my wallet at the club, and walked me to public transportation.  He's been texting or snapchatting me about 10 times a day since, and he's really funny and interesting.

He asked me to hang out on Saturday, and we went out to another show at a club where I met a lot of his friends.  I had a great time, and spent the night at his place.  I got my period though, so we didn't have sex.

We both go out a lot, but still get good grades at our colleges.  On Tuesday we both had major projects due, but he wanted to hang out.  So, he came out to my place on Monday and we stayed up all night working together.  It was also great.  He thought I'd still be on my period so he didn't bring condoms.  I had just gotten off it though, and we both got really horny so he took a cab to 7-11 to buy some more.  Anyway, I had an awesome time.

Now, he texted me today at some point ""what're you up to tonight?""  I said I had my internship tomorrow (true) so I couldn't hang out.  I probably could have made it work though, and I really wanted to go hang out with him.  I just didn't want to come on too strong.  I've never felt like this before and I've dated plenty of guys.  I just don't want it to burn out quickly by hanging out every day as soon as we meet each other.

So, should I keep avoiding some hangouts?  Or should I just do what I want, and see this guy every couple of days?"
1q2ufn,1,2013-11-06,Give me a chance!,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q2ufn/give_me_a_chance/,"No throwaway needed, these are my honest thoughts and I'm probably not alone. Most people don't want to hear my endless bitching so I rarely talk about it, but this is what this subreddit is for so I'll take the opportunity.

I am just wishing that some company somewhere would consider me for a job when I apply. It's always the same thing: We're looking for someone with more experience. I'm so sick of it. It's been over 3 years since I graduated cum laude. I recently did an internship this summer that I thought would help. It seems like nothing I do helps my cause.

The thing that bugs me the most about it is that the people in my particular social circle are all more successful.  They all have good jobs and are comfortable financially. So none of my friends can really relate. Seeing them all do so well makes me ask why I can't be in the same situation. I like to think that I'm a hard worker and a smart guy.

It's frustrating because usually it's the whole experience thing, and otherwise, I'm stuck with jobs that don't even require a college degree and pay some poor hourly wage. I was even turned down for one of these jobs because they thought I was overqualified and that I wouldn't stick around because I'd find something better. I have way more education and a better work ethic than anyone working beside me at these low end jobs. I thought this might help me stand out and advance but it's all about the experience.

I'm currently doing temp jobs, and the company I'm working for is interesting in that most people there are young. The hiring manager looks about my age (25). Yet she told me I don't have enough experience to move into a worthwhile job that I applied for.

You might be asking, ""Do you have a worthless degree?"" I have a degree in poli sci. Some find this to be worthless. I don't. As a matter of fact, I know a few people who graduated with the same degree and have not since gotten a masters. One of them works for the mayor's office in NYC. One works for a senator in Washington. One is a paralegal. And finally one works on Wall Street. All of them got these jobs with little to no experience.

It's annoying because I have a ton of student loans. That's a whole different discussion, but if I had a job similar to one that my friends have, I'd have no problem paying them and living a comfortable life. But because I make a low hourly wage, I have to sit in my apartment and do nothing because if I spend money on going out I won't be able to pay rent/loans.

It's a stressful lifestyle. Since I'm doing a temp job, I don't know when it might suddenly end and if I'd be able to land another temp job quickly. Holidays? Not something to look forward to. I get a day off, but I lose 8 hours worth of money because of it. I've been working overtime on Saturdays so I can be comfortable but it leaves me feeling overworked. When the busy season ends I'm going to have to find some dead end part time job somewhere to make up for the lost overtime hours.

And finally, my current job is not intellectually challenging. I like having tons of work to do which requires thought and organization. I'm doing a repetitive task that a 4th grader could be trained to do. So while I am fortunate to have a good work environment, the job is somewhat torturous to me. The thing I hate the most at work is being bored. I'm not angry at the company for it because it was what I was hired to do as a temp. But it's pretty brutal having to do this 6 days a week with no reward. I don't have the money to do anything. So really I'm just working to avoid punishment from my landlord and the loan companies.

That's all for now. I'm not completely miserable but it's nice to use this avenue to complain about some of the problems I have."
1q2qaj,7,2013-11-06,I suffer from depressions and social anxieties but now I live a good life. Here's how that happened.,Still_not_there,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q2qaj/i_suffer_from_depressions_and_social_anxieties/,"Every mental ordeal is conquered differently. This is how I did it, and if my story helps or inspires at least one person in some small way, then I'm glad I told it. 

I'm a guy that suffer from depression and social anxieties. I say suffer, because in a sense I think it's always with us. It emerges in times of stress like a malfunctioning defense system.

I had been on anti-depressants before. I had been in therapy before. Things always became stable for a while but eventually that crumbled. I wont go into details because that's not what this story is about.

Summer of 2009 my life looked like this:

* Smoke a lot of cigarettes and drink a lot of coffee.
* Stay up late and play computer games.
* Cry out of sheer loneliness.
* Get up at some time and repeat.

I managed to convince myself of again asking my parents to help me get to a doctor so I could get some antidepressants prescribed and a therapist. School started again so I actually had some things to do as well. But mostly my life was still just like the list above.


But that all changed when I got an internship at a lab (I'm a chemist). Suddenly I was **expected** somewhere at 8 am in the morning, and I got to do actual **practical** things. In order for this to work I had to eat **breakfast** and **lunch**, **sleep enough** and **plan my life** more than a day ahead. My work also meant that I interacted with actual living people *8 hours per day*. Something that hadn't happened since college.

Those are the things I strongly believe were absolute key for me getting better. This event in combination with my therapist and the antidepressants made me stable and confident enough so that I could start to address my anxieties instead of avoiding them.

I learned two major things in the months to come:

1) It takes great courage to learn to ask people for help, but once learnt it is a great superpower.

2) If I actually listen to my anxiety instead of trying to bang my head against the psychological wall it often breaks down into one out of two things. Either I'm a) hungry or tired, or b) I'm insecure because I'm encountering a situation I don't know how to handle. For a) it is easy; just eat and sleep dammit. For b) use the superpower in the previous point.


Now I've been stable for four years. I've continued to work in the same lab and I'm extremely happy to have a craft that I'm good at and that I enjoy, and where I meet people everyday that are genuinely nice to be around. Without it I would very likely succumb to my inner demons again.

I considered myself lucky that got that internship, but I also worked really hard to get it in the first place. I then continued to work hard to prove myself during this internship so that I could get a job when the time came. Now when I have the job, I still continue to work hard on excelling at what I do so that I can continue to live the life that I'm worth having.

Thanks for listening!"

If this is possible and will work the way I think I will, I will need an 8.57 ohm resistor (we'll call it 10 ohm) in series with a 34.28 ohm (40 ohm) resistor that is in parallel with my LED.

Will this work? The equipment I'm using is sensitive and I don't want to blow anything up."

At the beginning I told her I would come to spend christmas with her and she would come back with me. Things haven't been smooth since she was gone and I was unsure if I still loved her but I wanted to try to make it work and also felt obligated to go. So I said I would go. Things got better for a bit and then fell apart now. The big fighting point is that she doesn't like the people I surround myself with and doesn't want me to be friends with them anymore and to remove them from my life, which makes me uncomfortable. She put me in an us or them position which I did not like. I am certain I don't want to be with her anymore, but I would feel awful at the thought of leaving her alone for christmas in Tanzania with no family. I just don't think I can deal with this anymore, it is destroying me to the point where I don't eat, sleep, and am suffering from depression. Any advice would be appreciated."

We practice AcroYoga, or acrobatic yoga with a partner, and we've gotten to where we trust each other implicitly. We talk all the time about everything,  we even finish each others sentences. We also spend a lot of time 1 on 1 practicing outside of group. 

I know he has a girlfriend in another far away state so I've made effort to approach him as a friend.  But he's extremely attractive. 

The other night after our group session,  we were drinking wine with another acro team. They left and we talked for hours.  I had taken a really bad fall and he offered to rub my shoulders, which he's done before.   It was more...intimate than the back rubs we exchange during our group sessions. I wrote it off as the wine and my roommate came in and he stopped.  

We started talking again ended up cuddling.  He said he had strong feelings for me but before Anything happened he had to tell his gf. We kissed and I asked him to sleep on the couch because he'd been drinking,  but he said that was a bad idea and went home.

The next day,  he gave me a ride to school and we went to the park after,  just hanging out talking.  But neither of us mentioned it.  Soon he had to go work and he'll be working at his internship all this weekend so I won't see him till Monday at the earliest.  I want to message him and ask what's going  on. I've never been in this situation before and it makes me very uncomfortable. I don't know how to approach it without being pushy or needy. 

(This was typed on my phone so sorry if there's weird grammar stuff)

**TL;DR:** My yoga partner and I both found out we have feelings for each other over a jug of wine. He has a girlfriend in another state who he said he was going to talk to, but the next day we hung out and didn't say a word about it. I don't know how to approach it. I don't know if I should."

I am getting deployed summer of 2014. I'm having a very hard time finding a job to apply for because I'll be gone for 4 months this summer and I feel guilty applying for any job. I feel like I would be overlooked due to my deployment and causing unnecessary burdens upon any company that hires me. 

Should I just study for the CPA and sit for the test when I get back or should I try to find temp work in the meantime? I meet all of the requirements for the CPA exam in my state upon graduation. There aren't much temp opportunities in my area and any other.opportunities are for juniors or seniors. Or the job is for full time which I wouldn't be able to dedicate to until I got back.

1q5aju,1,2013-11-07,"This holiday season, I'm making a difference",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q5aju/this_holiday_season_im_making_a_difference/,"My family has always been financially stable. My brother, sister, and myself were always taught to appreciate what we had growing up. I'm 26, and I'm about to graduate from pharmacy school. While doing my last year of internships, I've had some life-changing, and eye-opening experiences.

Most recently, I spent time working with the elderly. Some of them were doing well for themselves, while others were clearly in need of help and support. I've always wanted to do something to help others, most importantly, helping those in need. Seeing some of the elderly people around the senior center and assisted living facilities, I began to have stronger feelings for making a difference. The problem was that I didn't know where to begin.

Today, while working at my current internship (independent, retail pharmacy), I saw a holiday tree that had tabs of paper as ornaments. I asked what it was, and I was told that it's a program for senior citizens who are in need of things for the holiday season. I took a closer look and it was simple items: a flannel shirt, a new pair of pants, a scarf, etc. I thought about it for a second, and I realized that I feel like a piece of shit. For all these years, I've been asking for mindless items for the holidays, and rarely did I ever think about truly making a difference. Sure, I've given old clothes to those drop off bins by Wal Mart and such, but who knows where those actually go. I was mostly just putting them in there and saying, ""Happy Holidays, whoever gets this stuff, enjoy it!""

This year, I'm making a difference. I went to my parents' house for dinner and chatted with my mom. I told her of the holiday tree with the ornaments, and how I want to do my part. She told me that every year, her and my dad ""adopt"" a family and get them items that are on the list. I thought that was amazing. I told her that I don't want anything for myself this holiday season. Maybe it's growing up, or maybe it's realizing that there are others truly in need, whereas I don't necessarily need it. If I should decide that I need it, I can use my own money to purchase it. I don't need to use the holiday season as a reason to get something I don't want to purchase myself.

I want to make a difference, not only during this holiday season to those who are in need, but I want to truly make a difference to those throughout the rest of my life. I'm not talking about the Peace Corps or anything, but I want to be more aware of what I'm doing when I make decisions. I want to make a conscious effort to think of those in need as often as I can. I don't have the time right now to volunteer due to my last year of school, but I can do my part by helping identify excellent charities and donation programs. I can give to those truly in need and try my best to make a difference in their lives.

Because of this, I'm sitting here, typing to a screen about feelings inside of me that I can't fully identify. It's not sadness, it's not happiness. It's almost like a happy-sadness. I recognize the need for helping others truly in need. I feel sad that people are in these situations, but I'm happy that I can feel the way I do about making a difference. People say that they will make a difference, and most likely end up forgetting about their promise. Today, I promise you, whoever reads this, that I will make a difference this , and every holiday season. I will do everything in my power to make a difference in someone's life. Whether it's as simple as buying a flannel shirt, or as complicated as adopting a family for their gift list, I will do something to make a difference. I don't care if others look at me strange and wonder why I'm giving up my gifts to help others. I know what I've received and experienced throughout the years, and I want to make someone's holiday season as happy and joyful as mine have been.

I hope there are others who agree with me. Let's all try to make a conscious effort to lend a helping hand those in need. Let's make someone's holiday one they will never forget."

Planning on applying to the PC in the next year or so and I was curious about other engineer's experience in the PC. I would love it if you could answer a few questions for me.

1. What is your degree in? Did you join right after school, or did you work for a while? If so how long? 
2. Where did you go? What did you do?
3. For returned PCVs, how hard was it to find a job upon returning? Did you rejoin the engineering field, or another occupation?

The main thing I am interested in is understanding how difficult it will be to find a new job upon returning if I do apply / am accepted. I think it is likely that I would be placed in education, based on my science background and volunteer work with students. 

If it matters, I would have four internships, three years of work experience in industry, plus the PC experience, on my resume when I return. 

Thanks in advance!"
1q9uch,13,2013-11-09,My Stepfather [39 M] wants to cut me off financially [19 F] No clue what to do,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q9uch/my_stepfather_39_m_wants_to_cut_me_off/,"I'll try to explain the best I can. 

My stepdad has been a part of my life for 9 years. When I was younger, he used to ground me for poor grades. Me being grounded was basically house arrest. I wasn't allowed to see my friends for months, i had every toy and book taken from my room and i would be screamed at for hours about how terrible I was. This was all if I got anything lower than a B. 


He has outright told me that my younger brother and sister are better than me and that I was a failure in his eyes. 


In highschool, he made it a rule that I wasn't allowed to leave the house during school nights to see my friends and that I needed to ask permission to do things weeks ahead of time. 


He would get angry and scream and hit things and destroy furniture if he found out I asked my mother to do things instead of him. 


I wasn't allowed a cell phone until junior year of high school because I ""would use it for drugs"". Each night I came home from hanging out with my friends, I'd have to let him smell my breath and check my eyes for drugs or alcohol.


There were multiple times that he blamed my struggling in school with me being pregnant, on drugs or using alcohol.


When I started looking into college, he knew that my entire life I had been dedicated to art and wanted to go to art school, but tore up my information brochures to the schools and told me I wasn't allowed to do art anymore.


I wasn't allowed to get my permit for driving until after I graduated from high school, I wasn't allowed to have a part time job.


I wasn't allowed to take out loans for college, I wasn't allowed to live on campus because when he was college, all he did ""was drink, smoke and not go to class"". I had to live at home for the beginning of Freshman year and be driven to my classes. (After I gave them my passwords, class schedule, and campus map with where I'd be)


My friends lived on campus and I got permission from my mom to start staying with them during the school week and go home on weekends. She agreed, but my stepdad was unhappy that I was spending time away from my family. He would yell and tell me I was abandoning them. 


All throughout the school year he would hold it over my head that he was paying for me to go to school, so he got to pick my major. 


Over the summer, because I didn't want to intern where he picked an instead wanted to get a job, he told me I was on my own and kicked me out briefly. 


Currently: I live with my SO on campus in an apartment, where I took out loans this year to pay for school. Because I'm paying for my school, I get to pick my major now. I'm also a year late in the program and need to take extra classes. 


I got a job on campus and am paying for almost everything I do, with my mom occasionally dropping off some groceries. 


I went home this weekend for the first time in few months and have been put down every chance my stepdad gets. He calls me a traitor. When my mom told him my SO and I were probably going to get a townhouse together off campus and save some money, he called me a whore.


My stepdad's father is also in town, and when we were on the topic off classes, my stepdad told him to forget about whatever I say because I probably skip all of my classes anyways.


Lastly, he was told that I would be taking summer classes and working, instead of coming back to stay, he told me that I was cut out of the family financially as far as he's concerned. If I didn't want to be a part of this family, then he wouldn't treat me like family.


I cannot begin to describe how much I hate him and how horrible he makes me feels, especially when he's not getting angry because he wants to cuddle and hug and be best friends. He has told my sister and I multiple times that we are his only friends and his dream is to have a farm where we can all live together. One moment he goes from cool stepdad to a monster. 


I don't know what to do. My mother loves him and fights with him often, but he wont let her leave or manipulates her into staying. (Money, dog, house, car)


I'm stuck on where to go from here. He told me he'd help me move out in the spring, but I'm forgotten after that. 





---

**tl;dr**: I'm so sorry for the wall of text. My stepdad is emotionally abusive and is cutting me out of the family 
financially. 

EDIT: The biggest reason why this is upsetting me is not because of the money, I have never asked him to pay for anything in my life, it's that this is his way of trying to cut me out of the family. He did the same thing to my younger brother when he decided to get away from our stepdad and move to KY with our dad. My brother is no longer seen as family to my stepdad."
1q9oar,3,2013-11-09,Serious confrontation at work? What do I do?,Brea593,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1q9oar/serious_confrontation_at_work_what_do_i_do/,"I work at albertsons in produce. Today there was a beer spill and as allways there wasnt any ""spill magic"" (It absorbs the spill so that you can sweep it up before anyone gets hurt or uses the opportunity to sue us), but this time there wasnt even a container to fill up with more. Theres stations positioned in every department. I had to ask the dairy guy next to us if he knew where I could find another close station, he leads me to his and its also empty but luckily there was a container. I take the container and go to the opposite end of our store to fill it up (and theres also no container at that spill station or inside the closet). Meanwhile even though I have a cone out, nobody is watching it. So the spill is sitting there this entire time. I'm the only one in my department but luckily my boss on his way out says he'll say something, one of the courtesy clerks shows up to get the spill by which time I've taken care of it myself. I explain to the guy that I got it but the problem is that theres no spill magic, he tells me that I'm supposed to fill it up. I tell him that there wasn't even a container for me to fill. I explain to him that when I was a courtesy clerk at the otherstore they made us fill and check every station. This man is in his 40's so I wonder if he is also disabled (we have a couple courtesy clerks with disabilities). I make it a point when I get off to talk to the front manager who works with all these guys. I approch her ""Hey, Robin could I talk to you moment?"". and she's like ""sure"" and I explain to her the spill magic issue and she grabs my wrist very strongly (so much so I thought she was being playful.) I'm having to bend over as she yanks me away and pulls me down and still firmly grabbing me the entire conversation she points over to our departments spill station and says ""You see that?! It's full!"" and I proceed to say assertively ""Yeah, I was the one to fill it."" ""You're supposed to fill it."" ""There wasnt even a container, I had to go to dairy to use their container"" and then she says flushedly "" Well, who's been throwing away the containers?!"" ""I dont know."" ""Well, I'll order some more but now we wont even have a container upfront!"". Thankfully my boss on his way out stood a few feet away watching the whole thing closely because I hit my meltdown so fast I had to walk away before anyone could see me. Im not a ""fragile"" chick, but I was hit with so much violent aggressive energy so unexpectedly that I broke like a rubber band. I've never been so overwhelmingly flooded by noises and tears in my adult life, especially over something so trivial. I havent been grabbed like that even when I was little. I still get overwhelmed just by thinking about how aggressive and ruthless she was with me in front of customers and coworkers. 

I'm worried that the courtesy clerk was disabled and as an aspie I was getting overly passionate or sounded really aggressive when I didnt even realize it or mean to, and he told the front end manager so she intern got aggressive with me. In my head I was just being assertive. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I plan on talking to the coworker who overheard my conversation with the courtesy clerk tomorrow, to confirm how I sounded. My boss watched the whole thing and stayed after I left, So I'll talk to him monday. My Mom says I should confront her and lay down my boundaries and take back my authority. I dont know if thats a good idea because she can obviously become very hostile at a moments notice. I do feel like somethings been taken from me. and if this is how she feels she can treat me as someone from an outside department, it makes me really question how she treats the disabled baggers. Her boss (the superintendent of the store) is a good semi-friendly guy but is just like techno viking. Point here is that I'm an assertive, professional, articulate person, who got abused to the point of actual tears today at work and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say or do?

Thanks for reading my wall of text, I'm sure I couldve stream linned it but I wanted every detail to be full understood."

DISCLAIMER: This is an extremely long update.



   First and foremost, thank you all for giving your advice and opinions. It really opened my eyes.

   I have decided to keep and raise the baby. Am I ready? No. Am I scared? Hell yes. But I could end up turning out to be a great mother. I know it won't all be rainbows and unicorns but I'm okay with that. 

   I'm willing to give up everything for this child. I will have to change my choice of career (I'm currently a pre-med student. Medical school obviously won't work out), and will have to work an insane amount to even achieve getting a degree while raising a baby. Not to mention work my ass off to provide financial support for the baby. It will be tough, I will be stressed, but it is possible. My parents were 18 when they were expecting their second child (they have 6 now) and had absolutely nothing. They weren't perfect parents, but they did anything and everything to give us a better life than they had.

   The phone call I had with Sam wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. I told him I was pregnant and that I was planning on raising the baby. He would have the choice on whether he'd like to be a part of this. At times, during our talk on the phone, I heard his voice cracking. Not entirely sure if he was crying or if he was trying to suppress how much he was freaking out. He says he plans on flying out in two weeks so we can begin with all the legal steps (DNA tests, child support, custody). He hasn't made it clear if he plans on being a part of the child's life, but we'll just have to wait and see how everything turns out

   Now for the fun part. I always try to keep a positive outlook even in the worst situations. So when it came to telling my parents, I thought I'd make the most of it. I invited them over for dinner at my place and told them I had great news. Now I should add that I have been waiting for a couple of weeks to hear back from an internship I have been furiously trying to get in another state. My parents assumed that's what we were going to celebrate. After we were finished with dinner I handed them a small brown box. They slowly opened the box and pulled out a pair of white baby shoes (Got the idea from YouTube). I yelled, ""Meemaw and Pappaw!"" They looked at me, then at each other, and had a confused look on their faces. They knew I wasnt seeing anyone so thought it was a big joke. I explained everything. They were disappointed and definitely let me know how irresponsible those choices were, but are extremely excited to meet their grandbaby. Also, they were furious when I told them I had thought about not telling Sam. My Father said when he meets him, he plans on punching him in the groin. I'm sure that feeling will go away after some time. Overall, they are being very supportive. They have always been understanding, loving, and considerate parents, which I am very thankful for.

  I do feel like such an idiot for thinking that I could raise a baby alone and thinking that having a baby was an obligation because of the choices I made. I see now how big of an ass I was. 

   Believe me when I say that my logic of this pregnancy was changed dramatically after reading your thoughts and seeing the excitement everyone had after hearing the news of a new family member. I understand that I could put the baby up for adoption, continue with medical school, and properly become an adult, but I am willing to give that all up for this baby. That's how much this baby means to me already. 

   Even if Sam decides to not be a part of his life, I know this child will always be surrounded by people who will love and adore him unconditionally. All I am sure of at this point is that the next 18 years will be one hell of a ride

   Thank you so much, Reddit, for your time and advice. I appreciate it way more than you will ever know.

 

TL;DR: Reddit and my family quickly showed me how big of an idiot I was and I am extremely thankful for that."

Bio: 27.M.American (speak beginner level of Spanish as well as Ukrainian and Russian

I seem to be at a crossroad in my life at the moment. I am trying to live a life of perpetual travel, well that was my goal at least, but I realize that may not be the most realistic goal.

I am graduating in December with degrees in International Trade and Political Science. I am a late bloomer. I took up a full time job at a bank for 6 years before deciding I hated it and wanted to go to school.

This summer I did a 2 month internship at a high profile inter-governmental agency in Bosnia, so I've got that going for me.

I wouldn't mind going to grad school, but the thing is I have a ridiculous amount of debt already and I am not confident because my initial job search failed miserably. So, going to grad school. I've looked at Norway (because state schools are free) but that is really it. Another **big problem** is I do not have a B average (which is a minimum requirement for all schools). It will be more like  C+ or B- when it is all said and done. 

* What are some free universities anywhere in the Europe (or in the world for that matter). I realize in a country like Norway the cost of living would still be outrageous, could I work there? Are they more lenient towards internationals in that regard? I see the link on the sidebar, but I specifically need free tuition universities for internationals. 

---------------------------------------------------


Something else I was looking into was actually using my degrees to find a job. The problem is that you essentially have to have an EU passport to get a job. Furthermore, getting a job in at a political think tank, IGO (inter-governmental organizations), international institutions like the UN or World Bank, NGOs, ect... all **require** a Master's degree. Your resume will be thrown in the trash and not even considered if you don't have one. I should probably mention that it is impossible for me to find work in my own city, but then again there is pretty much 0 demand for International Trade and Political Science here. 

* How do you get a job in the EU if you're not an EU passport holder? It seems impossible. "
1q85fa,6,2013-11-08,W5D1 - Thrilling win after feeling down for a while.,21roses,C25K,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/1q85fa/w5d1_thrilling_win_after_feeling_down_for_a_while/,"Sorry for the long post - this is my second time doing C25k and tonight was a definite turning point for me.

Some history: I began C25k for the *first* time in February. It was my last semester of college and I was working 2 jobs, an internship, and taking 21 credits. Personally, I tend to ignore or internalize stress, which was really harming me during this tough time. 

I still don't really know why I decided to do C25k. In the past, I had always hated running and couldn't imagine why anyone would do it willingly. I just knew that I needed to do *something* or else I would completely break down. 

At first, it was something I could love to hate. I'd get winded too fast, feel nauseous, all that good stuff. I got stuck on Week 4 (which could be renamed ""the month of April"") until finally I read that you could slow down your pace! Breakthrough! As I finally moved into Week 5, running started to become fun. I could feel proud about exhausting myself and I started to get these bursts of excitement and joy during the runs. I remember flooring myself the first time I wanted to run on a rest day (I didn't do it, but just the desire blew my mind) and holy shit - when I finished the program (ran the full 30 min in June and ran 5k in under 30 on July 19) - It's probably the most emotional I've been about anything in a long time. 

Unfortunately, the day I hit my goal was the day after I began working full time and I kind of tapered off - dropped down to running a mile every now and then to really not running at all. That, plus sitting all day, wrecked me and I lost a lot of motivation (and gained back everything since starting the program).
---
Thankfully(?) work suddenly got very stressful and I finally got back to a point of sufficient desperation to start running again. Last week, I went back to Week 4 and it was miserable. I couldn't believe how much ground I had lost in just a few months and how hard it was to complete the runs. I was discouraged and angry at myself. I even had to repeat days 2 and 3. 

Tonight's run felt different. I was trying to focus on not heel striking, pacing myself, and managing my breathing. I did the first and second 5 minutes without too much trouble. Then, on the ""one minute left"" mark, I decided I would keep going until I ran a mile. And I did!! Even though it was very hard, I started to get those bursts of joy and when I finally hit the mile mark, it felt so good. 

I know this is still going to take hard work and dedication, but after a terrible week and a crappy three months, tonight was the best I felt in ages. I'm so excited for Monday!

tl;dr Completed C25k in July, stopped running and was very discouraged when I tried to restart. Then, tonight I finally felt good on my run and was able to push myself a whole mile rather than stopping on the last 5 min portion. "

Help please?",tthrowawayy01,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q7vvv/me_22_m_with_my_gf_22_f_sex_life_problems_help/,"So my girlfriend and I have different needs. It's normal. I have an immensely high sex drive, she has a low sex drive. We've talked about it multiple times, with me initiating calmly, we now have sex 2-3 times a week, 4 if it's good.


She doesn't give me blowjobs, and when she does, she does it like it's a chore. Lately, same thing when it comes to sex. There, I said it. To me, it seems incredibly embarrassing, hence why I haven't confided in any of my friends yet. On top of that, I've talked over it with her, and it just gets better for about a week (if even that) and then it just goes back to normal. Why is it embarrassing to me, you ask?


I'm good looking, I keep myself fit and very clean (5 ft 8in, 13% body fat), out of college I'm making low six-figures (had an internship starting freshman year of college, learned quickly and well, got an offer when I graduated), I read, keep my place clean and tidy, even tutor underprivileged children &amp; volunteer at a local soup kitchen on alternating Sundays. Oh, and I sing well. 


So my friends (aside from my closest 3-4 friends) think I have it all and well put together. Obviously I have an issue with modesty, but that's because I was a late bloomer, admittedly pretty gross until I hit my junior year of high school, and I'm still dealing with the completely drastic change in attention I've been receiving since. That's another story.


Anyways, this ""I don't like giving blowjobs"" thing and ""I just don't feel like it as much as you do"" frankly makes me feel unwanted whenever it comes up. I give her oral every time we have sex, she told me she likes it so I do. She also said she doesn't really like being on top and likes it rough; though I wasn't too up for it, I made some changes and now we mostly go at it roughly and I'm ALWAYS on top. Always. Point is, I care for her, so when she tells me she wants something, I make sure to work at it until it's to her liking.


I also make sure we have frequent date nights (we haven't spent a night apart in the year we've been dating since about our sixth month save for holidays and the like), buy her flowers at least once every two to three weeks, massage her when she's feeling tense and stressed, and cook for her when she's sick. She definitely is a good one, though: she cooks for me almost daily, gets me the foods I like, listens to me very well when I vent about my problems, and just loves me for who I am.



It's just this one thing, and I admit it's just one small thing. So why not just get over it and enjoy what you have? Because I was so incredibly ""unwanted"" sexually and romantically by the opposite gender for all of my child-teen years, I can't stand being with someone who doesn't want me physically as much as I want them. With all that I do even with a full time job and what she does (she's been unemployed for the last three months because her last job wasn't what she wanted) for me when she's unemployed, I know it's wrong, but I'm starting to resent her for being overall just unwilling to see it from my point of view when it comes to the bedroom. I try so hard, both in our relationship and the bedroom, but one of those is just so incredibly unsatisfying to me that I actually contemplating breaking up with her last week, when she said, ""Okay, we'll have sex tonight,"" forgot about it hours later and just fell asleep without even mentioning it.


Another thing is that I know I'm desirable now - I get approached at least every other day (men sometimes, since this is NYC...), but I firmly turn them away; why would I even need to look at them if I have someone to care about? But when I know, such as when it's a semi-close friend, that they're well put together, gainfully employed, very willing in bed, able cooks, musically talented and attractive (yeah, there have been two particular girls that I turned away gently multiple times until I had to cut contact with them because it made my girlfriend uncomfortable, and rightfully so, that they were attracted to me), it becomes harder and harder to not think about leaving my girlfriend for a girl who maybe isn't as good in some aspects as my girlfriend is, but still possesses a wide variety of desirable traits.


It's frankly driving me crazy. She's also had many more partners than I have, and has made out with 10-15 people; compared to my 5 hookups, and 4 sex partners, it makes me feel sad. Not in a ""I didn't get to go out and have fun with many people"" kind of way, just I know she gave some of them blowjobs and had frequent sex with a few of them, and it just makes me feel bad about myself - am I not good enough to have her at least be enthusiastic about having sex with me?



She also had one boyfriend who cheated on her, so we made it a thing to have an open-device policy. I've checked her phone once jokingly - she's checked my Facebook and texts over five times throughout the course of our relationship, and I have NEVER made a fuss about it. I even offer to show her my texts and messages; I care about her, what do I have to hide?


It just hurts. I know we have a great relationship otherwise, we have fun being together whether we're doing something outside or just doing nothing and laying in bed together having a delivery.com + Netflix marathon. But I know I'm a catch, I've been called that plenty of times as people have witnessed my willingly given affection to my girlfriend, in compliments, presents, flowers, little notes, hugs from behind, listening to her problems, massages, everything that you would want in a boyfriend, I guess besides the going out. It's a big part of social life in NYC, and I'm not too keen on the going out and drinking/clubbing thing.


Am I wanting too much? Am I being crazy for wanting my girlfriend to be more ""into"" it in the bedroom? Should I breakup with her since I'm feeling unwanted? Are my feelings even justified?


TL;DR; My girlfriend isn't enthusiastic about sex and blowjobs as I am, when I know I am a great boyfriend, and she's a good girlfriend as well. I try to make our relationship as great as possible, and I feel like I'm not being appreciated for everything that I do, both in vocal acknowledgement and the bedroom. What should I do?


Thanks in advance for your guys' advice/help, lay it on me if I'm being unreasonable, cause if I am, I want a harsh wake up call."

I have a very light schedule next year and I work part time as an intern for an engineering firm. I should have plenty of time to take care of a puppy if I get one soon.

I want to move to Denver though when I graduate which may mean problems trying to move cross country with my dog. I was originally thinking of getting a dog thats more like 6 months old since that would allow me to leave him alone a little longer in the beginning but the local animal shelter has the perfect lilttle lab mix puppies that are 8-10 weeks old.

1qbsus,0,2013-11-10,Questions on rent and commute,n1c0_ds,montreal,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1qbsus/questions_on_rent_and_commute/,"(réponses en français bienvenues)

6 months ago, I have moved in Montreal with my girlfriend so I could study at the École de Technologie Supérieure. We just broke up and I am now looking for a place to live.

Unfortunately, I don't have a roommate on hand, and I don't really know Montreal. Essentially, I want a cheap place near the ÉTS and possibly near the yellow line for my internship.

Here are the facts:

* I have a winter internship at Pratt &amp; Whitney (Longueuil), then back at the ÉTS
* My share of the rent was $425 a month plus utilities. I liked it that way.
* I have a deep safety net so I can take a big hit financially
* I love Verdun, and the distance from everything is *perfect*
* I need a quiet space

What should I do? Should I find a cheap room near P&amp;W for the winter, then find something closer to Verdun for July 2014? I don't have any potential roommate.

EDIT: Bonus question: What are those coop places? Should I trust them?"
1qbo1v,8,2013-11-10,Slowly cutting my mom out.,AlbinoUnicorn,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qbo1v/slowly_cutting_my_mom_out/,"I am 21, still living with my mother as I finish college, work FT, and intern at a treatment center.

I am currently engaged and am moving in with my fiance this summer.  Right now, I am staying at my grandmother's house while she is overseas visiting family.

Throughout my life, my mother has emotionally abused me. She is Borderline. I moved halfway across the country to live with my dad when I was 15. He passed away when I was 17 and I was forced to move back in with my mother.  Things have gotten increasingly worse as my mother's BPD has continued to worsen and go untreated.

After last night, when things got particularly ugly and involved a few of my other family members (one aunt was particularly awful), I deleted the ""offending"" family off of facebook. 

I don't want to be immature, but seeing how things have gone lately, I have really been making an effort to cut them out (had not spoken to my mother for 3 days before last night, will not contact or answer phone calls from the other aunt, etc). But I am trying to transition to independence from my entire family.  I saw deleting the family members that have been particularly awful (some of my family is sane) as a step towards that.

Can I get some advice on how to handle disowning my family?  Is it better to keep them on board until I am completely gone?  Is it best to cut them out from social media?

I honestly want to handle things smoothly, but I know that my deleting them will likely cause my mom to get angry.  But she has been posting passive agressive and mean things about me today and I don't want to keep her on fb where she can continue to ""get to me""."
1qaqbo,0,2013-11-10,"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [28 F] 3 years, girlfriend breaking up with me, mainly because conflicting interests of the future.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qaqbo/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend_28_f_3_years/,"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [28 F] 3 years, girlfriend breaking up with me, mainly because conflicting interests of the future.

Hi everyone, this is a huge story so I'm going to try to stick to the important parts. 

I am a 22 year old male, studying Electrical and Communications Engineering, with one year left in a 4 year degree.
She is a 28 year old hairdresser 

What has taken me a few days to realise is what I should have known for at least a year now. I met my girlfriend when I was 19 and she 25, and since dating there has always been the difficulty of the age gap, but it hasn't become such an issue until this year, as we have just had future outlooks typical to people our age all through our relationship. 

This last year she has been pressing me occasionally with discussions of: do I see her in my life in the future, marriage, babies when am I ready etc. 
At this point of time she doesn't want those things right away, she just wanted to know if I felt the same way. 

I have loved her so much but thoughts of a future life never really occurred to me, not because of how I felt about her, but just because I think I wasn't exposed to this or I was so focussed in my university work and living a student lifestyle, I had never considered this step. I also think because she fell for me so quickly and without me really having to do anything that I became lazy in the relationship, assuming she’s just so in love with me. 

So whenever she brought it up I would become such an asshole, I wouldn't want to talk about it, I would just ignore it, and we had 2 very close breakups over this, mainly resolving in me thinking for ages of how I felt about her at that moment in time and really just missing the whole point, and she started to not believe that I really felt like I wanted her in my life. I should mention I live with my parents and have only considered moving out the last couple of months, and never had considered moving in with her until now, which I really want so bad. 

I think I have grown in maturity and smartness so much this last month, because we've basically been breaking up on and off. I have realised what I want and working out my 5 year plan, it's everything she wants and I want to make it work so, so bad. 

So she broke up with me for like a week, mainly because she didn't believe this is what I truly wanted and I would end up screwing her over in the long run. We started talking again, hung out a bit, but she still wasn't sure, so we took a break for 3 weeks, not to see other people, just some thinking space. 

After this we started hanging out again like a couple for the last week and a half, but last Wednesday it all just went horribly wrong and all her past feeling just came up and she dumped me 'for good' with no intention of changing her mind, I had scarred her too bad. And nothing had changed, I was just the same, drifting university student on holidays awaiting my internship and doing nothing. 

What makes this the most horrible of all is in 2 weeks I am leaving for Brisbane (3 hour flight from where I live (Melbourne, Australia)) to work a summer internship for engineering (2.5 months), which is an amazing opportunity, but I don't know anyone up there, and I just cant stand the thought of her here with all her friends meeting people. 

I have been horribly devastated the last couple of days and just thinking so hard on why she was so un attracted to me, where I went wrong. 

Last Friday I got into contact via txt message and just really spilled the truth; everything I've been hiding, why I was an asshole, my understanding of what it means to be in a relationship as a man, and how to conduct my own life. 


Her responses paraphrased are along the lines of:


 * ""I don’t really know what to say, I don’t think getting back together now is the right thing to do, I'm not open to it especially because of how I'm feeling""



After some more of my txts:



* ""Can you leave it until your internship is over, I meet people all the time whether you're here or not, I like it, and that doesn't mean I'm slutting around, I just forgot this about myself and I'm trying to find myself again, we can talk while you're away sometimes, just give it some time""

I like to think I hit home with her, I think my texts were very smart and showed how much I had learnt, but I'm still riddled with thoughts of her meeting people, having sex with someone and ultimately thinking her relationship with me was cancer to who she really is and what she wants as a person, and it's wrenching me apart where I'm just so depressed and can't concentrate on this upcoming job. I don’t know if she said this to get me to leave it for a while, whether she’s keeping me there as a backup if she doesn’t find someone, or whether she really deep down wants this to work. 

I'm coming back home for Christmas and New Year. So I think I might wait something like 3 weeks and give her a call, just for a chat and maybe ask if she wants to meet up when I'm home for a bit?

How far should I push this while I’m away? She said she would drive back home with me when the internship’s done… Should I see how it goes before asking if she still wants to do that? How can I get across to her that I can’t handle the thought of her hooking up with people?

Wow this is long; I could’ve gone on forever. I should mention we are absolutely incredible together, there is so much love, we really used to outpour our souls into each other, and everything was just so comfortable. She expressed numerous times how I’m perfect for her, and she wants the rest of her life with me. 

**TL;DR**: Much older girlfriend doesn’t believe I am fully committed to her in the future because of stupid, thoughtless stuff I have said in the past while I was young and didn’t understand, I got through to her a bit, she says give it time, don’t know what to do now.

1qe8s8,1,2013-11-11,I feel shitty without knowing why or even having a logical reason to.,Fristilus,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qe8s8/i_feel_shitty_without_knowing_why_or_even_having/,"The last couple of weeks I feel horrible and sad and angry and I don't even know why. It's not permanent, I've had some really good fun evenings and weekends with friends. But give me more than an hour alone at home, enter the sadness. A general feeling of bleakness, not feeling to well, mild headache, and sometimes accompanied by sadness and crying.

Point is I don't know why. I am as good as graduated, already have a decent job going (okay, not my dreamjob, but as a starter urgently needing to get some money, I can't complain), recently got a girlfriend, got a new appartement, new furniture, long story short: starting a new phase in my life and, unlike most Americas, without a towering student loan, just, clean slate.

I have some stress because combining work and finishing my school stuff is a tough combination, but should be doable if I plan it a bit decently, though has not being going great up until now. I never have been good at this. I'm one of those people lurking and staring at /r/GetMotivated  and /r/getdisciplined, I make plans every month to better my life, to start working out, to start eating better, and nothing ever comes from it. Do it for a week and fail.

As a computer scientist, there are so many exciting things you can do, as a student you have so many opportunities (internships, google summer of code, ..) that I see so many of my friends do, and I did not do any of them, just because I had to sit at my desk and stare at series entire weeks. I passed my studies with barely doing anything, I just wasted soo many opportunities and chances. And even then I got in a good place, have a good situation going and I still feel bad.

I fucked up so often and so many times, and I always turn out fine, manage to fix everything, to get something good going. But still I don't feel happy. Still I live on this emotional rollercoaster and I'm tired of it, I've had it.

**tl;dr: Emotional rollercoaster with sad moments at random times, while I should not have anything to complain about, objectively speaking**"
1qe86m,5,2013-11-11,"Story time: Almost got caught with synthetic urine at a drug test, not out of the woods yet. Wish me luck.",Schnozzberries,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1qe86m/story_time_almost_got_caught_with_synthetic_urine/,"Hey ents, gather round for a story, learn from my mistakes, and wish me luck today. I'm already getting ahead of myself. Here goes:

(This is a doosie, so there’s a TL;DR at the bottom)

I got offered a job last week as an intern in one of those typical cubicle office jobs. Not the most glamorous gig but I was beyond excited to find something that would pay the bills. I had decided long ago that, if I was drug tested for a job, I would use synthetic urine. I’ve been smoking daily for about six months and did want to risk anything showing up in the sample. I bought some Quick Fix Plus at my headshop and was confident everything would work out fine. On Friday morning, I heated up the bottle in the microwave, stuck it in my boxer briefs, and drove to the testing clinic. Although it came with a hand warmer, the instructions said it wasn’t necessary to use it in addition to the microwave, so I chose not to.

That was my first mistake. My second mistake was not taping the bottle to my leg or briefs. It was nestled nice and securely in my crotchal region when I walked into the clinic, and remained there as I filled out the paper work. A woman came out, called my name, and I stood up to accompany her into the testing area. That’s when the bottle slipped out of my briefs and began sliding down the leg of my jeans. It was all I could do to keep it together. I walked as slow as possible without being suspicious, hoping to god that the bottle would stay perfectly balanced on the top of my shoe, with my pant leg covering it up. Somehow the bottle didn’t fall out, and there I was in the bathroom holding a little cup. I thought I was home-free at that point. I looked at the temperature strip at the bottle, which read 92 degrees. Now, in my research I had read that as long as the sample was between 90 and 100, I was good to go. I poured half of the Quick Fix into the cup, half into the toilet, stuck the empty bottle into my briefs, and walked out proudly holding my sample. I was about to write my name on the label when the nurse (she was a sassy black woman, so you can read what she says in an appropriate voice) says “Uh, hold up. This is way too cold. Uh-uh, you’re gonna need to give me another sample.” 

Enter the flop sweat. I stupidly blurted out something about holding the cup up to the A/C vent after I peed into it because I was worried it was “too hot.” That’s when she knew I had faked it, I could see it in her eyes. A slow, small smile crept onto her face and I knew she was thinking “you’re so fucked.” She told me I would need to stay at the facility until I could pee again, however long that took. I told her that I had a medical condition (this part was actually true), for which I needed to take my medicine and couldn’t stay any longer. Thinking I was bullshitting, she tried to convince me that she knew about the condition (she obviously did not) and that I would be fine if I didn’t take my medicine. I called her bluff, and she finally said she would need to call the HR rep at the company to give the OK for me to leave. Luckily, she couldn’t get ahold of the rep, and I was allowed to leave. The HR rep called me later that day, saying I would need to take an observed drug test at 3:00pm Monday (today), which eliminated the possibility of using synthetic urine again. 

The last time I had smoked was Thursday night, which put the test 87 hours away from my last toke. I was 100% sure I was completely fucked. After scouring the internet, I found [this]( http://imgur.com/a/GmuD4) little guide on r/trees that gave me a glimmer of hope. I looked through the original thread from 7 months ago and found a guy who claimed he smoked heavily and this method worked for him every time. I sent him a PM, and as a true Ent, he responded to me right away to elaborate on his experience with it and give me some tips. Major shout out and thanks to /u/Snachmo here. No matter what happens, his reaching out to me really showed me the kind of awesome community r/trees really is. 

So here we are today. My drug test is in two hours, I’ve done all I can do to prepare for it and all that’s left is to roll the dice. I WILL edit this post after I get back from the test and tell you what happened, regardless of whether or not it’s good news or bad. Wish me luck ents, and thanks for reading. 

**TL;DR:** I royally fucked up using synthetic urine on Friday, spent the weekend following [this]( http://imgur.com/a/GmuD4) detox guide, have my observed make-up test in two hours and will report back results.

1qe7ae,2,2013-11-11,"[23/F] confused about keeping profile picture of us, but he [25/m] changed status to single in time to re-bound after a day.",madisonsites,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qe7ae/23f_confused_about_keeping_profile_picture_of_us/,"We've been in a rough patch since he took a new job at the beginning of the year (started dating June 2012). He has been too busy to do anything (and apparently not physically interested in me anymore) since and when he is around, he is easily angered and doesn't want to do anything we used to do together. We were backpacking the Grand Canyon when we started dating, now I get yelled at for asking to go on a day hike. I'm trying to remember that he isn't the person I dated when I start crying over this, but it is hard to accept that person was either a fraud to get me into the relationship or is simply gone. Told him I didn't want to go to a show 6 hours away on Thursday that he booked last minute after he was unwilling to take off for the weekend or let me stay with friends through it. He told me he bought the tickets, so I didn't get a say (I was covering gas and hotel). So, I said take someone else. I was tired of his gifts being an excuse to be a jerk. He did or went alone and I told him I hoped he took someone he would have a good time with and he could find someone that made him happy. This was over text because he never answers the phone and he is always busy working to have time together. Honestly, the text was a cry for attention to talk about our serious issues (primarily, lack of communication and work taking final priority).  He never answered. Went to the show. Unfollowed me on Instagram and Twitter, not Facebook. At some point he changed his relationship status to single. I went to LA with the friends on Friday for time away to think. I thought we would at least really talk about it. Well, I guess he managed to get away from work to go out with his previous re-bound girl since she happily checked him in on Facebook. Yet, his picture is still us and his family commented on my pictures from Disneyland asking where he was...

It really hurts that he was too busy working to spend time with me, yet all the sudden has a whole day for a rebound. Not to mention, I've been practically begging for sex most of this year, but for someone who didn't want it and swears he wasn't cheating, he was quick to go back to his re-bound girl. I've been trying so hard to do little things (I really can't afford much and have been trying to get a 4th job), but he never seemed to care or was too pre-occupied to notice or felt that his gifts meant more just because they cost more. All I wanted was his time and I told him this all the time. 

He talked me into this relationship just before I moved to an internship in China (I didn't want to do distance). I came home halfway through because he was so depressed over it and told me at one point that he should matter more than work (how ironic in hindsight). So, I came home, and moved from Memphis to California to be with him. Don't get me wrong I love California, but I also don't have an emotional support system out here like he does, so I guess that's maybe why he doesn't really care as much. This makes me extra-regret my decision to ever date him. Plus, now I guess I have ruined my chances to ever work abroad again for nothing. 

I guess that's also why this post has turned into my ""cry it out post,"" too. My apologies, but I'm feeling extra lonely post unexpected break-up than usual what with those circumstances. Any advice on moving through this with limited friends or just encouraging words would mean the world to me, too. 

Essentially, why would he keep his picture of us, but change his relationship status without us really talking through things and still not tell his family? 

TL;DR Didn't expect to break up with boyfriend, but I guess I did. I've never had my relationship status on FB, but he changed his (I guess to go on a rebound as indicated by the girl's check-in this weekend) to single. Semi source: He was dumped by his last girlfriend and was rebounding with her between the year we met and when we started dating. Still hasn't changed his profile picture a week later and clearly hasn't told his family (they have commented on my stuff from the weekend asking where he is). Interested in your theories on why. "
1qdy8t,7,2013-11-11,[PI] Chat Room Challenge - The Power of the Gods,TheWarPelican,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1qdy8t/pi_chat_room_challenge_the_power_of_the_gods/,"Haven't proof read it, need to eat. Here we go:

- - - - - - - - - -

“A-and... you’re sure it won’t hurt?”

“Mr Thompson, we can’t really be sure of anything. You are the first person to volunteer for the Consciousness Relocation Programme… we’re in uncharted waters, so to speak.”

“I know, I know… but it shouldn’t, right?”

“No, James, nothing we know of in the process should induce any sharp nerve impulses. Relax.”

Relax, heh. With restraints strapped around my wrists and feet, relaxing was easier said than done. Even with the sedatives setting in, I still feel the bite of hard leather cut into my skin. ‘For my own protection’, the doc had said, so I don’t start wriggling all over the place when my brain gets beamed into some fancy robot body. I suppose that’s fair.

Whatever second thoughts I’d been having about this whole thing, it’s better than living on the streets, right? My family gets enough cash to start over with, and I get a sweet shiney tush to flounce around in. Not a bad deal, I had to admit. Better than living on the streets. Gotta remember that.

Besides, eh, who wouldn’t want to be the first cyborg in history? Growing up watching Star Trek an’ stuff, this was the sorta thing I’d always dreamed about as a kid. Prepare to be assimilated! 

Maybe once I get my robot suit, I’ll get a bit more respect. Show them so-called ‘hard nuts’ who they were messing with, now they won’t be twice the size of me no more. Who knows, maybe I could be some sort of robot superhero! I could lift cars off injured civilians, climb mountains to help the ailing, even stop a bank robbery with my bullet-proof steel booty. Yeah, not a bad deal at all.   

Doc Martinez turns back to me, some sort of blinking gizmo clasped tightly in his hands. After some delicate fiddling an’ pushing, he slots the piece into a gap on the machine pinned to my skull. Here we go.

“We’re just about ready to begin, James. Do we have your permission to start?”

Last chance to back out now, I guess. These white shirts couldn’t go a step further without my say-so, not after those recent testing laws in the papers. I have the power! 

“Go ahead, doc. Give me my new body.”

I *will* have the power.

I hear a small beeping sound over my shoulder, to the right. Doc Martinez mutters something under his breath, and presses a dark green button on the touch-screen across the room. 

The power of a thousand gods spears through my limbs, all of my muscles jerking uncontrollably as lightning flows through them. The metallic tang of blood fills my mouth.

Everything goes black.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Doctor Martinez and his colleagues were all crowded around a clinically clean steel worktable at the centre of their lab. Breaths were held, and all eyes were focused intently on the unmoving machine laid before them. They knew how long the process should take, but an extra half a minute had gone by without the ‘Conscious Entity’ LED lighting up on the master display screen.

A single tear falling down his cheek, Martinez bowed his head and began to take notes on his clipboard. Just as the rest were beginning to turn away and start cleaning up the experiment, Gary the intern let out a gasp and pointed.

“Look, sir, the green light is flashing!”

Dropping his clipboard, Doctor Martinez all but sprinted back to the operating table, his colleagues doing likewise. The ‘Conscious Entity’ light was indeed now flashing an urgent green, and a dull industrial grumble had begun to emanate from the machinery at the centre of the table. Once again, not a breath of air was released from a set of healthy lungs. That being said, Steve the janitor was forced to let out a ragged gasp, the filthy smoker. 

Without warning, the tiny speaker attached to the newly conscious robot body began to let out a stream of gibberish.

    Aijidj100110111000101111001kaltomatoketchup10100110010pelicans?

Excited chattering, cheering and applause exploded throughout the lab, and Doctor Martinez’s solitary tear was joined with a stream of more joyous saline fluid. Eventually, the lead researcher was forced to ring a buzzer that called for silence. The experiment was not over.

“Errr, James?” the Doctor began, “Can you hear my voice? Do you recognize these words?”

    … Biscuit? No! That’s not the word… yes! Yes, doc, I can hear! Has… Has it worked?

The speech was grating and mechanical, a shredder given a voice box. Nevertheless, Doctor Martinez pressed on, a smile on his face.

“Mr Thompso- James… How… How do you feel? What is it, errr, like?”

He would reword the transcript of the experiment later, of course.

    I feel… free! There is no pounding of my heart, no constant need for breathing! And, and there’s no pain, doc,
    no pain at all! It’s amazing, and I can see, see my new bod- Oh. Hang on. Are you serious?

Doctor Martinez scratched the back of his head uncertainly. This could be awkward.

“Now, James, let’s be calm. This is a new process, and obviously concessions have to be m-”

    *ARE YOU SERIOUS?* You put my entire GODDAMN consciousness into a motherfucking *TOASTER!?!?*

“It’s a modified version, Mr Thompson, and you know very well we didn’t get proper fundin-”

    *A TOASTER?!* I mean, come *on*! The ad said very specifically that my ‘precious mind’ would be transferred
    into an ‘advanced android with mobility functions’. Last time I checked, doc, this toaster doesn’t have *legs*!
    HOW IS THIS AN 'ADVANCED' ROBOT?!

“… well, it *is* a recent model…”

    There are still crumbs in here, doc! What, I’m guessing that toastie you made me for lunch today was from
    here too, right? Right?! 

Silence.

    OH COME ON! You people are supposed to be scientists! What were you thinking of calling the report, eh?
    ‘Brilliant Scientific Minds Create Sentient Lunch-Maker’?! This is despicable! Put me back in my body, pronto.
    I had a shit life, but anything’s better than being toaster with feelings.

More silence.

    … You can put me back, right?

“… James, I don’t really know how to say this… but… eh...”

The toaster’s bread trays shot upwards, spraying the front of Doctor Martinez’s lab-coat with burnt crumbs.

    I’m genna sue.

1qdktk,2,2013-11-11,I [19M] am quite sure my best friend [19F] is in love with me. I am not in love with her.,throwaway02013-11-11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qdktk/i_19m_am_quite_sure_my_best_friend_19f_is_in_love/,"Well, or rather I am completely unsure about it.

##Nerds in a Tree: A Great Friendship
The entire situation is complicated, as these things tend to be. I am in school as a sophomore and met her in the second semester of last year, and we hit it off as great friends. We spent hours together talking late into the night. I shared my favorite movies, books, music, etc. with her, and we would go on long walks and watch the stars. Being both physics majors, we nerded out in the extreme. She was one of the few people at all I've ever met, let alone girls, who was even near where I was; a nerd's nerd, who could wax poetic about differential equations, and who I must admit I can't completely keep up with (she has one year at university on me, being a junior).

We are both virgins, and both have never been in romantic relationships before.

I had honestly never been so close to a girl before. That is not to say I haven't had very good friends, of both genders - I tend to be a bit of an odd social butterfly, as even as I tend to think of myself as the weird awkward nerdy kid (an identity I've really just grown up with) I have no problems with going up to people and having a good conversation. Lately I've been terribly depressed and withdrawn, unfortunately. As a result socially I've reversed; been keeping away from people who I would normally be very comfortable with. I'll randomly meet a friend around campus and end up in a conversation with them, but end up withdrawing and feeling too shameful to make any effort to see them again, avoiding them. My pathological reasoning is that I can pursue friendships after I am on top of my school work and such again, with internships and clubs and such under control. It has been about a month and a half and I am feeling worse than ever. I feel too ashamed to be in the presence of these people I respect and consider my ~~peers~~ superiors since they seem to have it together while I don't.

##Can I Kiss You? Actually, Nevermind.
Even though I'd never really thought of her as pretty/attractive to me, one night I asked to kiss her. She said no, and I don't regret asking. I got over it and we remained good friends. It is difficult to explain why or why not you like a person romantically, but for one she doesn't smell good to me - I'm not talking about hygiene or what lotion or perfume a person uses, just the way for example I'm comfortable with the subtle smell of my own skin. 

This was in the spring of this year. Thinking back on it now I was confused and didn't really know what I was looking for. No, I don't think she is ugly; plain maybe. Just not the one for me. She's very tomboyish, doesn't own any heels, dresses rather plainly even for important formal occasions, and actually doesn't use makeup, ever - a rarity; it seems most of my female friends do while trying to give the impression they don't. Maybe she would be more pretty in the usual college girl way if she did, but don't think it has much to do with my non-attraction to her. I didn't know what I was looking for romantically, and felt comfortable enough with her to ask. I feel I have grown since and know what I want, know how to handle asking a girl out and all in a more mature way now, though I'm at the moment too depressed to think about doing it.

This doesn't keep me from enjoying the hugs or cuddling on the couch as we watch a movie. That should probably be past tense actually, considering the whole depression thing since school started again. I'd been comfortable enough with her to experiment on her with getting myself more comfortable touching girls and people generally in social contexts, i.e. pats on the back and squeezing someone around the shoulders. She knows that I used her as a sort of guinea pig and is alright with this.

#Enough background, what happened?
About a week and half ago, while I was away from school on break, she sent me an email about how she'd been thinking about me a lot. She thanked me for helping her grow as a person over the last year, and wrote that I'd changed her conviction she would never love someone.

When we got back to school, I had dinner with her, and when I brought up the email towards the end before I had to go, she said something to the effect of regretting sending mail before thinking it through and got shy about it.

I don't what else it could mean but what I hope it doesn't. It makes a lot of things more complicated. I don't know if I can deal with the burden of being someone's interest. I don't know if I can deal with my best friend being in love with me while I don't reciprocate.

##Unequal life experience
A complicating factor on her end is that she's far worse than me on sociability. She has friends now, but told me that her first year here, before she met me, she had been more or less solitary with the exception of her roommate, and was quite depressed. When we are about and I run into an acquaintance and say hello and a few words of how-do-you-do, it is something she doesn't do; it's just not in her sphere. And she was homeschooled while I was in high school, so while I was making friends with a group that has now mostly diaspora'd around the world of higher education, she was alone without people to connect to, including her one year of high school/community college classes, when she still never met anyone to be a meaningful peer in the sense of my friends. In terms of relationships, even though we've both never been, I have plenty of experience with what could have been, with friends setting me up on dates that didn't work or girls making passes at me that I obliviously missed. There was a girl I met at summer camp who I spent so much time with that people started thinking we were a couple, and who I developed an intense crush on though she had a boyfriend at home, and who broke up with him after we returned to our respective homes but I didn't have the nerve to do anything... and so on. Basically, I don't want to be her everything; I want her to go out and know what she likes rather than having me as the only guy she's comfortable with. I almost want to tell her to go look around at the world of guys and reconsider. I don't want her to be liking me by default, as apparently the one who helped her change and consider love.

I'm afraid she doesn't really get the world of dating, even to the toes-wet extent I do. I just don't think it would be fair in a way for her to go this way with me, since I'm not sure she's capable of looking at other guys. I remember her telling me about when I first talked to her, about how somehow she didn't feel on guard with me as with others, which I suppose is good since she was comfortable with me from the start but bad because I'd rather she be able to be more comfortable with people (and guys). I mean, with the combination of homeschooled and tomboy I don't think she has much knowledge of typical girls either, or how a girl is expected to act. It's an odd situation that somehow I feel like I'm the worldly experienced one even though to most I'm still the starry-eyed kid, but I guess it shows how isolated her world (I didn't even mention the little midwest hometown yet) has been. 

And we're both still virgins again, and I don't think I want to lose it to my best friend, or take hers...maybe I've thought about a friends with benefits thing? I'm just terribly confused on everything overall.

I've been avoiding her more or less since. It's not especially noticeable in any way really since I've been avoiding basically everyone, but I don't want to make this awkward as it goes on, and I've hinted that I know what she didn't say, so being the smart one she is she's probably guessed why.

##Are we too close?
It's a difficult question, but to press myself on the question, we've been so close that it would have been a real problem if either of us had gotten into a relationship with someone else. Spending as much time with a friend, even a very good friend, and being so open with each other about everything, not to mention the cuddling and hugs, really would have been difficult to explain to an SO. I've been thinking that when I found someone we would have to back off with each other. With the withdrawal from everything it hasn't been a problem but once I'm out there again (yes, I am getting help) it probably will be. I still want to be friends, but this is scary.

##TL;DR
I think my best friend is in love with me; I don't think I am with her, and I don't want to ruin things. I'm not sure it's healthy for her since I've been such a big part of her life, I'm in a slump at the moment and don't think I can deal with it, and of course I have no idea how to handle romantic relationships at all."
1qdc1m,3,2013-11-11,Something is wrong with Wal-Mart's commercials. I believe they are being blatantly subversive and no one is calling them on it. (cross post /r/business),BuySplendidPie,walmart,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1qdc1m/something_is_wrong_with_walmarts_commercials_i/,"My issue is with their 'change over' commercials. Lots of us have seen information (http://io9.com/wine-tasting-is-bullshit-heres-why-496098276) showing that people will evaluate a wine based on its bottle and judge the taste accordingly. Wine from a cheap looking bottle tastes cheap and wine from a fancy looking bottle tastes better... even if it's the same wine. This doesn't just work on wine, it works on everything.

A few years ago Wal-Mart began a series of commercials (I believe it started with their line of premium steaks) where they would sub in their products at a business where you wouldn't think to find them. Places like an acclaimed steak house or a 'local' produce market. The idea was to see if people noticed a difference.

Except I don't think that was the idea. In these ads Wal-Mart is placing their products under a prestigious name. People walk into these tests being told they are eating a steak (for example) that is vetted for and cooked by some of the top chefs in the country. This presents an expectation and a bias the same way a fancy label on the wine bottle would. People are tasting the restaurant's/chef's reputation as much as the meat. Recently a similar ad aired with Wal-Mart produce in a faux market.

In and of itself this isn't so bad. Except that real empiric tests are available to see if a product stacks up against another. They are double blinds. This is not.

I just can't believe that no one at Wal-Mart wouldn't have figured out the logical flaw with this ad campaign. There's no way that someone like a young marketing intern wouldn't have pointed it out. That means they know and this a dishonest campaign attempting to use subtle psychology to manipulate.

I'd have more faith if I hadn't personally encountered issues with said line of premium steaks. First of all they are priced almost identically with competitors in my area. Second, keep one for a few days or let it set after you cook it and you'll see the potassium nitrate rise to the top of the flesh. My local supermarket beef doesn't do that. That's at least one difference and I hold there are others. Wal-Mart seems to be intentionally misrepresenting the quality of their goods through furtive means and so far no one has called them on it in this area. That bugs me."
1qd2w9,2,2013-11-11,Am I (22F) being unfair with my boyfriend (22M) of 4 years? Is this an indicator of the end?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qd2w9/am_i_22f_being_unfair_with_my_boyfriend_22m_of_4/,"I would appreciate all perspective and advice possible and will just write a huge wall of text both for your benefit and mine. 

I have been with my boyfriend since I was 18. We met on the first day of college. We instantly had a spark and within a few months were in a relationship. He was a relaxed guy that had much more experience in life (partying, traveling, etc) than I did and I was the career oriented girl from a lower class, small town family. 

We both dormed but in a couple years moved out together and lived off campus. He got kicked out of school after a year for a lowsy GPA and went to community college. He had a full ride in school because his mother worked there. I was attending on scholarship and was a member of the Honors Program. I am sure that you see where this is going, but I spent my college years interning, always working at least 2 jobs/ internships and attending school full time. There were times when he was not attending school or had a job. 

Basically, I am not sure if love is enough. I have a full time job that is good. Not great, but within my field and something that I am grateful to have as a first step towards my dream career. He is technically a college sophomore at community college still. Last semester his grandmother funded his community college money but because his GPA sucked again, he does not qualify for financial aid and we have to pay cash. He hasn't done an internship, etc but does work part time. 

Basically, I am a very driven person. I came from a low class family with an alcoholic father and am determined to make something of my life and live comfortably. He comes from a moderately wealthy family where his parents coddled him and filled out his college applications. I love him so much, and he is the sweetest guy in the world. We will be at home and I will say that I am craving ice cream and he's more than happy to run out and get it for no reason. But he isn't motivated. He won't clean the house without being told. He won't register for classes without being told. He has no sense of urgency. He would do ANYTHING to make me happy, but no matter the amount of arguments that we have, he just is not a free thinker. 

Yesterday we got into an argument about the college stuff and I found out that while he has been saying he is going back next semester (he took last semester off...) he didn't register for classes, check the tuition pricing or even select which classes he wanted. I had come back from my extra seasonal part time job that I got in order to pay for some unexpected bills we had received (my speeding ticket, registration fee, his school, etc) and told him how ridiculous is was that I was working so hard to pay for something that he couldn't be bothered with. So he spent a few hours researching and figuring it out, but I don't think that I should have to do that. 

I could go on and on on more examples, but at the end of the day, I just want to know if this is an example of ""love not being enough"". I love the guy and if we did break up, I would still want to help him and I know that he would always do the same for me. We are best friends and despite this scathing post, he really is a sweetheart that has driven me places dozens of times just because I didn't want to drive- including sitting in the car during job interviews for moral support. He is a great person. The absolute best. But is this divide in motivation/ priorities something that is most likely an indicator of incompatibility? It is our number one source of fighting- but it is also our ONLY source of fighting, though it is not just limited to career. It spreads all the way into laundry, cooking, etc. My senior year of college I was in school full time and had two part time jobs, while he only had a part time job. We were in credit card debt from fixing both of our cars equally (his a 2009 handmedown from his parents, mine a junker I bought myself, to paint a picture) and I was trying to pay them off,

---
TL;DR- Boyfriend is extremely unmotivated and ambition less which borders on selfish. I am career and success oriented to a fault. Is this a hiccup in our relationship or the end of it?"

1qcjy8,2,2013-11-10,[Title Here],[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qcjy8/title_here/,"So, within the past year of my life has been almost complete shit when it should have been.

I am a guy who likes guys and girls, basically it. I started dating this guy and this is my first ever relationship (I basically never wanted to, because I want to advance in a career and finish school). Everything is great - I am president of a club on campus and vice president of another. I get an internship, a boyfriend, and about to finish college.

Winter break happens, but right before I tell my family about who I am dating and they don't approve (go figure, christian, republicans, who are from a reservation). I get blackmailed into being at family functions with the fact that they won't help me pay for rent (only thing I needed - I have scholarships to pay for school and the rest was kinda basically stolen). Find out my uni says my FASFA is wrong family doesn't give me the info I need. I am in another state with them and boyfriend is in another. My aunt dies, I stay to help my single mother with not breaking down again.

I return from break, the guy I was dating said that we need to not talk / communicate with each other while he figures out if he wants to stay. I tell him I'll try, since that's what he wants. I can't return to school (thought I could). I don't have a job. I get my two weeks from my landlady. Just fucked.

I don't tell my friends everything that's going on, I hate being vulnerable with all these emotions (usually I'm the emotional strong one). I have no control of my life at this point and everything seems to spiral downward.

I did get a job and saved money and moved with my buddy up to Oregon. I love the change - I'm scared for the future.

Basically, I can't keep on complaining about this shit with friends, I feel, because it's just been the same. I just want to tell someone that my life feels really difficult right now. I haven't talked to my family, except my sister who is basically my twin. I completely cut them out and I just want to punch my ex in the face. 

You know?

1qc9qw,2,2013-11-10,"I'm insanely jealous of my boyfriend. So frustrating. Advice welcomed, please",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qc9qw/im_insanely_jealous_of_my_boyfriend_so/,"Hi guys.

So I want to be careful on how I word this because it's a really negative set of emotions I am dealing with and I am aware of that. I don't like it, I know is bad, destructive, unfair behaviour but I don't know how to control/deal with it. Please bare this in mind, because I worry I'll come across as a gigantic cunt.

Ok, so me and my bf have been dating for a year give or take. We are incredibly happy together, we get along very very well, he makes me laugh, he's sexy, funny, caring, incredibly kind, generous and all around just an amazing guy. Yep total puppy love.

There is however one thing that gets to me a lot and is a completely self-created issue which I can't seem to get shot off. In short I get very jealous of his friendships and his lifestyle.

In terms of life-style, his mother is incredibly succesful and while his whole family are not throwing money around he has a lot more funding available to him and the opportunity to do things I have dreamed of doing my whole life. In particular we are both crazy about traveling, execept he has had the opportunity to do some of my dream trips (Nepal, Svalbard) already and generally just has fantastic holidays with his family and friends that his family invites. This year his internship is paid and he gets a lot of funding on top of the money his parents give him. I'm barely making ends meet.

Secondly, he has had a great time at uni in terms of friendships. I've struggled a little. My first year was great, I had a large group of friends but they were all international students who then left. The second year we actually lived together (we weren't dating then) in a shared house with a couple of other guys. One of them I am very close to but he has reccently moved to do a masters. The other two, I am just starting to get close with but since we are all doing a year abroad I don't see them often and one of them will have graduated by the time we return. I tried really hard to meet people - societies, clubs, and I am generally a very gregarious person, super confident socially. I just really seem to struggle to translate a good afternoon or night of fun into a long term friendship, or more importantly - a close one. 

More than that, he has a wicked group of childhood friends at home (all great guys). I moved from Brazil to the UK when I was 12. I have very close friends, but they live an ocean away. Is not like I keep in regular touch and can just chill with them. I lived very far away from my high-school, like 20 miles, and didn't keep in touch with people from that town either because it was so hard to get there from my place. To make matters 'worse', me and him are doing a year abroad (in different countries). Because his job was organised by the Council, there are a lot of people his age doing the same thing in his town so he very quickly found a nice, close group of people our age to do typical college shit - go out, get drunk, etc.

My course doesn't have any system like that, I do a full blown 9-5 and organised everything myself. I don't have the access he has to other students. And I haven't met that many people my age since I arrived here. 

I should clarify, is not like I'm a billy-no-mates. I have met people, I do stuff but somehow I always end up hanging out with older people (more like 28 - 30) which is great fun but just not the same. I feel like I'm missing out on a huge part of my life, one where I can still be stupid and a little inconsequential and grow and learn from people going through the same thing as me. I really am not getting that experience and my time at University is ending soon.

I am very lucky in different ways, I've lived in many different countries, I am bilingual and can get by on another two languages, I am an execellent student, I get good grades, I have a loving family and have had some amazingly cool travels and opportunities, I'm well cultured and hugely independent and I know that. In fact, in the long run I'm sure my experience will be more useful than his.

...But that just doens't seem to placate what I seem to be lacking right now. I want what he has and man this may sound worse still but he had all of this handed to him in a plate. I've worked my butt off and tried so hard to meet people, have a best friend, whatever. Nothing, I got nothing. I have tons of things I want to do but it always comes down to money, which also is something he simply doesn't have to worry about. Being confroted by how awesome of time he's having doing all of the stuff I wish I was getting up to is hard and of course happens every time we talk - he goes out, goes to the ciname, etc with friends. Even just now he skyped to say good night and his room was invaded by his friends who all said hi, can't wait to meet me etc and were about to go to a club. It makes me so insanely jealous and at the same time it makes me feel so horrid towards him. Why can't I just be happy that he's having a sick time? I shouldn't and don't want to harvest this negativity towards him but I don't know what to do anymore.

Please help, I can't keep having these feelings, they're eating me from the inside out. It's horrible and I never ever had this kind of emotion before. At least not to this extent.

**tl;dr:** Life has dealt my boyfriend the most awesome hand and realising that in comparison to my life sucks and gets to me."

I had a Compaq Presario for the longest time, then I bought an ASUS U56E so I could play more than flash games and use it for internships and such. Now I want more.

**-What will you be doing with this PC?**
Playing visually nice games on as high of settings as they can go. I can barely run Lego Marvel Heroes on low right now, let alone Battlefield 3.

**What is your maximum preferred budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?**
$800

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC?**
I'm thinking of waiting until Cyber-Monday, but it seems like it would be hard to predict deals - plus I wouldn't know what was a good one.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget?**
Monitor, keyboard (noting too fancy), and maybe a wifi adaptor

**Location, Overclocking, Reusing Parts, O/S**
In the Us, no, no, and no.

**Do you have any specific case/tower preferences such as a window or LEDs, or do you have a preference for low-noise components?** 
I've never been a stickler for looks. In fact, I'd rather it not look worth getting stolen. It can look like a community computer at a homeless shelter as long as it runs well.

**Specific features**
A USB port, and MAYBE a CD port. I'm in music business so I might need it, especially since I still buy physical product."

1qhbsd,3,2013-11-12,I've been holding this in for a while.. Not sure what to do/where to go,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qhbsd/ive_been_holding_this_in_for_a_while_not_sure/,"I guess I should start by saying that I graduated from a small, liberal arts college in May 2012. Since then, I have been working for my father (he owns a small chemical company) and have had a good experience working for him.

For the past 8 months I have been living in a two bedroom apartment with one of my best friends. And it seems that ever since then my life has been sliding downward. I had the intentions of going to law school which I now believe to be out of an undefined urge to please my father. After working for a year and a half now I have decided to chase a dream that I've had for some time now. I have always wanted to write/direct films. Unfortunately I have no experience in the field whatsoever. I have studied film on my own for the past 6 months as well as trying to educate myself in any way possible for a transition into that field. Recently, I finally decided to ""man up"" and plan a move to Nashville in order to seek out an internship or job in this field. Big step I know...but I feel like if I don't chase it then I am turning my back on something that makes me happy.

My family and friends know about my move (planned for early February) and have all had positive reactions while being very supportive. You would think that a guy getting a chance to chase his dream would be happy...this is not the case. In the past 8 months, I have been miserable. I usually spend my time at work alone in my lab, I barely see any of my friends anymore, I have lost all motivation to do the things I love (working out, writing, hiking, studying film, etc.), I always feel like I've gotten no sleep after a full night of sleep, every morning I search for ""excuses"" so I can call in sick to work, sometimes I do stay home from work but all I do sit around and hate myself for not being productive, and most of all I have repeatedly ditched on family which is something I never have done before. And the only reason I can come up with for this behavior is  ""just because...""

I called to make an appointment for a counseling session yesterday. I don't know what to do...I feel like my life is a television screen being flipped over and over...everything is a blur...my mind feels so foggy and desolate. 

What do I do?"
1qhazk,17,2013-11-12,[Rant] Stop sending me job offers!,Gunnhildr,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qhazk/rant_stop_sending_me_job_offers/,"I get it. You want me to get a job. A *real* job. One where I have a boss and an office one hour away. Because being a freelancer is not a real job, right? Especially since I earn so little!

Because my decision to continue working as freelancer obviously doesn't appeal you, despite the fact that I have managed to earn more than the minimum salary these past months *and* I keep *your* house in order everyday and I still help you pay the bills and groceries!

Everyday I get more than twenty emails from career websites on my inbox. I have a RSS feed folder connected to major freelancing websites so I can apply to new offers in less than 30 minutes after they're posted to get some advantage over the competition.

But clearly I'm not working hard enough to find a job because you always have to rub on my face and send me more job offers via facebook and email! I have already told you numerous times, but you don't listen! And on top of that, most job offers you send me have already expired or they're from different fields!

You even had the guts of going into my bedroom while I was very sick about two months after the end of the internship, and cry about how I had to get a job, force me to apply for expired job offers and claim that if I couldn't find something from my field, I should work at the supermarket! How about a ""Rest for as long it's necessary, you can worry about those things later"", *mother*?!

You know there's another reason why I want to go freelancing, right? I'm not fit for a corporate environment. During my internship I had major stress crisis, I had swollen lips every week due to stress, I suffered a burn out crisis as well. I miss my old coworkers, I miss working with others, but I don't miss the environment. But do you care? No, you just want me to bring a salary, convince me to not move away, and drain my bank account! If I complain about a job or a client, all you do is say ""But you must do it for the money."" and ""the client is more important"". HOW ABOUT MY SANITY, YOU FUCKING BITCH?! How about telling me ""Yeah, that is not good"" or ""It's okay to ditch a bad client.""?! 

Why must be everyone else right but me?!

Want me to make as much money as one of those successful folks you're always bragging about? That's easy: I'll stop taking care of the fucking house and I'll have more time and sanity for freelancing! Even better: I could stop taking care of the goddamned bills and finally raise enough money to move away!

*deep breath*

Sorry for the long rant, folks. I'm kind of recovering from another depression episode after realizing that I'm alone. I should go out and get some drinks with friend- Oh wait, I live in the middle of nowhere and my friends live too far away.

My soul for my own house in another country. My soul for a goddamned hug. I'm tired."
1qhaut,10,2013-11-12,OSU's CSE or Purdue's CS?,hilalh,OSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1qhaut/osus_cse_or_purdues_cs/,"Hi everyone,
I was admitted to both programs as an International Transfer Student from California (I'm originally from Israel).

So far I've learned that OSU has a very strong spirit and the moral of students is very high whether it's in sports or academics, the students always love to represent the school.  For me it is very important and there's no doubt that Columbus has so much more to offer as a city than West Lafayette, however, what I am more concerned about is the academics, specifically class sizes and interaction with professors.

*  I have learning disabilities and it is impossible for me to study in a class that has more than 50 students in it, I know that OSU is a big school but how large are CS classes?

*  I've tried to search for an input about the CSE program at OSU but I couldn't find any opinion about, except for the explanatory video about the CSE on YouTube. Does the program have any specialties? I'm mainly interested in Entrepreneurship (Startups), Big Data and Networking. 
How does the program stack up against Purdue? (If anyone has any family member / friend attending the program)

*  I want to conduct research as an undergraduate in the latter two(Big Data and Networking), are there any research opportunities available for undergrads?

*  I would like to also attend a school that has a live entrepreneurship and startup scene, with Hackathons, Startup weekends, recruiters and ventures. Does these type of stuff exist in OSU? how do they stack up next to the big players such as Pennstate, UT Austin and UIUC?

*  Does the department of Computer Science have any strong relationship with Bay Area companies for summer internships? Who are the main recruiters in the Computer Science area?

*  When I looked at StudentReview.com I've noticed that many people mention that most of the transfer students get admitted because of their athletic achievements or through a transfer contract, and in most cases these are unqualified candidates for transfer. Are these student also admitted into the College of Engineering? I'm looking for highly intellectual environment can and Purdue students are often stigmatized as nerds, or bright, which is very aspiring. Can the same environment be found in OSU's CoE and specifically CSE?

Thanks Buckeyes :)

1qh5aj,1,2013-11-12,My future potential lays in front of me but I feel crushed by the weight of my past. I don't know what to do.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qh5aj/my_future_potential_lays_in_front_of_me_but_i/,"Over the last year I felt like I finally escaped hell, escaped the family that had only brought me sorrow. My father is a war vet, nearly 30 years of active duty; it has destroyed my family. My father, the man who once was my hero, has turned into a alcoholic zombie who is dead in the eyes. His depression, PTSD, and anxiety among other debilitating conditions were only prolonged by the military who pumped him full of meds because he was ""mission critical"". Over the high school years of my life I had to watch my family fall apart and tried to stay strong. I'm 19, and for the last 8 years of my life I had to be the adult in our family sacrificing everything to try to make the only family I'd ever had work. See in the military you end up moving all over and I have spent most of my life overseas, or shuffled around every 2-4 years.

I thought I had escaped it when I went to college, I really did. Of course it was hard at first getting use to it all but soon I had found an amazing internship and things were looking up. I quickly found myself surrounded by some of the best and brightest minds in the State all toward the goal of running my own business from the ground up and learn every associated skill. When summer hit it was time to go home to manage my business, I thought it would be easy, it wasn't. My family was worse then ever and the fighting ensued. Eventually I had enough and after my brother who has terrible grades and had never worked a day in his life was rewarded with a 40 thousand dollar car no one could afford I was at wits end. Screaming led to my brother and mother (father living alone) pushing my around my brother even throwing a lamp at me. I ran toward him and pushed onto the bed, he flipped over it and called the police.  (This isn't the first time he's tried to do it, or threatened to do this. I fear he is broken too and has become sociopathic)The family I thought I escaped pulled me back in and as soon as I could tried to push me under once again. It ended up getting SOC'd, but could still ruin my life. Its a torment of emotions. All I've ever wanted was to be successful and escape but you know the old quote ""misery loves company"". I ended up moving in with my father (yes the medically ill alcoholic). Well I did it, ended up being number one in my division and 5th internationally for a 60 million dollar company. It was the most challenging summer of my life following the most challenging years of my life. After sloping through depression, suicidal thoughts, and emotional torment I felt I had once again escaped. 

This year the company I work for, impressed with my efforts and ability promoted me. At 19 I am a District Manager for our companies first international branch. HELL YES! But no. I feel as if my world is falling in on me. I can't love, I can't trust, I can't feel. I drown my sorrows in cannabis, cigarettes, and alcohol trying to feel better.

People think I'm an asshole, that I don't care, that I'm purely self-involved. I just can't share why I feel so broken, there is no one to talk to and no one who knows. The only people I had in my life are gone and I know its for the better. 

What I have been working toward my entire life, the reason I have been overcoming for so long, was right in front of me. I simply feel to frail to reach out and grab it.

Do I continue on and do 50% of what I'm capable of chipping away at  who I am day by day? Or do I stop to pick up the pieces and turn down such an opportunity?

I don't know what do to. 


Sorry for any typos, grammatical errors, or slight idiosyncrasies it was very hard to type this and I can't bring myself to read it.

Thank you. 

Even worse is there is so much more to the story, so much more to say. I can't describe 8 years of pain through such a short medium. "
1qglx3,11,2013-11-12,I hope I never have someone this bad again.,[deleted],badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1qglx3/i_hope_i_never_have_someone_this_bad_again/,"In December of senior year of high school, I was accepted early decision to my first choice. Its a small College with 2000 students. A few days after I was accepted, I was added to the school's facebook group. This one kid who I'll call BR (for bad roommate) kept posting. It started with stuff like ""Congrats everyone on getting in! Can't wait to meet you guys!"" to it being his own personal twitter. A few of the posts were school related, like him saying that he bought some of the school appeal. Most, however, were completely unrelated. He was also that kid who would friend EVERY person in the group. So pretty benign stuff. Now here is where it starts to get a little weird.
He would send girls fb messages. He hadn't met them yet but it would be kind of friendly. One of my friends who I'll call J really liked back to the future. He was talking to her about her interests and when she said back to the future, he said he liked it too. On the first day of orientation, he found her and gave her a present: the Back to the Future box set, at least $60. He would also ask girls to video chat and when they would politely decline and make up an excuse as to not hurt his feelings, he would push and push until the girl would just stop responding. Also, if a girl accepted his request and she had her phone number on fb, he would start texting her. For example, in the morning, he would send a mass text to everyone saying ""good morning :p"". Keep in mind it is now the summer. We still have not even got to campus yet. 
Also during the summer, there was a regional gathering. Mine was in NYC as I am from NY. I met him, the famous BR and he kept talking to me and didn't stop. I couldn't even meet anyone else! When I was leaving, I said to myself ""well I'm definitely not hanging out with THAT kid at school."" So safe to say he had a very bad reputation. Lucky for him, one of the girls accepted to the school was homeschooled and was not that great on social skills. She thought he was just being really nice and they ended up dating. They still had not met face to face. 
In July, I got my rooming info. I was in a room with my now close friend, E, and BR. I still remember the shiver I had down my spine when I read it. But I thought ""whats the worst that could happen"". Fast forward about 2 months and I arrive on campus. I, like everyone else, was nervous and I met a bunch of people. Our room was set up as such when I arrived: a large room with a bed and 2 desks and 2 dressers and 2 wardrobes in one room, 2 beds, 1 dresser, 1 desk, 1 wardrobe in the other. I took advantage of being there first and claimed the single bed. Kinda threw E under the bus making him stay with BR but I was acting with my dick and used it as a hook up pad for about 2 months. (I ended up hooking up with this one girl and we dated and it ended horribly  with her cheating. Moral: don't date someone you don't know and hook up with one night) During my relationship, we changed our room. We put all 3 beds in 1 room with 1 desk and 1 dresser. Everything else was in the first room with a futon. We had a TV too. Before we changed everything, I would constantly find BR with his girl snuggling on my bed and waching tv. I was annoyed because I asked him not to but I knew it was my own fault bc my bed was where the TV was.
Now it started to get bad. E and I still hadn't bonded yet and he didn't have the highest opinion of me because of how much I was hooking up. I still trusted the 2 of them not to take my stuff. Then my alcohol went missing. First a can or 2 of beer, then entire handles. I was the only one with a fake ID and I would ask if they would want anything from the store when I went. E sometimes had a request, BR didn't. Anyway, I suspected BR and I put all my alcohol in my trunk and locked it with a combo lock. I told all my friends the combo and I said they could help themselves bc they are my friends and they would always pay me back. One night I was out with some friends and came back. Another friend didn't head out that night and said ""Hey kamakawiwo, BR came by and asked for the combo to your alcohol. Don't worry, I didn't give it to him"". I sat with him and played video games for an hour or so and then I got a text from BR's girlfriend saying ""OMG KAMAKAWIWO WE NEED BOOZE NOW!"" I told BR it wasn't cool that he was taking my alcohol but he kept doing it so I ended up storing all of it in my other friend's room. 
BR was always sex-iling us, saying we couldn't come in bc he was doing it. Sometimes it go in the way bc I would go shower and on my way back, the door would be locked. I would sex-ile them too but I would make sure it was ok and also that it would be on a weekend night when they were both out and I would make sure we were done when the got back. Then in mid-october, I had a bad GI flareup. I couldn't eat without being in pain or doing anything. I resorted to chicken brot and yogurt for a few days hoping it would clear up. It didn't. I told BR I was going to the doctor and when I get back in an hour, I just wanted to sleep. I hadn't eaten for 2 days and I was feeling horrible. 5 minutes before I get back, literally 55 minutes after I left, I got a text saying ""don't come in"". My friend let me sleep in his bed for a few hours.
When BR and his girl split up in November (she realized he was a creep, esp. after he made a sex tape of them without telling her) and he didn't leave the room. He didn't shower, he ate junkfood he stored up, and this went on for about a week. 
 
Now, if you've read this far, you're probably wondering why I didn't change rooms or report him. Well, the only time you can change is in between semesters. E and I were just starting to get close and at the end of the year I asked him why he didn't leave and it was the same reason I didn't: we both respected each other and didn't want to leave them alone with BR, but we could never find a time to talk about it bc BR would never leave and we didn't see each other around campus bc we weren't really friends yet. You're also probably wondering why E and I never reached out to him. Well we tried to. Except he was very obnoxious to us. He would say things like ""no thanks. Your friends are boring"" or ""I don't want to go out and be a stupid drunk like you guys."" So we did try.
 
But anyway, after this he broke up with his girl, he turned to the internet. Making profiles on OkCupid and other free sites. He would also never leave our room except to eat, go to the bathroom, or to go to class. A lot of the time, he would just eat ramen and wouldn't cook it. Just eat the brick of noodles. His crumbs got everywhere and he refused to clean them. I would vacuum once a week so I took care of it. No biggie. 
 
Then came my birthday in February. My friends wanted to throw me a big party. It ended up being in my room because our common area was the biggest place we had to party. I didn't care and they even set everything up. E, unfortunately was gone for a swim meet (he was on the swim team) and BR was there because it was his room too. He seemed happy to finally be part of a party. I had not hooked up with anyone since I broke up with that girl because I was already over the hook up culture and I was also sleeping in the same room as the other 2 guys and I respected their space. But tonight was my birthday and there was a cute girl checking me out. Seeing how E wasn't there, I didn't mind sex-iling BR. He didn't have anywhere to go and a bro of mine said that he could sleep on his futon in his room. It was very nice of him and I had a very nice time. 

The next month or so continued as before. He would never leave, eat ramen, and stink up our room. E and I were getting closer, mostly due to how awful BR was. About a month after my birthday, I was over the girl who hurt me and I asked this girl on a date. She said yes and I asked E and BR if I could get the room for about 2 hours starting at 9 and ending at 11 so that she and I could watch a movie. They both said yes. At 10, I was making out with the girl and BR just comes in. We stop kissing and he just comes in and sits down next to us and watches the movie (Ocean's 11 with us) and constantly commenting on it. When she left, I asked him why he came back and he said ""well I was in the library doing work but I got bored so I came here"". 

2 weeks later, he payed for his girlfriend from OkCupid to visit. E was gone for a swim meet and he asked me if I could ""sleep somewhere for the weekend"". I was pissed but respected him wanting to get it in, hoping that he would clean up and make the room stop smelling and that maybe, if he was depressed, getting it in would help. My friend who had a single was going home for the weekend and she said that I could use her room as long as I use my own sheets. it was very nice of her and I had a bed to sleep in. Still annoying that he expected me to leave for the weekend after he just walked in on me and a girl. When I met this girl, she was as disgusting as him. He didn't clean at all and they finished 2 tubs of those cheese puffs from walmart. Like the 10 gallon sized tubs. Gross.

In April, when it started to get warm, E and I and a few friends enjoyed playing pickup ultimate frisbee. We asked BR if he ever wanted to play and he constantly said no saying that we were ""typical college students"" and that ""excersing was stupid"". I know frisbee is a typical college thing but he was just sitting around playing video games and skyping with his internet girl. When we would get back, he would make passive comments about how we smelled like sweat in the 10 minutes between getting back and showering. 

The spring heat gave us an excuse to open the window. He took advantage of this by putting his speakers out of his window (our room faced the campus quad) and blasting death metal. Both E and I were very embarrased and when we asked him to keep the sound in the room and he responded by saying ""Ugh you guys won't let me express myself. You're like music nazis"" and kept doing it. 

Finally, the end of the year came and we were packing up to leave. E and I made plans to hang out over the summer and we both left. BR was the last one in the room and we asked him to be careful when taking down his posters as the duct tape he used might take the paint off. He said ""okay sure"" and we left. Room damage is divided by the amount of people in the room so we didn't want to pay anything. A few months later, I got an email from the school saying I hadn't yet paid for room damage. I was confused and went to the school website to see how much I owed. We each owed $75 and under description it says ""had to scrape old paint off and repaint room due to missing spots of paint and duct tape marks"". Apparently he destroyed the walls so much that they couldn't just paint over the spots. I thought about sending him an email asking him to cover both my and E's share as it was obviously his fault but I thought I would get nowhere and it wasn't worth the trouble. I later found out E did ask him and got the response ""wasn't me. It was you guys"". There was no way to prove he was lying. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I know its not as bad as some of the other stories here but it was pretty terrible to live with BR. As for what's happening now, E and I are still good friends. He has taken a year off to do multiple internships as he does not know what he wants to major in and he wants to test all the waters. I am currently doing my semester abroad. Last year I was roommates with my best friend and it was a lot better. 

As for BR, he got a single last year and this year. He has 1 friend who is very socially awkward and has a hard time making friends. I try to reach out to him but he is so shy that when I try to take him out, as soon as I look away, he leaves and goes back to his room. I also found out that BR met another girl on the internet who was selling herself. Her parents kicked her out because she didn't want to go to college and she lost her job working at some clothing store. He paid for a bus ticket for her to visit, gave her $500 for the weekend, and locked her in his room, basically making her a sex slave. From what I heard, he didn't even take her to the dining hall. He just brought back a sandwich or a piece of pizza for her to eat. 

And thats my bad roommate story!"
1qgjj0,9,2013-11-12,I hate both of my parents.,garbagebagholder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qgjj0/i_hate_both_of_my_parents/,"As a 22 year old young man, this may seem a bit childish to hold a grudge like this for so long but whatever. Here goes.   
  
Two and a half years ago my parents got divorced. My father had taken a job across the country despite my mother and two sisters and I wanting him to take a job in the area (trust me, there were offers).  
  
He didn't, packed up and moved out cross-country.  
  
At this point one of my mom's friend's brothers was in town and my mom and this guy met and became friends. He got introduced to my sister and I and we decided we liked the guy. But then he and my mom started getting a bit too close. I should have said something but I figured my mom knew better. Or so I thought.  
  
One day I get home from work and see them cuddled up on the couch under a blanket and don't say a word, I just go to my room. Within the month my mother is serving my father with divorce papers. Within two months, her and my little sister have moved to another state with this guy.   
  
As a college student without a degree, I didn't want to move across state lines so I remained in the state to continue my education. So far I've been making it OK, but that's not for today's post.  
  
I found out after a while that yes, my mother and this guy are now in a relationship and I can't say anything about it because she thinks I'm ""on her side"" in this divorce, but I hate them both for what they did. My mom left my dad for another man, and I don't know if you've heard the saying but it definitely applies here: ""If they'll cheat WITH you, they'll cheat ON you."" So they guy leaves my mom and now my mom is stuck with the guilt of being the one to divorce my dad, cheat on him, move in with the guy IN ANOTHER STATE, and then get left by the guy. 
  
My dad may not be the greatest person in the world, and more often than not he'll do something without REALLY thinking about the long-term or how much people value the short-term in decision making (yes, him taking the job cross-country was a much higher pay but my family couldn't see that and so they freaked out on him). Yes, my mom was absolutely right to think that my dad shouldn't have taken a job cross-country after 23 years in the USAF constantly being deployed and away from home. We got tired of him being gone and tired of moving, so we were done.  
  
Fast forward a year and a half after they all move to Sept (2012) and I find out that not only is my dad seeing somebody (not angry about at all, he;s a big boy and can move on) he is also marrying this person and my sisters and I have never met this woman or her four kids. So now I have a stepmother and four step siblings - all of whom are younger than I am - and I don't even know what they look like, much less their names. To top it all off, because of the way their marriage ended, she has nothing but a negative view of me, my two sisters and my mother and so every other week or so we have to deal with her blasting an email at us calling us babies, thieves, children, lazy, ungrateful, blah blah blah. The list goes on. 
  
So in short, I have a dad who 'left' his family for money and caused my mother to cheat on him, divorce him, move in with the guy, get left by the guy, and is now stuck in KANSAS of all states because she is too proud to admit she got screwed over and that she screwed up; my dad got re-married very quickly to someone I've never met; and the two of them constantly bicker and fight over money and relationships and the family and it's so frustrating being someone who's so far removed from everyone (literally and metaphorically) to still be sucked into this.  
  
I have a life now where I live. I'm about to finish school within the next few years, I've been working a full-time job for two years, I have several interviews set up for another job and internships, I have an amazing girlfriend who I love with all my heart, and all I want is to be able to let this all go and just leave all the bullshit behind.  

Side note, my older sister is getting married in one month so I'm super excited for her!"

1qgisa,71,2013-11-12,I read the conversation between my 2 mentors about my internship,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1qgisa/i_read_the_conversation_between_my_2_mentors/,"They gave me a task that required me to check in on a supplier's website. They would rather not give their login details for me to log in on my laptop so my mentor let me on her computer for it. As I was searching for the invoices she left the room to talk to the colleagues for a while.

I noticed that her Outlook was still logged in and curiosity got the best of me. I opened it, saw an email with my name and I opened it. It wasn't overly negative as I've only been there for 2 weeks but reading it kind of explained why the environment felt 'forced'. 

I don't know what the repercussion would be if I were to confess it to her because it's kind of eating me from the inside that I got a hold of said information, and it will definitely change my view of my internship."

Long, long text.",Paranoid_War_Pig,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qg4db/i_have_to_get_some_things_off_my_chest_regarding/,"About a year and a half ago, I graduated from high school and was expected to pick a college to enroll in. Long story short, I decided I wanted to be an elementary teacher. I can sometimes seem kind of hostile and cold (I've had a difficult couple of years prior, and it seeped into my behavior) but I really enjoy helping people out, explaining things, and kids are great. They are. It was an idealistic thing more than anything: I wanted to be a fun teacher, who would teach cool and interesting things, and really motivate and aid. I picked a college closest to home (~30 minute on public transport) and went to the introduction days (a camping trip with all the new students) enthused and motivated.

It was terrible.

I don't know what it was, really. The other students were so distant. At some point, the camp organisation scheduled a night out: club, dancing, all that. I'm not a big fan of stuff like that, but I thought I'd at least see a more relaxed, fun side of these generally morose people. About an hour in, I started hallucinating. I'd had one beer, but it was clear something was wrong with it. I remember nearly passing out, staring into a bathroom mirror and having it move towards me, colors being overly vivid and invasive, and people yelling hostile things into my ear. I went outside and waited the night out. After a few hours, the group went back. I got into my tent (I'd forgotten to bring a mattress, so I had to put my clothes under my sleeping bag, which was horrible to sleep on) and felt genuinely miserable. A day later I went back home, smiled and nodded when people asked if I enjoyed myself, and just felt silently shit about everything.

Thankfully, when classes started, things got better. My classmates finally opened up a bit more, got nicer. Teachers were very friendly to me, and the material was a breeze. Then internship came around. For our first year, we were required to go to an elementary somewhere in the country and put what we learned into practice. Due to the first semester being so short, that was basically nothing, and we were told just that. ""Relax, it's just a test run. You won't have to know everything"". My motivation was still there at this point. I met with a teacher at the school I was going to be an intern teacher at. She was very nice to me, even if I felt out of place already (5 female teachers, and then there was me) but okay, the school was nice, and the group was awesome. Really bright, fond of learning and energetic as hell. Lots of in-group friendships, so there was a really friendly atmosphere. I really looked forward to teaching. I prepared a class, did my best to finish it on time (lots of paperwork, everything you did had to be documented and explained) and got in front of the classroom. I did okay, I thought. After the last bell, the teacher called me over, and told me how she thought it went. She was almost in a state of disbelief how badly it did, in her words. I made stupid mistakes and didn't teach properly, and I should have done this and that more. First time in front of a class, mind you. And after every time I wrote down exactly what I should have been doing, what went wrong, and put my everything into ensuring I didn't make the same mistakes twice. The nerves ramped up, I had to work more and more, stay after school to grade tests (which was not a problem, I liked doing that, but it meant I was home late due to a long bus ride home)   and eventually I couldn't get work done on time (I got up at 4 in the morning for a week to finish things, but I still couldn't do it) so another teacher there had to take one thing over for me. After a few weeks, I got my rating. It was a 'poor'. I'd worked so hard, and then that. And when I returned to college when classes resumed, it turned out that I was the only one who did. Everyone else did well. Most of them had gotten the highest rating.

The insecurity and disappointment seeped into my school work. It became difficult to get up in the morning. I was deeply miserable. I felt like I didn't belong there more and more. I took long walks when I had time, to get away from people. I didn't want to go near college or any elementary again. But I had to. I had to do another internship. And it went just as poorly. I'd never gotten along with the teachers at the school, even though I was polite, offered to help them with things, got coffee for them, etc. What I eventually just got from them were uneasy grins. They wanted me to go. So I did. I dropped out, and still have bad feelings about that time in my life.

And that's what I wanted to get off my chest."

He said they had some serious blocks on it and it was difficult to even go to news websites, let alone stream videos.

That being said, I've gotten loads of requests within the past few months, some as recent as even this evening. Unfortunately, due to university, a work-intensive internship I'm starting soon, work, and my girlfriend/friends, I haven't had time for mat creation at all (or even to play the game, for that matter..)

I foresee myself possibly having more free time this summer, but that is still a big *if.*

NOW, here's where all you other creative-types come in.

PLEASE post below a quick summary of what you do, how much you charge, how those interested can contact you, and some examples of your work, so that way those interested in receiving custom mat designs can have some options to choose from.

Again, I apologize if I haven't responded to your PM or comment regarding mat designs, but I've gotten a lot of requests that I honestly just don't have the time to invest in.

It went into a long distance relationship right away since I was in college. It’s was a long distance relationship for about 1.5 years but I would visit her every weekend or every other weekend. I recently graduated and I spend about less than half a year back in my hometown with her.


She was amazing I loved her so much and she loved me. She lived with her parents that were holding her down and ruining her life. They would steal her money or opening accounts in her name and not paying the bills. So she always dreamed about me getting a job in my major and move somewhere so she could get out of her parents. She talked about getting living together and getting married and all that stuff but in normal conversation fooling around.


The problem was that I wasn't lucky on finding a job or an internship in my major. Also if I got an internship I would have to spend another half a year away from her again. I was upset I didn't get a job but also glad I didn't have to be away from her again. Since I didn't get a job, I took advantage of all that free time and make up for the first 1.5 years I spent away from her. So about 5 months went by like this.


But, I lost focus of the big picture of the future she wanted and didn't look for a part time job just to have some cash flow. She broke the bad news saying that she was unhappy and wanted her space. Also said I needed to get my life together since I have no job and was doing nothing. She says that I didn't care about her future and didn't want what the same future (house/marriage/kids), which I did want so badly. So I thought this was a threat because she doesn't have serious talks with me, which I will get to later. I started to get my life together and work on me thinking she just wanted her space for a day or two. She just kept pushing me away the harder and harder I tried for her to see me or hang out again. Then I realized how serious she was.


The thing is she never likes talking about serious things in private. She never sits me down and asks me what’s what. She likes jokingly talking about serious stuff like that. But, we only have serious conversations if I bring them up. I don't really like talking about serious stuff in pubic when she jokes about it. Because of this she’s scared to start those conversations with me thinking I don't like talking about it in general. She never brought it up, that she had a problem I didn't have a job or that she was unhappy, I honestly had no idea. She never sat me down in private to talk about our life plans. It was a shock. I knew we had communication problems but to end it because she scared of communication?


Now I have a part time job and told her I wanted everything she wanted. I promised her I wanted it all. To move in together, to get married and to have kids. That is everything she wanted with me so badly. She said I ruined her plans she had with me. I told her it was communication problems and we can fix it. I'm getting my life together so I can help her get out of her situation.


She’s not having any of it. She doesn't want to talk to me. She says she doesn't love me anymore. She doesn't care I'm getting my life together. She wants us to move on. I keep trying to prove myself but it wont work and I can't get her back. I just don't understand how she can go from wanting it all with me then to absolutely nothing. I understand half of it is my fault but I'm just confused why she doesn't want to fix her half. I struggle not to text her and she gets mad when I do. I just refuse to let her go, because going from thinking she was the one and imaging marriage and kids with her. Suddenly she ended and she didn't bring it up once she was unhappy but she seemed normal. I'm always a smiling upbeat person and you never see me get upset or angry, but I never been so sad and upset in my life.


I just need help of how to get over this, I just can't get my closure. I feel like she’s not telling me everything. Is it my entire fault and I don't know it? I just don't know. Should i give up? I love her so much and never cared more about anyone else in my life. Any help or opinions?


Sorry my grammar, I was never great at writing.

---

tl;dr: My GF wanted it all, from moving in together to kids then to suddenly end it with no warning and scared to talk to me. I ruined her plans and tried to fix it but she doesn't care."
1qf8he,8,2013-11-11,Tapering too fast? Hurting badly and scared.,PleaseHelpMeThruThis,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qf8he/tapering_too_fast_hurting_badly_and_scared/,"I have been lurking here for a while.  I was drinking Scotch, usually just in the evenings, between 3 and 10 shots a night for the past couple of years.  Sometimes less when my gf comes over on the weekends, but when she wasn't here, I would sometimes binge terribly, drinking the whole weekend, pulling back on Monday, and sobering up by Tuesday or Wednesday.

Last month I was doing great, drinking only in the evening, and tapered down to 0 shots.  I was free!  I went about a week without a single drink, and then had one with friends.

A week later, I was drinking every night again.

Last weekend, I binged again, worse than I ever have.  I knew it was bad, but Wed night I only had 6, and Thursday I went to work, and that night cut back to 4.  Friday, after work by 3 or 4PM I knew I was in trouble.

I never had any withdrawal in the past, and now I can't escape it.

Saturday morning I woke up shaking and finally told my gf what I've been hiding, what I have been too afraid to tell her, and we found the http://hamsnetwork.org/taper/ link and started on that.

Saturday I had 6 beers starting in the AM, with only 1 small window of feeling ""okay"".

Sunday I only had 2 beers (1 in the AM, 1 in the PM), and felt a little better for part of the day.  I was really stressed about driving to work Monday, so I'm guessing I cut back too fast?

Today I had 1/2 a beer at 6AM, she took me to work, and I was already hurting by 9.  Did I try to taper too fast?

The first 2 days it was in my chest, that horrible anxiety and tightness.  Today, it seems like it's mostly in my stomach and guts, which has me even more scared.

Has anyone else been through a similar situation?

Please let me know, and thank you.

Edit: i just want to get through this so I will never have to drink again.  I have wasted so much of my life!

Followup Edit:  I just wanted to thank everyone (again) for their responses.  I saw my doctor that Wednesday and got some blood work and a UA.  He gave me clonodine for my BP and told me to come back in 3 weeks.  I had my last drink that night (today is day 15!).  He told me to take the meds for about 10 days, but intern's syndrome made me worry that the withdrawal from those would be just as bad, so I have only taken one.

I still have the occasional panic attack (or is it anxiety attack), but I have no desire to drink, and am on my way to a healthy new life!"

We have proposed in REDACTED_CITY_NAME a way to define curves and surfaces with a control of the topological properties. The goal of this project is to fit these kind of curves and surfaces in a cloud of points.

These problems have a high space and time complexity and as such requires that we work on approximate stochastic solutions in parameter spaces of a usually high number of dimension.

One solution that could be used here would be to work through two successive parameter spaces, which would permit to linearize the problem and thus use an algorithm developped by a PhD student in another context of work.

""Ana is at Wake Med in North Carolina recovering from a serious car injury. Her leg has been amputated as a result of the crash in which a man without a license hit her and then fled the scene. She will be in and out of surgery for the next few days. When she wakes up she will endure a life changing moment. Losing a limb is never an easy obstacle to overcome for anyone and with the healthcare changes currently being revamped there is no telling how much this could affect her recovery. Ana is a recent graduate from Full Sail University with a very unique talent. Although, given that Full Sail is a very expensive school to go to she will be having many financial issues with medical bills and college loans. I as well as all her friends and family are wishing for a full recovery and hopeful future using her talented skills with as little complications as possible. 

If you would ever meet Ana the first thing that would come to mind is how talented of an artist she is both traditionally and in the Computer Graphics world. Being a Computer Graphics artist was her dream and nothing was stopping her from reaching the top. Right out of school she received an internship with Insomniac Games, one of the leading gaming companies in the United States. She was onto bigger and better journeys when she was struck by this tragic accident.

I ask that if you cannot donate for this cause, to please just send prayers to this young girl for a full recovery and bright future. Please share this page to all your friends and hope for the best in this mournful time.

Thank you for your time and compassion for this tragic event."""

(TL;DR - I realize this is a bit of a long post. In general, I'm looking for advice on how to get my first job in ID)

Right now it seems the ol' ""must have experience to get experience"" paradox seems to apply. I think I have a growing skill set and a lot to offer, but I'm not sure how to land my first job or internship. Any ideas?

What I don't totally get right now is how to enter into the field. I'm a former K-12 educator who realized a little late that he'd be most useful/happy working in instructional design or development to help adult learners and educators. I've been trying to hit the ground running ever since - contacting people in the field, growing my network, building my portfolio online. I left my teaching position last summer and have been prepping for my move into ID for about 6 months.

With my background, I'm likely a good fit for a position in higher ed, but I'm very open to venturing out into a corporate setting.

Here's where I'm at:

-BA English, BA Spanish, Master's Secondary Ed, and currently pursuing Master's Educational Technology (2015) with focus on andragogy and online instruction

-Taught secondary English and Spanish for 3 years at various schools, though no adult education

-I love technology, have for decades now. Self-taught on a number of eLearning or related software (Captivate, Camtasia, PS, Dreamweaver, Audition) with varying years of experience.

-Working on portfolio for edtech master's with project examples and reflective/research-based writing


I'm happy to give more info if it helps. Thanks!

I wasn't happy but he explained it would be rough during the winter months and so on.. since I was now stuck in a lease I reluctantly accepted...

Now he's doing a runner, taking up another job leaving me to run his entire business for him, for nothing, he expects me to also start cold calling people about his business too...

trained for jihad with the same Pakistani terrorist group that last year massacred 
more than 150 people in Mumbai, India.
• CAIR officials are secretly coaching terrorism suspects and witnesses to 
withhold information from FBI investigators, and have successfully obstructed 
at least one investigation in Maryland.
• CAIR is donating thousands of dollars to the legal defense fund of a Muslim 
cop killer.
• CAIR’s visitor logs show the father of an al-Qaida terrorist visited CAIR 
director Awad several months before he was convicted of plotting to assassinate 
President Bush.
• Curiously, the logs do not register any guests around September 11, 2001—
in fact, the entire month of September is blank.
• CAIR has cultivated Muslim moles inside a Washington-area law enforcement 
agency, including one who illegally accessed classified FBI records to tip off a 
terrorist under investigation and another with ties to Pakistani intelligence.
• A longtime CAIR advisory board member and top fundraiser has preached 
violent insurrection, including calling on street gangs to lead an “Uzi” jihad in 
America’s cities.
• Another imam whom CAIR frequently books to speak at its events 
has exhorted Muslims to hijack U.S. military aircraft, including C-130s 
transporting the elite 82nd Airborne paratroopers out of Fort Bragg—which 
happens to be part of the district represented by North Carolina state senator 
Larry Shaw, who this year took over the reins of CAIR as its new chairman.
• CAIR is putting books into neighborhood libraries across the country advising 
men to beat their wives—but only “lightly”—when they disobey them.
• Stung by recent terrorism charges, CAIR is losing members and dues and 
operating in the red; in fact, it is struggling financially to the point where it has 
to rent out one of the three floors it operates at its Capitol Hill headquarters.
• CAIR is suffering from a whopping 50 percent employee turnover rate in the 
Washington area and having a difficult time recruiting new talent.
• Interns have refused to be formally photographed with CAIR officials for fear 
of being associated with terrorists and profiled at airports, and some have even 
removed their CAIR experience from their resumés.
• CAIR executives travel regularly to the Middle East to raise cash, and bank 
wire transfers show Saudi princes have donated hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to CAIR—even as it claims to receive no foreign support.
• While cash-poor, CAIR is asset-rich, and in recent years has partnered with 
Arab investors—including a UAE defense minister who once equipped Osama 
bin Laden’s camps in Afghanistan—to finance its headquarters and buy up 
an alarming number of parcels of property in downtown DC while shielding 
them under a holding company.
• CAIR tried to muscle out other groups to represent the so-called Flying 
Imams against US Airways, promising them “large compensation,” and in 
another revelation, CAIR had a previous history with the lead imam in the 
case, working with him on a similar stunt that occurred on board an America 
West flight.
• CAIR went to extraordinary lengths to shake down Bank of America in a 
frivolous claim of discrimination involving a Muslim employee, internal 
strategy documents reveal.
• In spite of claims it represents all Muslims, CAIR routinely discriminates 
against Shiites and other Muslims—including its own employees—in favor of 
Sunni Muslims.
• CAIR is actively training Homeland Security agents to respect Muslims and 
Islam, while brainwashing them to think jihad means “internal struggle against 
sin,” and not holy war, as part of a dangerous disinformation campaign.
• CAIR quietly removed from its Web site an “Urban Legends” rebuttal it 
posted in response to growing criticism and terror charges after its falsehoods 
became transparently and embarrassingly obvious.
• Desperate for revenue, CAIR tasks its interns with researching and writing 
grant proposals while providing blatantly false information in grant applications.
• CAIR privately worries that “major roadblocks” to mainstreaming Islam in 
America include the religion’s “treatment of women and violence,” but instead 
of acknowledging misogyny and jihad as problems and disavowing them, 
CAIR coaches staff to use more effective methods to whitewash over them.
• CAIR and the ACLU have formed a strategic partnership to target the FBI 
with “ethnicity related” civil rights complaints.
• During the recent Lebanon crisis, which saw Israel defend itself from 
Hezbollah rockets, CAIR actually had the temerity to seriously consider 
suing the U.S. and Israel under RICO racketeering statutes for “conspiring to 
commit murder, kidnapping, property damage, and acts of terrorism.”

And found it at a perfect time in my life.,lapXpap41,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1qj1sx/help_new_to_this_subreddit_and_found_it_at_a/,"I've always dealt with anxiety. I have little coping methods that will usually get me back to where I need to be, eventually. But lately these tricks haven't been working, only making things worse. I feel like my anxiety isn't really an outcome of a traumatic event anymore, it's just turning into a daily occurrence that impacts school, my jobs, and my relationships. 

Right now school is my biggest struggle. I've changed my major three times in two and a half years, and am still not sure if where I am is right for me. I can't even go to class most days. If I'm able to get myself out of bed in the morning and ready, I usually can't even make it to campus. Most mornings I end up pulling over on the highway or not getting out of my car in the parking deck because I'm having a breakdown for no reason. Then when I go to class, I can barely focus in lecture or on the homework. 

I've had some weird physical things going on too. I'm not sure if they're because of the stress or other reasons, but I've been getting awful migraines that will last up to a week and a half sometimes. I also haven't been sleeping well at all. Presently I'm going on two days of no sleep. 

I leave in January for an internship with Disney World. Lately that's the only thing that I've had to pull me through. But it's hard not to just shut down until I leave. I'm also worried that the way I'm feeling now will just get worse once I'm down there on my own and I won't be able to achieve my dreams. 

I really appreciate any support or advice anyone can give. I've tried talking to my close family and friends about how I'm feeling and pretty much everyone has brushed me aside and said I just need to focus more. The only person who will listen to me and sit with me while I'm having my breakdowns has been my boyfriend. But unfortunately he has his own things going on and can't be around very often. So this is kinda my last attempt to reaching out to someone.

1qiow3,1,2013-11-13,Am I the only one who sucks at my job? (Long Post),AnEpiphanyTooLate,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1qiow3/am_i_the_only_one_who_sucks_at_my_job_long_post/,"I'm 21 and have had three jobs since 18. I've been terrible at all of them. I don't know why. I don't know if Asperger's has anything to do with it at all. I just don't understand why this keeps happening to me and if I will ever find a job I can actually be competent at. I feel like a fucking idiot. Hell, I'll admit it, I *am* a fucking idiot. If I can't do shitty minimum wage retail positions, how the fuck am I going to do anything else?

My first job was working for a fairly well-known retail store. I worked there for about five months. I struggled to stock 60+ boxes of items in under an hour while at the same time managing register, which was extremely frequent. I was also told my average ""basket size"" (how many items the customer buys) was too low. How I was supposed to rectify this, I don't know. Presumably, I'm supposed to advertise random items to customers and hope they buy them. I don't know anywhere where this strategy actually works. Nor did I understand why this was considered my fault. If a customer comes in to buy a Coke and leave, no amount of enthusiastic advertising is going to make them buy anything else. This is beside the fact that I was the main cashier. Our store was small, so we only ever had 2 people on staff at a time, usually a main cashier (me) and a manager/assistant manager. The cashier usually stocked/straightened and attended to customers whenever there was a line. The manager usually did administrative business and stocked and only got called to the register when there was a lot of customers. So with this set up, it makes complete sense why my ""basket size"" was so low. The manager is only called in when there's a lot of customers with a lot of items. Meanwhile, I have every other customer, even during the slow times when there's only a customer every 5-10 minutes wanting to buy 2-3 items. I don't understand how everyone else does it. It makes no sense to me how they can possibly work that fast and just naturally know where everything is. I don't understand why my stats are fucked up when I'm doing nothing to cause them. They of course cut me a break the first few weeks, but after three months, they were understandably getting pissed off. I contemplated photographing the store and trying to memorize the goddamn layout of the place, before realizing how fucking stupid an idea that was. Everyone else could do it, why couldn't I? I was fired when a customer gave me a $100 counterfeit bill which I *know* for a fact was a bullshit excuse, because they were cutting my hours long before that, several other employees did the same thing and were not penalized for it, and they only implemented anti-counterfeit measures *after* my incident. They did make some noises about my performance as well affecting their decision, but I would have preferred if they had just told me I sucked outright.

My second job was technically a 12-week internship, but I sucked at that too. It was for a parks &amp; recreation company. They couldn't find anything in pharmacy where I wanted to go, so they just scraped the bottom of the barrel and gave me a random job. Apparently, the boss had a problem with the way I cleaned the bathrooms and left bits of trash in places. She showed me the ""proper"" way to clean them, which involved going into every nook and cranny cleaning every crevice. Of a *park bathroom* that looks no different once it's been ""cleaned."" But I tried my damnedest, God knows I tried. I did everything I could think of and still she wasn't satisfied. Nobody else apparently has these physical limitations but me. She got massively pissed at me one day which wasn't my fault. One minute after I got finished cleaning, someone walked into the bathroom, took a massive shit, and walked out without flushing. She assumed I forgot to clean the stall or something. I told her someone must have come in after me, but she didn't believe me. And I scoured the trails for every conceivable bit of trash I could find. Even the places no one ever goes to. Still not satisfied. Another worker there told me they heard her call me ""mentally handicapped"" or something. I fucking fumed over that comment. I went to the main manager about it in a respectful manner and he said he'd take care of it. This ultimately meant I was transferred to a different park for the remainder of my internship. The new boss was an asshole, but at least he (usually) insulted you to your face. Something I respected more than the behind-my-back bullshit from before. This boss was a decent guy. He got pissed off every once in a while, but he treated me ok usually. I asked the other workers what he thought of me every once in a while. They usually brushed off the question or tried to phrase it in a somewhat positive manner (""Oh, he's coming around"" or something like that). One of the other workers did tell me once that he said (paraphrased), ""I don't know if that kid is just young or if he really has a mental problem."" I wasn't surprised, just kind of pissed off. At the end of the internship though, he showed a lot of trust in me by letting me drive his pick-up truck to a different location, something he didn't even trust the other workers to do. That kind of surprised me and caught me off-guard, but I was glad it happened. Still, I know for a fact I would have been fired from that job if it wasn't just an internship.

Now, I have a job in a popular retail pharmacy. I like it better than the other jobs, but I still feel like a fucking idiot. I don't mind the other customers yelling anymore and can usually handle them now. But every once in a while I still fuck up simple tasks. Examples: I accidentally take a script that we're out of stock on, or don't know how to properly bill insurance, or mis-file something, etc. When I fill prescriptions, I try to work fast but there's always something I can't find or that I mis-scan or something. I've been here over six months and I feel like I should have this down by now. The boss is a very nice woman on the outside, but I've known her long enough to know when she's pissed off. She's too polite to rage, but she always has some smarmy comment or lecture. For example, if I drop pills on the ground, ""Oh, let's try to be more careful now."" or if I don't have the label completely straight on the bottle, ""Ok, people pay a lot of money for these prescriptions, so let's just make sure to make the product look presentable, ok?"" or if I'm taking too long, ""Ok, we have to treat those waiters like they're on fire, ok?"" You get the point. I knew it was all over when a couple months ago, they hired a new guy fresh out of high school. Of course he does everything better than me only two weeks in and everyone loves him. I have nothing against the guy. He's likable enough and it's not like he's purposely trying to take my job, but he really makes my skin crawl when he gives me an obvious tip about how to do my job that I'm already aware of, even though I've been here longer! It's like everyone thinks I'm a fucking moron. And of course now my hours are being cut again. I went to my boss and told her I could work more and she of course gave me some spiel about how I should have more things down by now and that I would get those hours back when I started improving. I fucking knew it. Every fucking job, every fucking time. And the cycle continues. I wanted to at least last a year, but it looks like I won't even make it that far.

I don't even know why I'm making this. I guess I just want sympathy? Or to know if anyone else has this problem? Is there anything I can do? I try my goddamn best and it still isn't good enough. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me or why I seemingly suck at every single task placed before me. My Asperger's mainly affects my social skills and makes me clumsy at physical tasks, a common element to every job I've had. So would I be better at a job that doesn't require these things? Would it really be any different? Or do I just suck at working in general and will never hold down a job? I'm sick of everyone thinking I'm an idiot. Those who know me well think I'm intelligent and knowledgeable, but I don't think that about myself. Yeah, I know a bunch of useless trivia, but what does that matter when I can't do a basic minimum wage job to save my life. I'm going to get out of anything medical related as soon as I can, as I do *not* want anyone's life in my hands. But for now, I'm not sure what to do."

I don't care about their petty remarks, just wish they would stop this ridiculousness &amp; work with me like the team we're supposed to be? (long)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qik1m/jealous_coworkers_are_ruining_the_small_businesss/,"Hi reddit! For the sake of my job and reddit-browsing coworkers, I am using a throwaway account. And my apologies in advance for a long post. I'm going to try to help you all understand thoroughly of my situation!!


Okay, so background: I work in the horse industry, and am a working student at the stables that I work at. Essentially, I am a non-paid intern. I work 6 days a week, and though we have many clients, the business itself is quite small. We have a head trainer(boss and owner of the stables), a newly promoted assistant trainer (she was in my position before my arrival and was promoted to a paid position after I was hired - she's only a year ahead of me as far as experience goes), one other working student, and a single groom (helps tack up the horses, keep the place clean, etc). My boss is amazing and does her best to keep the atmosphere at the barn very positive and friendly. She does not want a hierarchy as far as positions go - it's her, then the rest of us working together as a team. Between me, the other working student, and the assistant trainer, we all share the same responsibilities. Some slight differences may be the level of lessons we are teaching, horses we ride, or the level we compete at. The other working student and I are also expected to assist the groom with a couple extra duties.


I started working at this barn a little over half a year ago. The other working student - let's call her Haley - and I were hired at the same time. A few months after our arrival, the assistant trainer - let's call her Jan - was promoted to her current position from the working student position, which Haley and I now share. For the first few months, everything was fine and dandy. For awhile Haley, Jan, and I would hang out outside of work. We'd go into the city, have a few drinks, or go to Haley's house. I'd like to note that during this time I always made it a point to not get too close to either person, because at the end of the day I am a working student to learn, not make friends. I never revealed personal information that normal coworkers shouldn't know about. But, with the business being so small and seeing these same people everyday, you cannot completely avoid developing sort of closer relationship with them.


Jan is a very, very forward person and has an extremely strong, controlling personality. Since the beginning of us working together, she has tried everything in her might to be close friends with me, which I was put off by (came off as forced), but went along to a certain extent for the sake of my job and keeping everyone happy. She will throw personal information at me (I honestly cannot remember a time I inquired about her life, and this is not out of bitchiness, she'll just tell me out of no where - seemingly ""pushing"" her problems and life onto me). I've seen her do this with clients as well. Haley is much more quiet and reserved and has a follower-type personality. I never had a problem with her, up until recently. The boss, let's call her Kathy, is a very smart business woman and highly educated. There really isn't anything that goes on at the barn that she doesn't know about. She is also amazing in the fact that she bends over backwards to give me opportunities to ride phenomenal horses, show, and lesson as much as possible. She is even paying for my gym membership and has paid for many show and clinic fees. Kathy has given me a full lease (basically a full rent) on her show horse in exchange for my work, which is quite an honor, and gives me many of the nicer horses at the barn to ride daily. The groom, let's call him David, is really out of all of this and does his own thing haha. Without further adieu...




The problem: Ever since Jan's promotion, she has turned into a very controlling person. There are several instances where she has been especially rude to me, especially as I started to gain more experience. She was never controlling or rude when Kathy was around, but when it was just me, Haley, and her, she would pick on me over the slightest, most petty things that at the end of the day didn't even matter NOR Kathy would have cared about. To me, it felt like she was searching for a reason to say something me and couldn't find anything. There was a few instances where she was so obscenely rude to me for no reason at all that I had to mount my horse and quickly ride off to avoid anyone seeing tears forming in my eyes. I just couldn't understand why she was so mean to me. I also noticed that Haley wasn't getting this sort of attention from Jan. In fact, Haley and Jan seemed to be getting closer, hanging out more, texting, etc. This didn't bother me at all, because like I said, I was there to learn and that's it. After the first couple of jabs, I completely stopped talking to Haley and Jan outside of work, because I felt like that was where it went wrong. For the sake of the business and because I have so much respect for Kathy, I couldn't let this get in the way of the business, so I remained extremely civil no matter what, and just kept everything work related for there on out. Just bit my tongue and continued.
Fast forward through dealing with some of these instances and letting it go, there was one final straw that broke the camels back for me. I was doing really good about not building resentment, but Jan just kept getting more and more mean. Basically, what happened was Jan and Haley came back from eating lunch (they never invite me to lunch. Doesn't bother me, but thought it might be note-worthy) and Jan demanded that I needed to come to work earlier that I already do in order to ride all the horses I was assigned in a criticizing tone. The thing is, I had already discussed with Kathy earlier in the day that I would be unable to ride all the assigned horses (this particular day was a half day for me), and she was completely okay with it, no questions asked. She re-assigned those horses to someone else. Jan knows that Kathy and I discussed this as well, as she was there when it happened. Also, it wasn't in Jan's place to tell me to do something like that, that should have come from Kathy. I come to work on time every day, and work my ASS off. If there is a reason that I can't get to everything, it's a damn good reason. I also think it's worth noting that Haley is late to work by 30 minutes to an hour almost every day, which made Jan's request all that more bothersome.
I decided to talk to Kathy about it. The talk went great, and Kathy said she noticed ""mean girl"" stuff going on at the barn. Kathy is especially sensitive to this because we have children at the barn every day to set a good example for, and as a child Kathy was bullied a lot. I didn't even have to say much for Kathy to know exactly what was going on, and it was extremely relieving to know that she was backing me up. Kathy mentioned that there was a lot of other things going on with Jan, and Kathy was beginning to get really frustrated with her. Before we could even finish our conversation, Jan interrupts us because she wants to know what's going on. Kathy backed me up by saying we were just talking about the horse I'm leasing. Kathy promised me she would talk to Jan about this without mentioning me, but I think Jan knew exactly what was going on, which is completely fine with me.
After Kathy and I talk, before Kathy even gets the chance to talk to Jan, Jan is already kissing my ass. Literally, completely different and she immediately was treating me differently. No longer bossy, over the top nice, etc. As over the top and ridiculous as she was being, I was fine with it and was just letting it be because I hate drama so much.


Fast forward to yesterday, things have been better between Jan and I. She no longer indulges me in her life, and the relationship is strictly work-related. She has toned down a lot. But, here is where it gets weird. Haley and I never really had a problem, but I have noticed the past month she has been getting weirder and weirder with me, and this is while Haley and Jan have been getting closer and closer. Like, her fuse is getting short with me. She was speaking shortly with me. I couldn't put my finger on it, until yesterday when Haley sent me a text she meant to send to Jan. In the text she was basically making fun of me over the most petty and juvenile thing ever (taking a selfie with my horse). She tried to cover it up. I responded gracefully but made it clear I was not an idiot. I continued today normally, and now Haley has been kissing my ass and being over the top as well.
I think this is all stemming from my relationship with my boss, clients, and my progression. My boss and I have a wonderful relationship. I have a fantastic reputation amongst everyone I know in the area who is in the horse industry, and I have made amazing improvements in my riding. Kathy compliments me often, which is something I noticed that bothers Jan. Jan has a reputation for being abrasive and has rubbed numerous people the wrong way. As far as Haley goes, I think she is just a follower and is taking Jan's lead. Kathy gives the same opportunities to Haley as far as I know, though they do not talk about barn management things as much as Kathy and I do and Kathy comes to me about it. Now that Jan can't be mean to me, her and Haley have formed a pact and are turning against me, is what it feels like. Please note: I can honestly say I have never, ever done something to give them a reason to dislike me and I try my hardest to make everyone happy, solely because I care very much about the business.


Reddit, thank you for reading my novel of a situation. What the hell do I do? Do I talk to Kathy again? Do I wait and see if it happens again/if the situation resolves itself? My gut instinct tells me they talk about me a lot, and I only think they are going to try harder now to make it less obvious. I refuse to leave my position and am honestly not as bothered by this whole thing as I seem. My main concern is that this doesn't effect the business in anyway, and I'm just afraid that Jan is being destructive with her behavior and Haley can't make her own decisions, thus follows Jan. We're supposed to be working as a team, and I can fake through it if I have to, but just wish these girls would chill the fuck out.
HALP.


TL;DR Jealous coworkers are creating a very difficult work environment, while I'm sittin' here wondering why we can't just fucking get along and have everyone act their god damn age!"
1qicpq,9,2013-11-12,18F4M - Impressionable girl right out of school becumming rich.,cumloverrrrrrrrrrrrr,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1qicpq/18f4m_impressionable_girl_right_out_of_school/,"This was long, if you can't read this you probably won't write something long enough (I love long things, like I said) and you'll think the roleplay takes too long, because of its incredible detail. It's good stuff once it's underway though, so if that's fine, please don't let this put you off.

Hey guys, I'm just writing this before I shower and settle into bed, so I can read all your replies before I pick the best one to do this fantasy with, but I came up with this idea for it. I want your take on the story, so the longer (I really love very long replies), the more detailed, the more impressed I am going to be, and therefore the reply that impresses me the most will be the one! You can interpret it based off the below here, I just want you to send your take on it.

So, I've just passed my final year, of high school, and by fluke or mistake I've received an internship at a fortune 500 company I applied for. The company I've applied picks up all the interns at once, and because it's so big, they have a function/drinks at the night for us to get us to know eachother before we starting working, and for us to meet staff who have worked there longer for us to feel more comfortable. For it, I've dressed up in a fancy, long back dress I got my daddy to buy, and I'm sitting by in a chair in the corner, feeling a bit alienated because of my age even though I'm getting many looks by lots of guys. Also, please include zxcvb in your subject reply line, so I can filter out any people who didn't read the whole thing and skimmed through. You on the other hand, are the CEO, and are basically a trillionare. You're sick of attending these yourself, but the girl you see idly tapping, bored, and too young to really be working here... she isn't boring you, she's the kind of girl that doesn't and shouldn't have to work a single day in her life, if she knows what you mean. You come over with me, and flirt, flaunting your wealth to a girl like this, so young and impressionable, telling her she could be yours and live in whatever mansion she wants anywhere she wants with you. Basically, imply I should become yours, live with you and that I can have anything I want in exchange for my body.So, after that, we sneak out together and go back to whatever number mansion you own, and yeah, we get naughty! Take it to the absolute extreme in the gold digging regard, in your story tell me about the champagne in your limo on the way back, the cars you have, that an 18 year old girl is so lucky to be able to now buy 20 ferraris if she wanted without any cost or whatever. I am going to marry you, and be your slutwife.

Also, as per usual with my fantasies and fetishes, I have a huge thing for cum. I want you to cum all the time (every minute maybe) without it being your orgasm, just so I'm covered in your seed, if that makes sense. I don't want you to get softer when doing it as if you've just orgasmed or something, I just want it to happen often so I'm covered in it, and then you orgasm at the end a huge load, and we finish off just like usual.

So, that's the outline of it. You can write your introduction from your perspective or in a way that impresses me, and you're likely to get picked! Once we get underway, I want to do this on sexytimechat (an online chat client), or skype, and write our replies with long back and forth messages. Just be prepared to use it, expect it! Anyway, I'll be back in about half an hour, because I'm getting a little hungry and I want to eat some food before I get back in bed (I'm from Australia) So I'll be around 30-40 minutes. If you have other kinks you're wondering if you'd want to **INCORPORATE** into the roleplay, just tell me in your PM."

[20/m] &amp; [25/f],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qi8z8/i_dont_know_what_to_do_20m_25f/,"Hey /r/relationship_advice. I have a situation happening with me at the moment, and I have no idea how to deal with it, and my friends aren't really that much help either. Just a warning, this is going to be a long story.. I will include a tl;dr at the end, but I want to thank anybody in advance that reads through the whole wall of text and offers any advice.


I'm going to give some background info. I used to work in a pharmacy/grocery store (not giving my position/store name just to be on the cautious side), and I've been there for a good 2 years at this point. We often get intern students working in the store from local colleges. The store I work at happens to have a make up section, and she was studying cosmetology at the time so she got the co-op position there. I thought she was pretty at the time, but never actually had a conversation besides small talk in the break room. After about 3 months of working with her, I end up getting a job at another location for better pay so I leave. I never said bye to her, as we weren't really friends at that point. I was gone for about a year and a bit. I then end up getting a job offer back at that initial store, for a higher position and for more pay. Being a university student, any higher pay is good for me so I took it. When I arrive back there I see that she ended up getting a job there after her internship.


From day 1 of me going back there, we started talking. She began speaking with me, ""Oh you're back?! Yay, that's awesome!"" Whenever we were on the same shift (different departments), we would talk. Either I would go to her side of the store, or she would come to mine. Eventually, [b]she[/b] asked for my number after finding out we go to the same university and that we're in the same year. Ever since that day, we've spoke every single day, through text, and often going for coffee together on campus. The university campus we go to is the largest in Canada, and we're studying two totally different fields. So the buildings are a good distance from each other. But, we'd often walk it to have lunch with each other, or go grab a coffee. From my previous experience with girls, I feel like I always start texting conversations myself with no assistance from the female. So in this case, I would often text her good morning or whatever to start conversations, but I intentionally did not some days to see if she would. And every single time she would message me saying hi or whatever to spark up a conversation. So I thought, ""hey that's a good sign"".


At the time, she was telling me that one of her friends was trying to hook her up with some guy. Being the type of guy I am, I didn't want to shove myself between them. Even though I Know they weren't dating each other, I didn't want to be known as that guy. So while I still made sure to sound interested through texts/conversations, I never made any major moves. One night, me and her were talking and she tells me about how she's not into the guy and how things won't work out. So, I decided to grow a pair and thought hey there's no better time than now. While I thought that everything was going good, I got the famous ""Oh I'm sorry gMAAYNE, I don't think of you like that"". Shit got awkward, fast. No more texts, no more coffee, no more even looking at each other at work. I would always say hi to her at work, but she would avoid eye contact with me at all costs. So I thought, hey I screwed up, I guess I just have to cut my losses and move on. And I did.


Fast forward ~2 weeks later, and I get a message from her one morning. ""Hey what's up?"" I know she's a good hearted girl, maybe she just didn't want to make things awkward between us, we do have to work together after all. So we start talking again. This was about 3/4 months ago. To this day, there hasn't been a single day where we haven't spoken. So, I thought she wanted to stay friends (I'm a nice guy after all c:).


She's a big gamer, and I am as well. She's a big fan of a certain character, I'm not going to give names, let's just call her Betty. So after I find this out, I jokingly say to her ""Oh Betty, I love her. That's my type of woman"". She replies to me with, ""Oh, that's funny my friends always say I am Betty"". I was taken aback, and initially thought I misinterpreted what she was saying. I just dropped it. I thought that maybe she didn't mean to say that and that I was thinking things up in my mind that I wanted to hear.


We're both into metal as well, and she happens to be taking a french course at school. So I see a video of France Has Talent or French Idol or whatever on Youtube, and it's of a very pretty girl singing French death metal. So I post the video on her facebook, and text her saying ""Wow, a pretty good that sings death metal. If I found anybody like that, I'd wifey her right away!"" She responds to me with, ""Well you know I love metal. I can't sing it, but I can try!"". What am I supposed to think? Why would you say that to somebody that you rejected before?


One day we end up going to the mall together. The mall turns into lunch, lunch turns into dinner, dinner turns into coffee. Before we both know it, it's 11pm and we've been together for 9 hours. Is it sad that those 9 hours have been the most fun I've ever had with a girl? Relationship or not? While we were together, she was very touchy with me. She'd randomly hug me, or grab my arm when we were going through stores. I know, that's nothing major, but she did reject me before. If I was in her shoes, I wouldn't be trying to give off the wrong signals to a guy I rejected. Although, I don't claim to be a female expert.


We've been together countless amounts of other times, in fact I just left from dropping her off. My question to you guys is, what should I do? I have never felt this way about anybody, ever. I'm young, but I can honestly see myself spending the rest of my life with her. I would like nothing more than to ask her out (again), but at the same time I don't want to lose her. I know if I ask her out again, she may not want to talk to me, due to awkwardness. She's also around that age where she wants to find a serious relationship and settle down, so the thought of losing her just breaks my heart. What should I do?


tl;dr hopeless romantic asks a girl out, she says no. But during the months following, she dosen't act the way a rejecter would act. wat2do

Since I don't know life any other way, I don't let it get me down (most of the time!). I have just recently found this subreddit and have read some comments of people being in very dark places because of their HH. I'd love to make a list of positive things that people have gotten out of living with HH. 

So for example, with underarm sweat, I always have to think about where I'm going that day, what the temperature will be, potentially stressful events that could happen (etc, etc, etc) so I can make the right outfit to have a jacket or other backup clothes without people asking ""did you change?!"" or ""its so hot, why do you have a jacket?!"" I am now a very detail-oriented person that thinks out every possible outcome for decisions, events, and projects which I now get complemented on a lot at work and at past internships. 

Also, I am always complemented on my witty and goofy sense of humor. I 100% attribute it to my HH (not out loud of course, just with myself and now you all). I believe I developed a strong sense of humor as a defense mechanism to be able to handle kids at school and to handle the condition is general. Honestly, I'd prefer to be know for a good sense of humor than being really attractive or anything else.

Ok- hope this works! Best wishes to everyone who has had HH for a while like me or is just now experiencing symptoms. "
1qmukh,1,2013-11-14,Second Time Around Interviewing With a Company for an Assistant Editor Position,klam1987,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1qmukh/second_time_around_interviewing_with_a_company/,"Back in June, I interviewed for a very conveted assistant editor position with a commercial editing house I really wanted to work for. I made it to the third a final round of interviews (that's how competitive it was), but was ultimately rejected in favour of another candidate who had more experience than I did. I actually had no work experience for the position, just schooling.

I sent follow up thank you letters to my interviewers to express my gratitude for their time and hope that we may work together in the future. While I was disappointed, the experience reinvigorated my goal and I made it a mission to cover the ground that cost me the job.

Almost immediately after I got a job for an logger/digitizer and assistant editor position with a tv show on a contract basis. When that contract ended in September, I emailed the interviewer and asked if any internship position was available with them as I still aspired to work there. Through scattered correspondence, I received an email back from her yesterday informing me that a new assistant editor position will open up soon and she will be contacting me for an interview in a couple of weeks if I'm still interested.

My question is, what is the best way for me to utilize what I did during those months in between to sell myself to them as a the best candidate for the position?"

Help me.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qmeim/i_24f_happily_married_with_my_husband_27_m_for_3/,"Okay, before you read this story I have to tell you that you will hate me, I am really ashamed for being like this.


I have been together with my husband for 6 years now and we had a very constant relationship, we love each other and he is like a soulmate. Everybody loves our relationship and tell us how well we fit into one another. Despite our good relationship,  I tend to be emotionally unstable. This is why I fell in love with another guy when my husband and I were apart when I stayed abroad 3 months. I made around with him and left him. Back home my husband was hurt and we almost seperated, but then decided to try again. Everything was alright after 3 months and we fell in love with each other again. This happened when we were engaged. 

Fast forward to last year were I had a crush on a guy who was working with me and liked me aswell, nothing happened. Then this year, we were apart again when I stayed in another city for an internship, I had a crush on my boss (so embarassing). This was nothing serious and I didn't start anything although I saw that he liked me aswell. I told my husband about it and he was hurt and couldn't understand. 

Now again, I have a bad crush on somebody, who is a friend in the new city I work and live alone. This time he is a very understanding, kind and nice guy and we get along very well. He already told me he liked me too much and we are on distance now because of my marriage. I really don't know what to do. I actually want my husband and my reason says it is the only right thing but my heart says different and for weeks I can't have any sex with my husband. He already asked me whats going on. 

I would be very thankful for some advices and really, I am sorry for being to unfaithful to a kind man. 


tl;dr: happily married; I constantly fall in love with different guys and this time I am in love with someone who is in love with me. "

I just got offered an internship (not the college program, I'm getting paid very well) with Disney and I'll be working in Celebration. Because I don't want to spend much time commuting, I'm hoping to live in Celebration as well.

The two apartment complexes I'm looking into are Camden Town Square and Evander Square. Does anyone have any opinions on either of these places? 

Besides that, I've just been looking at garage apartments on Craigslist, but my parents are worried that I'll be like, murdered by the homeowners or something ridiculous. 

Anyway, any advice would be much appreciated! :)"
1qlw5p,1,2013-11-14,I am feeling many feelings,cr0wdedmind,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1qlw5p/i_am_feeling_many_feelings/,"**warning, petty little bullshit life problems below**

Its 3 am and my head is spinning and my anxiety is running at an all time high. Perhaps this ""writing out your thoughts"" idea will work. I will be furiously typing this on my phone so expect many spelling errors.. Either way I don't really care nor expect anyone replies to my silly problems. 

To start things off I'm a 20 year old university student. I'm turning 21 on Friday, which is both scary and exciting as shit. I can't wait to get wasted and forget about all these problems.

One word to describe my life these days is confusion. Up until this semester I truly never realized how easy and simple life was despite my constant bitching. Hell even I'll admit my first world problems are nothing compared to those suffering poverty and financial problems across the world. 

Nonetheless the problems in my life are as follows: 

My gpa will suffer this semester and its scaring the shit out of me. For the first time in my college career I'm legitimately scared I'm going to get Ds in 2 of my classes and get Cs in the others. I've maintained a high GPA until this point, a 3.5 but I'm going to say good bye to that this semester. I have 3 weeks of grinding out as much studying as I can. I should be motivated, but I'm not for whatever reason. I'm burnt out, already withdrew from one class.

School has never been of interest to me. Since my teen years I've hated the education system. No I was never bullied, or the likes. Its just that I've always had to work my ass off 2x more than my class mates to achieve the same grades. A combination of anxiety and a foggy mind is thanks to that. This could be a medical issue, either way I don't think k I have the finances to seek help. 

Either way I understand the education system is a necessity. Which is why I'm studying something with good market value that way I HOPE I never have to return back for a masters just so I can ""get a job"". 

Speaking of jobs I'm currently in between 2. An internship with a very large company and a theater I've been at for almost 2 years now. I wish I could say I've enjoyed both but I don't. My internship is dreadful, I feel like an administrator over anything. Very few of the projects within the original description are being implemented and my time is running out soon. Whatever though, at least I can put their name on my resume now.

As for the theater i hate every second of it. I can't believe after 2 years I'm still in this shit. I've seen peo0le come and go and make progress in their life. Me? In still here when I wanted to leave within my first year. Pay is low, I get treated like the bottom of the barrel, only good thing is the coworkers who are mainly my age. I partied and had some of the best times this past summer.

Even with these 2 jobs I'm broke as shit. I'm barely making bills but I'm thankful to have a network of people supporting me, mainly my family.not my fraternity family, I will get to that nonsense later. I live with my sister and her boyfriend. Without her I would be a in a financial rut but she helps cover some of my rent time to time. Next up is my dad whom I respect dearly. He pays for pretty much everything else including my schooling. 

Maybe I over stress about my finances too much. My dad has offered time and time again that he can pay for everything as long as i focus on school. I don't want that though. I would feel awful. And plus I think work experience in college is a necessity. I worry too much about things like this when my situationis no where near as bad as others. Its just part of my anxiety I guess. 

Speaking of jobs again, I'm surprised as to how easy im landing them. Actually no I'm not, I have a good GPA, a marketable major and know how to communicate and kill interviews.  I've had about 4 internship interviews this year, landed about 4/6 of them and have denied people which I thought I would never do. How im still stuck at the theater is beyond me. Wait no its not, I need weekends because I like to devote as much time during weekdays for school where I can visit my professors office hours. I had a sweet job earlier this year doing tech support for my uni that had to end because my internship. 

I'm cocky and over confident when it comes to interviews. This past week I did an summer internship interview just for the practice of it after I've already accepted another offer recently. I prepare very little for interviews but I'm good at bull shitting and using fancy words. Also the only reason im getting so many offers is because of my gpa, once that drops say good bye to everything. When another recession hits and I'm jobless and can't land an interview like everyone else, I'm going to look back at this post, laugh at my stupidity, probably fall into depression and wither away. I'm fine with it though, these days nothing in life feels meaningful. 

Why does nothing feels of purpose? Im a lonely retard who can't grasp simple subjects, and over think things.  This semester I joined a fraternity, why? I wanted a tight group of people, go to the best ragers, and hook up with hot girls. The best part is after pledge ship and all that money I can say barely any of those are occurring. I'm still a virgin and I'm about to be 21. I've had one sloppy drunken kiss in my life which I cringe about.

I honestly have no clue as to how I am still a virgin at one of the biggest party schools in america. I'm tall, good looking (at least I think), make people laugh and dress nicely. I look at these goofy ass kids around campus and at parties who are landing girls left and right and am confused as to what I'm doing wrong.. Even this fat fuck in my fraternity who gets it in more than me. Even this annoying ugly, Indian kid who was in my pledgeship gets girls. Then again he has way more free time that me. His parents, like everyone else in my fraternity, are rich to the point where their work money is their free money. I'm cocky and over confident about my self. Only within my head though, I'm very humble,introverted and shy to other people. I'm also very self conscious, every where I walk I feel as if everyone is staring at me. I'm severely underweight for my height and my head is too big. My arms are like toothpicks and I've been told by a drunk girl how small my calves are despite over a year and a half of lifting. I quit lifting this past semester and dropped 10 pounds. I still think I look the same so why even bother?

Fuck them though, we have a formal coming up and I don't want to go because i don't want to get a date and its the weekend before finals. I want to study but I know I'll get shit from them for not going.

Its now 3:45. So basically scrolling through this I'm cringing at what I've typed. My problems aren't really that big of a deal but I like to worry about petty bullshit. I don't think though I will truly ever be happy in life. I see people with little to nothing and yet they are beyond happy. How I question my self, how are these people so happy? I lose sleep and I've lost a great amount of weight these past few months just thinking about it.

Overall my head definitely feels better typing this out but I know this is only a short term solution. Back to doing school work I suppose."

1qllc9,4,2013-11-14,"that RD Life - Calorie, the naughty nutrition word",leslierdn,nutrition,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1qllc9/that_rd_life_calorie_the_naughty_nutrition_word/,"So I'm gonna do a little blog series on just that… calories, carbs, protein, and fat. I'm going to do my best to explain each and why they're important. I'm obviously going to skip a lot of the really technical science stuff so I don't put you to sleep and I'm sure I won't address everything so as always… if you think of questions… ask! This stuff will be pretty generic so, (get ready for the shameless plug) we can always make an appointment and talk about what you need specifically.

Calorie. It's almost a dirty four letter word. I noticed throughout my internship that there's a few words in the nutrition world that scare people… carbs and calories probably rank as the top two. Really, I think these guys just get a bad wrap, lets call them misunderstood.

We need calories for everything: breathing, moving, even sleeping. The amount of calories that each person needs depends on their gender, age, body size and composition (meaning body fat and muscle mass) and activity level. The amount of calories my body needs (notice that I said NEEDS) will vary from yours. Without these little guys we literally can't function, and I'm not talking the I'm hungry and can't think straight type of function, I mean literally your body will shut down.

So we all know what happens when we eat too many calories, hence the whole bad wrap thing, but have you ever thought about why it's important to eat ENOUGH calories? Here's the part where I ask you to forget about everything you know about calories. One of the biggest offenses I see (especially in women) is not eating enough. I'm pretty sure in our minds we all think eat more and gain weight, eat less and lose weight. Now that's true… but there's a lot more to the story. Calories are given in a range, that range is on purpose. the bottom half of the range is what your body NEEDS. Eating less than that sounds like weight loss… right? Ehhhh maybe.

I would say the goal of most people is less body fat, more muscle. I'm going to explain this is the simplest form possible… muscle is more calorically expensive than fat. What does that mean? It means it takes more calories to maintain muscle than it does fat. Think of it like shopping… fat is walmart, muscle is chanel. You need to eat more calories to maintain muscle. If your body doesn't have enough calories it will shed muscle and KEEP fat. Scary, huh?! Basically what I'm saying is if you don't eat enough your body is gonna freak out and think it's starving, therefore everything you put in your body it's going to store… as fat.

I had to learn this lesson the hard way. I spent hours in the gym, ate barely 1000 calories a day and couldn't understand why I was getting fatter. It wasn't muscle, it was pudge, and it wasn't cute. Long story short, when I finally figured out that I needed to eat enough calories to support my body I shed 20 easy pounds. I'm not guaranteeing miracle weight loss, I'm just trying to put it in perspective. Eat more, weigh less (within reason of course, think the top of your calorie range). No adult should be eating 1000 calories a day or less.

On that note, lets address the fact that not all calories are created equal. Lets say I hit my 1900 calorie goal (yeah ladies, you read that right… I eat almost 2000 calories a day) with junk. I won't look or feel the same as I would if I hit that goal with a healthier diet. The other part of this is eating often. This is just as important as eating enough. I try to shoot for eating something every three hours. Of course life doesn't always allow this, but I've learned the value in at least trying to pack snacks when I leave the house. It's all about setting yourself up for success.

Hopefully you're still with me. Ladies I think this is a lot harder of a concept for us than guys. They're really lucky in the calorie department. Just being a guy means they automatically burn more calories a day than us… not fair. I know this can be a weird concept, but I promise calories are your friends. So, with the power vested in me by the title RD, I give you permission to eat.

xoxo,

Leslie

Right now I have a FT offer from the Big 4 for Risk Assurance and am unsure as to if I should accept it or not. I have always had a draw towards nursing, and I really feel like that would be somewhere where my work would be appreciated and I could make a difference in someone's life. It would also be interesting work, I think. My plan if I was to do that would be to start taking pre-reqs in the spring and then apply for nursing school in the fall. I'm really just unsure as to what to do.. any suggestions?"
1qkyj2,22,2013-11-13,"I am new, must Vent. This is some random blurbs about my incidents with my mother. possible [trigger warning]",cdnoted,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qkyj2/i_am_new_must_vent_this_is_some_random_blurbs/,"My mother. I can't handle it. I don't even know where to begin. 

I have such a long back story, but I will try and summarize.. When I was around 8 my mom divorced her 2nd husband and lost custody of her two children with them (she basically handed them over) After a few years she sent me to live with my Grandma and went off to do her own thing. 

HER life has always come first, Her BFs, being a barfly, going on fancy vacations..always more important. I resent her for this kind of, but I am really glad I had my Grandma bc I don't know where I would be with out her. 

From 6th grade to HS she was barely around, but when she showed up it was like a fucking tornado of chaos. She would get in a fight with her BF, move in for a week and act like ""mom"" tell me ""your not allowed to be on the phone on school nights"" rip the phone out of my hands (I was a good student btw) My Grandma would get into a fight with her and my mom would get in her face and call her ""fat pat"" or ""fatty patty"" and storm out. She would tell me I could borrow her car, only to call me at 7am, screaming, saying I had no right to take her car. She was a Gem. 

For some reason I was really intimidated by her when I was younger. She was loud and violent. Her favorite terms for me: Whore, white trash, liar, selfish, little bitch, prissy bitch. Her favorite things to do: scream in your face, throw things, pull hair, choke. 

After HS she wasn't around that much at all. She was living with this guy who was the love of her life. She actually got ""cool"" for a little while, when I was 19/20 she would take me out to bars, like she was trying to impress me actually, but it was only cool for so long before it turned into the worst situations ever. 

She would get to a certain point and tell me she knew she was a bad mom and knew that I didn't love her, and I would feel bad. She would then start bad mouthing my Grandma and blaming her for all the things thats has ever gone wrong in my moms life. I would stand up for my Grandma of course and it would turn into a huge argument. She would be an extravagant drinker too. Buying bottles of champaign she couldn't really afford to look impressive, and she would get mad when I told her it was a dumb idea, and waste of money. 

I went out with her one time, went to the bathroom and when I came out she had left me at the bar and left with some guy she met, Some random guy says ""your mom told me to take you home"" umm no thank you...called my grandma 

Another time (some years later) I took her to a premier for a show I had worked on, for some reason I want her to be proud of me. She spent the whole night hanging on my boss and drinking too much (worst idea to bring her i know. I don't learn) We got into a fight in the car on the way home bc she wanted to meet my boss at a bar for a drink and I said no. She grabbed my hair and I had to pull over, I got out bc I was so mad. She hopped the seat, took off and left me on the side of the road at 2am. My purse and phone still in the car. I am in a short black dress. I started walking towards home, eventually a police car drove past me and took me home...they were really nice guys actually.   

Anyway, fast forward to now. I am 28 living with her. Awful idea. 

4 years ago when I graduated college I needed to move to LA to start my career (Film industry) My mom was already living out her bc she met some guy on a cruise ship and she moved in with him. My sister and brother also live out here (they are her GC, more my sister). 

I needed a place to live while I did internships and moved my way up the ladder. She decided to move out of this guys house and get a place with me (Again, I am an idiot).

These 4 years came with a HUGE price tag. She ran my credit cards up, She goes through my things, if I buy wine or she will drink it before I have the chance, she loans people my car, she will eat my food that I made for myself, petty but annoying. 

I generally think my mom doesn't like me. When I got into working out, she would constantly mock me when I went to the gym, ""oh look at me, I am so fucking beautiful, I hope people will like me now"" or tell me it wasn't doing me any good and that I looked like shit for not being 112 lbs, 140 lbs is far to heavy..or say I look like a man.   

She tells me that I don't have a real college degree, and constantly hangs it over my head that I live with her and ""need"" her. If I upset her or don't agree with her. I am a failure with no where to go.  

She drinks a lot and has a mean mouth to go with it the majority of the time. She will tell me I was the reason her marriages didn't last and why she currently doesn't have a BF or any friends. 

She started a fight with a woman at a bar a year ago, my mom was completely wasted and this woman had bumped into her. My mom start calling her a lesbian and accused her of grinding up on her. The woman actually was a lesbian and my mom then started throwing out really derogatory terms, I am sure you can imagine. She starts telling them...and I kid you not...""my child just died in the school shooting"" I am MORTIFIED. I broke up the fight (probably should of let them have at it, she deserved it) I drag her ass out of the bar. She tells me I am a coward and should have fought for her. That I am not her daughter, and not ""Chicago"" The whole time antagonizing me in the parking lot as we walked to the car. She ran up like she was going to hit me and I shoved her back, being drunk...she fell REALLY hard. I felt bad. I really did..but she really really drove me to this point.     

Any time we get into and argument she tells me to ""go home to your real mother."" Or tells me to be a real adult and move out. I would LOVE TO. I would be able to afford rent if I wasn't trying to pay off all this credit card debt she created. BTW I pay for everything on my own, except rent currently, but she insists she supports me bc of this. 

My sister and I have a pretty good relationship these days and she came to live with us for a while. Before then my mom would message her and tell her she was diagnosed with Lupus and might not have long to live, in order to get my sisters attention. She would tell me sister she would buy her a car or a new bedroom set, or pay for her school if she moved in. 

She likes to 'put up a front' so to speak. With new people or anyone outside the family she acts like she was the best mother in the world. She constantly makes up stories of things we supposedly did together, how she bought my car for me (she didn't).

She makes up things to try and make me look bad to my Grandma/family. My BF and I have been together for almost a year and he recently moved in. My mom told my Grandma that she thinks he's having an affair with one of my friends (not even remotely true) She also told her that she thinks he has a secret family in another country that he sends money to.

Things have been better since my BF has moved in, but now that she is getting more comfortable around my him her true colors are starting to show. Last night at dinner she drank too much, went on about how she has a real degree, being a nurse, and that I do not. He told her that she was being disrespectful and her response is ""and where do you think you will sleep tonight"".   

There is so much more..I could go on forever. 

ugh.

1qkvih,10,2013-11-13,"Does my [28m] Fiancée [23f] need to know, or deserve to know, EVERYTHING about me?",OfficialZero,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qkvih/does_my_28m_fiancée_23f_need_to_know_or_deserve/,"I'm engaged to an awesome girl and very, very happy with our relationship and our future together. We've been dating for three years, and we've been engaged since June. Our relationship is very strong and secure, and we've never had any real issues. I'm a person right now, who has my life together and seem very straight-edged. 

I haven't always been this way though. I went through a ""phase"" from about 20-22 where I was just a complete and utter shithead for lack of a better word. I've changed and corrected course, but the past is still the past. During my Junior year of college, I went abroad for a semester and lived with a host family in South America. When I was there, I partook in an inappropriate relationship with a member of the host family. This was in, 2006. It ended up ending very, very badly after she became pregnant. Her parents found out and I ended up leaving the abroad semester early, and in hot-water. 

The family was devoutly Catholic, and there wasn't an abortion. I haven't been involved, and wasn't asked to be involved. When I left, I was just eager to get out of dodge and didn't try to resolve the situation. It was a mess for a variety of reasons, and I was happy to just ""escape"" without punishment or injury. I didn't think about the entire situation, and what happened for a while. It was one of those things you sort of put behind you, and pretend didn't happen. 

2 years ago, I received a friend request on facebook from the girl from 06' and we started talking, and she explained to me what happened. Her parents forced her to give the child, our son, up for adoption to another family member. She seemed to think it was for the best, and didn't hold any grudge to me towards everything that had happened. She sent me some pictures, and the boy was clearly mine. Not even up for debate, as he was very, very light skinned and had many of my features. We've talked on and off about him, and her life, but always in a friendly manner. 

She was in the United States earlier this year, and I travelled a few hours to meet her and see her in person. Again, nothing happened but we talked, and I apologized for everything and just caught up with her. We had a very good talk about everything, about how she was too young, I was too immature, and how things worked out. I talked about my fiancée, and how happy I was and she was happy for me. 

We haven't seen each other in person since then, and aside from the occasional email we aren't in contact. I did her a favor a bit after the trip, by having a friend recommend her for an internship, and I have some affection to her, because she is an ex, and the mother of my child, but there aren't any real romantic feelings. 

What spurred me posting was hearing a co-worker who doesn't have kids make a joke about ""having no kids as far as I know"". That was kind of a moment of realization for me, that I have a son and a child. When my fiancée has our first child, it won't be my first child. That is kind of a big deal. 

I've been nothing but honest with my fiancée and I don't want to keep things from her. I'd really love to share this sordid mess with someone, but it is sordid. I'm afraid that she'll think worse of me for it, because the girl was very young during it all and I haven't even made an effort at being a father and I've been arguably cowardly. I'm paranoid of her somehow finding out down the road, though I'm sure that is more paranoia. Part of me, thinks owning it pre-emptivly is smarter than having it come out. But then I think about it more and think there is no way to sanitize what I did, and seem like a good person, and the best approach is deny, deny, deny. 

I'm curious if folks think that my fiancée deserves to know this information, or is it acceptable if I fail to disclose? 

**tl;dr Many years ago, while in college abroad, I made a mistake with a girl that ended up in a pregnancy that was adopted out. I haven't told my fiancée about the pregnancy or that period in my life, and want some guidance on if I should tell her at some point or not?** "

First off - thank you very much for providing an amazing subreddit that oozes with positive inspiration.  

I have been bitten by the design bug and I have come to the conclusion that I would like to make a career doing it.  Here's the thing - I'm very very green to everything design.  So I, like many others, am reaching out for some advice on how to put myself in the best position to make that happen.  I have read many of these types of threads that ask ""how do I..."" in a very general fashion.  In an attempt to avoid generalities, I have listed below some specific details that may or may not affect my next steps.  I thank you in advance for any opinions you may have.  

**Here are my circumstances:**

* I'm 32 yr old male living in Chicago
* I have a slow laptop that barely functions with Gimp running
* I have an iPad (on which I use adobe Ideas and Photoshop Touch to create concepts and learn tools/jargon)
* I do not have the resources right now to upgrade my laptop
* I have some college credit (in Theater - not design)
* I have a full-time day job that is not design related
* I am confident enough in my artistic talent that I can make this happen. 

Since I'm new to this, I am in full force learning mode.  Really.  I'm a gd sponge right now.  Luckily my day job has a Lynda.com account that I can use for the limitless tutorials and resources.  Between reddit, lynda and adobe.com, the internet is my university right now.  

**Here's what I think my priorities should be moving forward (please tell me I'm dead wrong or if there is something I should do before all of this):**

* Find consistent access to the real tools (since even minesweeper makes my laptop exhausted)
* Make stuff
* Find real schooling
* Make stuff
* Find internship/real world setting to gain hands on experience
* Make more stuff
* Build portfolio
* Make more stuff n things
* Be around people who are learning too
* Make stuff with those people

Going off the assumption the above list is 100% correct (long shot), I don't know how to prioritize those actions.  Thoughts?

**Regarding Computers:** Is it better to invest in something that will last a while or try to find something cheap that will give me access to tools but will have to be replaced quicker?  

**Regarding school:** Currently I am looking into certification programs and portfolio schools as opposed to going back to school to finish the better part of a 4 year degree.  Since this is a creative field, I understand that a portfolio will speak louder than credentials.  That's how it works in theory but I'm not sure if real life mirrors that.  Any thoughts on finding work in the real world without university credentials? 

**Regarding more experience:** I feel like I could find an internship or something that would put me closer to the industry than my couch after work.  What type of places should I look into for this type of experience?  Are there places out there that need a monkey to do simple and fundamental graphic design related tasks over and over again?  If so, would those places consider someone like me with very little experience but a huge drive or are all places looking for someone who has enough experience to find that type of work a waste of time?   

I'm sorry if these questions seem very remedial - again, I'm very new to this.  Thank you so much for any help or ideas you can spare.

1qps6z,2,2013-11-15,EY vs PwC - Silicon Valley Summer Tax Internships,Aelyxi,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qps6z/ey_vs_pwc_silicon_valley_summer_tax_internships/,"Hi everyone, 

I was accepted for tax internships in the San Jose offices for EY and PwC, and I'm having a tough time deciding where to go, especially since the deadline is in less than a week. I enjoyed meeting everyone at both firms, though I found EY to be a bit more friendly, but that's limited to the small number of people I met. Also, I have more people in my network for PwC.

Some questions I have are

1) What are the biggest differences in each of the two firms, and the pros vs cons?

I like that EY has a Diversified Staff Group, so that I could learn more about the different tax groups, but PwC also has rotations (and Risk Assurance, which I've just learned more about and might be interested in a rotation - otherwise, my focus is tax right now). It takes about a year longer to advance to senior at PwC vs EY, though.
PwC has a nice open/modern office (kinda looks like it's out of an IKEA catalogue) while EY is more closed/traditional (though I've heard they're going to remodel soon).

2) What are the differences in benefits that can't be found on their website? 

3) And what other advice/notes do you have in deciding between the two?


Any advice would be helpful and much appreciated!

Some notes:
* cultural diversity and family (long run) are important to me
* location doesn't matter; they're on the same block
* I want to work in tech, which shouldn't be a problem since both are in the Silicon Valley
* at some point, I'd like to travel

If you want me to clarify anything, please let me know.

Thank you!"

I have 3.5 years experience in web development: started out with PHP, quickly changed to Python and haven't looked back since. I consider myself a quick, autonomous learner with very good problem solving abilities, and I love learning new technologies for fun and profit.

Now I want to dive into .NET and put lots of efforts into developing my skills in it, mostly because job opportunities. My plan is to create practice projects, and applying to internships so I could learn in enterprise environment while I also make some money.

I found a very good looking internship opportunity which says ""the most important tasks include learning enterprise software development with the help of current developers, and to perform small/bigger tasks in .NET"". The job would start in late January, so I have time to prepare.

I guess this would fit my needs really well. Unfortunately I have no idea what exactly they do in .NET, but it seems desktop development (which is fine, though my experience is 95% web).

So, knowing my situation, what would you recommend to get myself prepared for this kind of internship job? I have 2 months, and I want to create 1 or 2 simple, but not toddler level applications (covering most possible areas), but I have no idea what should I make. Any suggestions?"

1. Our security badge checker was arrested at work. We had a room by the door and watch the police cuff him and check him for weapons. He had long hair and they had to check his pony-tail. 

2. I did coding work for a company where my code would be going to a factory in China. I was actually updating/editting/adapting someone else's code.  Every comment and error message had swear words.  So if the user did something wrong it would pop up with ""You little f*cker. You don't know how to use a computer. What an idiot"".  My mentor wrote the code before I saw it. So I had to talk to my boss about it, who knew nothing about coding and explain who would see each message and how the engineers over in China could see the comments.  It was not a fun internship."
1qpldf,1,2013-11-15,Turning My Life Around,ChicagoLad,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1qpldf/turning_my_life_around/,"I've had anxiety issues my whole life. I don't know whether it's hereditary (unlikely since my dad was very charismatic) or a product of environment. I came to the U.S. with my mom during Elementary School and didn't speak any English. I got made fun of a lot and teachers always thought that I wasn't following directions on purpose, so I became kind of an outcast.

Anyway, fast forward to me being 21 and in college, Senior year. I have a 4.0 GPA, but I'm a fuck-up in all other regards. I've been arrested a handful times in a handful of countries, I've been through the psych ward, rehab, and an ICU for heroin overdose. I haven't had a girlfriend since Sophomore year of high school and I have no friends. I'm smoking a lot of pot, drinking a fair amount, and generally losing interest with the world around me.

At this point, you're probably wondering where masturbation comes into play. Well, I've also cultivated a massive and diverse porn collection that I'm quite proud of at this point and am in constant pursuit of more porn to aid my masturbatory quests.

My anxiety finally gets out of hand. My hands shake constantly. My knees buckle. I can't hold eye contact with even people I already know. I bite my nails. I'm convinced that everybody is looking at me in public. I'm hyper-conscious of how I walk, stand, talk, and sit. I can't be at ease.

I see a psychiatrist who puts me on Effexor and Xanax. It isn't enough to stave off the social anxiety, which is at this point crippling, so I start drinking before and during classes... pretty heavily. This turns me into a person who I like more. I meet people easily and am more at-east. But I still feel an underlying anxiety. I see no better alternative at the time. Meanwhile, I'm getting no class work done at all. I've put off literally all of it because I'm drunk and barred-out every day.

Eventually, I go to a bar after classes right off campus, get into a fight with some guys from my school, get arrested by campus police, and get suspended. I spend a few more months bumming around and getting drunk. The anxiety is getting worse presumably because of the feelings of uselessness. I keep meaning to turn my life around, but I can't seem to bring myself to do it.

I stumble upon this link on an investment forum I frequent:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU

It makes sense and I decide to try it out. As early as Day 3 of NoFap, I'm feeling less anxiety. I'm feeling more self-confident, happier, and I'm getting things done. I'm finally handling the 6-inch-high stack of hospital bills I've accrued. I'm reading the backlog of books I've meant to read. I start looking for a new internship.

I then decide to start exercising again. I do cardio every other day and body weight exercises every other day (Chinups, Pullups, Dips, etc.). I'm starting to look and feel better.

I change up my diet. I'm now eating mostly proteins and vegetables. No more Ramen noodles, pizzas, candy, and Taco Bell.
I start to look and feel even better.

I change my sleep schedule. I stop the cycle of meaning to go to bed at 11:30 every night and somehow managing to get to bed by 4am.
I go to bed by 11pm and I wake up earlier. I get no more than 8 hours of sleep.

It's now a month or so into NoFap and I'm feeling like a new man. I'm ready to go back to school and finish my degree. But I want a challenge first. I want to do something that means something. So I go talk with a Marine Corps recruiting officer. I wanted to go active duty, but they were only taking reservists at the time, so I went for that.

The enlistment process was a royal pain in the ass due to my lengthy record of misdemeanors and hospital visits, but I eventually qualify. I could talk for a while about the 13 weeks of boot camp and subsequent couple months of MOS school, but all I'll say is that it changed me even more for the better. I'm actually glad that I didn't go active duty because peace time active duty would involve a lot of sitting around polishing rocks.

So now, I'm finishing school while maintaining NoFap, exercise, a healthy diet, and constant mental stimulation. The anxiety is gone. I feel better than ever. I hardly drink and I don't use any drugs. I've made some solid guy friends. Girls are into me. School's going well. Life's good and I'm going to keep it up."
1qojsz,9,2013-11-15,I am so absolutely over this,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qojsz/i_am_so_absolutely_over_this/,"Hey community. I need to come clean. I am a stupid drinker. I wasn't always this way but I have been for a long time now. I am not a daily drinker. I am an every other day drinker. I drink on day a and recover on day b. 
A little back history.. I hated college my freshman year. I had no friends and hermited myself in my room. I felt anxious every second. Eventually I joined a theatre group and started coming out of my shell. After productions we went out to a local bar to drink. Great, I am underage and this bar is serving me, what is this, alcohol? I never drank in highschool. This is awesome. Wait, now I have a bunch of new friends. And a smoking hot girlfriend. Wow, how did life suddenly turn this amazing? So cool. Now I am involved in all kinds of activities. I am an actor, straight A student and I have friends. Why don't I get some internships. I interned at Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which led to a summer job at nbc Olympics in athens. I am on top of my game. Oh so a couple times I had to call out ""sick"" because I was too hungover to come in. 

Whatever I was in college, it was the norm. So I drink and drink, mostly on weekends. I graduate magma cum laude and president of my honor society. I win an award for best college DJ in nyc. I do another Olympics in Italy. Show up everyday basically hung over. Smoking cigarettes wont hurt. Come home addicted to hash to my new awesome job as a radio producer at the biggest station in the top market. So cool, i am untouchable! Free concerts and drinks? Hell yea sign me up. Drinking drinking drinking. Cant come into my awesome job, too hungover. Fired from my awesome job. 

Whatever I dont have a problem. Lets just do something completely different. Teach for America sounds good. They only accept the best and brightest. Lets go to Houston and change some kids lives. Oh wait nope. I have to be sent home because I got really ""sick"" and drunk everyday. Whatever I still have my loving fiance. No wait, she dumped me because I got trashed at her aunt's house on alcohol and cold medicine. Yea, maybe its time to go to rehab. Let me drink the first day I get out. 

Back to rehab. Finally I have some clean time. I am back teaching, I love teaching. If a just smoke pot everyday I can stay ""clean"". Well no not good enough. Lets do some oxy. No more oxy? Heroin is cool. Whatever I am not shooting just sniffing. No problem. Ran through all of my limited money fast.. better steal some money from the petty cash drawer to get me by.

 Oh and I am fired. Sweet. No more oxy or weed. Oh alcohol.. you have been there all along and I forgot about you. lets go to the mental health clinic for anxiety as a smoke screen for alcohol. I can't go back home unless I get help? Ok mental health outcare it is. These people are crazy, I am not crazy. Better start drinking while I am at this program. They don't notice until I don't know, the fourth time. And I am being sent back to rehab. Wait no I cant, they don't have funding this month. And here I am. waiting on funding for next month. I can't go this month so I better drink as much as I can now before I go. 
Well hell no. I am tired. I am done. I can't do this shit anymore. I know I can't drive but how can I stay sober for three weeks? I didn't drink today. I don't want to drink tomorrow. Good lord, what is wrong with me? I am at my wits end. I actually do have severe anxiety and drinking only helps solve it for a moment and makes it so much worse the next day. So yea, I am new. but I want to stay and become old,  sober. I have no other option. Death or institutionalized are my only other options. I cant do it. I am going to rehab next month but I have to wait. I need help now. Anyway,  thanks for reading. Advice is always welcome."
1qoja9,3,2013-11-15,I [21 M] need help with dealing with my very religious family,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qoja9/i_21_m_need_help_with_dealing_with_my_very/,"Sorry if this is lengthy, but I really need some insight.

I've always questioned theism. Growing up in a strictly Catholic household has hindered and continues to hinder my ability to live a more worry free life. Let me explain:

This is my junior year in college and my first year away at a university, away from my parents. They knew I wasn't going to go to church because I never ever had expressed interest in going and always put up a fight as to ""why"" it's necessary. Whenever I come home to see my parents on weekends or holidays, the topic always comes up as to why I should believe in God and Jesus Christ. My mom has asked me to read books regarding ""eucharistic miracles"" (Specifically the one that happened in Poland recently with the piece of bread), and while definitely interesting, it doesn't change my view at all. 

I'm a very hard fact, concrete kind of person. If I come out and say that I am atheist, my entire family will scold me. I do not want to sacrifice my relationship with my siblings just because I do not believe in an entity that controls our lives. I like to believe that I have the power to make the most of my life, and that my successes aren't attributed to ""luck"" or someone beyond my understanding.

Example: I recently accepted a very well paid internship at a fortune 500 company, which will most likely result in me getting a jump start on my career. On top of that, I had THREE other interviews for internships with other major firms. Never in the past 6 months have I prayed to God to help me get these internships. God wasn't on my mind when I was speaking with the recruiters, God wasn't on my mind when I was re-writing my resume, God wasn't on my mind when I landed the internship 2 hours after my interview. I simply *worked my fucking ass off*. However, once I told my mom about this, she of course said ""see, God is looking out for you but you're turning your back on him.""

This pissed me off to outer space. Never once did she compliment me on the fact that I beat out thousands of other applicants for this job by my charisma, hard work, or intelligence that I have *gained on my own over the years*. It's always God's plan. No, fuck that. What about the poor girl I work with who never got a call from that company? She is a devoted Christian, yet she didn't get a single call from any companies. 

Basically, I pretend to be still somewhat Catholic by not telling my parents how I truly feel. I'm not sure if they're playing dumb or not, but its pretty clear that I have no interest in bombarding my future children with religion. This is especially hard for my dad to accept, because all he cares about is family tradition, and the fact that he doesn't want his grandchildren with his last name to go to ""hell"". 

My main concern is that I'm hurting my parents and family by not believing the same thing as them, when simply I do not care for religion. Religion can definitely be a good thing since it brings communities together for the greater good (usually), but I don't need to belong to a religion to be a good person. I can just as easily go and help build homes in Africa with a group of atheists.

Lastly, my parents strongly associate my brother's recovery from cocaine addiction to religion. I agree with them on the fact that since he surrounded himself with positive people with the same common goal, he was able to pull himself out of it. I do not believe, however, that God had anything to do with this. Even though I've never been an addict, I can only assume that someone who is desperately reaching in the dark for a string to hold on to will grab any one that leads them out of a pit, and that's exactly what my brother did.

**TL;DR -  My family is Catholic as fuck, I'm the only one that isn't. How the hell do I ever get through to them or go about my life without burning bridges?**

Thank you so much for reading, if you did."
1qohm0,1,2013-11-15,I [22 M] broke up with my girlfriend [23 F] of five years last year after she cheated. Now I'm interested in a woman [23 F] with a boyfriend [25 M].,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qohm0/i_22_m_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_five/,"There are two parts to this story because I think the second is dependent on the first.

First, I started dating my girlfriend in high school. I hadn't anticipated dating anyone before college since I intended to move far away, which I did. She was an exception after I fell madly in love with her. Our relationship developed and matured over the next five years, most of which was spent long distance (rough, but it was worth it).

After 4.5 years together, we were beginning to talk about marriage. I intended to go to grad school, and she was planning to take on a job. We were both looking in the same cities, even though some of them presented fewer opportunities for each of us, but better for the other. Things seemed to be going really well; we were planning for the future, always happy to see and talk with each other, and were becoming a part of each others' families.

Long story short, she started an internship and found a guy who could invest more time into her than I could long distance. After pressing her about a few late nights she had spent with him, I had her send me conversations between them. In their conversations, she repeatedly disparaged me and showed that she no longer held any respect for me. I was devastated. The person I had trusted as my partner and closest friend had just shown that she didn't actually hold me in as high regard as I held her. We (supposedly) loved each other, but she attacked my character behind my back.

After two days of seeing how we could work it out, I decided to break it off. I wouldn't be able to trust her with her ""friends"" anymore, which is a key part of any long distance relationship. My doubt and her lack of respect would only be a burden in the long run. It was the hardest, most heartbreaking decision of my life.

I was inconsolable for a week, and my grades tanked that semester (incredibly important for my grad school plans).

That was one year ago, and I'm now in grad school and loving it. I love my classes, classmates, and atmosphere. In particular, there is one girl who has been catching my attention.

The first couple weeks of class, I worked hard to get to know as many people as possible in our relatively small class. She was one of the quieter students who took awhile to approach. We hit it right off the bat.

Our personalities, humor, philosophies, and values lined up unbelievably. Every chance we got alone, we would talk about everything from sports to ethical theories, from politics to our family relationships. I've never been so fascinated and, to be honest, attracted to someone before.

The problem is, she already has a boyfriend. I did not find this out until a few weeks into our discussions. They've been dating for about five years, from what I can gather, having attended the same high school and undergraduate program, but now he lives 3 hours away.

I am worried that I am doing the same thing with her that the coworker did with my ex.

I've already taken her to dinner (paid separately) and dancing alone (dancing did not go as planned, but we laughed about it), and she seems to be equally interested in me.

Should I continue to pursue this relationship? I want her to be happy, and I don't want to hurt the guy, so should I encourage their relationship? Should I work to remove any romantic thoughts of her? Should I be prepared to pick her up when thing are on the outs with her boyfriend?

---

TL;DR My ex-gf cheated on me with a guy during a long distance relationship, and I'm worried about pursuing a relationship with a woman who is already in a long distance relationship."
1qo71e,0,2013-11-14,Looking for insight on how to approach big4 internship possibility... (Sorry long...),[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qo71e/looking_for_insight_on_how_to_approach_big4/,"   So a bit of background on myself before my questions, I started college because I was told too and ended up doing horribly and dropping out for a while before eventually realizing that it was the rest of my life and I needed to stop screwing around and buckle down (this may be relevant later...). After trying a few different majors I fell in love with Accounting, not surprising as the logical accounting brain runs in my family(Sister rocked a 4.0 through college and passed CPA first try with flying colors). After lurking on here for a few months I have learned to make sure I network with people and get to know my professors and such as well as I can. This leads me to my main points.

   I mentioned who my sister was to my professors based on her suggestion and they were all thrilled to have me and have been a huge help through all my classes. I don't have many questions or issues with accounting so far but the few I do they are always happy to help. They have always kind of asked/pushed to hear what my plans were after school, CPA and such. I always kind of figured i'd stick to my smallish town and just get my CPA and find a nice firm here... Both my tax professor and intermediate professor were never happy when I mentioned this, insisting I would do outstanding in a bigger firm environment(read as a big4). After thinking about it and talking with my sister I decided that I think it would be a really good idea to intern with a big4 if possible and give it my all to see how well I can do with my career and not limit myself to this town. My professors were thrilled and offered to get me in contact with a couple other Graduates in one of the big4 and in return were able to get my their email and the email of the recruiters in a few of my top pick offices(which the grads are in or used to be in).

   That all being said, recruiters don't really make it to my school often we had some a few years ago but since haven't gotten any, so this is kind of my main shot it looks like. I would love to hear some suggestions on how to approach this situation. Obviously I need to get in contact with the grads since they are the ones with which my professors got in contact and spoke so highly about me. Should I email the recruiters directly and just get my name known? Or network with the grads for a while first? Or both? Should I include copy of my resume right away or wait until asked/networked a bit? Anything specifically I should try to mention in these email conversations? As I said I originally did not do well in my first few semesters in return I had dropped to a 1.6 GPA. Since I focused on my school though I have pulled it back up to a 3.1(after this semester) with a 3.9 in my accounting classes thus far. How will this effect any opportunities in this situation and should I try to mention accounting GPA first if asked/showing on my Resume? In the email the professor received the contact mentioned that the offices I asked about as well as most big4 are filled up for this year, but I should definitely push for 2015 any suggestions on what to do between now and then to help the situation?

   Thanks to everyone in advance. I know this got long but looking for some advice and ive read some great stuff on this subreddit so hoping I can get some help too!"

1qo3qr,4,2013-11-14,Do I need grad school?,EndiaBanana,compling,https://www.reddit.com/r/compling/comments/1qo3qr/do_i_need_grad_school/,"I'm currently in college dual majoring in linguistics and computer science, so when I graduate I should have a BA in Linguistics and a BS in Computer Science. I'm thinking about going for an MA in CompLing from University of Washington. 

There are three reasons I'm thinking about getting this MA: First, to tie together the two fields in a more coherent way and better prepare me for a career in computational linguistics. Second, for networking opportunities among other computational linguists and to get internships. And third, because I think having an MA makes me that much more employable. 

What I'm wondering is: with undergrad degrees in both comp sci and linguistics, would I be overqualified for grad school? And would having both of these degrees separately make me highly employable anyway without a graduate degree? The pattern I am seeing is that a lot of people go to grad school in this field to compensate for a lack of undergrad experience in one of the aspects of CompLing, more often the CS side of it.

1qnu4s,0,2013-11-14,I just want to learn.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1qnu4s/i_just_want_to_learn/,"Engineering, electrical engineering more specifically, was a choice I made 5 years ago in high school.
For 3 years I studied telecommunications technology, despite having lazy, incompetent and arrogant teachers, and completed the program.


 (Context: Here one must complete a 2 or 3 year technical or pre-university program before attending university)


I then got accepted in and started my electrical engineering bachelor's degree , for real, this was it, this is where I would be in contact with legitimate education. This is where my thirst for knowledge would be quenched.


I was then a little surprise, the pace of my classes was rather...well slow. Maybe it's because not everyone comes from an electrical background, yeah that must be it. Teachers are pretty horrible at explaining pretty basic concepts. Good thing I can learn on my own.. Autodidact and thirst for knowledge, I thought those where average human traits.

As time goes by, the thought comes back, why are so many people having so much trouble? I can't ask, I can't say I think it's easy, don't want to be that guy, the showoff of the bunch. Can I be proud of my results? Not really, at least not publicly. I'm not working very hard and jealousy is an unstoppable plague of hatred...  *""We won't ever use this in real life anyway, it's just about the paper""*


Play the game, until achievement unlocked: Bachelor's degree.

The paper, they think it's the goal. But they do not see that it means nothing more than the debt they're are putting themselves in, it's a lie, a void,  a sum of time spent cramming and vomiting things you never took the time to understand. It's nothing if you make nothing of it.



Well payed internships and even job offers have fallen into my lap with little effort. I get asked for tips and tricks, as if there's a cheat code for getting the job... I just wanted to learn stuff.

1qnstv,204,2013-11-14,A Quick Guide to the New 52,snesknight,DCcomics,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1qnstv/a_quick_guide_to_the_new_52/,"I see a lot of people asking about what the titles of the New 52 are like, and about. So I decided to make a quick guide for the N52, to help everyone out. 

**Justice League**:

* Justice League: The adventures of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg! These heroes come together to fight for the Earth and defend the people. Very fun, action series. 

* Aquaman: Aquaman and Mera’s tales defending Boston and the water’s of the Earth. Good humor, fun plots, and great action. If you think Aquaman is “lame”, check this out, and remember, he DOESN’T talk to fish.

* The Flash: The Fastest man alive faces old friends, talking gorilla’s, and learns more about his source of power: The Speed Force. Starts off slow, but has amazing art to support it, and it does get better.

* Wonder Woman: Amazon princess; “Wonder Woman”, learns about her new family, and does all she can to protect her new friend. Lovely art, great plot. Very disconnected with the rest of the DC universe.

* *Justice League of America*: A.R.G.U.S forms a team that can not only serve America’s interests, but if needed, take down the Justice League! Team consists of: Steve Trevor, Martian Manhunter, Stargirl, Vibe, Katana, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Catwoman and Green Lantern, Simon Baz. Great characters and ways of teamwork, fun read.

1qnrib,7,2013-11-14,Major GPA vs Cumulative GPA,clumpcha,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qnrib/major_gpa_vs_cumulative_gpa/,"Disclaimer: I am well aware that networking and work experience are the most important things so I'm not asking about that.

I am wondering just how much of an impact your major gpa (gpa from only accounting courses) will have on landing you an internship or will look on your resume. As someone with a low cumulative GPA (2.4 currently) but have not taken any accounting classes at all yet. How much hope do I have theoretically if I somehow get straight A's in my accounting classes or at the very least get a very high gpa. Can I still make it in the industry? "

My name is Crystal and I really need help raising funds for my summer internship. Hopefully you guys can help me! 
I've actually never posted to reddit before so this is kinda awkward.....I'm coming here to post this because sharing this with my friends and family has been a complete fail. Now, before anyone gets upset, (because I've received a lot of hate already for this) Please know that I am not asking for the full goal amount on this website.
 I do work full time, but I also go to school full time and pay for it completely out of pocket. 
My family is very opposed to me making this trip. Every time I even bring it up to them they laugh about it. They don't really think I can accomplish this goal. They're also very stuck amongst themselves. They're all about helping each other and preach constantly about the importance of helping your family, but when I asked around for maybe a few aunts and uncles and cousins to give about 10 bucks, they all flipped. They actually think it's a scam and that I'm scamming people for money, because I don't want to work for myself. But the truth is, I'm not. I'm a firm believer in getting off your ass and working for what you want. However in this case, it's just coming up short. It's just a lot of money in a short amount of time, and I'm just concerned because I haven't been getting a lot of hours at work. Really what I want, is for people to share the link. I have a hope that if I share enough times, maybe someone out there will see it and decide to give a little something. Please don't think that by reading this that you have to give me your money. I get that I am not a charity, I am not feeding starving children and saving lives, but I am working hard to achieve a long time dream, and when else am I going to get the opportunity to intern in London? I feel beyond weird for even making a fund raising site like this, but any and all help is beyond appreciated.

I have already applied for an IAESTE (an organization, which is exchanging students for technical work experience abroad) internship and now I want to do speculative applications for any german or english speaking company i can find. However I'm at a loss how to proceed. I seem to be unable to find any contact persons. How do I locate them?

1qs6lo,1,2013-11-16,I left my comfort zone and it broke my heart. Now I don't know what to think.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qs6lo/i_left_my_comfort_zone_and_it_broke_my_heart_now/,"Here’s something that has been bothering me recently. 

For most of my life, I’ve been straight. I’m not sure if this is the right way to put it, but I was downright terrified of being with another woman. So much in fact, that my best friend, let’s call him Z, labeled me as “the straightest person you’ll ever meet.” Lovely, I know. 

At the beginning of this year, I picked up an internship out of state and was thrown into a situation where I knew absolutely no one. That’s when I met another intern, who would end up being the best and worst thing that has happened to me. 

She was quite a bit smaller than I was at the time, had short hair and the most stunning eyes I’ve ever seen. It was the first time in my life I had met another woman I considered unbelievably attractive. She also made a point to smile and wink at me every time we passed each other. Part of me was rather uncomfortable with it, but deep inside I was filled with curiosity. 

Sure enough, the stress of the job pushed us closer together. We formed a rock solid bond. Everyone in the company would have agreed that we were the best of friends.

And I fell head over heels in love with her. 

We did everything together. On our off days, she would drive across town to where I was staying to see me. She gave me hugs when I was stressed, wonderful back and neck massages when I was tired. A couple times, when our jobs required us to stay late, I went home with her. When the internship ended, she drove me to the airport. The last contact I had with her was a long, quite sensual hug before I flew back home. 

After a few months, I went back just to spend time with her. We made plans for to hang out, and when the day came, she completely blew me off. I spent the entire day waiting for her, but she never showed up. I texted her with the last shred of hope I was holding onto and told her that if she really wanted to see me, we should try again the next day. She said okay. 

I spent the rest of my vacation alone. I haven’t talked to her since.

When I came back home, Z and I went to a bar a few miles away from my house. It was one of our favorite spots and the female bartender, who is lesbian, had been hitting on me since we started going there. Thanks to the internship, I looked at her in a completely new light and instead of brushing off her flirtatious nature, I soaked it all in, and even flirted back. I left that night with her full name and number.

She accepted my Facebook friend request, and after a few moments of creeping, I learned she had a girlfriend. It was all good though. Now, I didn’t have to stress about pursuing a relationship. I could focus on being the best friend I could be.

We ended up working out a few times together and everything was going great. One day, we planned to go out for coffee. I wanted to talk to her about the intern girl because of all people, she would probably understand what I was going through the best. 

Well, coffee plans got cancelled. No big deal really, shit happens. 

The next time I texted her, we were having a really awesome conversation and I finally asked her if she wanted to reschedule our coffee plans. She suddenly stopped texting me. This happened over and over until it became blatantly obvious that she would stop texting me when I asked to hang out. Now here’s where it gets more strange. The next time Z and I went to the bar, she was there. She mentioned to me that she really wanted to hang out with me and that we should totally plan something. 

Cool, whatever. We made plans to hang out a few days later, which happened to be her birthday. They were solid plans too. Date, time, location, all that jazz. 

I spent the day slaving over some special birthday cookies, then, an hour or so before we were supposed to meet up, I texted her to confirm and she didn’t text me back. I asked a few times but got nothing. 

Having wasted my time again, I asked Z if he wanted to go to the bar. I knew she wouldn’t be working on her birthday and that was almost comforting, considering I was terribly pissed.

Well, she came by with her girlfriend... I tried not to notice her but they approached us and made it out like nothing was wrong. Z is probably the only reason I didn’t blow up on her. 

I stopped going to the bar. According to Z, she has asked about me, and why I don’t come around anymore.  

I’ve been thinking about her and the intern girl a lot lately. They tore my heart to shreds. Every now and then I’ll hear a song, see a place, or meet someone with the same name and all the emotion comes rushing back. It hurts and I’m not sure how to make it stop. I can’t help but think that one of the friendships would have worked out if I would have done something differently. Sure, the bartender had a crazy obsessive girlfriend, but that shouldn’t have stopped us from being friends. 

Part of me blames the bartender and part of me blames her girlfriend. I want to go back to that bar on a night when she works, with an extremely hot guy. Only to passionately make out with him and completely ignore her. Because I know it would crush her on the inside. Just like her and the intern crushed me. 

I guess I’m a terrible person. 

TL;DR - My first two girl crushes broke my heart, but I can’t stop thinking about them. Maybe I’m better off sticking with men. "
1qrwfe,1,2013-11-16,"ADVICE NEEDED: Years ago I used to practice NoFap and was successful, now I am back.",DateofLies,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1qrwfe/advice_needed_years_ago_i_used_to_practice_nofap/,"This is my introductory post. 25 year old North American male. As this is the internet and everyone is busy, I am going to make everything point form.


1) I am extremely happy this forum/community exists, I feel I need support to succeed in this. 


2) Years ago I had the support of another community but I quit that place since I didn't fit there anymore. Yes I am talking about the PUA community, learned some valuable things there but I've now happily settled down with a great woman so that is behind me. However, since this success, I have restarted masturbating to porn regulating again.


3) The reason I stopped masturbating years ago was to motivate me to meet women. It worked, though it did make my life a bit unbalanced. I met my current gf during this period so I have no regrets, but I also got fired from my then great job (fueled by testosterone, was partying way too much). Both things happened at the same time.

4) I am 'back on my feet', I'm finishing my master's degree and have had two internships to boost my references and put the bad one in the past. 

5) I am currently looking for full-time employment in my field, however the positions are very limited and while I've been in the final round for many positions, I got passed over. There are extremely qualified people applying and while I feel I am up to par, I've so far failed. 

6) The reason I have come to seek support and stop masturbating: 

-It gives me a TREMENDOUS amount of energy.

-It makes me very social and friendly, I have an aura of positive and stimulating energy.

-This is great for INTERVIEWS and NETWORKING SITUATIONS, it's worked in the past (back when I was abstaining and recently when I managed to cut the habit for a few days). I feel I need this boost to get my dream job, but it's hard to keep at it, especially after I get turned on for a position and the inevitable stress/disappointment that follows.

-It helps me be more productive, active, fit, and keeps me from procrastinating and laying on the couch all day.

7) **PROBLEMS [ADVICE NEEDED]**:

-While abstaining, I have a tendency to be extremely flirty with colleagues, it's bad form since I'm in a relationship.
People, including women, are more attracted to me while I am in this 'high positive energy state', I feel like there's a risk that I cheat on my gf and ruin my relationship, even if I love her very much.

-I need much less sleep than in periods while I'm masturbating regularly: is this healthy?

-I am generally more aggressive, confrontational, and exhibit riskier behavior, though I am generally in a better and more social mood so it's usually okay.

-I always relapse after about a week (though now that I've found this community and I'm more serious about it, I hope to keep at it.)

-The moment I MOST feel like masturbating is right after sex. I'm not sure why, but it's very hard not to. Any experience with this?

8) I feel I need to be able to properly channel this energy into my job hunt and away from sex/women, any advice on how to stay disciplined?

Thanks for reading, any help/advice is appreciated. Happy to be part of this group."
1qrtli,616,2013-11-16,PS4 Launch - A discussion on failure rates.,xanaos,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/,"There is a lot of discussion in regards to the PS4 launch, notably the post at the top of /r/games [as of this writing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qq7ye/new_claims_of_ps4_red_line_of_death_beginning_to/) Some people seem to herald these failures of consoles as the end of the PS4 before it even begins, and for these people, perception is reality - with the posted reviews on Amazon (nearly 300 out of 775 reviews) claiming DOA units, some are quick to say this is a catastrophic failure on Sony's part. Let's stop and take a look at past events.

[A lengthy article from VentureBeat goes into depth on the 360 failure rates](http://venturebeat.com/2008/09/05/xbox-360-defects-an-inside-history-of-microsofts-video-game-console-woes/) with this quote that stands out in particular:

""According to Microsoft’s internal data, the assumption for the long term was that 6 percent or 7 percent of the consoles would be defective before shipping into the market, meaning the yield would be about 94 percent or 93 percent.""

The grammar on this quote leaves some wiggle room for semantics, such as is that a 6%-7% failure on arrival or after time? So let's take a figure that microsoft claimed after the console released (taken from an article written in 2007) - ""[As for Microsoft, in the early days after the console's 2005 launch it claimed that failure rates were no higher than an industry average of between 3% and 5%](http://web.archive.org/web/20080112091522/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/may/31/guardianweeklytechnologysection)""

Taking into account this, and other articles, The PS4 is doing [significantly better with a claimed 0.4% failure of units shipped](http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/14/5105438/sony-ps4s-technical-problems-are-isolated-to-0-4-of-units-shipped)

Now, with that being said, we can't really get a full picture of what is going on with PS4 failure rates until we see numbers of units shipped and customers who have had DOAs/failures have the numbers recorded.

This is also the first launch of a device of it's kind this highly anticpated since the last big big console came out.  Gaming culture has expanded significantly since that time.  Amazon had sold out of PS4 weeks before launch [despite having quite a few consoles.](http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/600517-image-shows-thousands-of-ps4s-ready-for-shipment-from-amazon) Jack Tretton say that there will be ""adequate supplies through the holiday season"", despite the fact that [Sony forecasts 3 million consoles sold by year's end, with 5 million by March.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-11/sony-sees-sales-of-3-million-playstation-4-consoles-by-year-end.html) These are huge numbers, with the 360 happy to claim 1.5M by year's end 2005, and 3.1M by March 2006. So my question is, how many units were shipped at launch, and what are the failure rates? We're talking nearly half a million units a week - and most of those should have been already produced before launch. 

I do apologize for using the 360 launch as an example in the PS4 launch - I do hate to spurn on fanboy-ism - but it is the most well documented launch to date, with many investigators digging into it after the RRoD issues cropped up. However, despite the issues it has faced, it ranks right next to PS3 in terms of total sales worldwide (even though it completely demolished the poorly launched PS3 in the NA market).

Thoughts?

**tl;dr: Is the spotlight on PS4 hardware launch failures justified?**

/u/carlosspicywe1ner sums up [how I'm sure we all feel about this whole deal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qrtli/ps4_launch_a_discussion_on_failure_rates/cdfvmul). Sorry Carlos, but you, your spicy we1ner and the rest of us will probably have to deal with this issue when the Xbox One comes out.

EDIT 4:
It appears as if the spotlight on hardware failure may not be justified, with [1 million consoles sold in NA in the first 24 hours of the console's release](https://twitter.com/yosp/status/402014678244524032). Four days [and counting](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/launch) until the next uprising of angry consumers, Microsoft haters, lovers, and gamers come together to congregate, commiserate and comment on the launch. 

A request for the mods - Would it be possible to get a post like this one put up for the 360 launch at the first sign of any launch issues - linking sites and articles regarding failure rates, unit sold, etc to avoid the semi-mess /r/games became after the launch?"
1qrs7p,0,2013-11-16,Sony’s PS4 is made with the blood and tears of unpaid blackmailed student laborers,[deleted],xboxone,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1qrs7p/sonys_ps4_is_made_with_the_blood_and_tears_of/,"Not posting this to slam the PS4 or Sony.  Seems like all large tech corporations (including MS) are guilty of outsourcing manufacturing to Chinese companies with dubious human rights track records. I stumbled across this when trying to find out which companies are manufacturing both consoles to see if there was any overlap as I am concerned the XO might suffer similar hardware problems to what we've been seeing with the PS4.

Anyhow, if the PS4 really is being put together by blackmailed student interns at Foxconn then it should be no surprise that quality has suffered. Shit, if I was forced to work unpaid I'd be doing everything I could to sabotage the production effort.

Thankfully, Foxconn are not heavily involved in the XO manufacturing effort. From what I have been able to find Flextronics are taking point. However, that is cold comfort as God only knows what crazy shit all these various companies have pulled in an effort to meet their production quotas. 
It is unclear what percentage of PS4s are defective, so it remains to be seen how serious the problem is. However, the bottom line for those of us waiting on our new XBox consoles is that we should expect higher than normal failure rates at launch.  The poor bastards putting these devices together are not treated well.  If I get a defective XO I will try to remember that no matter how much that situation sucks, the people who made it have it much, much worse.  Perspective FTW.

Good luck everyone.

TL;DR Hope for the best but prepare for the worst."

A little bit about myself:
24M. I have a technical degree in electronics (not college degree), and Bachelor's degree in English language, so technically i could be a teacher of English as a foreign language (it is not my native language).


I've always thought that there was something wrong with me. I try to be nice, but i don't really get along with other people. I'm especially good at blewing job interviews. I really enjoy reading American literature, I'm not too bad at writing (currently working on my first novel in my native language), I don't think I'm good enough at making it in English. I enjoy writing and translating stuff. I'm really stressed out about having a job in which constant social interaction with new people is a must.


I have almost no work experience. Aside from experience which I've aquired during learning process, I've done one paid internship, now facing a possibility of another, but we all know it's a dead end. 


Dear reddit, what are my options ?

1qqqrz,8,2013-11-15,New grad struggling to make a plan,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1qqqrz/new_grad_struggling_to_make_a_plan/,"I'm a 25 y/o new grad as of August this year and recently got a job that starts in January. I discovered this subreddit shortly after graduating and have been lurking and learning as much as I can. Now that I know how much I'll be making I'm trying to come up with what I should be doing with my earnings and I'm overwhelmed as I have a number of different things going on. 

I have around 12.5k in student loans and 10.5k in CC debt (first thing I'm taking care of via avalanche method). I've decided to live at my parents' for at least the first 6 months so I can keep costs low and pay off my debts as fast as possible. My parents are also letting me use a car for a couple of months, but I will need to get one of my own sooner rather than later. It's a '98 Wrangler (17mpg) and a 18.5 mi commute each way = costly, plus my parents would use it if I wasn't so I don't want to take advantage of them.

The last piece is that I will be getting engaged next year to someone who has around 250k in vet school debt. And the huge debt is what I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what to do with. She graduates in May 2014 and begins a year long internship making probably &lt;$35k. May 2015 or so she starts working as a vet hopefully making around 65-70k. I was thinking the best course of action was for both of us to live off my salary and put her entire salary into her loans. Not sure if there's a better plan. I don't know how much her costs will be once she graduates and begins the internship. She will be living at a different location than me during that year.

I've tried to list out a detailed  account of everything below.

**Job**

* 73000 salary
* 3000 starting bonus
* 1 to 1 match up to 3% Simple IRA

According to online net salary calculator after tax, medical and 3% IRA contribution I'll have: **$3800 per month ($45,600 per year)**

**Personal Debt**

* $2600 22.99%
* $8000 10.99%
* $7000 6.8%
* $5500 3.4%

**Sig Other Debt**

* $60,450   7.9%
* $155,916  6.8%
* $12,134   6.41%
* $20,516   5.41%

**Upcoming Costs (starting January)**

* $200-250 monthly gas (estimated) 17mpg, 18.5 one way commute. Not really taking into account other travel.
* $100 monthly food (chip in towards parents)
* Car - not sure how much to spend/finance, thinking a sedan/hatchback with good mpg, would be nice for it to be ""fun"" (mazda3 or similar for example), but not an absolute requirement. Need no later than May-April 2014, but may be more cost effective sooner considering mpg.
* Auto insurance - on the purchased car only
* Engagement ring
* Sig other living expense (May)

So with all that, I'm just not sure how to allocate what money where and how much to save (emergency fund, car, retirement, invest) vs put towards loans. And I don't want to make a mistake when we have this amount of debt. Also being as it will take 8-9 years (if paid aggressively with her total salary going towards them) from when I start working for us to pay off the debt, where should I be putting my salary? If I put everything remaining from my salary after both of our living expenses into loans as well, neither one of us would be putting it into 401ks or retirement, compound interest, etc. And that feels like a bad move. I basically wouldn't have started saving until I'm 35 which everyone seems to say is a terrible idea. Not to mention it'd be nice to actually live a little and have fun, maybe travel before we have kids in our 30s.

1qu4kg,16,2013-11-17,"I went to the hospital for an ovarian cyst rupture, and I left feeling violated and traumatized.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1qu4kg/i_went_to_the_hospital_for_an_ovarian_cyst/,"First off, I'm 21, and about a year ago, I was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst. When I went back for a second ultrasound (transvaginal, both times), they confirmed that I indeed had a cyst, on my left ovary. It had a solid mass, and it had grown from 2 cm^2 to 5 cm^2.

Yesterday, I started my internship, and spent 5 hours bending, squatting, and standing. I went to my sister's afterwards, and when I went to stand up, I felt a searing pain in my pelvis, like a dull knife being pushed against the inside of my uterus, but not breaking through, just running up and down. So, I sat down, and waited for it to pass, after all, it wasn't the first time I've had that pain, I just never knew what caused it before, and my mom always told me I pulled a muscle.

When the pain finally subsided, I contorted my body enough to stand without pain, and managed to start walking, but when I stood up straight, the pain was excruciating, like someone was pulling my uterus out of my body. My sister gave me some motrin, and I drove myself home. When I got in the door, I put my face down and just scream-cried into the back of the recliner, huddled over from the pain. It was much worse than in the past.

I called my doctor's office answering service, since it was a Saturday, late afternoon, and got a call back telling me to go to the ER. My gram left work, came home, and took me to the hospital. They asked a couple questions, sent me to a room, and had me change into a hospital gown.

Soon, a doctor entered the room, a male in blue scrubs. He asked if I had a cyst that I knew of. I said, yes. He asked when I was diagnosed with it. I told him, ""about a year ago, and when I went ba-."" ""Well, ovarian cysts are very common in young women and the come and go with their menstrual cycles, so it's highly unlikely that it's the same cyst from a year ago."" Then he told me to sit back on the hospital bed.

He put a second hospital gown on my legs as a blanket, then tossed a folded sheet over, and then listened to my breathing for a moment, then told me to lift up, as he tugged at my hospital gown, and he just lifted it up to expose my naked pelvis, then reached down and touched my lower abdomen and my mons.

I just sat there with my hands up by my shoulders, in shock of what was going on. Then he said he had to contact gynecology for an ultrasound, and he left.

I just pressed my legs closed and folder my arms over tight. I felt violated. I didn't have a chance to ask for a female doctor. He didn't ask if it was okay if he touched me. He didn't tell me what he was going to do, as I was always accustomed to. (i.e. ""Is it okay if I lift your shirt in the back?"")

When the nurse came in, I was given vicodin, and she told me I was getting a pelvic ultrasound, which I thought was strange. My gram said ""She's not too thrilled with having a male doctor."" But the nurse said there were no female doctors on staff tonight. I was so frustrated.

Then the ultrasound technician that came in, told me we would start with a pelvic, then do a transvaginal, depending on what she sees. I told her about the cyst from a year ago, and the follow up, and the size. She listened, and asked questions.

In the room, she told me what she was going to do before touching me. She gave clear, gentle instructions, and she gave me washcloths and a new gown to change into when it was done.

Then I went back to my room. The ultrasound technician and the doctor were talking in the hallway and I heard pieces of the conversation, and that made me all the more freaked out. ""5 cm"" ""with no blood?!"" ""and a smaller, more complex one.""

I waited in the room for almost an hour, and no one came in to talk to me. I just sat there crying. Crying because I felt violated. And crying because I didn't know what was going on.

When the doctor finally came in, he talked to me as if I was the reason he didn't know the details of my last tumor. ""You do have a cyst on your left ovary. It seems after I left, you said the cyst from a year ago was more complicated than a normal cyst."" He told me that 7.5 cm is a large cyst, and that mine was 5 cm, so there's no need to worry. Then he said, here I'll show you, and drew two circles on a paper, saying this is what your cyst looks like, this is what 7.5 cm is. (Really? You don't say...)

He told me to follow up with gynecology on Monday and left again. I changed out of my hospital gown, back into my clothes, and waited until the nurse came in and told me I would be discharged when the paperwork was done.

I feel like the trip was a complete waste. I didn't learn anything new. I was traumatized, and spoken to like I was stupid.

**Edit** For clarification, I would have felt just as violated by any doctor behaving this way. However, I definitely feel less comfortable with male doctors for this issue, but that's more of a confidence issue on my part.

I also want to clarify, I don't think he was trying to harm me, I think he honestly just wasn't thinking about the consequences of such abrupt actions, due to the number of years he's been there (at least 20, he treated me when I was a toddler), and the number of people that come in and out of the ER each night, which makes it easy to mechanize the treatment of people."
1qu3ck,9,2013-11-17,I need to make a thermocycler. Is this even feasible with an Arduino board?,atggcgacaaca,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1qu3ck/i_need_to_make_a_thermocycler_is_this_even/,"I'm a science researcher, but my only engineering knowledge is from the past few hours of Googling. I'm trying to get a basic idea on the feasibility of my idea, but I'll probably have to hire an engineering intern smarter than myself to get it done.

I need to make an 8x8 array of Peltier tiles with the ability to heat/cool each one independently to a set temperature +/- 0.5 degrees Celcius. (The end product will resemble a thermal checkerboard.) Each tile will only be used between 23-37 degrees Celcius, and I'll be sure to limit temperature change to less than 1 degree per second, so I'm not too worried about stressing the tiles. I'm realizing that this is going to involve constant temperature feedback, and then power/polarity adjustments to each tile. The control and calibration of the tiles is going to be complicated enough, but I think I have a more pressing issue...

I'm not going to be able to control the power to 64 Peltier tiles with PWM (the only method I currently understand) as the biggest Arduino boards only have 15 PWM outputs. Is there a workaround for this? Is there a better method for controlling power to my tiles than PWM? I appreciate any advice on getting this idea off the ground!

Thanks in advance for the help!"

My family has been through a bit of a hardship with my dad losing his job, then moving to Montana to try to start a business with two guys he use to work with. While he was in Montana we had no income coming in to the house. I was finishing up college (with a full time unpaid internship), my mother is unable to work due to a shoulder injury, and my sister was unable to find work in our area. I was lucky enough to get a job through my college working 12 hours a week for minimum wage, which kept us fed. That job lasted two months (temp work). 

Dad came back in July and began looking for work, which is really hard to find in this area. He finally found a job and then our power was turned off. At the moment we're still trying to pay back house payments and get caught up with all the other bills that we have since he left. We were unable to make the payments so the bill reached a final total of $3,000. At this moment there is no way we can make the payment. No way at all. Without the power we don't have heat, water (we have a well), or lights. It's Michigan and it's getting cold here and it's really cold in the house at night. We've reached out to government aid with no assistance, as well as local charities. Without help there is no way that we will have power until tax time.. and at that point I'm afraid of pipes freezing and bursting. It's just a nightmare here, honestly.

Any help at all would be welcomed. Thank you so much, people of Reddit.

EDIT: Thanks to the charity of our local community I'm happy to say we now have power. "

I'm comfortable telling my boyfriend no, if I disagree. I'm comfortable telling the people closest to me no. But the less I know someone, the more guilty I feel.

I just sent an email quitting a part-time job I literally just started last week (sounds bad, but actually the easiest way to communicate with my boss). It was just a seasonal job, I was only working 16 hours a week, blah blah blah... but I feel like I'm leaving them in a lurch. My sister works in retail and says they overstaff at Christmas every year, and I shouldn't feel guilty because I have to do what's right for me.

I have good reasons. I got a job in my field (YAY!) so now I have other demands on my time and energy. I moved, so I'd have to travel an hour each way to hold this part-time job. The opportunity costs are just so huge that I can't ignore them.

But I do feel bad. I do this with lots of stuff- my internship director made massive demands on my time, when it was advertised as a 5-hour-a-week commitment. I said ""yes, of course"" every time she asked me to do something new, no matter how much it made me want to pull out my hair.

Does anybody else struggle to tell people no, especially at work? Do you feel incredibly guilty when you quit things?



TL;DR- I quit a job today. Quitting anything makes me feel unbearably guilty. Anybody else?"

Should I get back together with him for temporary happiness?
  (probably not, but I want advice on if it can still end on good terms, because I'm blind and dumb and could choose instant gratification for postponed heartache)
Even if we don't, How do I not be insanely jealous of him with another woman?
How do I get over that he broke up with me, and stop being so insecure?

Now say we do not get back together...

Should we have this conversation before or after one last go (it's inevitable).
Does anyone think IT'S VERY NECESSARY TO ABSOLUTELY NOT have one last go?
Love cast aside, can I be FWB?
I want sex. I want him as a friend. I don't want to be hurt again. I have other suitors. 

My ex/boyfriend and I had been dating for two years when he accepted his dream job, a 6 month internship in the Grand Canyon. Which I AM SO HAPPY FOR HIM. 

Completely and utterly in love, his friends and family love me, my friends and family love him, everyone thinks were made for each other, we do too, etc.
He breaks up with me because he couldn't make make happy anymore, 3 months into the long distance part (I'm from Philadelphia). I get why he broke up, but no one else does, and it does seem like a cop out. 

About a month and a half after we broke up, we finally talked.I told him if be couldn't get back together, I couldn't talk to him because it made it impossible to move on.

He wanted to be best friends and talk everyday, he missed me but agreed.
 A week after that I buckled said it was too hard to not talk. 
I needed to talk to my best friend even if I couldn't have him.


Fast forward to now, he comes home Monday/Tuesday until late March when he is gone permanently.
I don't start work until April. He an I have 3 months of free time now.
He also had sex with this girl out there, during the time we started talking again.
Shes beautiful and tiny. I'm 5'10'' Amazonian. 
She has a boyfriend.

This whole time I have said  I love him and that when he gets home, were going to hang out, were going to have sex, we will see each others families, we may as well be a couple. 
He wants to come home and have a long discussion but ultimately agreed it makes sense.

I WANTED THIS FOR SO LONG, and now, I'm afraid. I havent been leading him, I did want to be his, and I do love him so much as a person, but in the last week my emotions have made me crazy.

I'm less devastated than when he broke up with me.

 I went on three dates but told the guy, last week, that I need to figure things out with my ex.
 He completely understand, not pushy, gentleman, my type, and just got out of a 2 years relationship in September. I had a lot of fun with him, and he likes me a lot, but the new guy  is not a factor. I need to make this decisions about a guy I had great years with, not someone with whom I had a couple of great dates.


I want to see Erik's family,k and bring him to my cousins wedding in January, and go on a road trip . We both have time and money right now, so it makes sense. I know I'll get hurt again, I'm actually somewhat okay with it, I just want to make the best decision to be with him long term.


I'm also extremely jealous of this girl, Gabby, that he kissed a bunch and had sex with. 
I'm tall and curvy with blonde hair and blue eyes and my boobs are my best asset, but hes always been a butt guy.
Gabby is petite, with an exotic accent and an amazing butt. 
He always said loves my butt, but hers is better.
I know this shouldn't matter but shes making me crazy.
 I hate that he would have with someone that has a boyfriend, it goes against all of his morals. 

When everyone found out we broke up over Labor Day, they immediately asked if there was someone else because nothing else made sense to them. Especially if he was coming home in November, and we made it that far. He promises me she wasn't a factor but its still in my head. Every day. This fling with this girl irrationally consumes me.

I don't like the crazy girl I've become.
 We were texting about seeing Colorado today and he said
  ""It's gorgeous! I want to see you wearing lingerie with a ski hat and warm knee sock. With pig tails"" 
Something totally normal for us, except I lost it in my head. I could only think ""Gabby has a profile picture wearing pigtails.""

She posts on his FB wall ""safe travels"" messages, and etc, things that do not matter, and it makes me INSANE.
 I feel like shes rubbing it in my face.

 If we were serious about getting back with me he had to stop kissing her and he completely obliged. He had a conversation, and cut it off, but they worked together and were in the same hang out group. She said ""Why don't we have fun these last 3 weeks and then well be faithful."" It's just insulting. First of all he was single and didn't have to be faithful, shes just terrible.
I told him how crazy it makes me, I couldn't help it, and he will do anything to help me not be insecure and be confident again.
 He said he'd delete what she wrote, and message her to stop posting, which is nice, but I know its crazy for me to even ask that. LIKE WHO CARES ABOUT FACEBOOK, why does it even matter to me?

I'm also second guessing, does he just want his cake and eat it too. He really only wants me to do what makes him happy but it still goes through my head. He was there, had his fun. I was broken, and will take him back.

I don't know what to do.
 Should i get back together and be happy again?
 Even if its only for 3 months with him until April when well break up again (my terms, if he gets the job he is not coming back, we cant do this again), or not, as hard as it will be, to not lose my mind for a couple of months again when hes gone. 
How do i get over this crazy jealousy and over analyzing. He was single and completely honest with me, and would do anything, be with me, or not, he just wants the best for me without hurting me.

Side note the sex is amazing. Like SO SATISFYING. Is friends with benefits a possibility with an ex,  that one is in love with? Because a big factor is having sex with him. 

My guy friends are no help. They don't understand why I don't move on.
 The whole your smart sexy funny stuff which is nice but I'm so insecure(now) that Erik's he's the only one I believe.
 I second guessing it because ""why would he break up with you if I'm so great"" just runs through my head.
 My girlfriends suck because they think we should get married, and I should move out there, which Erik and I have talked about, even before he left, just not until we are each at least 28. I wont move out there.

If I decide to stay friends, Ill start seeing that other guy, Henry, is that a bad idea too? 

I told Henry I might start seeing him again, but lightly and I'd still be friends with my ex, and possibly travel with him. He said he completely understands. Its a hard situation. He'd be concerned if I could just drop him so easily haha. Just dont tell Henry about when I see Erik.


I'm so lost in my own thoughts, I'm so sad, and afraid. I could spend the rest of my life with this man if he came home in 5 years things could work out. He wants to do whatever is best for that to  happen.

P.S. I've talked about some of these fears with him, not to this extent, since we are waiting for him to get home to hash it out. 
I mentioned I should date to not fall back in love with him, if we did just stay friends and not be a couple. 
He was understanding and okay with me seeing other guys, so I don't get my heart broken again. He just obviously doesn't want to hear about dates.


P.S. I graduate college in December. I received an offer for my dream job, from my dream company in September, when we weren't talking, and accepted it. It starts in April.
So I couldn't move out to him if I wanted too. 

TL;DR
Ex I'm still in love with, but just getting over, is home for 3 months. Get back together temporarily?  Be friends with benefits? Be just friends? Or will life be easier if I move on? Is seeing him and other people a good way to move on or destined for failure?
Also how do I forgive and forget?


Please, help, anyone. Or anyone just read it, and even if you have no help, tell me I'm not crazy. Anything.

I hate it. I feel i'd actually enjoy a job or work experience in it, but the theoretical bullshit holds me back. Realised 2 weeks ago that my email header i'd been using to send out job emails was a chat name instead of my full name, so i've basically ruined good opportunities on internships by looking like a teenager on msn.
I have good flatmates and a group of fairly close friends that live nearby.
I've already taken 6 months out to deal with everything, putting me a year behind.

I base my happiness around making others happy, I make plenty of mistakes and I have paid for them dearly. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, i've got so many deadlines coming up and I can already feel myself buckling, I just don't care. I don't care about a career or any of those things right now, all I care about is just being happy and not waking up hating myself every morning.

I can't tell you the pressure I feel, I have already tanked my grades, I lose sleep over not attending class, but I just can't, I feel paranoid permanently. I missed a doctors appointment due to missing a train and now I'm too scared to rebook the appointment, absolutely pathetic I know. I crave the weekend to escape responsibility, then I can't hack the free-time either. If I can't handle even 1 out of 7 days of the week what the fuck is the point?
I've tried it all, but the nature of me as a person just can't stick to one thing for too long once i've poured all my remaining energy into making a start on something.
There are so many things I want to fix about myself, but I just can't keep it up.

My ex seems hell-bent on wanting to remind me of her existence, and I think she knows im a vulnerable place right now and is fully intent on exploiting that.
The girl I clicked with utterly and completely is out of my reach due to immigration laws and other factors.
The thing that really struck a chord, a girl I hardly knew just said to me 'you don't seem like the type to be on Facebook on a Saturday night', the amount of pain this comment caused me is just, stupid.
I have so many things I want to do and would be happy doing, but I am just not in the right circle to do those kind of things and my confidence just doesn't allow me to do that alone.

I love house and drum and bass, I started trying to DJ with the society at my uni but its full of, quite frankly wankers who are already really good, so I feel kinda shunned. I'm trying to practice, but at the first signs of messing up a mix I just lose interest.

I slept all day today, woke up every 2 hours and just asked myself the question, ""Why bother, what are you going to actually do today? Will any of it actually matter?""
I need some direction, a way of focusing and a way of driving myself out of bed. Every eve of extended loneliness will be fueled by a chemical of some kind; alcohol, weed, or whatever is available. I have none of those things and i'm confronting the sober reality of it all, and other than my parents and friends from home, there is nothing stopping me from wanting to top myself. I'm stuck on a course that I hate and i'm a hypocrite when it comes to giving advice.

I saw pictures from a social event the other night with all my close friends, and it just so worked out that I wasn't in any of the pictures, at all, all night, somehow through chance or whatever, and that just hit me really hard as well. It was like I was never there and that is precisely how I picture myself.

tldr; rants of someone who can't focus."

Throwaway account here.

Background:
  
* Me [25/M] - College Grad, IT Professional, Starting 2nd temporary holiday job to pay off Student Loan/Credit-Card debt. Taking classes for my professional certification.  
   
* Her [24/F] - Intern @ an architecture firm doing recruitment - Graduating with her BA in May. Taking lots of credits to graduate in May. She's a 3.7 GPA student.


My GF and I recently moved into a new place (new to both of us - neither of us previously lived here - both of out places were too small for 2 people, and we wanted a place that was neutral to both our work locations). We decided to move in because we have been dating for a little over a 1.25 years and things have been amazing - we spent nearly 7 nights a week together at either of our places and it seemed like the next step in taking our relationship further.

Prior to moving in things have been amazing. We really have been seeing eye-to-eye and have rarely fought - and if we have, it was usually resolved quickly.

**------But I digress - here's the lowdown. -------**

I fucking hate moving. I've moved 7 times (including this move) since January 2010 when I moved to college. It's my personal hell. I'm not a pleasant person to be around while moving. I'm a prick and impatient and childish and I complain. I hate it about me, but it's just the way it is. I've done it so fucking much that I don't feel like I can change it. Moving can never be fun and it's a pain in the ass, and I would rather rip off my testicles with a pair of pliers than move one more fucking time.

*Not even kidding.*

Now this should be a fun and exciting time for both of us, and it hasn't been. It's been miserable. We've been fighting. I've felt like I've been walking on eggshells around her and she's been irritable. I've been stressed about work since we're down 2 resources and their work has slid to me, and she's stressed about school and the HW/Finals that's coming down the pipeline. Neither of us have lived together with an SO before.

I've been childish and selfish lately, complaining about how she hasn't been helping (when in reality, she's been doing alot) and in general being a dick. I've been complaining how she doesn't involve me in the decisions, but then don't want to help because she has her way of doing things. I've been complaining about having to buy stuff that I'm not using and that she'll use 100%. 
  
I guess I've been emotionally immature lately. But she hasn't been a peach to be around either. She's been pissy and hasn't really been treating me as an equal, and has been rather bossy/commanding.  These are traits that neither of us have really exhibited when we weren't living together.

She's questioning (she told me this) if it was a good idea for us to move in together. I think she's also been questioning our relationship in general. I've been thinking the same thing. We've lived together for 2 weeks and it's been fucking rough.

**Here's the deal: I want this to work.**

 I love this girl more than I've ever loved anything/anyone and would do anything for her.  What can I do to make this better? What's going on? I'm so fucking lost about this whole thing. Just advice....please!

Ask questions and give me advice. I'm so fucking desperate that I'm turning to reddit.

Please help."

I am single, claim only myself (nobody else claims me), and am unsure if this will be my only job next year. Pretty normal situation.

Is this wrong? Will I be subject to the penalty or should I be fine having less withheld (federal and state).

She is also capable of being extremely considerate and caring - she buys fantastic, thoughtful gifts for people and has supported F through some dark times. These traits have, admittedly, been on the backburner since she dropped out of uni, but they are still there. In particular whenever I see her this is mostly what I see - she isn't a brat around me. This just emphasises its a family-dynamic issue.

Mum and Dad are also awesome, caring, thoughtful, intelligent and fun. We can't just abandon them to a problem we think they are constitutionally incapable of fixing themselves, they are family and don't deserve it. There is no malice in them at all and while mum may have an unhealthy relationship with S, it comes from the best possible intentions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly it's worth saying that this post is not really about my own relationship with my future sister in law (at least not yet), as it is reasonably good, but rather about her behaviour around her parents and to a lesser extent my fiance (25F), her sister.  For this post I will refer to my fiance as ""F"" her sister as ""S"" and her parents as ""mum"" and ""dad"" respectively.  This account is from my outside perspective, with all the caveats and biases that implies, but I've tried to set it out neutrally and in as much detail as possible in the hope of getting good advice.  I'm really sorry for the excessive length.

Mum is of south asian background, Dad is welsh, both have lived in England for most of their adult lives.  Mum's family are very modern and liberal (by local cultural standards) and one of her siblings also married a westerner and moved abroad with the family's blessing.  She is English in attitude but retains certain cultural traits from her childhood, paramount among which is her relationship with her children.

Simply put, growing up, Mum ensured life revolved around the kids.  She chose a career (civil service) that allowed her security of income while still giving her very regular hours and the ability to spend as much time with her kids as possible.  From what I can tell she was a great mother, EXCEPT that the guilt she felt about working at all manifested in trying to do everything possible she could for her kids, even when they were perfectly capable of doing it for themselves.  While in the case of F, 4 years older than S, there were some rules (some quite strict even) and boundaries, these were much more relaxed for S.  There were few if any imposed responsibilities (formal chores etc) but the kids were generally good and (F at least) did help out around the house reasonably regularly.  The family were and are VERY close, though mum and dad do argue from time to time over the usual small scale bits and pieces.

Growing up (from F's account), S was a particularly wilful child.  She often required things to be done a very specific way and her parents and sister would pretty much always indulge her.  F feels horribly guilty now, but she often used to ""help"" her sister with homework from school, which in retrospect amounted to basically doing it for her.  F (and Mum) was incredibly protective of S.  Dad was slightly less close with S, as S would often ignore him and run to Mum etc.  Dad was closer to F.  Mum also had very high expectations of her kids and schoolwork always came first, to the point Mum would stop them from helping with, say, washing up and instead insist she do it so they could go study.  She was not, however, a ""dragon-lady"" - her approach was pure love, with a little bit of guilting thrown in.

F has many memories of huge S temper tantrums, which would end up with Mum comforting S to keep the peace.  So far, so normal for a young child.  Except these behaviours have continued or even worsened into adulthood.  Mum and Dad spent S's later teenage years, after F had moved out, treading on eggshells.  Literally anything could set S off into screaming and shouting, or ignoring for long periods.  

Shortly after leaving home for university several hours away, S stopped attending lectures/classes or handing in work.  Every weekend she would come home (a 3 - 4 hour and expensive train journey) with her washing.  She did not get on with her housemates, feeling alienated from them, and did not have a large social circle.  I think it is this environment in which she first developed anxiety/depression issues (see below), primarily as a result of difficulty adjusting and guilt over not doing any of the necessary work at university.  F thinks she has a problem accepting that something is worth doing even if it cant be done ""perfectly"" - e.g. if she is 5 minutes late to something she wont go at all.  This may tie in to OCD traits she has (see below). Halfway through her first year, S dropped out of university and moved home.  

S has (shortly before dropping out of university) been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, though in my view this is not the route cause of the behaviours but rather a consequence of the situation S is in as a result of the behaviours (who wouldn't be depressed and anxious when their incredibly high expectations and limited work ethic fail to gain traction on the real world?).  Certain therapists have also mentioned possible paranoia and/or OCD.   S has not stuck with any therapist for more than a handful of sessions and often finds fault in their approach, gets angry and/or sleeps in and misses sessions and then stops going.  S is on some form of anti-depressant now which seems reasonably agreeable to her.

Over the next year after dropping out she lived at home and (intermittantly) attended mind youth group meetings (her most successful commitment to date, she goes reasonably often but is always late (30mins+) despite it being 2 minutes walk from home, doing a little bit of volunteering, going to adult classes in various hobbies (again, not usually on a committed basis) and very occasional therapy which has tailed off.  After six months she attempted a grace-and-favour job her mother organised through work (but in another department) but quickly quit because she could not really attend punctually and found the work menial.  She has restarted in a local university, living at home, doing an easier course (she is very academically able) that she claims is very easy, but again has issues with attendance and handing in work, missing several major deadlines and obtaining several extensions based on her mental health.  It is unclear at this point whether she will keep it up.  The course in undemanding and there is no evidence she finds the work itself taxing or anxious-making.

That brings us up to date, so I will briefly describe her current behaviour.  Crudely put, it is like a spoilt 5 year old:

* She often uses a baby-voice, though this is one of the few things her mum, with coaxing from F and I, was willing to set boundaries about and its got a bit better.  She still has a babyish ""lilt"" to her voice a lot of the time which is entirely contrived.

* She makes very specific and exacting demands.  She wants a drink, it must be in a specific cup and a specific temperature, NO NOT LIKE THAT, get another one.  Mum almost always complys.

* She has a general sense of entitlement that manifests as frequent anger (outrage is probably a better word) at the world.  She has limited empathy for people outside her immediate family and friends and can't see things from their point of view.  For example, she frequently loses the plot with customer service etc. and feels people ""owe"" her special treatment.  She is actively angry (and capable of expressing why cogently, but not able to express how this is a reasonable reaction).

* She frequently takes charge and feels entitled to make family decisions that her mum and dad then have to stick to.

* She is extremely whimsical and expects others to pander to her whims. One day she decided she didnt like some champagne goblets her parents had in a sideboard so she gave them away because she didnt want them in the house.  Her parents' views were not solicited.

* She sleeps for at least 12 hours a day, I'm not sure when she goes to bed but she gets up in the afternoon most days.  She cancels/skips out on a lot of planned events (including meeting us and going to uni) and just sleeps or plays on her laptop.

* On her 21st birthday she offered to make a cup of tea for the assembled grandparents etc (I was also there) and went to the kitchen, before bursting into (screaming) tears that no-one came to help her.  She ran upstairs screaming and (as usual), mum followed and tried to console her.  Among the many things she cried was one nugget that I found interesting - that she ""didn't want to grow up or be an adult"".  This infantilism is a common theme (colourful, curley strawed cups and other childish things an often demand).

* Mum tends to nag, but otherwise treats her with kid gloves. Dad tries to keep out of it but privately expresses similar concerns to ourselves.  Their house is literally a warzone sewn with landmines.  Neither mum nor dad can have any interaction with S without, sooner or later, setting her off entirely unintentionally.  

* F has the best relationship with S in the family, but after a few alienation incidents over the last few years, is also treading on eggshells and isn't comfortable giving advice to her forcefully for fear of the (volcanic) reaction.

* Although I see entitled behaviours, demanding and occasionally the baby-voice, when I am around S does not have tantrums in front of me (though she may run to her room).  This seems to be the case for other non-family too.

* S is effectively completely dependant on mum and dad.  She does not (will not) cook, clean or do anything else around the house with any regularlity.
 
All S's financial needs are met by a generous allowance from parents and significant  savings made up of gifts from parents and grandparents.  S has held an occasional job over the years but generally quits after issues with punctuality/reliability/taking time off.  Even if parents turned off the allowance (which would result in a lot of screaming and crying and shouting), I think S has many thousands in savings held in her name that would be difficult (and perhaps very unfair) to take back. 

No idea if this is relevant, but for full disclosure - S may be questioning her own sexuality. She has never had a serious boyfriend.  One boyfriend at university turned out to be asexual and broke up with her when he ""came out"".  She may have had sex with girls.  Whole family is and would be super-supportive of this, and have expressed this in non-threatening terms.  F has talked to her about it and got non-committal responses (""maybe"").  That said, most recently S had sex with a (M21) friend who was staying with her and parents while pursuing a London internship for a few weeks, although he decided he didn't want anything else to come of it.

While we push getting more therapy, in particular CBT, we have had limited success in actually making this happen.  More recently we have suggested family therapy, as in all honesty we dont think Mum-S interaction is helping things improve, but again very little has happened and its hard to impose something like that from externally if none of the involved people particularly want to go.

In a candid moment, Dad has said he thinks it very unlikely that Mum will listen to a family therapist even if they make it explicitly clear that she needs to stop pandering to S and set clear boundaries.  Dad thinks it will break her heart to do so and she simply isn't capable of it.  F tends to agree.  Mum gets INCREDIBLY upset and defensive if any of this is brought up or it is suggested she change her approach.  She seems to blame the situation on her working instead of being a stay-at-home.  This is exacerbated by a fairly unhealthy relationhip between her and her MIL during the early stages of her marriage / kids childhood in which MIL would endlessly criticise her choices and dad wouldn't defend her.

What do we do? How do we help S and Mum improve their relationship, and for S to become less dependant?  

PS: F is wonderful and we have a very communicative relationship - I may share this post with her depending on how the responses go, and she knows I wanted to make it and was ok with it so I am not betraying any trust by writing all this.  Thankfully she doesn't get defensive about my opinions on all of this.

About me: 

My degree is in Political Science w/ Religious Studies minor. 

I ran student newspaper (~98 students), built converged newsroom after managing website for a year, started student-run online video network (news, sports, and other). I've had two internships.

Skills: Multimedia, video editing, html, css, some javascript and other programming, data analysis/data journalism, Stata, SPSS, learning R, Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, InDesign, Illustrator, etc.) 

Extra: I believe in community involvement, so I have extracurriculars and leadership credentials. I've travelled in third world countries, and would absolutely love for my job to include the possibility (documentary/international).

Even though I'm all alone now, barely a support system to speak of, and my entire life has been shifted, I feel sad but strong, happy but confused. I will get out of this and be a better person, I need to remind myself of that though any tears that may arise.

**Start:** 
Meet in College, 101 graphic design classes.
Lust at first sIght. He see's me. Makes an effort to slowly change seats until he's sitting next to me 2 weeks later. We talk. Fresh out of 5 yr relationship, but still talking to my ex, we're friends. 
But.
New guy is hot. handsome, nice, funny, and even his stutter is cute to me. Great body too, perfect I'd say, at least to me. For years later I'd go on to compliment his ""statuesque"" body, even though he'd brush it off and dismiss it. 

But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's go back to the start.

He's friendly, and his eyes lock into mine with such passion. Even when we're in a class full of people, he could make me feel so giddy with just a glance, as corny as it sounds like it was just us, all that mattered was us. I fell hard for him, but was cautious of hIs ever-too-easy effortless charm. I feared he was a player. I should have listed to my instincts. **Fuck**, I wish I would have listened to my instincts. 

We quickly became intwined with one another, shared the same likes and dislikes and felt like I had met someone I had known once before. He changed for me, without questIons, without askIng. I noticed this guy who wore sneakers and sweaters all the time slowly mold into one who would wear dress shoes, slacks and button ups. He always said It was because he would see me reblogging fashion and menswear for hours on tumblr In class. He always said he did it to try to impress me, so that he could be the man that I apparently wanted. I now think it was for all of us, not just me, but every other ""girl"" he was talkIng to. We'll get to those quote in a minute…

He was kind, generous, funny, and confident. Throughout our time together he always spoiled me, always cared for me, and took me to places I might not ever be able to afford again. He was sweet, caring.

He sold drugs so, he could afford to do this for me, and blow my head up, while simultaneously talking to other people online and giving them false hope too. 

*But I was the ultimate cover up*. His family knew me, and mine knew his, his friends knew me, everyone knew me. I moved into his house, and his mom and bother were awesome, made me genuinely feel at home. I loved his pets and even his hobbies. I knew nothing of video games yet was attracted to the amount of effort, planning, and the mental process that goes into fighting an opponent on a screen. It made me love him more. SeeIng his qualities shine even in activities I wasn't necessarily interested in.

I knew his darkest secrets. The various sexually transmitted diseases he had faced and conquered and even the one he did not, the one I would later find out we shared. Herpes.  I knew this and still wanted to stay wIth him. He said he didn't want to tell me because he was taking meds and wasn't having an outbreak and was almost certain he wouldn't pass It to me, but he did. He said he would have told me later. Why didn't I run then?!

I stayed with him because I loved him, because I wanted to make things work and because I felt like he was a good person who shouldn't have his past haunt his future. I was willing to forgive and grow and make our bonds stronger. I wanted us to be better.

**Fast forward 2 months. This is where it gets juicy.** We've been together 5 months at this point. We argued about trust, since he knew I was talking to my ex. Nothing more than talking, just texting. He was depressed I had moved on so quickly, I was a softie and felt bad, but always told him I was happy now. Anyway, the argument leads to the New guy giving me the password to his email. Says ""I have nothing to hide, look at it, all my passwords to my cell phone and everything is in there, I hide nothing from you and give you access to it all, I hope this will help our trust"" 

I didn't go through it for 3 days. One day at work, I felt an eerie feeling, I decided to look, and start at the oldest emails. What I found didn't even surprise me as much as I thought it would. **He was messaging transsexuals on Facebook. Not one, but many. He had even at one poInt messaged a cross-dresser.** These things are not one in the same, they are very different likes. Both, ultimately scared the crap out of me. I was shocked. I never knew about these kinds of people until now really. The most I knew was what I was exposed to on the Jerry Springer Show.

*Let me preface this by saying:*

Transexuals are human beings like anyone else (no shit) they have normal lives, and can be great human beings, but the ones he was messing with, where not. They were the type that use there body, and somethIng many struggle with, to make money. Prostitutes, whores, back page hostesses and porn stars.
 
I did my research to try to better understand his affliction and ended up finding out who his first encounter was with. His first encounter was with a porn star. This handsome, ""Straight"" 19yr old fucking a transexual porn star and driven there by his mistrust in women because one gave him herpes….. **Shit.** *Wtf did I get myself into.*

Basically, this New guy would talk to these prostitutes and wrap them up and make them feel like he didn't care about their work or past and just wanted to get to know them. This way he could have sex without having to pay. He would then drop them and move on the next one.

This was all before he met me, and he told me I was the first woman who he had gotten close to, who he was able to trust and want to build somethIng with. He begged me to forget about his past and love him for who he was, and how he had been treating me. I complied because like I said, I loved him, he was good to me, he was my best friend and I decided working though our difficulties could only brIng us closer, maybe he would appreciate how much I loved him by seeIng how much his past confused me, but that I was stIll willIng to be by his side. He apologized for days for his past ways and tried to reassure me it was somethIng of the past by going to sexual addiction therapy (for porn) and couples therapy wIth me. He spoiled me with love and homemade dinners for months, he was amazing to me, always tried to help us prosper and grow into the adults we wanted to be. 

*I never felt this coming.* 3 years into our relationshIp, it was volatile, argumentative and possessive. We had no trust for one another although we tried to trust. I lived with him, cooked and cleaned for him, woke him up for work on time and packed his lunches for him.

The same lunches that he would come home with later. ""Oh babe, I was just so busy, I just ate trail mix all day at my desk while designing"". A few days later I find out the truth. 

**I see someone call the house at 3:30 am. No one ever calls at this time.** I was a gay man (he confirms this) asking for my boyfriend. Backtracking saying oh no, not the guy I was talking about, bye. He hangs up.  I had been out of the house for the 2 days prior, although we do live with his mom and brother. 

The next morning I look through the caller ID, I see a few private callers and one local number who called when I was out of the house. I google the number to find out the name, so I can know who I should be asking for. First thing that pops up is a sex forum where men review their experiences with this particular transsexual. Great, so he's been seeing this person!? I call, she says who are you? Your calling from a friends number. Friend huh? I'm said friends GF, wondering why he has a transexual prostitutes number on his house phone… She said they've been friends for awhile, said they get together and eat, watch movies or just hang out, but have never had sex. He told her he had herpes and she had a BF anyway, she says it's been this way for the past year. Says the last time they hung out was 2 months ago, went to lunch at The Madeline, a restaurant across the street from his internship.

*So he's not eating the lunches I make for him to spend the money I give to him to take out a transexual for lunch to chit chat?!* **It almost hurts more that It's not a sexual thing.** Why the fuck would he feel the need to do this? How can he lie to my face about doing well in therapy and battling his shit, He's the one who signed up for and said he needed help. Why do this? I was even accepting of the fact that he was attracted to them, so long as he was honest about it. Why would he do this to me? Why not just leave me if this is what he wanted all along?!

I freak out, panic attack hits, can't breathe, spend the next few minutes in the bathroom trying to catch my breath and collect my thoughts. Fear for my health sets in. I wake him up with yelling and questions. Which he swiftly lies about. I have him call her and confront his lies. He begs me to stay during the 2 hours it took me to pack up my belongings and GTFO.

I never want to see him again. The line may have been faint, and I allowed myself to move that line a few times, but there was a line, and this time he crossed it. 

I know there were plenty of red flags along the way, but he honestly made me feel like he was regretful of his actions and that he wanted to build a better life together, he told me that so many times, he sat me down in front of his mom and told her that I was the women that was helping him deal with his demons  and that he wanted to marry me one day and prove to me he could be a better man,that he could be better than his flaws. He bought me a ""promise necklace"" for our first anniversary. Its scary how much compartmentalizing he did.

I mostly just wanted to share this story. Type it all out and get it out there. I feel like I could write a book with the shit we both went through. It was an overall wonderful relationship and I visualized myself marring this man despite his flaws. Thats how i knew I loved him. His flaws meant nothing to me, they would make me fear things, but I never turned my back on him, I never looked at him in disgust. I just wanted us to move on and build a ""normal"" life together and for the most part we had that. We shared everything and did everything together. That's something I will miss. It hurts, but that chapter is closed now, and I'm excited to move on in life. Even if it is alone.

**TL;DR**
**3 years into the relationship with the BF and I find out he's cheating on me with transsexuals. I had known about the attraction, and he told me it was something he did in his past during his ""dark"" days and that he wanted to be a better person. He personally sought out therapy, and I stuck by him and never turned my back on him. This is how he repaid me.**

But read the story, it's worth it. I think.

1qwvde,1,2013-11-18,NoFap brought on a shitstorm of emotions,ProgressTracker,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1qwvde/nofap_brought_on_a_shitstorm_of_emotions/,"A shit ton happened since I started NoFap. 20 days last time, relapsed for 2 days, now at 2 weeks again. 

In that time I: 

* Had my first real kiss (20/M)
* Started dating
* Got into a relationship
* Lost virginity, lots of times
* Got highly reputable internship offer
* And now most recently, had to deal with a break up.

So much going through my head. But the difference between pre-NoFap and post-NoFap? I am:

* More capable of dishing out all of my feelings
* No longer desire relationships for sex
* No longer even considering masturbation, even after stumbling upon nude images on reddit
* Capable of telling people exactly what I think and my opinions on the matter
* No longer hiding anything from people
* Confident with what I say
* Hopeful of the future

I have to say that dealing with this break up is hard. But this isn't the end of the line for me. In just one month of NoFap (with a relapse in the middle), my mind was able to change so much. I was able to gain so much. 

I don't feel alpha every day, I don't feel like I'm the king of everything, but I feel more comfortable with myself and who I am, and I feel more comfortable with letting other people know who I am as well. 

It's not super powers. It's bringing out what I tried to hide so dearly in the past.

1qwa30,7,2013-11-18,"Intrusive thoughts, feeling hyperaware [wall of text: x-post r/depression]",[deleted],OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1qwa30/intrusive_thoughts_feeling_hyperaware_wall_of/,"Where to begin...

So basically I have been suffering from intrusive thoughts for about a month or so. However I have a really hard time talking about it because I can't exactly pinpoint what it is that I'm thinking about. One way I can explain it is hyperawareness/metaawareness, in that I could be going about my day and suddenly become aware of all my actions and thoughts to the point where I cannot actually enjoy what I am doing. Another way I can explain it is when something makes me laugh or smile a little voice in my head says, ""Stop it, you're depressed. You're not allowed to do that."" I have many brief spurts throughout the day and occasionally they last a very long time (30min-1hr), and they are gradually getting better, but I have days where I backtrack and lose a lot of progress. It's quite frustrating.

This isn't the first time I've been suffering with this. The first time this happened is back in 2010 when my abusive tiger dad prohibited me from taking an administrative job at a university and forced me to stay with him for 3.5 months in northern California, where he was working as an exchange professor. I had no friends and no job and was therefore relegated to staring at the ceiling, going online, or watching TV. After about 2 or 2.5 months of this I started to go absolutely insane and experienced my first panic attack. I should probably mention that at the time I was in an incredibly unsatisfying long distance relationship and I had cheated on him about 6-8 months prior. Though I felt very little guilt before that summer, the panic attacks and depression lead to intrusive thoughts regarding my affair. I could not escape the thought that I was a piece of shit who didn't deserve to live, and that I should just kill myself for doing something so horrible. The guilt was overwhelming. This continued for 9 months until May 2011 before I got into a new, much more fulfilling relationship, after which the thoughts dissipated.

Of course, the thought would pop up from time to time, but never for long, and by the beginning of 2013 I was never thinking about it. After all, I was now happily in a relationship with someone on which I never, ever intended to cheat and still don't. Even when my parents and I had come to a point where we were no longer speaking to each other in May, I was happy. I thought I had beat depression for good and very slowly weaned off the antidepressants I had been taking for eight months (I should also mention that between May 2011 and May 2013 I was suffering from depression, but not intrusive thoughts, for a variety of unrelated issues), and by the end of July I was completely off.

I feel like I should never have gone off the pills (I was taking buproprion 150mg and sertraline 100mg). I graduated from college in June 2013 and started an internship at a firm, where it was strongly implied that my internship would be a precursor to a full time position. However, when the internship came to a close I was told that I would not be hired simply because they did not have any positions available (which probably wasn't a lie they told me to make me feel better, since I know for a fact that many, many people got laid off in the subsequent months). After about 2 months of unemployment and lack of meaningful activities in my life, my intrusive thoughts, the thoughts that I thought I had escaped for good, returned.

However, the second time around, the intrusive thoughts are not as overbearing, simply because I know better than to push away the thoughts. Furthermore, I no longer think about my previous affair constantly (however, it is a strong trigger due to the fact that it was part of my intrusive thought process in the past), though I still feel an appropriate (and dare I say healthy?) amount of guilt and shame for my actions.

My depression is mild and highly functional, which makes me feel kind of guilty about complaining here...but that doesn't mean it's not frustrating. I have put myself back on sertraline 100mg for five weeks now (will resume buproprion when I get new insurance, as my current insurance doesn't cover it), and I am planning on seeing a professional for CBT in early 2014 (which is the earliest I can get new insurance). I have also been exercising and getting plenty of sunlight. In addition, I have also been praying (I'm a complete atheist, but it's nice to pretend someone is watching over me) every night, and been attempting to ""think over"" my negative thoughts with more positive ones (I can and will be happy, I deserve to be happy, I am getting better every day in every way, etc). But I am not making as much progress as I would like.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I was just wondering if anyone understood where I was coming from. I have noticed my symptoms are in line with purely obsessional OCD but I have not been formally diagnosed with it (just depression and occasional anxiety). I was also wondering if at 5 weeks if the sertraline is taking full effect (I've been told it can take up to 8 or 12 weeks) and if there is anything I can do in the meantime before I can get therapy to progress on my own (also, is CBT really effective?). I really want to be happy...I just don't know how.

Thanks for reading...even if no one responds I would be happy to know that someone read this and may understand where I'm coming from."

I don’t think I’m ready.,capeofhorn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qvtge/my_girlfriend_21f_wants_to_move_in_with_me_21m/,"My girlfriend (21F) wants to move in with me (21M) after we graduate from college. I don’t think I’m ready. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half. We have a great relationship. We rarely fight and get along great. In May, we’ll graduate from college. I’ll be interning in another city instate while she rides out the rest of her apartment lease in our college town. 

We’ve talked about our future recently, and I told her I see our relationship going beyond college. We didn’t discuss it further because I wasn’t sure where I will be interning this summer until later this year. Recently, she’s talked about moving in together when my internship ends in August. I’ve played off the topic with shrugs and “we’ll sees.” Now, however, she’s talked more about living together to the point that she’s asking if we should get a dog or a cat. 

I’ve never felt comfortable with the idea of moving in with my girlfriend right out of college, especially with the chance that I’ll be moving around a bit until I find a stable job. Don’t get me wrong. I love my girlfriend, but I don’t think it’s a great idea for us to live together so soon. I want us to find our professional passions and become financially stable before we decide to share a house/apartment. I also want to live by myself and develop my own life now that I'll be out of my parents' house. 

Am I being selfish about all this? I don’t know how I can voice my concern about living together without hurting my girlfriend too badly. I talked to my dad about this issue, and he said I’m in a lose-lose situation. She’s going to get hurt regardless, he told me, and the best way to lighten the blow depends on how I’m tell her. 

What should I do about this? Is this normal for a couples graduating college?

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend of 1.5 years wants to live together three months after graduating from college. I love and care about her, but I don't think I'm ready yet."

1qvd0p,2,2013-11-17,I guess I'm one of those people that just doesn't really enjoy weed :(,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1qvd0p/i_guess_im_one_of_those_people_that_just_doesnt/,"I'm in college and have been smoking for several years now. I occasionally smoke by myself, but most of the time I do it with friends and we're either just chilln or going out to a party. In general, I sort of like the feeling I get from weed, especially since I think everything is instantly funnier. But then there's the list of things I don't like about being high. I get REALLY quiet and when I do end up talking, it's usually just me saying a few words to answer someone's question. If it's at a party, I usually end up sitting on a couch, wondering to myself, ""Why the hell I can't converse like a normal human being?"" The reason I don't really talk much while high is because I always think that someone will think whatever I say is stupid, which doesn't really make sense to me because I'm HIGH. Of course what I say is probably going to be stupid! 

Then there's what happens when I mix weed with alcohol. Most of the time I go out with my friends, someone suggests we all smoke when we're already drunk. Everyone I know can handle getting crossed, except for me. I can count maybe three times in my entire life that I've been ok to continue partying after getting cross faded. Every other time I've pretty much died and end up puking my guts out. So now whenever I go out I have to stick to one or the other, and I usually go with the alcohol since it isn't the one that turns me into a weird mute the entire night. But every once in a while, I'll tell myself, ""Hey, maybe this time I can handle doing both."" Aaaaaaaand I end up puking like every other time.

Finally, weed just makes me tired and lazy for the rest of the day after I smoke most of the time. I think thats a normal thing but I guess I hate the idea of me being so unproductive for a really long period of time. I just see it as me wasting my time when I could be doing something, anything, that could be of benefit to me. Maybe that's just me. I'm trying to stop being lazy so I can do something that contributes to my future, like getting an internship and doing better in my classes.

I'm not trying to knock weed with this post, if any of you are getting that vibe. I think I'm just finally coming to terms with the fact that it just doesn't really agree with my body. I don't think I'll stop smoking entirely, because I do like being high from time to time when I'm just chillin, but I'll probably just kindly refuse when my friends offer to smoke me out from now on. Honestly though, I really wish I could get the same experiences that you all have had with weed. I've read plenty of interesting/funny stories here and it makes me sad that I don't feel the same way you guys do when you're all high. I'll still be here though, reading your posts and living vicariously through your stories. haha.

I'm looking for a job in the outreach / legislative affairs / government affairs arena. I graduated from a well known college with a degree in political science and am finishing up my Master's degree here in DC at night. I'm currently finishing up an internship within the legislative office of a well respected federal agency. In my current role I perform legislative research, administrative functions, event planning, materials preparation, and routinely go to Capitol Hill to hold events and speak on behalf of the agency and science/tech issues. I also have a strong IT background, as well as having previously worked for a consulting firm and various political campaigns. 

I am looking to move out of an internship position and take on a full time role. I've come to understand that in the DC job market, ""entry level"" means 3-5 years of ""real experience"" which I honestly just don't have, I'm 23. I'm willing to put in the long hours and hard work, I just need somebody to give me a chance.

1r0ltd,0,2013-11-19,Advice for me (21/m) about a very long distance relationship with my girlfriend (20/f),Shuttuko,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r0ltd/advice_for_me_21m_about_a_very_long_distance/,"My girlfriend is currently in Disney World doing an internship with the Disney Corporation, which is fantastic because it was always one of her dreams to do that and I am really happy for her. Along with this, she is taking a few credits online, and I am a full-time student and have a part-time job.


With our schedules, we rarely have time to talk. In the beginning, SHE was always calling me every chance she could get and texted me and SHE always initiated conversation and she always made me feel missed and loved. Lately however, things have been getting a little scarce.


She rarely talks to me anymore, and I know we are both busy, but when we do talk, her texts are generally short and open ended and our phone calls are usually dead. I admit, the calls may be my doing, as I am naturally a quiet person with few words to say, but usually she is always talking about everything: her day, her friends, her job, etc. Lately it feels like it has been forced.


Along with this, I just have a feeling that something is wrong. Though little and insignificant to others, I view them as otherwise. For example, on her FaceBook, her profile picture was always one of ME and HER together kissing or hugging. Now, it is one of her senior pictures. Like I said, little and insignificant maybe, but I noticed and started to worry.


She has also always been hounding me to send cute things her way and remind her of all the reasons I love her and tell her all of these romantic things, which I always did. Not anymore. She hasn't asked me to do that in a long while, so I started doing it on my own whim to which she replies with messages like ""You're so cute!"" or some other generic response. I just feel like it doesn't mean anything to her.


Being in this relationship for almost two years, I talked to her about it the other day and simply said that I feel like I don't mean a lot to you anymore and I told her I wished that she would let me know how she felt after those cute messages/voice-mails and how much she liked them.


Finally, here is my question: Based on this, should I be worried? She tells me everyday that she loves me, and her and I have been through a lot together so I trust her, but I also feel worried that something else is festering that I can't repair because we are 3,000+ miles apart. This girl is the woman of my dreams, and I don't want to lose her. What is your advice?

I'm looking for a little advice and direction - I'm in a really bad place right now and any help would be hugely appreciated.

I'll try to keep this as short as possible.

During my undergraduate career, I participated in 2 busy-season internships with a national firm. Loved the experience, loved the people. It was great.

That firm offered me a full-time position for when I finished school. I was stoked, and accepted.

Fast forward to June '13. I graduate from a MAcc program, with a scheduled firm start date of September '13.
Right around the time of graduation, I was hit with some very difficult personal circumstances. These circumstances completely took over my life, and required that I be near my family (in a city several hours from my job offer.) 

This is where everything went downhill.  My mental state was very bad during this time. I convinced myself that everything would be straightened out by the time my start-date came, and so I did not communicate my situation to the firm. While my start-date crept closer, the stress of the situation and frustration made my frame of mind worse. With very little notice, I informed the firm that I wasn't going to be able to join them.

They inquired and offered help, but I was too stressed/embarrassed to share details so I didn't reach out.

That brings us to now. I have done a lot of healing over the last couple of months, and am ready to start my career. However, I've burnt the only bridges I had, and I am in a city where I know almost no one in the industry.

My resume is strong (summa cum laude, decent involvement, etc.) but I simply can't get any responses from the firms I am reaching out to. A few have gotten back to me and let me know that they aren't hiring right now, but most just don't return my emails &amp; phone calls.

I would honestly be completely fine with working a small retail job or something until firms begin recruiting again, as long as I had some sort of confidence that when that time came I had a shot at a position. 

What are my options here? Without the advantage of a Meet the Firms, I'm not sure how to get connected with recruiters, and I'm also not sure how to explain this gap in my resume now.

I'm desperate for some sage advice. Please /r/accounting, tell me there is some hope here."
1r00mu,3,2013-11-19,"Me [23/F] with my ex [21M/] 20 months, he broke it off while abroad and is acting very condescending. Rant. Now comes the time he said we could work out being friends, but I doubt he'll keep his word.",cursedxseraph,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r00mu/me_23f_with_my_ex_21m_20_months_he_broke_it_off/,"This is going to be long. I went through the whole relationship up to the part up to now to see how he roller coasters up and down. 




I was in my first year in grad school. He was a sophomore. Not a huge age difference (2 years- I graduated early), but 3 school years apart became a big deal when I, as the female, had the job, the car, the life and identity put together.  We had actually known each other for about a year before that. No attracted to him that first year at all because I had a no younger than me rule, especially that young. He followed me to the gym/ track every night and we would run and talk. Just thought he was a cool freshmen. 





He leaves for the summer, and I graduate undergrad and slowly I realize I miss him, and I never miss anyone. We start talking everyday on skype and chat.  He messages me one night about his ex, who wrote some message to him about how she's sad they can't be friends, anymore. So they meet and talk, i give him some advice. he tells me he still cares for her and wants to be nice but he has no feelings for her. 




When he gets back, we hang out everyday and then one night it just happened and we started dating. Were good for the most part, but then within a week, he starts taking me for granted. i.e always went to the gym with me. i ask him to go one night and he says he's busy, and I'm fine with that,but then a mutual friend calls and asks if he'll go to the gym with him and he's out the door. I talk to him about it, and he says it's just that this mutual friend rarely hangs out with him, and he likes the attention and the chance to hang out with him so he's going to take it. I forgive on the basis that he's young and still in the ""I want to be popular"" mindset. 





Thanksgiving break : he visits his brother and we skype and he tells me how his brother notices that he's not having an amazing time and looks a bit sad, and he says it's because without me there, he feels like he's missing  part of himself, so he can't truly be happy. I feel horrible, so I tell him, it's fine. I'll be there when he gets back, so he should learn how to enjoy his time away from me, because we'll have more time together. 




Christmas: he runs into his ex in a club. They sit down and talk until like 7 in the morning. He tells me immediately the next day, including how she asked him if he was dating anyone and he told her ""I've dated"", therefore lying to her that we were dating. He said it was to spare her feelings. It didn't mean anything, but he didn't want to hurt her because she seemed to be having a hard time moving on ( she said something about how she hadn't been able to meet anyone that compared to him). I'm hurt, but his friend convinces me he's a good guy, and he told me everything immediately.





3 months in, he does something stupid and neglectful towards me and I'm telling him how much I can't stand feeling taken for granted especially because of my last ex, and I'm freaking out that this isn't going to work and he says I love you for the first time. 





A month later I meet his parents for the first time, and during dinner with them, he makes a joke about how he's going to be my trophy husband. His dad glares at him and says something about "" too soon"" and I'm in shock and say ""yeah, too soon"" (I mean come on, we've been dating for like 4 months). Later he mentions how his parents consider me just a college fling and think that he should and will date other girls since I'm only his second gf. I ask him if he thinks of me in that way too, and he only says ""I can't believe you even need to ask me that""




It gets better again except for stupid petty fights that we usually talk through and then laugh about. I graduate again with my MA, he stays for graduation and meets my family (the only SO of mine and he has to go home again (international student) Long distance works and we plan a trip to Japan.  Trip happens, and it's amazing and we're all lovey dovey again even though we've been apart. 




Next school year starts, and now I'm working full time in the city with a 1.5 hour commute.  First few days of school, i plan on going to my home, but he asks me to stay with him in the dorms. I stay.  Then slowly, he stops wanting to go out. He says it's because he always seem me every day, and he counts anytime with me, sleeping, or me just sitting there while he does school work, as quality time spent with me because he's just happy that I'm around, so when he has a weekend he wants to go out with his other friends. 




Arguments begin. One night he says "" If it comes down to college life and you, I will choose college life. I will never try"" I should have left that day, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him reword what he said (international... angry German who doesn't always know the best way to express himself). He explains that because he doesn't have a car, he will never try to go to my house, so he prefers that I stay around his dorm with him. 





He starts getting angry at me more often. Annoyed at anything that I say. He say's it's because I'm always there, but every time I want to leave, he asks me to stay.  He gets into a study abroad program to Japan. Every time we argue he says he's torn between wanting me there and knowing that he'll be leaving soon and wanting to spend more time with me.  He basically is making me cry every month or few weeks at this point, and I am  not one to cry. 





I'm not happy and bring it up that maybe we should break up because it doesn't seem like he cares about me at all. He cries. Say's that he has doubts, but when he thinks about it, he's happy when I'm around and wants me there. So we try to work on it.  It gets better, with a few arguments here and there. 




His birthday, I take him to Vegas. pay for everything. I'm horribly sick, but i still go around with him and we see two shows. I say I think i'm too sick to go out clubbing, and he says that's fine. he doesn't want to go anyway and would prefer just to be back in hotel with me.  While walking back, he looks at me and says ""You know what would be funny? If we got married right now""  I freak out and ask him why he thinks that would be funny and he just laughs and say's i'm just joking.





A month later, some tragedy strikes him, he doesn't tell me right away, but I can tell, so I'm just hugging him in bed while he cries until he tells me. He then says ""you're the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not as good as you at showing it, but I do. You know that right?"" I say ""yes, even though it's hard to tell sometimes"" and he says he's sorry and hes going to try harder.  





The year is rushed by and we don't get much time together and before I know it, he's leaving for 6 months for Japan.  I take him to the airport and he's crying about how he's sad we couldn't spend more time together before he left, how he's going to miss me so much, how if we make it through this, we'll make it through everything, and how it's only a short amount of time in comparison to how much time we could have together. 





We talk everyday the first two weeks. Then we have a stupid argument and i need to book tickets to go visit him, so I send an e-mail saying it was a stupid argument and I need to know if the tickets I want to get will work. He ignores me. I get angry because the tickets are selling out. I can't believe he would let something so petty get in the way of me visiting him. And then it dawns on me that he probably doesn't actually care that much.  To give him the benefit of the doubt, I ask our mutual friends and his best friend their opinions of us. And in the end, they all  confirm that they don't think he cares about me that much from the way he treats me. That he'll be sad if I break up with him, but for my sake they all agree i could do better, and they were all surprised I even gave him a chance at all. 





With his best friend's opinion pushing me overboard, I try to break up with him, explaining all of this and he breaks down completely and says how he was jsut being stupid and angry and that he talks about me everyday and thinks about me everyday and loves me and that we I just need to make it clearer to him what I want because he's an oblivious guy, and if I feel neglected or something, I just need to tell him and he'll work on his anger. He tells me that he thought we had reached a point in our relationship where breaking up wasn't even an option anymore, and that we'd be able to work through everything and talk about it. If there was a problem, we'd just need to talk.  I stupidly give him another chance. I book my ticket to Japan. 





We skype again and he has a huge breakdown. He feels like he's completely lost about his life. He's never had a real internship, not a real job, the one thing he wanted in school, he didn't get. he continues and says he doesn't understand why I'm with him. How i could be with him and be so understanding of him even though he's an ass who can't even take care of me. I tell him, he's just freaking out. That I believe in him and he just needs to calm down and things will work out (I honestly believed this. I always believed in him. He's really smart. Just neglectful and stupid sometimes) and that in the end, I'm with him because I love him.  He cries even more and tells me how he hates himself because he knows I'm the best thing that has ever happened to him, but he can't shake his doubts about us. And i tell him that doubts are normal. That I have them too, and it all comes down to wanting to try, especially because we're long distance with a huge time difference and age/ life stage difference. He calms down. 





A few weeks later, we're talking about and I ask him if he wants to meet my entire family at thanksgiving so I can book the ticket while it's still cheap.  I remind him, that if he goes, this is a big deal. He has to be serious because no one meets my family, my grandparents without being serious. He says he wants to. I take it as a sign of his commitment.  I book the ticket. 






A week before I'm set to fly to Japan, he's been MIA online. he gets on and i'm asking if he planned anything for when i get there like hotels and such, or if i need to do that. he says he's sorry. He's been caught up meeting up with everyone as the semester there ends that he's ended up being a bad friend, a bad son, and a bad boyfriend because in trying to be with everyone, he ended up neglecting everyone.  he say's he'll take care of all the hotels and planning though and he can't wait to see me.  So i let it go, and let him be and look forward to seeing him. 





I land, and he quickly kisses me and looks around and is like "" we're in Japan, so it's weird to show affection in public. sorry"" I'm okay with it.  But he doesn't seem excited to see me. We get on the train and I'm feeling sad because it's not comfortable. He seems distant. I'm just staring out the window, and to my surprise he grabs my hand, kisses me on the cheek and whispers ""I'm really really happy you're here. I'm sorry i can't show it in public. But i'm really happy."" We look around and when no one's there he actually kisses me.  I'm feeling better.





We get to the hotel. I drop my bags and just jump into the bed since it's been a long flight.  He says he's going to check on directions on how to get to the restaurant.  It's taking a while on his iPad so I crawl over to see what he's doing. He's playing a game. I jokingly hit him and say ""I've just traveled halfway across the world to be with you and you'd rather play a game than be with me?!"" But it's how we always are. Comfortable around each other. Just being around each other is fine, so I shake it off.





He takes me around Japan. He's a horrible guide and didn't plan things well, but he's trying. A majority of the trip is just us on trains going from place to place. But it's okay. We're happy and having fun and the awkwardness and distance starts to fade.  One day we're walking and talking and he talks about how it scares him much popularity matters to him. In Japan, everyone wants to be around him because he's the 6'3"" Blonde German.





I tell him that that scares me, because if he wants that popularity when he gets back, he wouldn't be dating me. He says he knows, but obviously he doesn't want it that much because he's still with me.  We talk a bit more about how our friend groups form, and how to me, he's the main friend I have that i can do anything with. He's the good time, partying, deep conversation, friend, but I point out how he doesn't seem to think i'm the partying friend anymore. He says it's awkward because we never met in that context, so to him I'm the friend that he can talk to and completely be himself around, but not the I'm drunk and partying friend to be around. Just the one he can come back to when all that is over and he can stop pretending that's what he wants when all he really wants is to be able to sit around and watch shows and read.   





While he goes to the bathroom, i read an article about ""Catholic Dating"" that someone posted on facebook. I laugh at how its kind of ridiculous. He points out that the part about couples freaking out when they get into their first argument after marriage would never apply to us if we hypothetically got married because we've argued and we know that we can sort through things





That night he introduces me to his best friends in Japan. A bit of a language barrier, but we all get along. We were supposed to go to an arcade that night, but his friends can't and i was like. well can we go after, and he says it'll close and its unfair to his friends because they all have work tomorrow, so i should be understanding. I am, but it still sucks because I just flew halfway across the world and I won't get to see the arcade he promised. But I let it go. He leaves the bar we're at slightly before me, leaving me to exit alone. It's like 2/3am. I'm okay with this though a bit hurt, but it's the last time for a long time he'll see his friend from Japan. On my way out, some random guy grabs my ass. I'm in a bit of shock and just stand there and try to see who this guy is so I can go and beat the shit out of him. I see him pretty far away. My boyfriend asks whats wrong when he sees that I'm pretty far behind him. I tell him and he just stares at me and is like "" I'm sorry i don't know what to do. Do you want me to run after him and beat him up?  Or hold him down while you beat him up? Or yell at him in Japanese?"" by this point, the guy is gone. I just tell him it's fine and that we should just go.  We get back to the hotel and he apologizes for not being a better boyfriend and knowing what to do and then turns the situation about him and how incompetent he is and again why he wonders how i could still be with him and comfort him. I'm a good girlfriend and just ignore what I went through and try to make him feel better. 





This is getting long. I meet his host family. the tell him he should marry me. his host mom gives me a kimono to reflect that. my parents come. we have a good time and he's being a pretty good boyfriend through all of this. We get into an argument my last day cause he did something really insensitive and brought personal family issues into a conversation with my friends because "" he didn't know what else to talk about and it was my fault for being so quiet"" I'm about to leave japan and I'm angry at him, he grabs me apologizes. Makes promises about how we're going to do all this stuff and be so much better when he gets back. How he can't wait to visit my family and thank them and then he says ""I love you. You know that right?"" and again I tell him ""Sometimes I do"".  Rushed at the airport again and he just says "" we're halfway there. It's only a short time until we're back again"" 




Two weeks after I leave, it's amazing again. Then his parents come to visit him in Japan. He doesn't talk to me for a week and I'm getting a bit paranoid because this is strange.  Right when i'm about to get angry, he sends a message telling me how he's beein busy but he really misses me and loves me and promises to skype with me soon. 3 days later, he has time but he decides he'd rather go out than skype with me. I send him a message about making time instead of waiting for a time when he has nothing else to do and how he asked me to express when I feel neglected and this was me doing it. 




Three days later, i get on skype and he basically says "" I think we should break up. I don't love you anymore. I've been dating you out of convenience for the last year. I don't want to marry you or have kids with you.  and I don't think we can be friends. I stopped being attracted to you.  I can't do this in person, because I'd be happy to see you and we would keep this going on for longer, but I'm not blissfully happy with you.""  etc etc. ""fuck you for being so caring"" etc etc for two hours and while he's crying. 





I tell him okay, but can we talk in a week when we've both calmed down. A week later and he's being a complete ass. He says I've cried this whole week but I'm over it now. I don't love you. We can only be friends under the condition that you don't try to get back together with me because it will never happen. I don't know anything else about my life, but I know 100% how I feel and I know I don't love you, but I still care about you, but I don't think we can be friends. he then says he doens't want to talk to me or see me again. 





Then he messages me about when he's coming back to school and if i want to meet up.  When i tyr to he says no because it will be an argument.  I kind of force him to talk to me one night after we see each other for the first time and he ignores me all day.




he says: 1. Yeah it's hard to look at you. Everything here reminds me of you.
2. I don't love you, but I'm not over you. 
3. You're so caring, it's suffocating. 
4. I know I treated you like shit. Obviously, I didn't love you or else I would have treated you as a goddess.
5. I was a great boyfriend to my ex, so it's you. 
6. I don't like who i am when I'm with you. I'm a bad person. that's not the type of person I am, or who I want to be. It's you. 
7. I couldn't stay with you. If I did, i would have settled for a job here to be with you. (funny thing is he just got a job about a block away from our university) 
8.i will never forget you. You've been such  huge part of my college life. I just need time away to sort out my life and then maybe when thanksgiving break comes, we can talk and try to be friends again. 
9. Maybe in another life we would have worked, but I gave up. I was selfish. It was hard and I just want to be single now and enjoy my last year of college. And now we have two year of history for this to ever work again. 




The list of hurtful and nonsensical things continues. Contradictions galore.




Now, its about that time. He hasn't reached out. He's been ignoring me more than ever, and usually I'm fine, but then there are bad moments when I remember what he promised. Like this weekend about trying to be friends. Even though he hasn't acted like that.  And he's so fine and perfectly moved on. I hate it. I gave him so many chances and he just ran away in the end.





And the worse part is that he treats me worse than everyone. Worse than his old ex. Worse than people he hates. And he always vents up all his anger, so everyone thinks that he's such a nice and happy guy, and I'm the crazy person who won't let go, when all i really want is a proper explanation as to why he can treat me like shit and no one else. He's not a bad person. Just an ass to me. He always said that he always ends up doing this to the people closest to him. It was his brother before, and then it became me. I get to see him sad and cry, but I also get to see the angry him. 


There are a lot  more details that make this more confusing. More stuff with his ex, his parents, his breakdown etc. but this is long and I doubt people are going to read it,but if you want more details, just comment.


I don't want him back as a boyfriend. I just want to know what happened to my friend, and what it is about me that makes him resent me so much. I want to say his family had a huge say, he denies it. He lies to our mutual friends about wanting to be friends and then acts otherwise. It' not worth my time, I know. But I want answers. 
---

**tl;dr**: 20 months of ups and downs. He talks to ex and is nice to her even though we're dating. He mentions marrying me several times and I'm not ready. He goes abroad. I try to break up. He cries. I give another chance. His parents come. he ignores me for two weeks. comes back saying he hasn't loved me for the last year and has been using me. Contradicts himself. Lies to our mutual friends. Now is perfectly fine and I doubt he's going to keep his word about meeting up and trying to be friends now that he has his life sorted out. I hate that I don't hate him. I hate it that he doesn't give a fuck and forgot about me. "

So for as long as I can remember I have wanted to get onto a professional race design team like along the lines of Peugeot Sport. I will be finishing up my first semester of college as a mechanical engineer next semester, and as such have next to no large internship/co-op opportunities available to me for this summer. The other problem is that my experience with building cars is very specific and i need more board experience before many companies would even consider an internship.  
___
My question is: **where would you start?**  
  
  
I dont need a payed position so I was thinking about calling a lot of the auto shops around where I will be staying this summer (Southern California) that specialize/do a lot of rally and race designed cars. Do you think this would be a good place to start? Would they even likely take me since I have minimal experience?  
  
**NOTE:** the reason I x-posted this here is that I am majorly in love with rally, and while it will be a while before I can afford to get into it, I thought it might be useful to have experience on rally cars specifically.

**TL;DR** I'm a college freshman in Mech. Engr. and want to eventually get onto a race design team. How would you start?"

Is this LEGAL?,Clurrrrrr,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1qzh4a/i_just_found_out_my_sister_hasnt_received_a_penny/,"My sisters and I were raised Christian. My oldest sister and I became atheists and my two middle sisters are still Christian with my sister, lets call her Laura, being the most “extreme”.  She got a job at a church last year which sounded like an amazing opportunity. She would get to live with a host family which would provide her with food all while making about 2,000 a month. How great does that sound? Anyway, as time went on I started to notice things were just NOT adding up. She would ask my parents for money constantly and always seemed to be broke.  She pays no rent, no car bill, no insurance and no cell phone bill. After asking her where all her money went she said that it goes towards gas and that she was giving my parents 200 dollars a month for her cell phone. My mother confirmed this was a lie. Since my husband and I pay bills out the ass, have a baby and still manage to get by I started to become furious at my sister. Where was ALL of this income going? How could she be so irresponsible with her money? 
I went over to my parent’s house yesterday to drop my son off before I went to work. My mom started bitching about how my sister used their credit card to buy herself a birthday gift that cost over $100. I finally blew up and asked my mom why she’s letting Laura mooch off of them when she is in the perfect situation to take care of herself. My mom then informed me that Laura’s job wasn’t as “good” as she made everyone believe it was and asked if she sent me a letter. I said no and she explained that Laura has to raise $12,000 in 6 months in order to get paid by sending out letters to friends and family asking for donations. Half goes to her half goes into “the program” that she’s working for.  If she doesn’t raise the money, she doesn’t get paid. 
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING? Is this even legal? THIS is why I hate Christianity and organized religion. They are basically making money off of my sister working for them. She claims that “God called her to this job” but in reality they are scamming her.  Has anyone else heard of something like this? 


UPDATE: I spoke with my sister on the phone. The program is 12 months. She WAS getting paid 500 dollars a month until her 6 month mark because she was unable to meet her halfway point in fundraising. She decided to give up payment so that she didn't end up OWEING money to the church. So now she's working for free until more donations come in...if any. She feels ""blessed"" to be in this position and says it's like an ""internship"". She also has faith that all of her funds will be covered. During this conversation I found out that she had NO idea the church doesn't pay taxes. 

Me: I mean they don't even pay taxes you'd think they could atleast afford to pay you minimum wage

Laura: the church pays taxes!!! 

Me:uh no they don't 

-------
Me-there is a church in Virginia beach that cost like 50 million dollars to build, don't you think that's crazy? 

Laura- that's not the churches fault it wAs so expensive, it's the governments fault. 

YES these were things my idiot sister said. I'll post more as I think of them

---

-------

* [Spigot seems to have started work on 1.7.2 builds](http://ci.md-5.net/job/Spigot-1.7/) and released them before Bukkit has even gotten its first dev build out the door, I think Cuthulutest has been having login auth issues (no clue why only it is getting them) so I cant join to test things. Its got a long way to go but its encouraging to at least see somthing. I am going to leave it running on Civthulu so that people can try it out. 

* Javapipe has more joys of scheduled maintenance for us this Thursday at 13:00GMT or about 7am CST, we will need to shut down the server for this, so I will need to try and find a good schedule to shut it down and bring it back up. 

* Ok in repose to the NoCheatPlus based fix for the point to point teleport issue I have re-enabled indestructible boats. Enjoy. 

* Server move cost breakdown: I have some reservations about this move, but I am willing to try if the community is. 
   - $200 (Shipping $100 a way)
   - $50   (Package Insurance $25 a way)
   - $200 (Install/uninstall costs $100 each)
   - $224 (Month one bill)
   - $40   (A pair of rails for Titan, without them $7 a month to rent a pair) 
   - Total: $714 of which $225 is recoverable backup funds if everything goes well. 
   - Collected $190 
   - Stretch Goal: [128 or 256Gig SSD to replace the current 60gb one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA2W00ZD1539) 
   - Notes: The Website fund $176 could fund a good bit of this, but funds will not be moved without supporters consent. 

* Speaking of the website [here is the github](https://github.com/SuperfineStudios/civcraftsite) right now I would really like to see a finished landing page soon, and then we can put that up and develop out from there. If we wait till its 'done' to put it online then things will never happen. Whats the ETA on that? And since we have a website fund who can I pay to make it go faster? 

*  [Pluxar's new new poster](http://i.imgur.com/6wysHwC.png) is sitting here so I don't forget the link. Its also quite nice to look at eh? 

* For all the desire and interest in Nether travel when I agree to try and implement the NetherFactory (and thus Neather travel) there seems to be little development effort forthcoming to try and make it possible. Do we need a development bounty? 

* Rourke, I still owe you a dev bounty, contact me about that. 

* I need to start looking into Internships for my Major, as a Computer Engineer I think I would like to actually stay on the hardware side of things which makes me very confused about where to go for a computer hardware based internship, software ones are all over the place. 

--------
Changes for Civtest:
-----

------

* The MySql RealisticBiomes seems to be droppings its database connection after it is online on Civtest for long periods (aka any longer than a day) since Citadel and JukeAlert are fine I presume there is either somthing up with the way its handling things or that Citadel simply makes no requests to discover that there is a problem during that period.

1qz7e0,4,2013-11-19,27 M4F - Why should I choose you over her?,Epower86,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/1qz7e0/27_m4f_why_should_i_choose_you_over_her/,"Here is my idea, it may work it may not but let me know if you have any thoughts anyways.
It seems as though guys are always trying to hook up with the girls on here (Yes i realize the ratio and that guys creep this page, I am one of them) So I thought I would try to flip this around and see if I could get a few responses from females interested.

Scenario:
Basically a classic, you've always been in love with me/ lusted after me, but for some reason or another I was out of reach, Marriage, Distance, Maybe I don't even know who you are. Here's a few ideas I thought up, but I welcome any other suggestions you think might work as well.

1. Having been recently divorced, I am finally single. Although working for a powerful agency and making incredible amounts of money seems great from the outside, the long hours, various business trips and seemingly endless amount of perky college interns trying to make a name for themselves takes a toll on a marriage when the wife doesn't trust you. But at least I have you there to help me through this time having worked together for 6 years we have our own history, and although we have never been anything but friends your intentions are now changing and you want more.
Twist - You can either be the friend co-worker or if you prefer a conniving college intern trying to get ahead in the corporate world.

2. I'm Married, and the little ring around my finger means that I am off limits. But you don't care about that, it's you who I should have been with in the first place not your sister. It was you and I who became friends way back in school, it was you and I who went to prom together, it was you and I who lost our virginity to each other but a lot has changed since then. We grew apart when you left, when you left me behind to pursue your own life without me in it. I fell in love with your sister, we got married, you didn't attend the wedding, you were too ""busy"" as usual. But now your back and you've never let go, and it's you who I should be with, and now you're ready to show me why. But your sister won't let me go without a fight.
Again, your choice, be the older sister back in town, and in my head I can see her being slightly crazy, maybe not murdering the sister, but I could see her kidnapping her, or making her watch as she seduces me, something to really get back at the sister for ""Stealing"" me. Or you can be the wife who knows what the sister is up to and wants to make sure I stay by turning things up a bit, in a good girl gone bad sort of way.

3. The floor is yours - Let me know if you have an idea that would work, I am completely open to any and every suggestion!

Thanks for taking the time to read, and I look forward to some great responses!"

I am an intern currently, and have not used R Studio prior to the class. I have been investigating the utilization of the 'Shiny' and 'googleVis' packages in R Studio. I attached a private link to a copy of one of our old reports, as well as a link to an interesting and related article. Does anyone have any recommendations about where to start? I am having trouble finding information using 'shiny' for ecology, is there a reason for that? Thank you!

1qz3gs,0,2013-11-19,I need advice for finding your first CPA position.,kittycatshay,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1qz3gs/i_need_advice_for_finding_your_first_cpa_position/,"I am in undergrad studying to be an accountant. I plan on going to grad school for my MSA in the next couple of years and also sitting for the exam after that. Originally, I was going to graduate undergrad this upcoming spring semester. However, I went to two accounting career fairs this fall and gave my resume to probably 30-35 firms. Some small regional, two Big4 (I was not expecting to hear from them) and some larger regional firms as well. 

I know that I'm not super competitive, but I think that I am at least somewhat competitive. I have a 3.4 accounting GPA, and a 3.2 overall GPA. I did a full time internship last year (not in accounting, but in finance) and am working a part time internship right now as well (not accounting again, but finance). 

However, I had a very hard time getting interviews anywhere. There were a few companies that I thought I definitely met all of the qualifications for and then I never heard from the again. (I did email their HR departments after the career fairs) The weird thing to me is that when I met the reps at the career fair, a lot of people told me that I was an ideal candidate. But then when they got back to their firms and gave my resume to HR, I never got an interview. 

Instead of graduating this spring now, I am working full time next semester at an accounting internship that I was offered and will graduate the semester after that instead ( next December). It is not at a CPA firm, but it is at a publicly held company and I'm going to get to work closely with the CFO. 

Also, since I will be graduating in December now, I now have a window for full time grad school after I graduate for companies that have fall starts for their hires. 

My question is, do you think having the accounting internship and concrete plans for grad school will give me that edge that I need to get interviews when I attend the career fairs next fall? What other steps can I take to make myself more competitive?"
1qz3ds,2,2013-11-19,"Help dealing with my (m27) fiance's (f25), depressed, OCD and extremely difficult sister (f21)?",SpoiledAdult,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qz3ds/help_dealing_with_my_m27_fiances_f25_depressed/,"X-post from relationships, as it would be helpful to have more mental-health based responses.

Firstly it's worth saying that this post is not entirely about my future sister-in-law's depression, but rather about her general behaviour around her parents and to a lesser extent my fiance (25F), her sister, some of which may be caused by, or even cause, her depression.  I will refer to my fiance as ""F"" her sister as ""S"" and her parents as ""mum"" and ""dad"" respectively.  This account is from my outside perspective, with all the caveats and biases that implies, but I've tried to set it out neutrally and in as much detail as possible in the hope of getting good advice.  I'm really sorry for the excessive length.

Mum is of south asian background, Dad is welsh, both have lived in England for most of their adult lives.  Mum's family are very modern and liberal (by local cultural standards) and one of her siblings also married a westerner and moved abroad with the family's blessing.  She is English in attitude but retains certain cultural traits from her childhood, paramount among which is her relationship with her children.

Simply put, growing up, Mum ensured life revolved around the kids.  She chose a career (civil service) that allowed her security of income while still giving her very regular hours and the ability to spend as much time with her kids as possible.  From what I can tell she was a great mother, EXCEPT that the guilt she felt about working at all manifested in trying to do everything possible she could for her kids, even when they were perfectly capable of doing it for themselves.  While in the case of F, 4 years older than S, there were some rules (some quite strict even) and boundaries, these were much more relaxed for S.  There were few if any imposed responsibilities (formal chores etc) but the kids were generally good and (F at least) did help out around the house reasonably regularly.  The family were and are VERY close, though mum and dad do argue from time to time over the usual small scale bits and pieces.

Growing up (from F's account), S was a particularly wilful child.  She often required things to be done a very specific way and her parents and sister would pretty much always indulge her.  F feels horribly guilty now, but she often used to ""help"" her sister with homework from school, which in retrospect amounted to basically doing it for her.  F (and Mum) was incredibly protective of S.  Dad was slightly less close with S, as S would often ignore him and run to Mum etc.  Dad was closer to F.  Mum also had very high expectations of her kids and schoolwork always came first, to the point Mum would stop them from helping with, say, washing up and instead insist she do it so they could go study.  She was not, however, a ""dragon-lady"" - her approach was pure love, with a little bit of guilting thrown in.

F has many memories of huge S temper tantrums, which would end up with Mum comforting S to keep the peace.  So far, so normal for a young child.  Except these behaviours have continued or even worsened into adulthood.  Mum and Dad spent S's later teenage years, after F had moved out, treading on eggshells.  Literally anything could set S off into screaming and shouting, or ignoring for long periods.  

Shortly after leaving home for university several hours away, S stopped attending lectures/classes or handing in work.  Every weekend she would come home (a 3 - 4 hour and expensive train journey) with her washing.  She did not get on with her housemates, feeling alienated from them, and did not have a large social circle.  I think it is this environment in which she first developed anxiety/depression issues (see below), primarily as a result of difficulty adjusting and guilt over not doing any of the necessary work at university.  F thinks she has a problem accepting that something is worth doing even if it cant be done ""perfectly"" - e.g. if she is 5 minutes late to something she wont go at all.  This may tie in to OCD traits she has (see below). Halfway through her first year, S dropped out of university and moved home.  

S has (shortly before dropping out of university) been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, though in my view this is not the route cause of the behaviours but rather a consequence of the situation S is in as a result of the behaviours (who wouldn't be depressed and anxious when their incredibly high expectations and limited work ethic fail to gain traction on the real world?).  Certain therapists have also mentioned possible paranoia and/or OCD.   S has not stuck with any therapist for more than a handful of sessions and often finds fault in their approach, gets angry and/or sleeps in and misses sessions and then stops going.  S is on some form of anti-depressant now which seems reasonably agreeable to her.

Over the next year after dropping out she lived at home and (intermittantly) attended mind youth group meetings (her most successful commitment to date, she goes reasonably often but is always late (30mins+) despite it being 2 minutes walk from home, doing a little bit of volunteering, going to adult classes in various hobbies (again, not usually on a committed basis) and very occasional therapy which has tailed off.  After six months she attempted a grace-and-favour job her mother organised through work (but in another department) but quickly quit because she could not really attend punctually and found the work menial.  She has restarted in a local university, living at home, doing an easier course (she is very academically able) that she claims is very easy, but again has issues with attendance and handing in work, missing several major deadlines and obtaining several extensions based on her mental health.  It is unclear at this point whether she will keep it up.  The course in undemanding and there is no evidence she finds the work itself taxing or anxious-making.

That brings us up to date, so I will briefly describe her current behaviour.  Crudely put, it is like a spoilt 5 year old:

* She often uses a baby-voice, though this is one of the few things her mum, with coaxing from F and I, was willing to set boundaries about and its got a bit better.  She still has a babyish ""lilt"" to her voice a lot of the time which is entirely contrived.

* She makes very specific and exacting demands.  She wants a drink, it must be in a specific cup and a specific temperature, NO NOT LIKE THAT, get another one.  Mum almost always complys.

* She has a general sense of entitlement that manifests as frequent anger (outrage is probably a better word) at the world.  She has limited empathy for people outside her immediate family and friends and can't see things from their point of view.  For example, she frequently loses the plot with customer service etc. and feels people ""owe"" her special treatment.  She is actively angry (and capable of expressing why cogently, but not able to express how this is a reasonable reaction).

* She frequently takes charge and feels entitled to make family decisions that her mum and dad then have to stick to.

* She is extremely whimsical and expects others to pander to her whims. One day she decided she didnt like some champagne goblets her parents had in a sideboard so she gave them away because she didnt want them in the house.  Her parents' views were not solicited.

* She sleeps for at least 12 hours a day, I'm not sure when she goes to bed but she gets up in the afternoon most days.  She cancels/skips out on a lot of planned events (including meeting us and going to uni) and just sleeps or plays on her laptop.

* On her 21st birthday she offered to make a cup of tea for the assembled grandparents etc (I was also there) and went to the kitchen, before bursting into (screaming) tears that no-one came to help her.  She ran upstairs screaming and (as usual), mum followed and tried to console her.  Among the many things she cried was one nugget that I found interesting - that she ""didn't want to grow up or be an adult"".  This infantilism is a common theme (colourful, curley strawed cups and other childish things an often demand).

* Mum tends to nag, but otherwise treats her with kid gloves. Dad tries to keep out of it but privately expresses similar concerns to ourselves.  Their house is literally a warzone sewn with landmines.  Neither mum nor dad can have any interaction with S without, sooner or later, setting her off entirely unintentionally.  

* F has the best relationship with S in the family, but after a few alienation incidents over the last few years, is also treading on eggshells and isn't comfortable giving advice to her forcefully for fear of the (volcanic) reaction.

* Although I see entitled behaviours, demanding and occasionally the baby-voice, when I am around S does not have tantrums in front of me (though she may run to her room).  This seems to be the case for other non-family too.

* S is effectively completely dependant on mum and dad.  She does not (will not) cook, clean or do anything else around the house with any regularlity.
 
All S's financial needs are met by a generous allowance from parents and significant  savings made up of gifts from parents and grandparents.  S has held an occasional job over the years but generally quits after issues with punctuality/reliability/taking time off.  Even if parents turned off the allowance (which would result in a lot of screaming and crying and shouting), I think S has many thousands in savings held in her name that would be difficult (and perhaps very unfair) to take back. 

No idea if this is relevant, but for full disclosure - S may be questioning her own sexuality. She has never had a serious boyfriend.  One boyfriend at university turned out to be asexual and broke up with her when he ""came out"".  She may have had sex with girls.  Whole family is and would be super-supportive of this, and have expressed this in non-threatening terms.  F has talked to her about it and got non-committal responses (""maybe"").  That said, most recently S had sex with a (M21) friend who was staying with her and parents while pursuing a London internship for a few weeks, although he decided he didn't want anything else to come of it.

While we push getting more therapy, in particular CBT, we have had limited success in actually making this happen.  More recently we have suggested family therapy, as in all honesty we dont think Mum-S interaction is helping things improve, but again very little has happened and its hard to impose something like that from externally if none of the involved people particularly want to go.

In a candid moment, Dad has said he thinks it very unlikely that Mum will listen to a family therapist even if they make it explicitly clear that she needs to stop pandering to S and set clear boundaries.  Dad thinks it will break her heart to do so and she simply isn't capable of it.  F tends to agree.  Mum gets INCREDIBLY upset and defensive if any of this is brought up or it is suggested she change her approach.  She seems to blame the situation on her working instead of being a stay-at-home.  This is exacerbated by a fairly unhealthy relationhip between her and her MIL during the early stages of her marriage / kids childhood in which MIL would endlessly criticise her choices and dad wouldn't defend her.

What do we do? How do we help S and Mum improve their relationship, and for S to become less dependant?  

PS: F is wonderful and we have a very communicative relationship - I may share this post with her depending on how the responses go, and she knows I wanted to make it and was ok with it so I am not betraying any trust by writing all this.  Thankfully she doesn't get defensive about my opinions on all of this.

1qyhp2,4,2013-11-19,"Stupid ex-supervisor, I hate you!! I am VERY sorry I EVER met you!!",aliveeyes,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qyhp2/stupid_exsupervisor_i_hate_you_i_am_very_sorry_i/,"It's taken two years of therapy for me to be able to even talk about the seriously fucked up way this woman abused and bullied me. I am respectful for the sake of readers, not for the sake of her humanity, but it hurts me to not rage about it. I absolutely hate her.  I wish the last day I was on that site was the last day I thought about her and just put her out of my mind, but the entire situation just disgusts me.  I was an unpaid intern there, and it timed with when she got passed over for a promotion she had been openly grooming herself for.  But I should have seen it at the beginning, that instead of promoting her, even after funding her PhD, that they chose to open a search for another 8 months to find a more suitable candidate and passed her over.  Also, her office was located in an isolated spot in a building away from her actual department. I'm willing to concede that it might have just been the wrong time for her to have an intern, after being passed over.  But she has a responsibility to speak up about that, too.  She was so rude, and I could never do anything right.  I visited over the summer to see what the office apparel looked like, and she was wearing jeans and flip flops (black ones with rhinestones on them).  I wore jeans and she told me those were inappropriate and swore up and down while sneering her lip at me when I apologized and said I thought I had seen her wearing jeans that summer so it was my mistake. She literally sneered at me, I can't even make this childishness up.  She started to educate me on racism because she had read a book on it recently, but she had no idea the multiculturalism of my own background, so I shared with her a bit of my background to let her know I was on board already and also hoped she would take time to get to know me, and she took offense!  She arranged to sponsor a safe space program, but the feedback she got wasn't pushback due to hate, the feedback from peers she got was for using the platform of safe space as a means to try and promote herself--apparently she had a reputation for being selfish.  In the 12 weeks I was with her, she mentioned on 9 occasions with such classist airs that she and her partner used to live in a 5000 square foot house.  She talked about it like it was the highest thing on her resume, like she should be treated special for her status in the community.  She was ignorant to her snobbery.  I was living between such narrow parameters to afford my schooling.  I was young and had a small retirement account, and I drained it to afford my tuition.  She watched me drink my vitamins instead of eat food the whole time.  She was always on me about not having new clothes for work, and told me to ""go to Kohl's, they have cheap things"".  I don't think Kohl's is cheap, and at that time, I was lucky to have two nickles to rub together at the end of the month! She had such a sense of entitlement, and I was embarrassed for her because she was just too old to behave that way. She would talk down about me to others saying things like how in Europe, people send their children to travel so they gain culture, and had no care to ask me about my extensive travel and living experiences. She came in one day and said they had changed the policy and that I couldn't be there for the whole year, only for one semester, and you could just see it on her face that she had coordinated the whole thing. My professor had figured out what she was doing before I did and had advised me (in a supportive tone) to start looking for a new site about 6 weeks prior, and I had looked, I just hadn't found anything. I felt it--she was firing me, but doing it in a clean way that didn't dirty her hands. She also said she was going to have a meeting with me and the director with my professor, and I questioned why the director needed to be there since she'd had no role in my supervision. She said she can be there. I just sensed the scheming, and it was her office, but my schooling, so I put my foot down and said that if she is there, then she is there but I wanted to be on the record that I questioned the appropriateness of her presence there. I left, and got a note from my professor to show up at a meeting. And there she was, with my professor, and she had on a brand new outfit and the most makeup I had ever seen her wear--war paint, lol--and with this audience, she proceeded to yell at me.  No exaggeration, she raised her voice, got red in the face, and told me I had no rights to tell a director what she can and can't do, and I told her I disagreed--I have a right to stand up for myself, and that she was not planning anything with good intentions, so I needed to stand up for myself. Then she lit into me for using the word ""demand"" which I did not use, but she heard my tone just fine, and I had put my foot down--and she apparently wasn't used to not having her way, even as a grown woman holding paper that proved she had at least sat in classes long enough to get a degree. To be clear, I don't think she is a scholar at all, I think to her it was another thing to acquire, another symbol of status, not a commitment to being an educated woman.  Anyway, she lit into me about not being entitled and other political rhetoric indicative of ageism that is common for more senior employees to have against younger people in the work environment. My professor just laughed and tried to see if the conversation was salvageable, but when she finally ended with telling me she just didn't think I liked people, which was a good half hour into her litany, he finally realized this conversation was over. I have never cried so hard. I couldn't stop crying for days, I couldn't breath. It wasn't only her meanness, it was the combination of all of the time I had spent getting my degree, and all of the money and sacrifices I had made, and the threat of losing that. And my professor sitting there and ignoring that she was abusing me and ignoring that I was crying too hard to ask her to stop talking or anything. And her threat to tell everyone in the entire community what a putz I was and to have no future career anyway, just be robbed of my life because she planned on--get this--murdering my name. And that apparently a final stand had been staged months in advance, and I hadn't even seen it coming and had truly just thought that if we got to know each other and if I kept a positive attitude, things would come around. I felt so helpless. Shame on me for thinking she was human, when she was only opportunistic and dangerous. I think she felt insecure as a wife of a successful man for so long, and the fact that it took her 6 years to finally finish a bachelor degree with a C average probably didn't help. I do pity her, but it's hard to remember that when I think of how savage her conduct was. I've never seen a person in real life behave like that before. And recently I saw that she had been admitted to the board of my program where I graduated! There she was, and it was a picture of her with the minutes from a meeting held the semester after I was so rudely treated! I couldn't believe it, not only that my professor hadn't stood up for me, but had actually allowed her to be on the board! Talk about betrayal. I couldn't help it then, I looked up her page at her work--something I have easily avoided doing because I do have self-respect and just cause I couldn't shake the feeling of being violated didn't mean I had to go and look her up online.  And there is this new, sticky-sweet ""I want YOU to succeed!"" front, and I was disgusted because it is all a lie. She just wants to use others to advance herself, and she needs people to need her. God help you if you don't need her. Anyway, even though it was two years ago now, I still suffer from it and I wish I'd never met her. I just--ug, I wish I knew she would get her come-uppings, I would revel in that, but things don't work that way. There really is no justice.  Anyway, where usually I like to learn from bad situations so that I can find the good, I can't here: I am just sorry I ever met her.  I want to rage, but more importantly, I just want people to know her type and to see them coming. She is class-ist and age-ist, she is entitled, she was more or less gifted an education by her job, and she is dangerous. Do not help these people, and do not get close to them.  I am getting better slowly, but I still need help putting this situation to rest in my heart and my mind.  Thank you for listening."
1qyh98,2,2013-11-19,Damned if I do. Damned if I don't.,Subject83,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qyh98/damned_if_i_do_damned_if_i_dont/,"When I graduated high school in 2003, I wanted to join the military but due my asthma and scoliosis I was denied by every branch. The next idea was college. My SAT/ACT scores were terrible. My grades in school were good but not great. I made As, B's, and C's. My gpa was 3.0. At the time I thought the only way to go to college was if my parents helped me pay. I tried for scholarships but scholarships are only given to people with 4.0 GPAs in high school or those who played sports. My parents didn't help me with school. I couldn't get any scholarships or grants either. By the time school wrapped up I hadn't gotten accepted into any college so I had to back to Japan. Plus, I hated the people I was living with. The youngest would go into my room and steal stuff when I wasn't around. My ""friend"" turned into an asshole. The mom didn't care about anything going on in the house so I left.

(My step-dad was in the air force, and my mom told me I could stay with a friend of the family so that I could graduate in the states.)

I came back state-side and my step dad said I need to start looking for a new place to live. Thankfully my mom talked him into letting me stay till I get a good job. I couldn't get a job that paid well enough to get me my own place so I tried looking at colleges again. I heard about ITT Technical Institute. It sounded great. I get to get a degree and I only have to take the classes I need rather than all the gen. ed stuff. SO signed up for loans. My step-father refused to sign the FASFA that would have given me a lower interest rate. My mom's credit was bad so the FASFA is all my info and mine only. I got a $30,000 loan. At the time I didn't complain about the total because I figured I would get a good job with my degree and pay that loan off in no time. I had no concept of a the price of a college degree because I thought that was normal. College isn't cheap so I didn't question it.


Two Years Later (2007) I graduated with my Associates in Electronics. I wanted to see how far an Associates would get me. If I didn't like it then I would go back for my Bachelors. That was the plan. Just like ITT advertised, I got a job very quickly. In fact, the school helped me get a job lined up 2 weeks before graduation.


I worked at that company for 2 years as an Lab Technician. At first it was fun and interesting but then things changed. It wasn't long before my boss was asking me to do things I have never done. He wouldn't show me either. Most of the time, he would tell me to fix something, then I didn't know how. He got angry with me and moved me on to something else. On day he asked me if I went to school at all. I told him I did and that he can talk to the Electronics Chairman from the school if he didn't believe me. He then told me that I should back to school but not go back to ITT Tech. I decided to do just that except no school would accept any credits from ITT so much my boss's disappointment I re-enrolled in ITT to get my BA.


Over time I grew to hate my job and my boss. On top of that my parents were talking about divorce. I hated where I lived. The winters were terrible and the crime was worse.
My childhood friend in Florida made me an offer. He said that I could live with him and his fiance for a little while til get on my feet. He also said that he would help me find a job and help me get into FSU. He had contacts everywhere. After a couple weeks of discussion over the phone I finally made the decision to quit my job, leave ITT Tech, and move to Florida. to get a BA degree.


I was in talks with the advisor from FSU who said my transcript looked good and that I would only need to take some classes at the community college first. Since everything sounded in order I moved to Florida..



At first, it was great being back in my hometown, but 3 days later my friend dropped a bomb on me: He just got a scholarship through his job so that he could get his PhD. He was going to move out of town. Once he told me this, I started packing my things to move back. He re-assured me that he would help me find a job and a place to stay before he left. At that time I had 3 months till he had to move. I went to the community college to sign up for the fall-semester. Then things got worse...



Not only did the community college accept ZERO credits from ITT Tech, but they also said that if I wanted to go to school, I'd have to pay 3x the normal amt because I wasn't a FL resident yet. Needless to say I was devastated. I had spent every time I had to move to Florida. I lived on the rest of the money for those three months. At this point I was defeated and started making plans to move back in with my parents but my friend said I can work for a year till I become a FL resident then go to school. He introduced me to a friend who worked at a good company (a defense contractor). He also introduced me to another friend who was in process of buying his first house.



I got the job as an Electronics Technician for the defense contractor and the other friend let me move in with him after my other friend moved away to get his PhD. SO everything was in order. Got a job and a roof over my head. One year later, I was getting ready to sign up for the fall semester seeing as I was to become an in-state resident.

11 Days before I was to start school and get started on re-starting my life, something bad happened. I was laid off along with many others. Instead of getting ready to get back in school, I was cancelling my registration and using my time to look for a job. Over the next few years this cycle would continue. I would get a good paying job that I enjoyed, then I would lose my job to NO FAULT OF MY OWN. Each defense contractor would lose funding which resulted in layoffs.

Now my roommate is a good guy who want's to help. To my surprise, he told me that I didn't have to pay rent when I was laid off. In fact, he said he didn't really need money from me because he's got a good stable job. He's got a Master's Degree and works as a programmer for the military. He told me that as long as I am working towards school that I could stay here rent free. Great deal right? After one lay-off I was out of work for 7 months. I was depressed. I started to make plans to move. I had a few friends in Alabama and family in New Jersey who said I could crash with them if I need to. One day a miracle came in the mail. It was an award letter for small scholarship. I showed it to my roommate and talked to other friends about it and everyone said the same thing. Stay here and go to school. In 2011, I enrolled in the community college (now State college). Each semester, I've been fortunate enough to keep getting scholarships and pell grants. I was even put on the Honors List...for the first time. EVER. 

An important thing to note: Due to the layoffs, I've had to defer my loans over and over. I couldn't pay. My $30,000 loan with the interest rate is now $74,000+. The website says it's $95,000+ but Sallie-Mae tells me this is a glitch on the site. With the ridiculous loan debt, I am now CUT OFF from receiving anymore loans through FASFA. This means that the only way I can pay for school is through Scholarships, Pell Grants, or out of pocket.

I was laid off back in July of this year (2013). My unemployment is running out as is my roommates patience. I moved to Florida in 2009 to restart my life, go back to school with a free degree to get a good job so that I can start paying off that debt. It is now 2013 and I have been laid off 8 times. 8 FUCKING TIMES TO NO FAULT OF MY OWN!!! I'm only half-way done with my new associates degree from the state college. I was working part time as an intern because I still have bills I have to pay. A part time job is perfect for me being a student. There are ZERO electronics jobs in town for me. The defense contractors are not hiring. Since my unemployment is running out, it looks like I won't have enough money to keep my cell phone on let alone gas for my car..or food. I've seen several full-time jobs but I didn't apply because I am a student. I got desperate and applied for a full-time technician position but I wasn't hired because of my lack of availability. Having that said it looks like I am going to have to make this my last semester so that I can focus on getting a job. I know working full-time and going to college is hard but not impossible. I have Attention Deficit Disorder so I need extra time on tests and special tutoring. I take Ritalin as well. Having that said having a full-time job is a bad idea for me. I wouldn't have time to go to the DSC (disability services center). 

I've come so far, made so much progress, and now my dream of restarting my life has come to an end. I'm 30 years old, $74,000+ in dept, and I can't keep a job to save my life. I've tried to apply for part-time jobs that have nothing to do with my degree but the same thing happens each and every-time. I get declined because I am ""overqualified"". No one wants a guy with an Associates in Electronics and 7 yrs experience to bust their tables, be their cashier, or wash their dishes. I couldn't even get a job as a custodian. I'm willing to do whatever I have to pay the bills but no one will give me a chance. Since I'm broke and in debt, I can't go anywhere or hang out. Can't get a girlfriend either and why would any girl want to be with me when I'm drowning in debt.

When I was younger I always thought that I would have a career, a place of my own and a wife/kid by the time I was 30. Instead my friends have all of those things and I am 30 and can't even take care of myself. I'm not independent. With the economy being this bad, I see little reason to live. The only reason I haven't committed suicide is because of my spiritual beliefs...that I've lost two friends to suicide. I remember how sad it made me feel. I remember how devastated their parents were. I don't want to do that to anyone. I feel terrible for even thinking about it but this life of always eating my way through life and running up hill is no life at all. My roommate hasn't said it but I know he is tired of helping me. I don't blame him. I hope that if I chose to leave this world that no one will blame me. All I want is a better life. How am I supposed to pay off the debt if no one will hire me?

At this point, I've gone from applying for actuarial/analyst positions to everything from HR to finance to ecosystem research (which is ironically turning out the be my most successful application. Wat.)

I'm double majored in Actuarial Math and Econ with a minor in CS. I do a ton of extracurriculars and have a good deal of leadership experience. I've passed P on my first go and am sitting FM in a couple of months. But my two shortcomings are my blatant lack of industry-relevant experience, and my unspectacular grades (hovering around a 3.1). I wouldn't contest that I'm the cream of the crop, but I'm starting to feel downright invisible because I very seldom get an opportunity to show that my strengths outweigh my weaknesses, and it's terribly easy to screen resumes in GPA-order.

Obviously I'm keeping at it, but I'm wondering if there's anything that I can do to change my approach so I feel less like I'm spinning my wheels. So I was wondering what sorts of things that I can focus on in the now, apart from doing well in my courses to try and hike myself up from the B-range. 

And if it shakes out that I don't find work this coming summer, I've had a desk job with my uni that I'd just continue to work at to keep myself living comfortably, and would likely try sitting another exam so I'm not just twiddling my thumbs. Apart from that, are there any resources out there to help me sharpen industry-relevant skills?

Thanks in advance for any responses.

**EDIT:** Some feedback I got from a career advisor today. Figured some of it might be helpful to anybody else in my shoes reading this-- this is a forum right?:

*  There's a ton of jobs still out there. Just because it's mid-November doesn't mean that everything is dried up.

* Spamming applications is great, but there's much more success to be had by introducing yourself outside of the same context as everyone else applying (i.e. career fairs, info sessions)

* Going off of that, LinkedIn is an invaluable tool that you can use to get in touch with (read: not harass) folks working at companies that you're interested in. There are a number of ways to get in touch with alumni, and through asking them for advice/guidance, you'll end up having an edge (however small or large that might be) on other folks because you'll have a real feel of the atmosphere you're trying to get involved with.

* Expand your margins on your resume, and really dig into the bullet points that you might have listed on your activities. The guy I spoke with said to try and follow the ""ACR format"" where you summarize the **A**ction verb you did, given the **C**ontext, and the **R**esult that followed (e.g. I *analysed* the merchandise sales trends of my organization which lead to a more profitable approach to the types of things that we sell). These types of things should be expanded upon in your cover letter (just pick a couple) as they relate to whatever jobs that you're trying to get.

*  Worst-case scenario, if you strike out, try and get in touch with any professors that you have about getting involved with research opportunities. Paid or not, they're invaluable, and could very well be the types of things that get you a callback when the next round of job applications go out.

* Reiterating, there's still plenty of internship-specific recruiting that happens during the winter term, so it's by no means an anomaly to not have found something yet, but in the meantime, just keep at it.

Hope this helps someone. I know that I needed to hear a lot of it."
1qy19y,1,2013-11-18,I'm not sure what to do.,Thatsmyfavoriteword,AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/1qy19y/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Well, I go to a small private college. I'm in my last year of undergraduate school majoring in psychology and sociology (I'm actually in my 5th year because of the second major). A month ago I took the GRE Psychology subject test and I thought I did great. However, I just found out online that I didn't do so well. I may have just been optimistic, I'm not sure.

Anyways, I assumed I would eventually go to graduate school, but this has left me a little more than disheartened about that. I want to go simply because I can't see myself doing much else in life. If I were still to attempt to go I would be applying for grad school *next* fall. I would actually be taking graduate classes in the fall of 2015.

I'm not sure what I would want to research (This is possibly another reason that I wouldn't be good in graduate school). I have a lot of interests: Psychology of Self, Self and Identity, Self-concept/knowledge, Meaning/Purpose in Life, some Positive Psychology, Epiphanies. 

If I could boil the questions down a little, I guess I want to know how people define themselves and why, and if they want to be defined in a different way, then why, and how they may change that. It may seem a little odd, but I don't really want to focus on qualitative research. At this time I'm still trying to find articles/researchers that interest me.

Well here are my numbers.

GRE: (Absolutely no studying done)

Verbal Reasoning: 66th percentile

Quantitative: 15th (Yeah, I was going to retake this next year, but this is obviously already a big dip in my chances of going anywhere)

Analytical Writing: 54th. I took the GRE in the summer of last year and I think that I could raise my Verbal and Analytical scores quite a bit actually, probably not much can be done for my Quantitative however.

GRE Psychology Subject Test : 36th (I probably could have studied more, but I thought that going through the capstone class in psychology last semester would have prepared me enough, and I did review the GRE Psychology subject test textbook for about a couple weeks before actually taking the test)

But *then* there's my MFT at the end of this last spring semester, which I got in the 80th percentile overall, also with a:

70th in Learning and Cognition, 

84th in Perception, Sensory, Physiology. I do like Neuroscience and Psychopharmocology and I have considered those areas in the past as well since I've done better in them than many people. On a bit of a tangent, I've also thought about Biomedical Engineering but that is most likely very optimistic/naive as you can see by my Quantitative skills above.

A 66th in Clinical, Abnormal and Personality. And actually, my lowest was in Developmental and Social which was in the 58th percentile.

Is my MFT score relevant at all to anyone?

GPA: 2.65/4. I'll try and justify this my saying that I actually am doing much better now than I was my first year or 2. I got on academic probation during my first 2 years but I've tried pretty hard to turn things around. All of my terrible grades are in general education courses. I can't find my psychology or sociology gpa but they would be over 3, though not by much.

I've done three research projects for classes by myself from beginning to end and I know how to use R pretty well. I've never actually presented at a conference or worked in a lab though. I am friendly with my professors and they all know me well and they would probably help me find somewhere that I could gain lab experience or I could do another research project or two (and present at a conference) or an internship.

There's actually one more thing that might be worth mentioning, I go to school completely free, and I could conceivably go for a couple more years in the future. Though next summer I am planning on studying abroad because that's something I've always wanted to do. After next semester I could also go to a nearby University and take a couple graduate classes for cheap, which, if I'm not actually accepted anywhere (very likely, I know), I probably will end up doing. (I could also potentially take those undergraduate Biomedical engineering classes here for cheap). 

I'm trying to be realistic about my future and I guess I just need some honesty about what I can do and some alternatives for me. Thank you very much!"

I need a bit of help with my apartment search. I live in Canada, but I got an internship in NYC, so I'm in the process of finding a place to stay. As I'm nowhere near New York, and won't be able to get out there until I start my internship, I was hoping someone could take some time out of their day, and look at some of the potential places, to confirm they're legitimate. I already have one potential place, so ideally I would like to get it checked out tomorrow or Wednesday. 
Thanks!"
1qxpow,1,2013-11-18,"GF started working before me and was rapidly promoted. I'm feeling rushed to build a career, feeling like shit and my life has lost almost all meaning. Any advice?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qxpow/gf_started_working_before_me_and_was_rapidly/,"A little backstory: me and my girlfriend both study computer science. She is 3 years older than me, but spent some time studying philosophy and additional time studying for the university admission exams for economics (she didn't pass) and later for computer science. She started college one year after me, as a result. My girlfriend was always very ashamed of her ""lazy days"" before studying CS. She also have always had poor self esteem in respect to her academic skills. Throughout the years I dedicated a lot of work into making her feel prouder, and had some minor (but existent) results.

That being said, I should mention that, in the early times (before she started working), my girlfriend was very proud of my academic achievments, frequently massaging my ego. I mention this not to show myself, but because I recognize my depression may have something to do with my ego.

My girlfriend has had some difficult times with college, but I always did my best - and still do - to help her with that. This is important because, as I have an academic inclination (I wish to pursue an academic career), she doesn't share most of my interests in computer science. The ""helping with college"" stuff makes me feel good not only because I can talk to her about the subjects I like, but because I feel my interests are justified by her necessity to learn about these subjects for her exams.

Finally: At the start of 2012, my girlfriend started working as an intern to a software company. She really found her place in the professional realm of computer science, being promoted 2 times throughout the course of two years. She now works full-time (40 hours), makes solid money and is just waiting to graduate to receive an even bigger salary. I don't need to mention I was (and still am) extremely proud and happy for her.

Now comes the sad part: with increasing work and additional college time, my girlfriend has almost no free time to spend with me or anyone else. This has gotten me increasingly sad over the months following her admission, to the point I almost broke up with her as a result of being unable to cope with the reduced attention. I really love her, though, and decided not to.

We (she and I) talked a lot of times about this, and her opinion is that our schedules are too much different and that I should fill my time with something such as working. My wish, however, is to pursue an academic career, and she is fine with that. The only problem is that the academic journey is a little longer than the professional one, and I will still be doing my PHd while my girlfriend will have the money and the autonomy to live alone from her parents and everything else.

Wishing to conciliate my lifestyle with hers, I quitted my scientific initiation scolarship and started working on a company, only to quit 3 days later, unable to fit myself in and already crippled by depression. Now I'm utterly lost in life; confused and extremely sad. My girlfriend (and I agree) thinks I should see a psychologist, but my parents disagree.

I feel like I'm rapidly losing all interest in life and have considered suicide a few times. I know the motivation behind all this is ridiculous and properly a ""white boy problem"", but that doesn't change the fact that I'm feeling very sad and can't do anything about it.

Any help will be extremely appreciated."
1r3j0y,0,2013-11-20,Anyone Know Any Local Companies Looking For Tech Support?,Ratman_84,Sacramento,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1r3j0y/anyone_know_any_local_companies_looking_for_tech/,"Hey guys. I'm currently unemployed and figured I'd drop in here to see if I could find any leads for local companies that are looking for tech support as the job hunt is not going as well as I'd like (can't say I'm surprised). I'm Sacramento born and raised. I've been in the workforce for a decade now. Other than a short stint at a retail place right out of high school I have always worked tech support. This has ranged from in-home repairs while working at small door to door repair places, to corporate tech support for large corporations.

My last job paid well and the people were great, but other than being slightly soul-killing due to repetition, it was also a contract position that expired without the opportunity to get into a permanent position.

I'll try to make my background quick and simple. I started out with a networking class in high school that got me a limited-term internship with Hewlett-Packard. Then I got an AA degree in general studies and worked for a year at a business degree at Sac State before deciding that wasn't what I wanted and took a full time job as I live alone and really need to work full time to pay the bills. I do, however, have extensive on-the-job experience with electronics in general. My skills include:

- Active Directory user account creation/maintenance
- VPN/Citrix account creation/maintenance (including on mobile devices such as smartphones)
- Advanced Outlook user account setup, permissions, exchange list creation/modification
- Have supported Exchange setup as well as company proprietary software configuration on Blackberries/iPhones/Androids/Tablets
- General and comprehensive support for desktop/laptop/tablet/phone software, including McAfee Encryption and all MS Office titles, as well as any Windows OS and any modern MacOS.
- Extensive hardware support. I can thoroughly test and replace any hardware, whether it's on a desktop/laptop/smartphone, even if it requires soldering.
- Network troubleshooting, as well as setting up network printers or any other device needing to be connected to the network.
- Advanced data recovery. Basically everything up to the point of actually needing to send it to a data recovery location so they can remove the internal platters to pull data off.
- Advanced virus removal. Really extensive experience here, which is important as it also frequently involves repairing the OS after virus removal. Even had a virus that got into a customer's router and screwed with the DNS settings.
- Experienced with remote desktop support via various remote support programs.
- Experienced with various ticketing and tracking systems.
- Can type average of 90-100wpm

I've worked in a pretty solid spectrum of environments. From retail and the horror/experience that go with that, to corporate/professional where I've had to support Presidents/Vice Presidents and communicate with vendors for large purchases and cost saving initiatives. I've had to manage my own schedule and create my own appointments. I've learned how to deal with some pretty crazy situations and how to clearly communicate to people about technology. I can't tell you how many times I've had people tell me I should be a teacher because I explained something technical to them and they understood it.

At this point I'm really trying to find something ""normal"". Monday-Friday. Day shift. Not that I'm old, but I'm not a youngster anymore and am really trying to avoid falling back into retail or one of these small computer repair shops as most pay based on commission and have limited hours/benefits. It's also much nicer to support people within a company than to deal with random people in the ""civilian"" sector. And I'm really trying to avoid another contract. It seems like the majority of positions in the tech support field are contract positions, which basically means they'll pay you less than a permanent employee, provide less benefits, and then probably let you go at the end of the contract. Currently I'm trying to get a job with the state by pumping out the resumes to each department as the job listings show up, but no luck so far.

Money is important but I live a pretty frugal lifestyle and job satisfaction and the people I work with are as important to me. So if anyone knows any Sacramento area companies that are looking to fill permanent tech support positions, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks."
1r3aoe,1,2013-11-20,Shittiest month ever,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r3aoe/shittiest_month_ever/,"I just need to vent
First off, my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me around two weeks for what she said at first was pretty much ""it's not you it's me"" we all know what that means though.  She can't devote enough time to me because she is prioritizing right now and I come last in that list of things.  Recently she came up to me and said that she wants to try and make things work, that she's willing to try harder to make this work... whatever, I know that won't last.  I said I'll think about it and later told her that I don't want her back and it honestly felt good at the time to see her with the same pain that she caused me which I see know is a bit fucked up.  But this week I have missed her non stop, I can't stop thinking about her and I have to fight the urge to text her all the time because I know it won't lead to anything good.  It hurts the most knowing that I won't ever spend the rest of my life with her like I always thought I would.  Nights are the loneliest because I'm used to having someone next to me willing to hear about my day and tell me that things will get better.  

Secondly I didn't get my internship that I needed for the summer.  It just seems like my career choice is a dead end with no job opportunities because I have no idea where to start.  My advisor has no idea what she is talking about and I've pretty much been on my own academically since the start of my freshman year.  I graduate in 2015 and I feel like I'll be unemployed forever because everyone else in the field has an internship and has passed exams needed already.  It's just really frustrating not knowing what I need to do to get a job and that prospect scares me more than anything.  My biggest fear is being a failure because my parents work so hard to put me through college that if I don't get a job all of that effort put in by them was a waste.

And to top it off, my computer took a massive shit earlier today and I'm currently typing this on a library computer (because you know, have to get that reddit fix).  I lost everything on my computer, projects I need for school and all my pictures that I've been saving for the past 3 years.  I was stupid and never backed my entire computer up which I know is my own goddamn fault but I ""never thought it would happen to me"".  I don't know how or when I'll be able to fix it or if it's even fixable because I'm broke and working as a tutor for my academic support center which is only minimum wage.

1r311y,13,2013-11-20,"Me [31 M] broke up with my fiance [27 F], need some outside reaction to what happened",cheechmo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r311y/me_31_m_broke_up_with_my_fiance_27_f_need_some/,"So here it goes....It has taken me a while to write this out just because I still feel really down and out. I haven't really been able to concentrate on it the way it needs. I have been seeing a psychologist and she helps and my other friend helps too because she went through the same thing as you will see below.

Leading up to the engagement, everything was going great. People have their good and bad days and can be moody, but nothing off setting. She lives with her parents and converted the basement to an apartment for us. So I do it in June near my birthday right after she finishes her first internship and is ready to go into the second one. Everything was perfect. We are happy, and then a few weeks later in the end of June this switch flipped in her head. I don' t know what it was.

She was supposed to call her guidance counselor at school to schedule her next internship and she couldn't pick up the phone to call. She was riddled with fear and anxiety. She couldn't even send an email. She was scared. Scared of finishing something, fear that she would fail at being a good OT. I would say to her, you will be great OT, but you will only know that once you actually do it. Turns out she left her other grad program with one semester left to begin this program.

So she fell into this deep dark depression that left her stressed out and trapped in her house in the basement during the day, all day, until I would come over. She would hide from her brother because he is schizophrenic and he would annoy her. She has no patience for him at all. How unusual that someone with a brother like that would want to help people with disabilities? She always took benzos to sleep, but then she started smoking weed everyday which she said would calm her down, to the point where she was always doing it.

Now, during this she said she couldn't work because it was against school rules to work and have an internship. But she didn't have either, so I suggested she get a day job at the food store or something to keep herself occupied. She didn't want to do that, but she would complain about not having any money and she would spend $60 a week on drugs. So you can see where my frustration started mounting.

I offered to help her with another OT intership at a place near my apartment; I went in and talked to them and got information and gave it to her to pursue. My father is director of a medical college nearby and offered to help her. She did nothing with what we gave her.

At this point, I couldn't even talk to her about what she was doing with regard to school. She would just get really mad at me and tell me to mind my own business. She was seeing a psychiatrist who was giving her medication to sleep, and suggested she see a psychologist to help her with getting through the trauma? stress? of making the phone call to her guidance counselor. They diagnosed her as having PTSD, mood disorder and one other disorder which I cannot remember. They said these were a result of her last relationship with her shitty ex-bf who used to poison her coffee in the morning with pain killers to control her.

Turns out, she had more stirring in her head than I could possibly ever help her with. She was sexually molested by her grandfather from the age of 5-12. At 12 she said something and the grandparents denied it and moved away. Now, she told me all about this in the beginning of our relationship and she said that she was fine and that it didn't bother her and that she worked out her issues when she was younger. I don't believe she did. She has a lot of anger and frustration towards men. She would always think something was wrong, or there was a problem, just a very negative attitude. When there wasn't a problem and everything was good, she would create one. The Psychologist found some issues still lingering (she hadn't gotten over any of it) and when I asked her how it was going she said she didn't understand why the doctor was focusing on this. I said it might be because there is still some stuff you need to work out with regard to your grandfather and what happened. She is a trained professional so let her go through the steps. 

We were walking through a local food store because I wanted to make her a lobster bake that she liked, and she had the nerve to turn around and look at me, and say ""My ex-bf's were so much more fun in here than you are. You are boring."" Then we got outside and I accidentally cut in front of this big lady who gave me a dirty look in the ice cream line. I said excuse me and got our ice cream. While we were eating it, the black lady was waddling over and I said to her, ""please don't say anything, it's no big deal, just stay quiet."" I know her temper and anger and didn't want to fight anyone. Especially not this lady 4 times my size. She turns to me and yells ""don't tell me to be quiet, don't tell me what to do. You're not my father"" and then she proceeded to smash me in the face with the ice cream on the cone.  There are a lot of little stories like this that I could type out but I am sure you get the idea. This would be as long as war and peace novel if I did.

I stayed cool. We got home I made dinner for her entire family. I occasionally made dinner for them as a way to say thank you. I would buy groceries too. She used to say ""you only spend time with my family, you never spend time with me, we never see each other."" Now, I was coming home from work back to my place to change and feed the cat, to drive to her house, to spend time with her, slept over, woke up early the next day to drive back to my place, to feed the cat and get ready and go to work. Nearly EVERYDAY. And she had the nerve to get upset at me when I wanted to go spend a few hours on the weekend playing frisbee with my friends in the backyard or at a sport field nearby.

It just got really painful and overly dramatic. She would just start something or have this overly negative attitude about everything. ""let's go for a walk to the ice cream shop."" She would be miserable the entire time there. ""Would you like to go canoeing with my family on the river near their house. They are having a BBQ after."" ""Not if your brother is coming."" She didn't like hanging out with my brother, she spoke badly about her ""friends."" She is very sensitive and he isn't so much as he is a guy. He wouldn't do anything and it would bother her, so like I said before she would start something. As we were driving together, she said in the back of the car to them, that they need to save up and and be ready to spend at least $5,000 towards the wedding. I was so embarrassed.

So these issues kept mounting. She kept getting deeper and deeper into the depression. Nothing made her happy. She said she felt like she wasn't even getting married because I didn't want to plan anything right away and wanted to take our time with the plans. She wanted to get married in May or June of next year. I sat her down and suggested that we both work on getting her school situation settled, get her job placement out of the way and established and wait to get married and make plans until then. She threw me out of the house on a Tuesday and wouldn't speak to me for three days. She told me in her usual fashion of angry text messages that I am a terrible fiance, I am an embarrassment to her and her family, that I don't love her and that I don't care. I didn't think my suggestion to wait a bit was harsh. I stood my ground and said that it was a suggestion to get ourselves together on stable ground before we went through with planning a wedding because that was stressful enough. So she was upset the remainder of the weekend, and then everything was fine and she was in a good mood. No idea. She was like Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde and would flip on a dime. It made it very difficult to talk to her because I never knew how she would react.

She said she didn't like going to see the shrink because it was a scary place to go and that she would hear dead people, former patients, in her head yelling at her to let her out of the hospital. I suggested that maybe the psychologist she was seeing wasn't working for her and that I know of a psych that I saw earlier on in my life to deal with family issues with my mom that she could go to and I would pay for it with my insurance. She agreed at first to go. I went to the first appointment because my doctor wanted to learn the background of the situation. We never got to go together because it turned into me going for her, to me going because of her.

On her birthday I was running late to work in the morning. When I called her in the morning to wish her happy birthday on my way to the office from the train, I said happy birthday, hope you have a great day, I will call you later with a train time to take into the city for dinner. She said thanks, but three of my friends called me already and you obviously don't care about or love me as much as they do. This was really the last straw.

Every time I would leave to go somewhere it was like I was leaving forever. ""Why do you have to go,"" she would say. I went to Vermont for the weekend with my friend, hiking, and I would call her to check up and say hello, and she would just be sad and miserable, and text me back blah things. So this one day I went to work on a Saturday doing a catering event and she was sad when I was leaving. ""Why do you have to go, can't someone else do it for you.""

So I ended it when I got back from the work event a week prior to our engagement party. It wouldn't have felt right to go through with the party. The night before she said to me as we were leaving the car walking to her house, that I am going to act like a fiance at the party and that I am going to act like I love her and that I will be happy and do all those things a fiance is to do.

Our mutual friend who is a girl helped her through the rough time. The three of us were all friends together from the beginning. My ex-fiance never wanted me to hang out with this friend alone because she was extremely insecure with herself thought we would hook up and I would cheat on her. The friend reached out to me after to meet up and get my side of the story. I didn't tell her much of anything and she said she can understand where I am coming from because she has known both of us so long both together and separately of each other.

One night a few weeks later, the friend attended a party which I was at. She told my ex-fiance that she saw me and that the friend wanted to be honest with her and that she didn't want the ex-fiance to find out on her own. some back and forth went on between them, the friend stood up for herself and said how the ex always plays the victim, she never accepts responsibility for her actions, etc. The Ex threw the friend out her life, wrote me an email and said that she is no longer friends with her. I will send them to you so you can see what I am talking about with the Jekyll Hyde dynamic. The first one was at 930 in the morning which she wrote with her Therapist. The second one came later in the day with a very angry hateful message to me because she thinks I have nothing better to do than to write back to her emails. She now has let the only friend of hers go. She has no friends at all.

So that is that. Would like to know what you think if anything. It is a lot to deal with. I miss her everyday, not the kookiness, but we did have some great times together. There is stuff that I left out unintentionally, but you get the idea. Otherwise it would go on forever.

1r1rlv,3,2013-11-20,I've found my love.,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1r1rlv/ive_found_my_love/,"I've always loved cooking. My dad is a Louisiana native and my mom, old-school Italian. I've been cooking at home since I was six years old, and I've always loved reading about and studying anything relating to food.


About  5 months ago, after going through different jobs and schooling for careers that I was interested in, I got a stage at a restaurant in Las Vegas, and went in with absolutely no restaurant experience (aside from the odd fast food job). The executive chef and sous liked my commitment and passion, and asked me to hire on as a prep cook. However, the owner was under the impression that I was an intern, and did not want to pay me until I was good enough to work on the line.


I decided to stick to it, working two jobs and giving as much time to the restaurant as possible, and a couple of weeks later they compromised and gave me a few hours a week paid to help me out. Two months after working doubles every day and quitting my other job to free up my schedule, they asked me to come to the line and learn as many dishes on the salad/sauteé station as possible. The next week I was scheduled as a line cook for the entire schedule.


I tried to keep up, banging out as many tickets as possible while still making them look as perfect as I was capable, and after a while it all started to flow. My exec. came to me and told me that since I was useful to him, I would be paid accordingly, the same as the other line cooks were. And I was ecstatic. But after a while of working the line, and soaking up everything I could, the stress started to get to me. My ""yes chef""s were more short as the newly-opened restaurant got busier and busier.


One day, my sous asked me to stay late and help with prep as we had a particularly slammed day and our walk-in went down on us. I stayed with no hesistation, and was then asked to cover the line while one of our chefs went to run an errand, but but my exec. threw me off the clock and told me to go home. Being more cocky than I should have, and used to working off the clock, I told him I was going back to cover the line, but he got pissed and threw me out of the restaurant. 


The next week I was scheduled one day, and was extremely worried about still having a job after that, so the one shift I was scheduled, I came in, kept my head down, and did exactly what I was told. The exec. was a little short, but appreciated that I came back with a professional attitude and workedy ass off. The next week, my hours were back, worked a few doubles on prep, and I felt a lot better. I apologized to the chef, and he said he was glad to have me back, that I just needed to do as told by him, and just kept chuggin away. This week, my hours are back to normal, I'm doing better than ever, and I'm still scribbling away in my notebook and learning as much as possible.


After experiencing all the stress, the heat, the insane hours, and crap that our kitchen deals with, I can say without hesitation that I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Both my friends and family say that I seem happier than ever, and I agree. This is what I love."
1r1mmz,1,2013-11-20,Me [23 M] with my world-class deadpan social radar. Attn: ladies - help a clueless young male.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r1mmz/me_23_m_with_my_worldclass_deadpan_social_radar/,"**tl;dr**: Ladies (or gentlemen if you have experience) - How do you advance a relationship to another level(whether it be physically, or emotionally)?  And how would you go about communicating this to your subject of interest?

Okay ladies.  I'm a 23 year old college grad, and as of today I have come to the realization that my knowledge when it comes to understanding you amazing people - or more likely social cues - is 0.  I am literally, a clueless deadpan mixed with an even stronger inability to differentiate between female friends and ones with other intentions.  I will provide some examples to illustrate my, hopefully what turns out to be salvageable inexperience rather than a complete inability to understand my role as a male.  I'm going to try to give just enough detail for you to understand my situation.

#1: I knew a girl for about 3 months that I had totally fallen for. I spent about 4-5 hours each day with this girl.  

I eventually got her to agree to let me eat dinner at her dorm. She dressed up. Cooked. Ate dinner. Watched a movie. And helped me get my work done.  It was around midnight, we just finished our last assignment.  I decided to sit down on her couch and watch some TV.  She sat down next to me, grabbed the remote, and shut down the TV.  I thought this was rude and unusual. She then immediately asked, ""So.....what do you want to do now?"" in what seemed to be an unusual voice with odd tonal inflections.  Considering she just shut off the TV, which to me at the time, seemed rude, and likely meant she wanted me out, I responded, ""I'm really tired, I guess i'll go home now...""  I didn't think about this twice.  I took her question literally.

I didn't realize what just happened, or what I just did, until...say.... 5 months later. I am literally, deadbeat retarded and was unaware that that line has secondary connotations apart from the literal. I don't think she could've been anymore obvious, but that's easier to say now that I know the stereotypical context of that line....

#2: One of my best friends is a girl.  Her best friend (they're practically buttbuddies) is also a good friend of mine.  I have known both of them since HS.  Girl A I visit whenever I get the chance to, mostly on vacations due to where she studies.  I love talking to her, having been friends for many years.  

She asked me to prom back in HS, and recently I had asked her if she had enough time to see me twice during my short trip to her city.  She agreed, with at the time seemed too enthusiastically, but due to how we usually interact, this seemed only a slight bit unusual. Imagine two little girls gossiping. That's us. Anyhow, I then asked if she had time for drinks that week as well - she agreed. 

When I finally met up, I revealed I had feelings for Girl B, her best friend.  Her face seemed more than shocked, and for once in my life she seemed so absolutely serious it made me uncomfortable [because that's so away from how we usually interact].  She asked me to repeat it multiple times.  The whole dinner after that felt like a bad dream.  She became very distant, and I don't feel like that divulging that information would be so bad if we were on the same page.  I could be wrong, but we didn't go for drinks afterwards, or meet up for the rest of my stay.  She put out excuses about having other priorities/illness/whathaveyou. I also later found out it is apparently common social etiquette for a male to ""pick"" where the ""date"" is.  Which reminds me - if you've read this much, thank you. But if you could please define what constitutes ""date"" that'd be a great help.  I feel as if my obliviousness has impacted our friendship(?) somehow and it may not be the same.  I treasure her, and I don't want to mess up like that again with anyone else.

#3 When I was an intern last summer, I met this one girl that I got along fabulously with.  We went out to the club scene one night and she refused to dance with anybody except me.  I kept refusing, because I was still moderately sober and wanted to remain professional.  I still sort of believe she was being kind?

Regardless, a few drinks later libido and lack of sobriety got the better of me, and I agreed.  She kept grabbing my hand and placing it on areas too close for comfort.  I mentally forced the assumption in my mind, that she was just being friendly and that everything was a function of alcohol, and that anything here meant nothing of how a girl actually perceives you. 

But am I generally wrong, or only just wrong for this case?  I mean, that's like getting a lady reallllly buzzed on beer goggles to intercourse, and then assuming that in the morning that her actions the other night were indicative of her true perception of the male, and not a function of intoxication.

So ladies, or gentlemen if you have any productive input:  What are the general social cues or hints that there are feelings involved?  What actions are generally recognized as passing the boundary of friendship, or what lines are typically spoken with secondary connotations in a dating setting?  What if in example 3 we had just gone to the movies? Friends do that all the time. Any tips?  Thanks.

I want to say thank you. I just finished my labour and delivery rotation as an RN student, and it was the most eye opening and beautiful thing that I think I've ever done. It has completely solidified my intentions to do my preceptorship (nursing internship) in L&amp;D, and *fingers crossed* make my way to becoming an OB/GYN nurse practitioner.

I have crept here at /r/babybumps because I love the stories that come along with the patients I see in hospital. Sure, a woman can come in at 3cm with ruptured membranes and be GBS-, but what was her pregnancy like? What are her plans for her baby? I don't get to know that while she's labouring. I got to see a glimpse of that here, so thank you for letting me get a glimpse of your lives. And thank you for sometimes letting me reply, even though I know that as someone who has never been pregnant, I don't really belong.

And from all of the nursing students: thank you for letting us learn. I fiddled with the doppler and it took me twice as long to find a heartrate, and I might have pushed a little too hard when I was palpating that first contraction. But you let me learn and you were compassionate even in the middle of a contraction, and I am eternally grateful for that. Even though I am a student, you trusted the knowledge I imparted to you about why you couldn't eat at this point, and why it was okay that baby's heartrate was variable. It meant the world to me that you had faith in my knowledge. It also made me feel competent that you asked me questions, so thank you. 

Thank you for letting me be present as you brought new life into this world. I'm sorry that I cried when you cried. You let me hold your new baby girl, and even though I had never held a newborn before, you trusted me. I cannot express my gratitude for the trust you imparted to me for allowing me to take care of your beautiful miracle; for letting me listen to her heart and her lungs. For letting me swaddle her. Thank you.

Moms, moms to be, and future moms: thank you for trusting me with your health and the health of your baby. I do not and will never take this responsibility lightly.

THANK YOU!!"

1r17qf,2,2013-11-19,my introduction,thebuddhit,Buddhism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1r17qf/my_introduction/,"This account is admittedly my /r/buddhism account.  I have a main account, and my reason for keeping the two separate are privacy reasons from my main account.  

I believe that people should be able to practice the religion of their choice freely and openly if they choose, and privately if they choose.  I'm a private individual, which is going to be ironic given the amount of information I'm about ready to spill.

I have post traumatic stress disorder from being raped when I was six years old.  How does this relate?

Well, regulating my emotions has been difficult as I posted in my other thread.  It has shaped my large world-view.  

I have trouble letting go that the event happened to me.  I am often filled with shame, guilt, anger, and other emotions.  Most of the time, I know I have nothing to be ashamed or guilty of.  The amount of anger over certain events is unrealistic and stems from abuse.  I'm aware of this, and yet it still boils up inside me.  I dislike it, and am seeking to change it.

My emotions swirl inside my head and are difficult to nail down.  I am in therapy and I am on anti-depressant medications.  I am in college and have an internship coming up shortly, and I have a job.  I run.  I walk a lot.

Unfortunately, I used to drink a lot to repress emotions (I started drinking at a very young age), and it used to be a very large constant in my life.  I know drinking is against the precepts of Buddhism, and because of this and other health related reasons I have cut back a lot, and can't even remember the last time week wise that I've had a drink (I monitor it because alcoholism runs in my family), but do know the last time I drank I had 2 drinks with a close friend.  

I would not consider myself Buddhist necessarily - I have Taoist influences, as well - but am thinking of taking Buddhism along more seriously, and know that if I am to do this I know that the drinking must stop altogether, or continue along the cut down path (I forget which it is I have heard various reports in various places).

I have a lot of things in my life that are up in the air right now (my job schedule, my internship schedule) and I am the kind of individual who is a very anxious person by nature and the uncertainty produces a lot of anxiety.

I am unloading all of this here because I am aware of impermanence.  

I am aware these situations will change.  

I am aware that if I choose to be happy I can let that emotion into my mind and soul and heart.  I try to let go.  I try to have peace in the current moment.  I remind myself that each breath in and each breath out is new life, and is new death.

I remind myself to ""Smile, breathe, and go slowly"".

I attempt to radiate positive feelings out toward even individuals who I dislike a great deal.  I wish them well.

Despite all these things I often feel very pessimistic inside.  It is an attitude change that is taking a long time.  I am looking to be more positive in general.

I am curious about meditations that may help me along this path.  

If you have made it this far I truly want to thank you for your reading, your time, and I want to make clear that the facts of what happened to me when I was a child are just that - facts.  I am not looking for sympathy.  I am just looking for a path through the darkness.

1r0yvf,1,2013-11-19,how to maintain a right balance in a relationship.,rosterag,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1r0yvf/how_to_maintain_a_right_balance_in_a_relationship/,"Hey guys I am just trying to understand long term relationships. I know a lot of people don't like these words but since so many people have a general idea of what they mean we are going to use them. Alpha/Beta

If you have ever looked into the redpill (I have out of curiosity) you'll talk about usual case. Woman settles for Beta husband, then isn't fully committed to him uses him for emotional support than sleeps with the Alpha bro on the side. We have all heard this story, and I think it does reaffirm what a lot of us believe which makes redpill values sink in.

However, that being said, I think we have also seen this too, woman is in a relationship. Guy that compliments her, does cutesy things, ""beta behavior"" wins her heart. Now I have seen this happen, shit has happened to me. I ended up losing my girlfriend to some really skinny Asian guy from an internship. And guess what he was 100% beta. Yet the redpill never mentions this? Even though we see ""beta"" behavior end up winning the girl from the Alpha guy.


That being said, how the hell do you maintain a girl's attraction long term. Male attraction is definitely more simple than that of woman's. If a man is satisfied in a relationship, than even if he does cheat he will still hold his wife to higher regard. And men tend to not develop emotions for their affair partners as women usually do.

Men do cheat too, (actually in nigher rates) but men are more opportunistic and often tend to cheat ""down."" Men usually cheat for variety/opportunity as opposed to women that usually ""trade up.""

So as a guy what do you do? Please don't just tell me 100% honesty and communication, if you have ever been in a relationship with a girl you know they love to play games. Even married women ""test"" their husbands whether they do it subconsciously or not. If you have never been in a relationship before and only watch Dr.Phil / read /r/relationships please don't comment thank you. "
1r0y1u,61,2013-11-19,"The Dutch take advantage of alcoholics by paying them way less than minimum wage in beer. /r/worldnews creams it's pants over ""Dutch pragmatism.""",Maharbal217,circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1r0y1u/the_dutch_take_advantage_of_alcoholics_by_paying/,"http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1qz2fq/amsterdam_pays_alcoholics_in_beer_to_clean/

If you're not inclined to read the article the city of Amsterdam is using alcoholics to clean its streets by paying them in beer and giving them a hot meal. More specifically:

&gt; For a day's work, the men receive 10 euros (around $13), a half-packet of rolling tobacco and, most importantly, five cans of beer: two to start the day, two at lunch and one for after work.

So for a days work the government pays them probably the equivalent of $25 dollars (and that's a pretty generous estimate). Of course they do this willingly, but as a participant in the program gladly states:

&gt; if they didn't give us beers then we wouldn't come

So to summarize the government is using an addiction as leverage over people in order to get them to work long hours, paying them with a mix of money and goods. Goods which, I might add, fuel the addiction that put them in this position in the first place.

Seeing as how people on this site bitch about internships paying them in college credit and bolstering future resumes you would expect Redditors to be up in arms, but you'd be wrong.

&gt; It's like someone sat down and thought about an issue in real terms of what everyone wants, and the best way to achieve that without throwing people in a jail.
It's like...a fucking government.

Yep, the best way to avoid public intoxication and damage to public property due to alcohol is in fact *give people alcohol*. Oh, and they can work all day, get off around 4, and have the rest of the night to get shitfaced and cause problems.

&gt; It's just basic economics actually! People respond to incentives. Literally in the 10 principles of economics.

Exactly, it's basic economics! People are willing to work for incentives, especially people who are chemically dependent on a substance and cannot normally function without it. This is why drug addicted prostitutes are some of the hardest workers around! Let me tell you, criminal syndicates and pimps truly understand economics! Obviously local governments should look to them for economic advice!

&gt; Were they drinking before? Yes
Are they drinking now? Yes

&gt; Are they being paid and eating well before? No

&gt; Are they now? Yes.

&gt; Were they sedentary and disruptive before? Yes.

&gt; Are they now? No.

&gt; I don't think exploit is a proper word. Everyone is better off than they were.

I think it's important to note that **nowhere** in the article is it shown that these programs have either decreased alcohol consumption: only one participant stated that he didn't ""necessarily want to drink after a days work."" Seeing as how these people are willing to work for less than $30 a day while being paid in booze I'm going to assume that 5 beers over the course of 6 hours probably isn't going to do it for them, you have to be pretty far from a ""functioning alcoholic"" to accept such payment for your time. But hey, what good is logic and reason if I can ride Amsterdam's dick a little longer? In fact, another participant argued that:

&gt;  ""Of course we drink in a more structured way, but I don't think that we drink less,"" he said.

&gt; ""When we leave here, we go to the supermarket and transform the 10 euros we earned into beers....""
And when the group isn't working, the old habits return.
""When the supermarket opens at 8:00 am, we're the first there so we can get some drinks,"" he said.

But back to the comments.

&gt; I like it. Could you imagine what we could get the crack heads to do? This is brilliant.

We could probably get them to engage in depraved and unwanted sexual acts, compromise the health and safety of their children and families, and get them to commit violent acts. Remember guys, incentives!

&gt; Yea.... it is pragmatic.
Just like those piss-troughs I saw int eh street for dudes to piss in at night.
I mean, it seems crude at first - then you realize that everywhere else on earth, people jsut get drunked up and piss in the street - so it makes perfect sense to provide a little outdoor nook for a quick piss with better drainage into the canal.

Yep, enabling addicts and building piss-troughs are pretty much the same thing. No moral difference there. Also enjoy the delicious ""in AmeriKKKa all pedophiles are just people peeing in the streets"" jerk that ensues in the comments.

&gt; Makes sense to me - and I guess that it is the same pragmatism that is leading to prisons closing through lack of prisoners.

Well while were here we might as well link two totally unrelated phenomena and credit it to pragmatism. Boy these people sure understand logic and evidence don't they?

Finally we have someone who disagrees:

&gt; Do you guys seriously support this idea? ""Hm, we have this group of addicts, how about we exploit their weaknesses by feeding their addiction instead of helping them AND use their addiction to our advantage?""
If this was happening in Detroit with crackheads people would be disgusted.

The responding comments include:

&gt; To be fair, there probably have been attemps in the past to get these people back on track but they have all failed obviously.

Nowhere in the article is this stated or implied, this is just pure conjecture.

&gt; This is not feeding an addiction, it's harm reduction.

Yep, giving alcoholics alcohol is not feeding an addiction. What, are you some kind of idiot?

&gt; They are paying in beer just to make them accept the job.

Because otherwise they wouldn't. After all who would work 5 hours a day for less than $20 in usable cash.

And it just goes on and on. You can argue that this is ""better than nothing,"" and that they're ""contributing something useful to society."" Yet is it really morally correct for a government to take advantage of someone who is suffering from severe substance dependence by fueling their addictions? It seems much more like the workhouses of Victorian Britain than a progressive social program."
1r6an3,2,2013-11-21,[20/m]It's been two years since I have been with my boyfriend[21/m] and I feel our sex life is lacking. I need help...,monkeyx23,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r6an3/20mits_been_two_years_since_i_have_been_with_my/,"Iv'e been with my boyfriend for about two years now. My problem is I feel like he is never horny anymore. When we started going out we would have sex all the time but now its maybe once a week but I feel like he is never into it... I feel like really passionate moments are rare and it only happens when I let him know we haven't done anything for a while... I used to be able to touch him and he would get into the mood immediately, but now he just doesn't want me to. He doesn't actually say stop but I can see it in his face. I understand sex isn't everything but it's really important to me. Every now and then I ask whats wrong but he just says nothing or not in the mood. For a bit more context we are both in college, he is currently on a small break. We live about 30 min from each other and the only viable place to do anything is in my apartment. I have a roommate but that's usually a non issue. So what should I do? How should I talk to him about this? Also another small issue. I am leaving for an internship for 8 months and will be 2 hours away. "
1r681k,10,2013-11-21,I have my yearly review tomorrow. Can you read through and give some Constructive Criticism?,[deleted],computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1r681k/i_have_my_yearly_review_tomorrow_can_you_read/,"First, some background: I've been at my place of employment as an IT Technician for 2 years and some change. the requirements for the job were originally a 4 year degree, A+ cert (or working on them) and experience. I was in the process of working on my A+ and had my degree and an internship when I interviewed. I got the job and they told me I would be able to work up the ladder, with positions created for me as my abilities fit their needs. Since being employed I've gotten my A+, Network+ and am working on MSCA SQL 2012. There was another guy who got hired the same time I did, he's got a two-year degree, A+ and MCP Windows 7. Since being here I've gotten about a dollar raise, sitting at ~$15 an hour. I was asked to fill out a self appraisal and goal setting form to take with me to the review. Here's what I've got so far.


What do you feel are your strengths:

Finding long lasting solutions (batch files), being able to take on extra workloads (handled the Help Desk alone for a week on multiple occasions), adapting to change/sudden issues with a level head. I've been able to learn, write and administrate the needed SQL Reports within a timely fashion. Overcoming roadblocks along the way.

What areas do you feel are opportunities for you to improve? How would you improve in those areas?

If I don’t have things written down, I get sidetracked. This is remedied by writing them in a notebook, using the ticketing system and tasks in Outlook. I won’t be able to get everything, but I feel I’m improving. On some of the SQL reports, I get stuck on some of the language requirements. Knowing SQL and Reporting services better will help me. I'm in the midst of learning it better as I go.


Do you believe there are areas you are underutilized? Please be specific.

I feel that due to my age[I'm 24 and youngest. my boss is 60 and the next higher up is in his 40s] and not having worked here as long, my opinions and levels of responsibility are being limited. I do not feel I am being utilized to my potential and that I have outgrown my current position of technician. Many of the tasks I’m performing would be better suited for an intern (like we had this summer). 


Do you feel there are areas you feel over-extended? If so, what are they?

With the goal of getting all of the PCs upgraded to Win7, study and writing time for SQL has dropped significantly. 
My knowledge of the workings of many of the programs I am supposed to support is quite small. Any time someone calls in with a problem related to $AppSuite1 or $AppSuite2 I can only help them to a marginal level and have to defer them to 2nd in charge guy. If he isn't here I can not help them, leaving them unable to use that program until he returns.


Areas you feel additional training and development would be beneficial to your job performance?

Freeing up time to dedicate to SQL writing and learning. Being able to branch out to help cover other important areas like $SecuritySoftware could be beneficial to the company as well.

I've already had one internship, but I was only able to get it because I knew the person who had it last. It was also an hour and a half drive one way, and most students in the program weren't willing to drive such a long commute. 

I'm looking for other ways to find I/O relevant work besides the common and well-known sources (e.g., the SIOP website). There are a few positions sent to us by our program manager, but because everyone in the program knows about it (including the MS students who will work for peanuts) so it's very competitive.

Does anyone have any suggestions for finding work in the I/O field?  For example, do you have any suggestions for professional organizations I can join that can help me network and find work? I've looked into professional organizations in my area. I'm more ""Industrial"" focused, with a great interest in designing assessment centers. I would like to find a professional organization geared more towards that."

1r5lev,7,2013-11-21,I [F21] am moving away from my family and boyfriend [M21] and am seeking general coping advice.,wdwthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r5lev/i_f21_am_moving_away_from_my_family_and_boyfriend/,"Hey r/relationships. I'm not one to make posts like this, but I need some people to talk to. 


So here's the deal. I go to school in the midwest and am a 4th year undergrad. I'm finishing school in December but coming back to walk in June. I've been offered my dream internship with my dream company in Florida (maybe my throwaway username can give you a hint). This is probably one of the most exciting things to happen to me, but I'm having some serious issues. 

First of all, I didn't go away for college. I go to school about 20 minutes away from my house. I've always had the idea instilled in me that family is most important and it's important to be close to them. I love my parents and sister and never even wanted to move away, so getting into my top school in my hometown was pretty great. I'm really worried about not having my family, my support system, close to me. They've always been there for me when I have rough times at school or with my boyfriend, and no I won't have them near me. 


Next, I have only been in 2 long relationships in my life. I definitely get too emotional and attached and am not one to like being single and want to date or sleep with many people or things like that. Attachment and love are really important to me and I like being in a relationship and caring for someone and being cared for as well. 

My current boyfriend and I started dating during February of my first year of school, so we've been together almost 3 years. Things have not been easy, we're pretty incompatible (especially when considering our long term goals), but we have grown so much together and have gotten along incredibly well, especially recently. I love him so much (what I often feel is too much, compared to how I feel he feels about me). One problem of mine is that I become entirely too dependent on my SO when I'm in a relationship. I've never really gotten along with/enjoyed hanging out with girls that much, so I don't have many friends to talk to about this, which makes everything even harder. 

My bf and I talked about this a few nights ago and decided mutually that once I leave, we should end things. Our long term plans aren't compatible and we want different things. I'll be in Florida and he wants to go to grad school in California. Besides that, he told me that he never pictured himself entering grad school with a girlfriend anyway. So I guess I was never part of his long-term picture (which absolutely sucks to hear when you love someone so much), even though he keeps telling me he still loves me very much and that this will be very difficult for him too.

I guess I just don't really know how to cope. Not only will I be away from my family for the first time, starting a job in a brand new city, I'll be losing my best friend and the person I love most. I always sort of knew this would happen, but now that it is, I am having a lot of trouble. I guess I've always had this fantasy that we'd end up happily ever after despite our differences. Honestly, he's difficult to deal with sometimes and I've handled him well. Part of me is worried that he'll be alone and won't end up happy because I don't think many girls will have as much patience with him as I have. 

I just can't imagine not texting him good morning or talking to him about my day. I don't know who I'll be able to talk to or who will be there to make me feel loved. 

Anyway, I don't really know what sort of help or advice I'm actually looking for, I just want someone to help me process this or let me talk at them. 

P.S. One positive thing is that I'll be bringing my dog with me to Florida, so I won't be completely alone. If I didn't have her, I'm pretty sure I'd go crazy. 

----

TL;DR: Moving away from family for first time and also mutually breaking up with boyfriend. Worried about feeling alone and sad and just need general advice. "

Is the 520 going to preform any differently?  Does the camera pick up typed text in a reasonable fashion?  Any one with a 520 or 521 test this for me and report your results?  

If I can buy one for $50-$100 I may just save us a ton of work.

Switch banks to be able to use any cash machine - on the TO DO list. Will also suggest that to friends who pay for their account monthly, but don't really need the paid parks.

TL;DR as long as I have an UK account with a debit card and use it for expenses and direct debits, would it make a difference on my credit score whether the type of account I have is of one type or another (unpaid, versus monthly fee account)? 


Is it possible to have an account that has no influence whatsoever on my credit score? According to someone that seemed driven to make some commission on me, my current account has absolutely no influence on my credit score whatever I do with it, which I kindly beg to differ, as it would mean I could get the latest iPad on a contract from a mobile network and not pay, without getting any consequences. Thank you in advance for any responses (I find the credit score information I can find is so vague compared to other topics online, you'd think it's a huge taboo in our society...)
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extended story about how I got to think about this, with a light flavour of need to vent out, read at your own peril:


I am a final year student, who has been using for the whole uni period an account that comes with a debit card and with no monthly charge for keeping the account open. My bank also has multiple types of accounts that also have debit cards that incur a monthly fee; the cheapest costs 10£/month and gives you the possibility of taking cash out of any brand of cash machine (as opposed to only my bank's for the no monthly charge account) and have a ""free"" phone insurance. I chose the frugal account version, as I prefer more food to the ability of getting cash from every corner and having an uninsured phone constitutes a delightful form of adrenaline in my assignment/work packed life.


Yesterday, I want to the bank to change form my 0.2% interest/year  savings account to a ISA saving account with 0.5% tax free interest/year after reading some leaflets. At a bank, a lady was assigned to me to walk me through the change. All my previous experiences with the bank were positive up to date.


During the meeting, the lady started asking me questions which in the beginning seemed random small talk, but after that they turned rather intrusive, like where will me graduate position be and making comments about the wage I had at my previous internship (as they were visible on the system). Then, after asking whether I have home insurance (which I have), she was really pushy with showing me a quote from the insurance the bank offered, based on my conditions. She was putting in information that was not exactly what I was telling here (like that I was living on my own, which I told here it's not true and that giving that false information will show a cheaper quote, but consider fraud; she did not want to change it, as she was telling me that living with my SO is the same as living on my own). In the end, the quote ended up more expensive than mine, with all the false information, but she kept telling me that, even if the policy was absolutely unsuitable for my possessions (like only covering on third of the cost of my PC, none of my glasses and but a lot of home content value - which I don't need). I kept insisting that a second insurance that doesn't even cover my PC, but covers the expensive clothes I don't have is not something I will buy.


After I kept refusing, she started telling me how I need the account with a monthly charge, as it offers a lot of benefits, like phone insurance (own 2.5 year phone, and in case that it breaks, I have some ancients smartphones laying around), access to all cash machines (I don't really use a lot of cash, except for the bus, which I used 4 ties in the last 2 months) and so on. She was visibly unhappy. She asked intrusive questions. Then, she dropped the bomb: according to her, my account made absolutely no contribution to my credit score, which should be zero after all these years of paying direct debits on time. I asked for a reference to support what she was saying. She said the bank did not print this kind of stuff.  At this moment, just wanting to get my new account and get out of there, I said that this matter really worried me and that I will think about it, but for the day I only want my new account. She looked not necessarily happy, but did it. The thing is, I can't really seem to understand what kind of link exists between the type of account you have, the type of DEBIT card you have and the effects on your credit score, having a given set of transactions and direct debits paid on time. I would really appreciate if somebody could shed some light on the matter for the naive me, and thank you in advance."
1r4otu,74,2013-11-21,"My girlfriend [24 F] of 6 years, Skyped me [25 M] from her new internship in Geneva to end things.",PaleBlueThought,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r4otu/my_girlfriend_24_f_of_6_years_skyped_me_25_m_from/,"On Sunday, the girl that I saw myself sharing my life with Skyped me from Geneva (where she's on a 6-month internship, post-graduation) to end things. This was a month after leaving the west coast - I couldn't follow her, since I'm still in school (two years behind her since I switched into Engineering). 

Everything was fine before she left, and even a few weeks in. We originally said that after I graduated we would go off around the world together. 

Now, the thing is that she's a TCK (if anyone identifies with that, I could really use your advice). She's been moving around since she was a baby, every 3-4 years to a different country. University was the longest she's ever been in one place. She was getting ""the itch"" to get out again, and so when her friend in Geneva mentioned she could get her an internship there, she up and left. I don't blame her for leaving - it was an amazing opportunity - but I kind of expected what we had to have a bit more weight. To be clear, I didn't expect her to stay, but I thought that we would find a way to make it work. I could have done internships abroad, and worked anywhere in the world after school.


Her rationale was that she wasn't happy in the city we went to school - the people here aren't ""like"" her. And now that she's in Geneva, she says she's found herself again. She said that she relied solely on me for her happiness here. She also said that now that she's being exposed to this new world, and doesn't really know where she wants her career to go, she wants some time to grow as an individual and let work/school take her wherever she needs to go.
She kept reiterating how much she loves me, and is sorry for ""being selfish"". She is genuinely upset. I don't believe she's met someone else, or that there were that big of problems with our relationship. We've done long distance before. It sucked, but we got through it (what did people do before Skype??).


So I guess what I'm wondering - and I know it's hard to say since you don't know us - is how I should be reacting. Of course I want her to be happy. But on the other hand, I feel like I was just deftly discarded at the first sign of this exciting vagabond life she's always wanted. I love her, so much. I would literally have done anything for her. She said on that call that she didn't want to make me move away from everything and drag me around the world with her - that it was unfair to me - but I was so ready to follow her wherever.

To be honest, I'm just so confused. This really did come out of nowhere. I knew she wanted to move away from our university city, but so do I once I finish. There is an outside possibility that she could find herself back near the city I'm in after her internship is over. ~~Am I a fool for still wanting her in my life?~~ 

Really, anything you have to say would mean a lot to me.

**EDIT**
Thanks for your responses everyone. The confusion over how to feel was one of the worst parts of this, and you all have really helped me focus on the details that really matter. Again, thank you everyone :)

1r4mxy,1,2013-11-21,Boxed myself into a corner and feel like there is no way out.,Malphael,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1r4mxy/boxed_myself_into_a_corner_and_feel_like_there_is/,"I'm hoping if anything that posting here will be helpful to get some things off of my back that's I've been carrying around with me.

I've suffered from depression on and off for about 10 years or so. I tend to go in cycles where I will have a few years where I am doing well and then years where I am miserably depressed. I am currently in what has been an almost 2 year depression and I feel like I've hit one of the deepest moments I can remember in a long time. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for about a month and am on 40mg of Prozac.

Right now I'm under just an incredible amount of stress. I'm currently trying to earn a masters degree in law and coming up on the finals in a few weeks and there is just no possible way I can pass my classes. I am over a month behind in all of my classes due to not having to the energy to keep up with the material. My days have been marked by me going to class, sitting in class in a dead malaise praying I don't get called on, coming home, and then spending most of my day lying in bed. I have no clue what to do and am terrified of asking for help because I respect my teachers and I feel like I've failed them all miserably.

I'm also trying to figure out how to try and pass the bar exam and it's been a huge problem for me. I've postponed it because of my depression and I've taken it once and failed. It's so difficult for me to focus on the material for the 8-10 hours a day that you need to and when I finally got into the exam I panicked and it threw me off even worse. I've spent so much money trying to pass this exam and my family has helped me throw so much more at it. I'm set to take it again in Feb and I know the way I am right now I'm not going to be able to pass. If I push it off to July I'm afraid of trying to look for work without having any idea of whether or not I've passed.

There's a part of me that isn't even sure if I want to be a lawyer anymore, or should be a lawyer, or even deserve to be a lawyer. It's been something I've wanted for for years, since practically being a freshman in high school. But I hate everything about the culture. I hate the dog eat dog nature of the profession. I hate the cronyism and nepotism that's rife in the profession. I hate the kind of people who are successful in this field.  At one point, I wanted to do public service work and one internship ended up breaking me. I couldn't handle the suffering of the clients and I felt so guilty about hating myself and my life when my problems were so small in comparison. Which only led to me hating myself more. Now I'm just trying to get a job doing transactional work because at least doing that I won't have the burden of the horrors of social work weighing on me. But even then, I worry that even if I can pass the bar, I won't succeed as a lawyer. I have to accept the fact that I am terrible at managing stress and don't work well under pressure. There's so much responsibility involved and I find myself terrified of the prospect of making a mistake and failing a client.

I feel the weight of my student loan debt hanging above me like the Sword of Damocles. It's so incredibly vast (over 200,000) that I just have no idea how I can possibly begin to tackle it. It felt so small when I first started college, and by the time I began to really understand how much debt I had, it was too late for me to do anything else but continue on? What would I do? Finish halfway through my JD and walk away with 100,000 in debt and nothing to show of it?

I'm living in a new city now and I have no friends and no significant other to rely on for support. I feel alone all the time and it makes trying to deal with my stress all the worse. I can't even stand to go on Facebook anymore because seeing my peers all happy and successful in their new careers just reminds me what a failure I am. I'm afraid to let people into my life because I don't feel that I can be a good friend to people the way I am now. It's also hard for me to socialize because I'm absolutely terrified of crowds and so I hate being in clubs and bars and parties and concerts. I feel smothered with so many people around me and I can't breath.

I hate myself because I know that all my suffering is wrought by inability to deal with my problems. I've thought about killing myself before but I'm too afraid to go through with it. I guess that's a blessing. At the same time however, while I won't take my own life, I have no problems with letting myself rot. I've just absolutely stopped taking care of myself in any way and it's had drastic effects on my health. I let my acid reflex go untreated and it has ruined my teeth and I've had to have several pulled and replaced with a partial. I've gained a significant amount of weight in the past year. I stopped exercising entirely and have grown lethargic. My sleep schedule is a total mess. Sometimes I won't get to sleep until about 5 or 6 in the morning (having to wake up at 7). I'll do this for days at a time and then take a 16 hour coma the next day. And when I look at how I've ruined my health, I on feel more despair and it makes it even worse.

I've lost the ability to enjoy anything in life. Colors don't seem bright, food tastes bland, and I feel like I'm just an observer watching some automaton run through a per-programmed routine. I'm just going through the motions and doing my best to hide the fact that I'm struggling so that I don't end up burdening anyone.

I've spent my entire life single and it's left gaping hole in me that I've been desperate to try and fill. I never thought I would be in this position at my age. All of my friends are getting married, and having kids. I've never been on a third date. I don't want to be alone anymore. And yet, I hate myself for feeling this way too because it's so selfish. How can I ask or expect someone to love me when I don't even love me? I couldn't ask someone to be in a relationship with me just because it would make me feel better. 

I'm stuck in this pit of darkness and I'm so far down that I can't even see the light anymore. What's worse is that I dug this pit with my own two hands. I don't know how to climb out or where to begin. And honestly there is a part of me that is afraid to climb out. Afraid because I know that the climb is going to be tough. Afraid because I know that if I fall again, it's going to be a long one and the landing will hurt. Afraid because I've been down here for so long that the pit seems more familiar to me than what my life was like before. That last one scares me the most: that a part of me wants to be depressed because depression is all I know.

It's 4 in the morning, and it doesn't look like today will be one of the days of sleep. I'm just so tired. Of everything. I thought about posting this to a throwaway because much of it is very personable, but a part of me is sick of hiding who I am from the world and myself."
1r4j75,6,2013-11-21,Trouble finding work after culinary school,SativaCyborg89,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1r4j75/trouble_finding_work_after_culinary_school/,"My girlfriend graduated culinary school a couple months ago, completed a 3 month internship at a fine dining establishment and gained much experience. Now she can't find work at all. This isn't your typical culinary grad chef wannabe either. She has a true passion for food, understands the industry, and has applied only for entry level positions.

Now I've been working in kitchens for a while and seen some terrible culinary students get hired all the time. What I don't understand is why she doesn't even get any calls. She has applied to about 40 different places that are actively hiring prep/ pantry cooks. She has only been called in for one stage, and that was because the chef looked up where she interned. She described the stage to me afterwards and it sounded like she did great. pretty much thought she had the job. Never called her back. She tried calling to see if she could talk to the chef at all (at an apprpriate time people) and never was able to speak to him.

So what gives KC? There are plenty of kitchens in Denver hiring right now but she isn't having any luck. Her resume isn't outstanding as she has only worked 3 months in a real kitchen, but she has extensive culinary event volunteering and great food knowledge. Her chef (well renowned) from her internship even wrote a solid letter of recommendation. We wonder if it has anything to do with gender... it would be interesting to just shorten her name on her resume so it is not gender specific to see if she gets any calls.

Any comments or advice would be appreciated.

1r483n,3,2013-11-20,So I'm putting together a portfolio for college...,NotGarrett,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1r483n/so_im_putting_together_a_portfolio_for_college/,"Ok so a little back info, I'm a junior at a university with dual photography and business majors. Once a year, every student art/photo major is required to submit a portfolio of 10-15 works to present and the professors come together for a couple days and review all the portfolios and provide their opinions on the students' work. High-ranking students receive scholarships, internships, studios, etc. For the last few years, I've had a diverse portfolio that ranks well. I've discussed with the head of the department and he thinks it'd be a good idea to have a really diverse, well-rounded portfolio for my junior year and one that is more focused for my senior year. So the question I'm posing, is what all fields of photography should I try to cover? Typically I'm a sports/portrait shooter so I'm moderately well-versed in those fields if that matters.

TL;DR I need to put together a portfolio of different photographic topics. (sports, commercial work, landscapes, products, etc.) I'm submitting 15 pieces with a different theme for each. Which ones should I focus on?"
1r437q,0,2013-11-20,"Interested in a 0% APR Credit Card, recommendations?",unrefine,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1r437q/interested_in_a_0_apr_credit_card_recommendations/,"Situation:

* I have a little money in the bank: ~$1k.
* I graduate college in December.
* I have signed a job offer starting in June.
* I will have 6 months that I want to work minimally during (either low hours each week or put in heavy hours for a couple months and take the rest off).
* I would like to travel before I start working for the long haul.
* I will probably get ~$700 in graduation gifts (based on what I remember my siblings getting)

So, with the above, I was thinking a decent way to supplement my income until I get my job and a signing bonus would be a 0 APR credit card with a 12-15 month introductory period until they jack it up to like 24%. I have applied for a couple credit cards a couple years back and was denied due to lack of credit and lack of income as a student. I am currently working an internship and have pay stubs incase I need those to prove how much I am making to hopefully qualify for a credit card.

I was looking for recommendations on cards. I don't know if I have a credit score or what it is. I have been paying rent(co-sign with my parents) and utilities (my name) over the past two years. There have been a couple payments I have made to the utilities companies that were a couple days late but I called and they said that it should have no effect on my credit unless it was like a month late(can someone comment on that?).  I think I am  looking for about $2k credit limit on it due to the size of the signing bonus I am getting.

**Also, I understand the risks that I am undertaking with this. I am graduating with a degree in finance** ""What if you don't get the job come June and you have 2k in debt with a incredible interest rate?"" Worst case scenario I will ask my brother to cash it out for me if I somehow don't get this job and I'll pay him off. No interest. Brother Loan. ""Why don't you ask him first, so you don't expose yourself to this risk?"" I don't want to ask him unless I have to."

1r3tf0,3,2013-11-20,"I[21M] am living with my girlfriend[23F] and she has a money/spending problem, what should I do?",frostygaming,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r3tf0/i21m_am_living_with_my_girlfriend23f_and_she_has/,"I am 21 years old and I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now, who is 23.  I moved in with her this past summer for a few reasons:
 

 
  1.It was convenient for me because it cost less than it would to stay at the dorms at school.  For personal reasons those were my two options at the time.
  2.I really care about her and spent so much time with her anyway it wasn't much of a change.
  3.She needed help paying for her rent and could afford it if we both split it.


I knew when moving in that we were both poor college students and because of that it's hard to come up with enough money for everything, car payments, internet, utilities, rent, food.  But I'm starting to realize that she has a real problem with spending money when she has it.  It's like she doesn't realize that in the future she might need the money for other (more important) things.


She had a paid internship when I moved in with her and she was making a lot more money than I was with 2 jobs, it was more than enough to get by on but she would go and spent several hundred dollars on concert tickets and clothes even though she didn't need them.  She also paid off some debt she had from borrowing money from her family which at the time was a LOT of money.  After summer ended she no longer had the internship but was lucky enough to get a job not long after.  It was a decent paying job and she could still get by with the amount of money she was making.  What I didn't realize at the time is that her bank account was in a hole, about a $1000 hole.  All this time I paid for half the rent and utilities and for ALL of our food.


She used school loans to fill in this hole and to help pay for other things like books and rent.  This is another trend that I realized, she had been paying all these essential things with her school loans and had been living off of that for 5 years.  I did the calculations and even though it's not a very expensive school she's about $80,000 in debt if not more.  She has asked me for large sums of money on a few occasions but I refused because I don't believe she'll be able to pay me back.


That aside moving on the the more pressing issue which is what I need advice on.  This past Monday she was fired from her job.  I told her all her options to find a new job but as of now she has made no attempts at finding one, instead she is taking some freelance work that her step-father has given her.  This is fine but it won't last forever and the sooner she starts looking for a job the sooner she'll have one.  


Today I came home after another 12 hour day and picked up the mail, I usually leave the mail on the table for her when she gets home (my mail still goes to my dads house).  This time though I saw that she had a letter from Duke energy, I was curious to see how much this bill for the utilities would be, or that's what I guessed it was, and so I opened it.  It reads Final Disconnection Notice, it was a letter saying that our power is going to be shut off in 10 days if we don't pay the bill right now.  At the beginning of this month I gave her $400 for my half of rent(300) and utilities(100) but it seems she hasn't been paying it.  Also in the mail today was a letter from her bank, after seeing the duke letter I opened the one from the bank.  It was a letter notifying her she had Overdraft and she had -22 in her account, it was also nice enough to point out that this was the 44th overdraft in the past 12 months!


We are supposed to go look at new apartments to live in this weekend but I'm starting to have severe doubts about still living with her and with having a relationship in general.  I don't know what to say to her, I've tried talking it out and helping her make a plan to spend less but it always ends in a fight.  Please help me out guys!

I met this girl in high school about three years ago over the summer and we initially really hit it off. We were constantly flirting with each other, but it never really went anywhere and it kind of fell apart once the summer ended.

Fast forward to the end of last summer (2013).
She and I started talking again and we started getting more serious. We were older and were more open about our feelings and so we actually got somewhere. Before leaving she gave me my first (sober) kiss, and it meant a lot to me. We've been talking via skype, facebook, text, twitter, etc. since then and things have escalated. We're now calling each other romantic kid names and have been talking openly about our feelings for each other (big step for us). 

She goes to college in New Jersey and I go to college in Maine. Over thanksgiving break, I'm coming back home (Jersey) and I'm not sure how to proceed. Since I'm mainly there to visit family, I won't be able to see her much, but I've managed to reserve one evening with her. I'm not really sure where to go from here though. 

Where do I take her? 
Should I make a move?
Should I end this?

I don't know what I'm doing in this long distance thing, but I know that I really like this girl. The problem is just that I know that I will be constantly abroad (whether it be on campus or during summer internships, jobs, etc.) and I don't want to her or me to end up hurt. Any advice would be appreciated!

I'm 22, finished school in May, currently living at home. I managed to land a pretty nice job, my take home pay is approximately $3400/month. Right now I don't have much in the way of bills. About $200/month in gas, $400/month in student loan payment, and maybe $150/month in food and other miscellaneous stuff. The obvious thing to do would be to stay at home for a few years and save money, but that's the opposite of what I want to do. As much as I love my parents, and as much as it sounds like the whining of an ungrateful jerk, I can't stand living at home, and can't wait to move out and be on my own.

I'm planning on buying a home next year. Due to the difference in home prices (about a 60% decrease) as well as other factors, I'm planning to relocate to a work location with the same company in a different area and buy a home there in the middle of next year. Between a UTMA account I just found out about recently that was intended to be used for college but wasn't, and my savings from my current job and previous internships, I have a pretty sizable chunk of money for a down payment saved up.

The other major expense I'm looking at, but with a lower priority than a house, is a new car. I'm currently driving a hand me down that's 10 years old and has almost 200k miles on it. Right now it's running ok, but I don't expect that to last too many more years.


Anyway, here's my numbers:


UTMA: $34.3k split between FCNTX, FGRIX, and FMCSX

PNC Money Market: $12k

Credit union savings account: $11k

Student loan debt: $28.5k @ 6.8% interest

Target home price:180k~200k. Since this will be my first home, I'll also need to buy furniture.

My main question is what to do with my money while I'm waiting. The UTMA has been doing pretty well since I started watching it, but I'm worried about the risk there. On the other hand, the money market is safe, but I'm only getting 0.1% interest on that, and slightly less on the credit union savings account. Would my best option be to empty the UTMA and consolidate into the money market to keep it safe? I can't put it in something that I wouldn't be able to withdraw from soon. I could also pay off some of my student loan, but I'm hesitant to pay too much of that since I don't know exactly how much buying a home and the related expenses will be.


Any advice on that, or anything else for that matter, would be appreciated.

Yesterday I had to meet with my professor to talk about a project. I had to collect a bunch of data and only had time to do it a few hours before meeting with him. That time crunch made me really anxious and I just feel so terrible right now.

That was yesterday around 4:00 pm and I just can't calm down. I took my anti-anxiety medication which helped, but now I'm back to feeling so stressed and awful. All I want to do is scream. I just want to explode and I have no idea what to do. I'm afraid this is going to trigger depression, which stress did to me last year in the fall. 

I just hate this. I keep digging my fingernails into my arm and biting my hand from feeling so intensely uncomfortable. But I can't stop doing anything, not right now. Everything will be cooling off in 3 weeks but I just hate it right now. Fuck. I just thought of putting a gun to my head so I wouldn't have to deal with any of it anymore. I'm not suicidal right now, but the thought just flashed through my mind. Recognizing that I'm having these thoughts just makes it worse.

I guess this is part rant, part asking for support, and part asking for advice...anyone?"

I've been considering posting in here for a while, but didn't dare to until now. Probably some sense of self-pride holding me back, persuading myself it ain't all that bad (my situation certainly could be far worse, but it's still far from making me feel well). But yeah, I do need external input, holding it in slowly drives me crazy.

It does start well. I'm currently 28, well-educated with a college degree obtained around 2007 - when things started to go down in the sub-prime mortgage crisis, freezing employment opportunities badly where I live.

I have two main issues, job life, and love life. They're tied, but let's break it down:

Jobs: I'm currently unemployed. I've been struggling to find a decent job since I graduated, and that was long ago. First, my internships proved to be complete failures with no pay and no job at the end. I've been from low-wage jobs to low-wages job, not even meeting minimum wages requirements in my country, and having to move out every four months. I could not save any money, but managed to pay my rents and other fees but cutting costs everywhere I could (at least, no debt issue). The latest job I've been in was a joke: basically, the State paid the company I worked in (specific process to help employment), providing I'd stay a full year

None of my jobs were ""McJobs"" - the companies I worked with were all seeking skills at no cost, and that's all I could find due to a lack of experience (instable work do not count as experience here). Everyone I worked with was pretty happy with what I had to offer, both in performance and on the social field. That wasn't enough for my to start a ""career"", which means to me have a basic stable income.

I had to leave the crappy flat I rented and go bak to my parents'. I'm currently filing tons of form everywhere to get a new job, with no success so far - it's been 8 weeks. As time goes by, and as I had to switch places often, I'm losing friends and networking opportunities to the point that there's none left.

Love life: pretty poor. I'm not actively looking for female partners, and - given the places I was sent to to ""work"" - have close to no chances of meeting people. I had a limited share of sexual encounters. My main issue is that I've been heart-broken since I've graduated; I was, at that time, deep mad in love with a girl, and still am (she's literally haunting my dreams in times I expect it the least). This relationship has been broken due to both work issues and boredom on her side about 4 years ago, and I moved about 500 miles away then. I've been very supporting of her when we were together, helping her getting in touch with the industry she loved, proving her that her dreams were accessible and ultimately providing her with the boost she needed to succeed in her field - spent a lot of time. I've been working hard, wasn't home often, but it did pay in a way. She never could understood how I managed to get her where she wanted to be, and still couldn't get a decent job myself. Eventually, she left me; I know she waited about a year to get in another relationship, which current state is unknown to me. The weird part, at least for me, is that she contacted me again a week ago, looking to get back in touch; she probably just want to have me back as a friend, but I know I can't stand this - I'd wish for more, and think that's a bad idea overall. I have no idea how to handle this situation, and tends to burst in panic now.

So, halp?"

He's a solo practitioner, so it's only me, him, and the paralegal in the office. I suspected when I took the internship that my boss had a slight drinking problem but I didn't think about it too much. He'd have a drink or two at lunch, not a big deal. Then it turned into a few drinks at lunch. Then it turned into a bottle of alcohol at the desk. By that point, he was visibly a little tipsy in the office most of the time, but he more or less handled it well, so the paralegal and I ignored it because it wasn't out business.  

Then everything just went to hell. I've found him passed out at his desk three times in the last two months. At this point, I'm pretty sure he's gotten into some kind of drugs. I saw what I think was cocaine in his desk and I've seen him carrying a pill bottle around. He didn't show up to a hearing last week because he was too fucked up to be in front of a judge, and he's losing clients because he isn't functioning well. 

I can't take this much longer, but I can't leave a for-credit internship in the middle of the year. I'm legitimately worried about my boss but I have no idea how to help without getting him in trouble. I really don't want to have to explain this to school administration. Anyone had a situation like this before? Any advice would be appreciated.

1r6pb2,1,2013-11-21,College student who was born without both upper lateral incisors needs advice....,butteredpancakes2,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/1r6pb2/college_student_who_was_born_without_both_upper/,"So, as the title reads, I really need advice on what to do going forward about my teeth.

I'm 19 years old and was born without both of my upper lateral incisors. Ever since I was about 15 I have this issue temporarily resolved by having an MCLR placed in my mouth by my orthodontist. It is simply 2 teeth attached to a wire that is held in place by 4 wings cemented onto the neighboring teeth. From my understanding, this is a very temporary measure, as they can break every year or so. I am currently on my second one.

I am currently in my sophomore year of college, and I have aspirations to study abroad, land an internship, etc., making this one of worst times that I could potentially lose my teeth.

Recently, I spoke with a periodontist and had x-rays taken. I had braces in middle school, however the roots of the teeth neighboring one of the absent lateral incisors have shifted towards each other, making an implant impossible there right now. Meaning that I would need braces once again, potentially up to 1 year.



I also spoke to a dentist about having a bridge done. He told me about how it involves shaving down teeth, increases potential for root canals, etc. However, my father has had a bridge for ~20 yrs with no problems and this is a person who is a heavy smoker and probably hasnt used floss since he was a kid haha. I understand that every person/bridge is different, however this still comes to mind when I think about getting a bridge.

This leaves me with a few cons of each:

**Implant cons:**

**1)** Requires braces, once again
**2)** Will need to wear a flipper
**3)** Will be sporting both of these during my college years
**4)** Although not very probable, if my body were to reject the implants after putting through the effort/spending the money on braces I don't know what I would do.

**Bridge Cons:**

**1)** Shaving down healthy teeth
**2)** Possible root canals 
**3)** Do not typically last as long as implants

Honestly, I really think I am leaning towards having a bridge done. I won't need to spend a year with braces and months with a flipper which is huge for me. Is it wrong for me in this situation to be leaning towards the less praised bridge over implants?? "

1rapbm,1,2013-11-23,Unescorted Access Question: Criminal Record.,[deleted],nuclear,https://www.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/1rapbm/unescorted_access_question_criminal_record/,"First off, I know I'm an idiot.  Let's clear the air on that one.  I got cited for public drunkenness when I was having a reunion with some friends at our college this past weekend, 11/16.  As far as I understand, this is a summary offense, which ranks even less than a misdemeanor.  I'll be going to court in the next month or so and the officer has already offered to get rid of it in return for customer service.

I work at a contractor and in the upcoming few months I know I'll have to pass some sort of background clearance to get on their nuclear sites.  We're working mainly on computer stuff, so I don't think I'd need access to any inner workings or anything.  Not sure if I'll be in the protected area.  So does this kind of thing even require unescorted access clearance?

I've had unescorted access at a different company before, but that ended (favorably) about 14 months ago.  It was an internship.

My main questions are:  If I'm in the process of getting rid of this in the court system, will it even show up on a background check? 

Should I self-report this on the UA application?  From what I remember, they ask for all criminal background EXCEPT minor civil actions or misdemeanors.  This is even LESS than a misdemeanor! But I do NOT want to act like I'm hiding anything.  If all goes well, this will be completely 100% off my public record after all the paperwork goes through.

I understand that they probably won't outright deny me if this shows up on a background check.  But I also understand that it reflects pretty poorly on my character to have this show up so recently.  

So.... how bad is this???

(FYI This licensee is Exelon.  I hear they can be picky...)

Any and all help is appreciated.  Feel free to call me an idiot; I deserve it."
1ramwk,8,2013-11-23,LPT: How I was hired into one of the most competitive industries in the world.,[deleted],LifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ramwk/lpt_how_i_was_hired_into_one_of_the_most/,"* **Industry**: Consumer Goods
* **Job**: Analyst

Trying to find a home for this. The goal is to help everyone though so forgive me if I'm incorrect. Read on if this applies to you.

**The process before the process...**

I should start by telling you about my background. I graduated from a non-target school (a barely Division 1 state school with strengths in Ag Business and Nursing) with a Finance degree and an *okay* GPA (3.3). I networked pretty hard in college; being naturally gregarious this was easy. I studied abroad in Asia for 6 months but I did not have an internship. I landed a job in a management and leadership program in a Fortune 500 company directly out of school. Hated it because of the industry mainly. Had to get out to reclaim what remained of my soul.

I spent 18 months at the first company. It's important to reach 2 years, and 3 if you can manage it. I just could not, so I started grinding as hard as humanly possible while in an industry related to the one I wanted to be in. I was critiqued by HR professionals, networked somewhat through personal channels, and went through about 50 iterations of my résumé (no joke) for different industries -- treasury management and banking, supply chain management, financial analysis, sales, etc.

After completing those 50 iterations of my resume I then applied online for countless jobs. I had to jump through clunky and cumbersome application software hoops, uploading a resumés, sending tailored cover letters, answering an abundance of questions already in my resume. It was a very redundant process, and very frustrating.

Lots of grunt work occurred in addition to my already tiresome job. Keeping the face of the company I worked for while being in a management and leadership program, combined with hating it, is very exhausting. 

I did get two phone interviews through web applications though. These led to one panel in-person and one phone interview. I did not get offered either. I attribute that mainly to a huge lack of confidence and some desperation to get out of my first job.


**How I proceeded after failure...**

I will now address how I changed my approach. I hear a lot of folks complain about struggling to get some where with the job market as it is. I can understand that. Here are a few components of a successful candidate.

Being intelligent might actually be less than half of getting to where one would like to be. If I had to index components of the process, I would assign a 40% value to being smart. 

The other 60% is energy and passion. People buy passion and energy if it sounds credible. Combining intellect with energy and enthusiasm is deadly. Many believe the common denominators between highly successful people are energy and work ethic.

**Where to invest a lot of your time**

* Learn what you don't know. You can't sell yourself very well without a solid foundation in the role you want -- or at least a sound understanding.
* LinkedIn. No, I'm not advertising for this company. It's just the best we've got in terms of widespread professional networking. I hope that changes. Competition is great.
I got hired into the consumer goods industry as an analyst. Here is my process.


**A more step-by-step process**:

* Look at countless job profiles in the field you're trying to be in.
* Adapt your resume to those profiles. Incorporate buzz words that are laid out in the requirements/desired competencies. Why? Software like Taleo and other interview architectures will fish resumes for key words. These automated processes just makes HR's life easier considering the large volume of resumes they see.
* As most of us are aware, when writing a resume be concise and try to impact the reader as quickly as possible.
* Go learn enough about those buzz words and desired competencies to feel comfortable with them -- both in conversation and in execution.
* **Aim to be better than the next guy in the areas you will be asked about.**
* Create a meaningful LinkedIn presence.
* Message a recruiter in your desired industry. Make it straight-forward. Be passionate (or fake it -- both here and in the interview). Be succinct and very personable. I say fake it because charisma is a trait not all of us have. Giving yourself a little push when you have their attention is so very, very important... even if it's not in your personality. 
* Keep in mind that different kinds of recruiters exist, and most of them are trying to place big talent. They want to place a manager, director, or VP level recruit. Why? Their commission is fatter. The firm employing your recruiter will pay them handsomely (can be north of 25% of total compensation). Hang in there though. Someone is interested in you. Just keep playing the game!
* Continue all steps until you get a bite.

**Playing the long game...**

* At this point you're chomping at the bit because you know that you're ready. You've studied what is needed to study. You continue to keep your nose in periodicals and other news resources. It gets exhausting, but you want it badly.
* Now your head is in the game. You can speak generally about a broader range of topics in the field than when you started. You SOUND smart, and you really are to boot. 
* **Boom**. The recruiter lands you an interview **because you sold yourself to them. You went to *them*. They believe in you. They think, ""This guy or girl is SMART and HUNGRY. I would recommend them to my best clients.""**
* A good recruiter is going to prep you for each subsequent meeting with the company. He will instruct you to view the hiring managers' Linkedin profiles. Do it. Learn as much about them as you can. Talk about their successes in their career. Ask intelligent questions about what got them there. 
* Proceed through 2-4 interviews. Corporate America is often structured this way. There may be more interviews. 
* Be the THE MAN they want (or THE WOMAN!). Flex a bit. Be confident. You worked hard. Now you can talk casually and comfortably about the job. You're a great fit. Help them realize that. Their main concern, however, is being able to work around you for 8-9 hours per day. Be likable! It's a survival tactic.
* SMILE. Laugh. Weave words. Be transparent and as honest as you can be without raising doubt. Always leave your answers on a good note. Make them feel good (hiring managers/HR). You want them to say, ""I love you,"" after 5 minutes of meeting you.
* Get said job.

I've sent I don't know how many applications to just about every position that Google searches throw up, and haven't even received acknowledgement from most of them (from talking to my classmates this seems to be standard practice).  I really need to have an internship sorted by January, and I'm starting to stress out over this. The main reason is finance - unless the internship is in the Athlone area I need it to be paid; I simply can't afford rent in the likes of Galway or Dublin. 

Has anyone out there got any contacts or job openings that could help me? I'll be glad to pm my CV and details."
1ra2kz,5,2013-11-23,Recent problems after LDR - should I [21F] try to stay with him [22M] after 1.5 yrs?,melborp3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ra2kz/recent_problems_after_ldr_should_i_21f_try_to/,"Hi guys, this is a throwaway since he knows my username.

I [21F] met my SO [22M] when he had an internship in my area. The first month was amazing! But then he had to go back to his school, so we had a LDR for 7 months. During that time, I would drive ~500 miles every 4-6 weeks to visit him for a few days and it was fantastic! We had so much fun and it was the best! During holiday breaks we spent more time together (more like 2-3 weeks). We were always having fun going out and doing things. He came up to visit only once, and that was also because he had job interviews.

He took a job up here because his friends are here, and when he moved in to his new place he had major problems (another tenant was there, dirty, etc) so I offered that he stay with me and my family temporarily (I live at home). At the time, I was still in university classes, and I really had to focus on my studies, which I told him flat out, and that I couldn't handle extra drama but he was welcome to stay with us for a week. He would come home late, walk through the door, not ask how my or my family's day was, and immediately complain and ask my parents to cook him dinner. I just couldn't handle it so I separated myself from that whole situation and kinda went into hiding. After a few weeks I sat him down and explained that how he acted towards us was inappropriate and he just sat and huffed and puffed and rolled his eyes and made a drama out of it.

Things have been getting progressively worse since that dialogue. All we do anymore is sit around and watch TV once a wee.. I feel like he doesn't pay any attention to me or care about what I do and he told me he feels like I don't respect him. On my 21st bday he didn't make any effort to meet my friends and really made it obvious that he didn't want to be there.. He's done it again too: sometimes its social anxiety, but other times its just rude (on the phone the whole time, etc). Recently he's been under a lot of stress from work and having some serious back problems, so that's been a lot of stress for him.

 We have had our super fun moments, and there at definitely times we really enjoy each others company like we used to when he lived far away.

Tonight he told me the relationship was ""broken"" and basically he didn't want to fix it. He said the turning point was after the conversation about how he treated my family when he was staying with us -- apparently he had to tell one of his ex's the same thing (that he had to focus on school) and it made him feel terrible to be on the receiving end. He said I did it really condescendingly, but I think my delivery was just bad because he was acting out and I didn't know what to do. I did say some things that I apologized for since I know they aren't true (ie ""I don't care about your problems""), but he is saying that everything is beyond broken since his opinion of me has changed. He also accused me of intending to hurt him with my comments over the past few weeks, which I feel were all just in a cycle to the things he's said to me. We've both said things we probably didn't mean.

After the conversation he sounded like things could change for the better, but we are on break now until he gets back from visiting his family.
I feel hurt and surprised by all this -- the entire time he wasn't really considering my feelings and I had to point out that he never apologized for his behavior, while I apologized profusely and he was still attacking me. He says he wants things to be how they were but doesn't want to fix it. 

Idk if this is just a rut we need to work through (since he is really stressed) or if this is really ""broken beyond repair."" ... Where do I draw the line? I feel like we worked so hard to make this relationship work LD and then once he got here, and we definitely have had our moments, and I just am not sure if I am 100% ready to leave for good.. 

TLDR: Had an UH-MAZING 7mo LDR, hung out a few days-weeks in person regularly. 4 mo ago he moved up here and there are problems (his health, work, a fight, no more dates). Is this just a rut that we should try to work through or is this just broken beyond repair?"
1r9t6t,0,2013-11-23,I [20 M] have an issue on how to deal with 2 [21 F]/[20 F] long-distance relationships,apsfmpfm,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r9t6t/i_20_m_have_an_issue_on_how_to_deal_with_2_21_f20/,"So I worked at an internship this past summer with people from across the country (US). Prior to starting at my location, I went a visited a friend at another location, and while I was there I met girl A, who shared a lot of the same interests that I had. We kept in contact even when I was gone, and later on, I managed to get to see her again and we hooked up a few times. We would talk every day and skype about once a week, but then school started getting really stressful for her and as a result we spoke less, and I figured that she was over it. 

That's where girl B comes in. Girl B worked at my location and I really got to know her quite well over the course of the few months I was there. We share all of the same interests and she's exactly the type of person that I had always thought I'd want to be in a relationship with. She had a boyfriend at the time, so nothing ever came of it, and we kept in contact every now and then once she left to return to school. About a month later, I happened to get a job interview in her town, so I crashed on her couch for the weekend before flying home. Over the weekend, we went to a party and after a few drinks, she confessed that she had been in love with me the whole time and that she was planning on dumping her boyfriend for me. I advised her against it out of concern of her making a rash decision considering I live so far away, but she did it anyways. 

So she breaks up with him and we have a romantic rest of my time there, and all is good. Until I get home, girl A comes out of the woodworks again after such a long time away and starts going on about how much she misses me. So eventually, I somehow get myself into basically being in long distance relationships with both of these girls. I talk to both of them frequently, but even though I care deeply about both of them, I feel as though it is unfair for me to be talking to both girls in this way.

I am more attracted to girl A, but besides that girl B is a much better fit for me, and I'm not sure what to do. I'm not in a committed relationship with either of them, it's just casual flirting and such, but it feels wrong to be flirting with both at the same time. But at the same time, it feels weird to address it with them because I'm not actually in a relationship with them. I should add that both girls know each other, but they don't know that I talk to the other in this way.

Any thoughts or advice on what to do?

**tl;dr**: 2 girls, both a long ways away. Unsure how to deal with it"
1r9b5j,0,2013-11-22,Big 4 Second Round Interview,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1r9b5j/big_4_second_round_interview/,"Hi everyone,

I just made it to the second round interview for a summer tax intern at PwC. I have a few questions and if anyone could share their insight that would be great. I'm taking a survey for the office visit and it asks a few questions that I'm not sure how to answer:

1. What other firms/companies will you be visiting for 2nd round interviews?

I didn't get any interviews at any other firms. How badly will this reflect upon me? I only applied to 3 of the 4 big 4, and only got an interview from PwC. I'm pretty worried about this.

2. Who are the three people you know the best at PwC and would you like to meet more PwC professionals at a specific level?

For this question, would it be okay if I put down my interviewer or campus recruiter as someone I knew? The interview was on campus and there was one social but the employee to student ratio was 10:1. Therefore, I didn't get the chance to meet that many professionals. Also, from a recruiting standpoint is there an answer they are looking for when they say professionals at a specific level? For example, would putting down partners be better than associates? 

Any other tips/help for the office interview would be really nice. I hear that PwC accept too many people for first and even second round interviews because they want to give students the interview experience. Since I didn't get any of the other Big 4, I'm really hoping that this works out.

Thank you! :)"

Are you a trust fund baby? If so, good for you. Couldn't happen to a better person. Seriously. Furthermore, go fuck yourself. Your kind, with its consequence-free paradigm, dilutes the talent pool in the entertainment industry and has an undue influence on the American narrative — which is why, in the 1970's, movies were about urban, interesting looking, colorful people, and now, they're about suburban, dead-souled superheroes. And thanks to ""unpaid internships,"" your ilk will maintain its stranglehold on the industry for generations to come.

I am not so fortunate. I had three strikes against me as I embarked on this profession. Number one, I am publicly educated. Number two, I am Irish Catholic by heritage, meaning one look at me and every person thinks, ""I'm going to colonize and oppress the living shamrock out of that people-pleasing leprechaun, just for the hell of it."" Number three, I am interested in the happiness of others. Numbers two and three are related, baked into my motherboard, and problems I'll contend with for life.

Number one, on the other hand, could have gone another way.

My high school was extremely traditional. How traditional? It was founded in 1635, one year before Harvard. Six years of Latin. A strict adherence to 17th century educational principals of discipline, rigor and gratuitous suffering. If you raised your hand, you had better have the right answer or you get the hose again. In the hall? Where's your lavatory pass (that's right, lavatory)? Hard work was king. Colorful complexity, as a desirable trait, was, in the eyes of my instructors, a notch below rabies. Lunch break was 19 minutes long. Lollygag time did not exist.

And here's the lesson one takes away from this. If you speak, spit out the right answer fast and get out of the line of fire. Go along. Do not be noticeable for fear of a misdemeanor mark. This is, obviously, fantastic training for the bottom of any number of executive food chains.

My wife, on the other hand, went to a private boarding high school only 25 miles, yet several centuries, north of my own. At her school, probing complexity was the name of the game. An interesting and deep answer was prized higher than a correct one. Students probably rode around in golf carts or were carried on sedan chairs by lower classmen. All enjoying the overwhelming message: *I am a complex person and my complexity has value.*

This dichotomy bears out in the following way: at dinner parties, when you find yourself bored to tears by a person's long-winded answer to ""how are you?"" chances are they went to private school. That other guest, who got everyone else talking but left without divulging so much as their last name? Public. And it bears mentioning, the one who snuck off to go to the bathroom but really was doing all the dishes? Parochial. God bless those poor bastards.

To be a director, in this industry that is now overrun by Thad Claddingtons the Thirds, who only feel comfortable hiring their own, we must learn to pass. All the blonde, white-slacked, yacht-treading villains from 1980's John Cusack sex comedies grew up to become agents and development executives and we, the John Cusacks of the world, only too excited to be granted the right to work, have been tossed outside the gates.

Luckily there is a way back in. A secret body language taught to and understood by only the privileged. And here I am to blow the whistle on it. I humbly present: Six Ways to Pass as Privately Educated, or... Six Secrets to High Status Body Language, or... Six Methods to Put Peasants in Their Heads...

**1. Never touch your face**

Ever. Don't touch your face. Dead give away. Don't rest your head on your hand. Don't pick your teeth or wipe your mouth. Don't check your nose for bats in the cave. All of these motions are dead giveaways that you care a little too much about the impression you're leaving on the person with whom you are in conversation. Did I say the person with whom you are in conversation? I meant the plebeian upon whom you are briefly bestowing your glorious presence. And if they must stare at some particulate matter in the corner of your mouth, SO BE IT, it is a small price to pay for the attention they are receiving from you.

**2. Delay your reactions**

If you laugh right away at something funny said by this plebeian, you lose at the game of status. If however, they say something undeniably funny (a sure sign they need to impress you, and how gauche is that?) and you pause one Mississippi, and then meaningfully blink while firing a quick breathe from your nostrils, indicating you get it, but are too important to truly laugh, you win. And you have just committed what is known as a status attack. Let silence into your exchanges and watch your opponents begin to tap dance. Get comfortable in this silence. It is the sound of power draining from your conversation partner. Now, for the love of god, keep them on the ropes.

**3. Freeze! Now move in slow motion**

Confidence, it has been said, is the absence of insecurity. Insecurity is demonstrated through energy leaks. If you cannot manage your voltage, or if you are generating more than is appropriate for a situation, it will leak out of you any way it can: through excessive blinking, leg-thumping, weight-shifting, over-sharing of autobiography, looking to see what a loud noise was, manic changes of subject, and worst of all, the overt seeking of validation. Meanwhile, in science, temperature is the measure of how much undirected energy is in something. Therefore: cool down, direct your energy to the task at hand. Have slow, powerful thoughts. Focus on the present. Don't stir. You're fine where you are. Success will seek you out. Be still. People lose their minds over the quietest, stillest person in the room. Be that person.

**4. Don't acknowledge the new person**

This makes me insane. I should pause here and say I don't ethically condone any of these tactics. In fact I find them repulsive, BUT they work, especially when your status is under attack, or when you need to impress someone who falls for this bullshit. So, this next one is a sadly ubiquitous anti-greeting among the highly statured. When you greet a group of people you know, and it contains a stranger, take forever to acknowledge them. Start long, endless conversations with those you already know and make the new person awkwardly wait, hand half-mobilized for a shake. If I had a nickel for every time I've been on the business end of this adorable little maneuver. This neutralizes any potential status attack within the other person, and gets in the first lick while they are vulnerable. It's also heartless. I can't bring myself to do it. Ergo, I will never succeed.

**5. Consider your eye contact a gift**

Have you ever Facebook-cruised your buddy's new girlfriend (or boyfriend) prior to meeting in person, and thought to yourself, ""uh-oh, those are crazy eyes."" The muscles around our eyes are one hundred times too strong for their intended purpose, i.e. dragging our eyeballs around their sockets to look at stuff. Why do we have all that extra brawn? To convey meaning. To give away how we feel. To reveal we are, in fact, crazy. We are transmitting all sorts of sensitive information when we make eye contact with another. And we all, although we don't realize it, have the capacity to interpret these cues. Therefore, don't give away the store. When you look at someone, you essentially say, this is me, this is what I'm actually thinking and feeling. So bestow this information only on those with whom it can be trusted. (I have to stop here again to say these six tactics are dick moves. Make no mistake, I have a hard time relating to people who do this stuff, but, then again, I am not high status. I am not successful. So if it is success among the successful that you seek, here you are.)

**6. Withhold intimacy**

I am a compulsive hugger. When in doubt, hug it out, that's what I say. The amount of hands I've swatted away, in favor of going in, is innumerable. And I therefore remain, in the hearts and minds of all who know me, utterly harmless. In probably a bad way. Got an intense project that needs a strong leader who'll guide us out of the chop? Don't give it to Hughes! He'll just make everyone feel good. This concept even works in relationships. The more you withhold intimacy, the more you gain power over the other person, who will then have to give something up to get it back. This is also useful when blocking scenes. Point is, don't be me. Don't offer your hand first, don't offer a hug first, be totally fine and intact and privately educated, and someone will slip up and offer you their hand. Or at the very least, wonder what you think of them.

 * * *

With these dastardly and effective tools, you'll be able to move through cocktail parties with the upwardly mobile. New people will seek your approval. You'll be sought after for projects and social engagements. You'll even be able to detect other in cognito charlatans. And you can give them the slow Renaissance Fair nod as if you're both wearing cloaks. But remember, we only visit the privately educated world to accomplish the mission of being successful. We do not take up residence. We do not forget where we come from.

Godspeed, and happy rejecting, you successful, privately educated so and so. With any luck, and some crafty en masse infiltration, we can put an end to plutocratic warping of the collective American autobiography.

1rdmzt,31,2013-11-24,You could almost make an argument that everyone on this show has slept with everyone else.,[deleted],greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/1rdmzt/you_could_almost_make_an_argument_that_everyone/,"In the episode discussion thread I made a chart of who has slept with what other coworkers.  I decided I'd do the whole thing because this show is utterly ridiculous with its relationships!


Alex holds first place by sleeping with 10 main cast / recurring cast members:

Alex has slept with:

* Addison

* Rebecca (she counts because she basically lived in the hospital)

* Izzy

* Callie

* Heather

* Leah

* Jo

* Lucy

* Lexie

* Olivia

Callie has a strong hold on second with 5 main cast / recurring cast members plus one hospital employee alluded to in season 6:

* Alex (told to us in flashback in ""The Time Warp"" episode from s6)

* George

* Hahn

* Mark (I'd like to note that Mark and Hahn were AT THE SAME TIME - as in, in the same day)

* Arizona

* ""the busty redhead in peds"" (thanks /u/maxwellhouselizzy for finding this one)


In third place we have Mark, with five:

Mark:

* Addison

* Lexie

* Callie

* Teddy

* Reed (thanks to /u/Myfriendgwen for the last two I forgot!)

* almost the entire nursing staff, but we never learn their names so they don't count for this purpose but I had to throw it in :)

In fourth place we have George:

George:

* Meredith

* Callie (thanks /u/alliptera for pointing out George is more of a manwhore than I thought!)

* Izzy

* Olivia

In fifth place we have a tie between Lexie, Derek, Richard, and Jackson:

Lexie:

* Alex

* Mark

* Jackson

Derek:

* Addison

* Meredith

* Rose

Two of these women were his wife - I don't think he deserves 'man-whore' status

Richard:

* Adele (worked with him as a nurse)

* Ellis

* Catherine

Jackson:

* April

* Stephanie

* Lexie

As for the rest of the cast and whom they've slept with:

* Meredith: Derek and George

* Cristina: Burke and Owen, CREEPY CARDIO GUY FROM MINNESOTA WHO TRIED TO FIRE MR. FEENY BECAUSE HE WAS OLD, Colin Marlowe (but he was her professor/teacher at the time)... so I guess Cristina moves up to third place...

* Izzy: Alex, George............. I don't think Denny counts because he was never actually *alive* when they had sex but we'll put him here anyway

* Bailey: Eli and Ben

* April: Jackson

* Arizona: Callie and Leah, skank from s9 finale, Colleen - Callie's scrub nurse (I still hold that all of the other women she pointed out were sarcastic to get Callie off her back because Callie wanted to know who she had been with - season 7? season 8?)

* Teddy: Mark, Henry, Trauma Counselor Andrew

Interns: 

* Heather: Alex

* Leah: Alex, Arizona

* Stephanie: Jackson

* Jo: Alex

* Ross: no one

Hey, let's get some new characters in here.  Or an outside relationship.  Perhaps this is why I like Matthew with April - NO ONE ELSE HAS HAD SEX WITH MATTHEW.

1rdjil,1,2013-11-24,I [M20] have serious psychological issues surrounding talking to girls. What sort of things can help my situation?,Naranis,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1rdjil/i_m20_have_serious_psychological_issues/,"From the time I was in elementary school, I was told by a number of ""friends"" and family that I would never have a girlfriend. I was often called a girl by new ""friends"" and my family some more in middle school because I grew my hair out to almost 9 inches. In high school, I started dating and dated a couple crazies, because apparently that is all that is attracted to me. I eventually fell in love with a girl, who was my best friend, who had a boyfriend. I chased her for 2 years (knew her for 5), and then dated her for 6 months only for her to dump me and start dating another guy while she is doing an internship on the other side of the country.

I've always been the ""nice guy"". Everyone tells me I am the nicest person they have ever met, and i have a rather sadistic sense of humor that pops out every once in awhile. But I fear that this is starting to turn me into a doormat.

So now we have some relationship background on me. All of that has messed up my ability to even approach a girl that I don't know, and I seem to have a problem of slipping into the ""comfortable"". 

I also have this little quirk where I HATE failure. This is also coupled with a crippling fear of rejection. A lot of times it is easier to not try at all than to fail. You can't fail if you don't try, right? Wrong. Oh so very wrong. I don't even know where it came from. I think it is my parents' doing.

Anyway. Does anyone out there have or have had the same problem? I've put some serious thought into counseling (my uni offers it for free) to try and get rid of my fear of failure and rejection, but I always make excuses. ""I don't have time"", ""They have more important people to deal with"", ""No one wants  to hear my ramblings for an hour""... That sort of thing... 

What should I do?

**TL;DR: ""Nice guy"" with some serious issues with failure and rejection and no self confidence. Where do I start to gain some confidence and get back out there?**"

My pilot I'm making is called ""Intern Roommates part 1: Dating in LA"" and it's shaping up to be pretty great! Everything takes place in my apartment (in front of the big white wall, next to the fridge) and incorporates all the inside jokes that me and my roomies keep chuckling about (we watch *Anchorman* a lot!). Can't wait for it to be shown on the big screen!

Quick question: do the shows *have* to be five minutes? I mean, what if they're five minutes and twenty seconds? That's only twenty second over! Come on! I have a killer 20 second ""awkward pause"" bit I need to keep in there. And the jokes need lots of room to breathe. We're gonna be holding for laughs!

My script is currently 9 pages, but with the training/dancing/*RaNDoMNeSS* montage it's gonna be about 11. I can send you the script if you send me a message here, but my lit. agent (my roomie) has to approve you first. My influences are Jim Jarmusch, P.T. Anderson, and my Boondock Saints poster.

**CASTING MY CREW:**

* I'm looking for a DP with a Red Epic camera and those lenses that Kubrick used for Barry Lyndon. The job doesn't pay and I won't have food, but you WILL have the opportunity to DP more of my stuff in the future. You may even be bumped to cinematographer!
* I'm looking for a Production Assistant with grip equipment who can do grip work and will be key in gripping the grip equipment. This is also known as a PA gig, and does not pay.
* I'm also looking for a sound person who can hold two booms, since my show will be in stereo (duh). The sound job also does not pay (duh!).

How I will create value for you: I am quite content with the type of job where I must do many different tasks, which is part of working in a startup. I think I would be most suited towards some form of project management, and/or a form of marketing as I have had experience in that area. However, I am flexible and a quick learner, so any position you need me to fill, I will do it. Please PM me and I will be happy to send you a resume. 

A few things about me: 

* In the past, I have had internships with two startups, one which was a website and the other wrote software, and in addition to internships I helped a couple friends of mine start their own auto parts and restoration business. 

* I am more computer savvy than the average Joe, and I am already very good with Excel/Word/PowerPoint and have received certifications in each, expert level for Excel. However, I am not fluent in any programming language; that being said, I am able to pick up most software quickly, and I have started to learn the very basics of HTML and CCS on my own time. 

* I am a leader. I have held multiple leadership positions in my school organizations and even founded one organization, then was a founding board member of another. 

* I am fantastic at working in groups, and this is part of where I feel my education has helped me tremendously. Nearly every business class has a group project of some sort, and this has helped me become an expert at working in teams.  

* My written and oral communication skills are excellent, and writing is a hobby of mine. 

* I have had a deal of international experience, as I have studied in London and China, which will help with any company doing work in multiple countries.

I am an outgoing law student from Michigan relocating to Illinois for an internship at a law firm downtown starting January 6, 2014.

The internship is only for six months with the possibility of getting hired on afterwards, so although there is a possibility of me staying there long term, I can only guarantee six months. 

I am looking to move in at anytime between December 26 - January 5th.

I am a non-smoker, with no pets.

I am looking for a place preferably in Wicker Park or Logans Square, although any place that is safe and within walking distance to the blue line is ok. 

Although I will be working/studying for the bar most of the time, I am an extrovert and do enjoy going out and seeing/experiencing new things.

My range is from $500-$800.

If there is anything else you would like to know about me, shoot me a PM. Can't wait to meet you guys."

1rcx7z,0,2013-11-24,"I have chronic depression and anxiety. About a year and half ago, I was borderline suicidal and I wrote down my thoughts for a Reddit post but never posted it. I just found it.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1rcx7z/i_have_chronic_depression_and_anxiety_about_a/,"- **Summary of Problem:**
      Have you ever been driving and saw a car try to merge too early or too late into your lane and had a split second spike of adrenalin and anxiety? Have you ever been waiting in line at a bar and saw a fight start to form and watched as one of the participants pulled out a knife or gun? You know that split second of “HOLY SHIT!” and the overwhelming out-of-body surge that just screams disaster and lets you strongly sense that something bad is about to happen? Do you recognize the physical symptoms that accompany this? You know that knot in your chest, muscle tightness, shortness of breath, an overwhelming urge to escape to danger, or just en entire overload of the senses? This type of adrenalin rush or extreme panic is a healthy brain function that alerts the body to danger and muscles up energy for a chance to defend or escape a dangerous or hazardous situation.
	Now imagine feeling those same surges of anxiety, both mentally and physically, for things like knowing you have to go to work today, worrying about where you want to find a job, where you want to live, if the new person moving into your apartment will be a weirdo. Worrying about whether or not you’ll ever make as much money as your friends, knowing you have a ton of dishes to do when you get home, wondering if you are able to stop smoking pot every day. Clearly there is a distinction between the examples in the previous paragraph and the ones just listed.  Lastly, just think about how long the previous paragraph’s episodes would last. They probably last right up until the situation is resolved. As soon as you honk at the car that swerved into your lane and assuming the car swerves back into their lane, that spark of anxiety will probably last no more than 5 seconds. If you see that guy in the bar line pull out that knife, you might decide it’s time to walk or run away since you are not part of the fight. Maybe that episode lasts 5 minutes from the time you see the fight starting to the time you run across the block. Not only do I get anxiety attacks for mundane every-day reasons, my periods of severe anxiety and terror last for weeks to months.
	The difference between normal, healthy “anxiety” and whatever the hell I have is that I get panic attacks and the physical symptoms of severe danger where really no problems or dangers exist. I know it’s not normal to have full on panic attacks and pack-a-day cigarette binges at least multiple times in the week. I smoke weed constantly in an effort to quell the symptoms even for an hour or two. Taking 0.5 mg of Klonopin for these attacks aren’t even enough to stop the racing thoughts and disgusting pit in my stomach. 
	I’ve always had anxiety like this and I have been on every single SSRI and SNRI under the sun but the last year and a half I have been off of all meds and it’s getting to the point where I am beginning to feel suicidal and hopeless. I am afraid that if I do not fix whatever is wrong with me, that I will have no choice but to kill myself in order to stop the pain. I am seriously terrified and dreadful that I may have some sort of mental illness that is incurable. 


- **Reasons why I may have this disorder:**
	I have always been on the go. Even as a toddler and pre-teen, my mom always told me that it seems like I always need to be doing “something.” Anything. I’m always on the move. I could never really seem to sit still and relax (psychiatrists and therapists have always said that they do not think I have ADD or ADHD. They say this is an anxiety problem as the reason why I cannot focus is not because I am over stimulated by the external environment, but because I have too many anxious thoughts in my head and cannot focus). I have always felt that I need to be doing something. Like I need to be achieving something. Building something. Buying things, making money, being more social, spending more time with this group or friends or this group. Although these are nice goals, the thing is that since my anxiety is so powerful, I can’t even bring myself to achieve the things I seem to need.
	Anyway, whatever I may have had in the past, my issues became much for severe when I was in sixth grade. In February of my 6th grade, my father unexpectedly passed away form a heart attack late at night when he was playing tennis with a friend. His friend said he was complaining about a shortness or breath and pain and then just collapsed. The paramedics did not arrive fast enough to revive him. My mom did not want an autopsy. She was just so upset and paralyzed that she did not think to find out what had happened. I believe he had either high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Either way, it was obviously a heart attack. My father hated doctors. He once had to have a rib removed because the doctors thought there might be a tumor. After removal it turned out the tumor was benign and the recovery process was extremely painful. I think after that, he just kind of stopped going to the doctor for checkups. I do not know if this was preventable by medication or lifestyle changes. I know he smoked cigarettes for 20 years so that may or may not have had a role in his death. There really is no way to tell. I basically have no idea what killed my father and I am also terrified that I am going to die when I am 50 from the same thing that killed him.
	Basically, his sudden death shook me to my core and I believed something inside of me died that day. Being a sensitive and over stimulated kid already, this devastated me to the point where it still makes me cry to talk about. I think after losing a parent with no warning whatsoever, it instilled a sense of overwhelming dread about the future. I seem to think that something bad is always going to happen and unless I can strive to find the best solution possible, I am going to end up with nothing and I am going to fail or my girlfriend is going to leave me or I am going to go crazy or I will never be able to hold a job or have a life.



- **Things I am doing to attempt to improve:**
First of all, I have decided that I am going to stop smoking pot, or at least heavily cut down on the drug. I’ve been smoking weed basically every single day for the past 6 years. I keep ignoring my therapist’s advice and other’s that marijuana increases anxiety in people who are prone to it and that it changes your thinking and makes it harder for you to clear your head, especially in times where clear-thinking is pertinent. Over the years, I have stopped for 3-week periods in the past whenever I needed to get drug tested for an internship or co-op and I do remember feeling more clear-headed and had a more normal emotional level. 
Second, I am going back on SSRIs. I used to be on Celexa and I’ve decided to give it another shot and evaluate the effects without drugs like weed. In the past, I’ve always come off the drugs because of the sexual side effects that affect me. I have trouble Cumming (I’m a guy) and sometimes I remember it would feel desensitized and not as good. This did not happen all the time. It was kind of a hit-or-miss each time. I have decided that although I take pride in how I fuck and in my sexuality, it benefits me more to be happy and clear-headed and I could always try supplementary drugs in order to combat those effects, as long as my doctors say it is healthy to do so. 

- **Goals for this thread:**
      I really have none. I haven’t written my feelings down on paper (or Microsoft Word in this case) in a long time and I thought it might make me feel better. Feel free to bash on me, help me, or just read. I don’t mind either way. 




- **UPDATE A YEAR AND HALF LATER:**
Since I have written this, I have gone back on SSRIs. Doing this has made me feel worlds better, although my anxiety and depression are still here. They are just greatly reduced and I have been able to function. I still get panic attacks but they are much more rare than before. No more weeks straight of pain. I have also graduated college with a double bachelors degree and have been able to keep a steady job at a pharmaceutical company doing Business Architecture. I still have the same girlfriend from when this was originally written and she has helped me more than anyone ever could. I owe most of my continuous recovery to her. She has stood by my side and done everything she can to give me the confidence to push through this. I also still smoke weed every day :-/. I wasn't able to stop that. I still use it to self medicate. Thank you all for reading and feel free to post whatever you want here, good or bad. "

1rcor9,68,2013-11-24,My cancer has come back and going to ruin all of our plans.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1rcor9/my_cancer_has_come_back_and_going_to_ruin_all_of/,"So after a stressful week of waiting for test results and things to come back it's finally been confirmed. My cancer has come back. 
It still seems so unreal to me. I always knew that the possibility to get cancer again existed sometime in the future, but I didn't realize it would be so soon after the first time. 
I was first diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma in 2009 when I was 17. And, while I got through that mostly unscathed, it was still one of the hardest times of my life.

Fast forward to now. I bought plane tickets over a month ago before any symptoms even presented themselves. I was going to spend christmas with him. I was going to meet his parents and siblings and friends. We were going to meet up with some friends from his country who we met and got close with during our study abroad (friends who are also doing LDRs and meeting up for christmas). We were going to drive around different cities and see different places in the 3 weeks I would have been there. We booked the same flight back to New York together, seats right next to each other. He let me get the window seat since he knows I love watching take off and landing. He would come and finally meet my family and friends and everything. He would see snow for the first time. He would have a blast practicing speaking German with my sister-in-law. We would look for an apartment together since he just got an internship in Manhattan for the next 6 months. 

Everything was supposed to be perfect.

Then this cancer just appeared out of nowhere and I know it's going to ruin everything. The diagnosis is so new we still haven't talked about treatment yet. But, if it's anything like the last time it will be a grueling combo of chemotherapy and radiation that goes on for months, maybe even a year or longer. It will be something that takes me from the relatively healthy, energetic person I am now and turn me into a weak, sickly little thing. 

Though I haven't spoken with my doctor yet about traveling, I imagine that I wont be able to make the trip we've been planning. I imagine that since I'll probably start treatment right before I would leave for Mexico and it will probably be too risky for me to go there for 1 weeks, let alone 3. Even if I can go, it wont be the same. Everyone's first impression of me wont be natural. It will be one of empathy, pity, sadness. Trust me, I know how this is. I've dealt with cancer before and I know how people react and how they act around you and how they treat you. Sometimes its subtle, but I can still pick up on it. This meeting of his friends and family will never be what we imagined it. I was looking forward to it so much. I've met his parents on skype a few times and they seem so sweet. How can I go to their house this christmas and burden the, with my sickness and with pretending that things are okay and normal? (and this is all assuming I can even go)

At least he'll still be coming here no matter what, since he has this internship position. But that means instead of having fun he'll be burdened with seeing me at my sickest. He'll be burdened with making sure I'm well and coming to appointments with me. He'll be burdened with my overall wellbeing. We probably wont be able to get an apartment together. I'll have to stay home with my parents who will want to keep an extra eye on me to make sure I'm healthy. He claims that all of this is okay, that we'll get through it and he'll be with me 100% of the way. But I hate doing this to him. I hate that he got a position in my country to be closer to me and spend time with me and do fun things with me and now he'll have to del with this. I hate that he's going to come here and my being sick is going to ruin his whole 6 months. Six months that would have been really fun and amazing, but will now be stressful and shitty.

Ughh. I'm sorry I'm unloading this on you guys. I just truly can't believe this is happening. I cant believe I have cancer, again. I can't believe all of my plans are going to be so seriously fucked. I just want to see him and be with him and spend the holidays with him. I don't want to be sick. idk, I'm just all over the place having a one-woman pity party. This just sucks a whole bunch :/

A few years ago, I was in law school. Although I had a sufficient GPA and LSAT score to attend a prestigious and high-ranked law school, I chose instead to save $150,000 in tuition, and to attend a reputable (top 50) local and less prestigious law school.

After completing my second year of law school, I interned at a law firm during the summer along with a couple other law students. One particular intern, we'll call her Asswipe, was a totally arrogant, stuck-up, pompous, pretentious bitch. She had just finished her first year at the prestigious [redacted] law school, which, as you may know, is an outstanding school, with an excellent history and a great deal of prestige (it is consistently ranked in the top 14 law schools in the nation).

I have nothing but respect for that institution, but this girl was just a biyatch. Every single day during my internship she would emphasize how superior she thought she was because she went to a fancier school. Every. Fucking. Day. She would constantly try to undermine me and second guess me (even though I had twice her legal education and practical experience). Any opportunity she had to attempt to assert her supposed superiority, she jumped on it. Annoying as hell.

I shrugged it off at first because, hey, some people are dickheads, but her shit went on for months. I was glad when that internship was over. Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with her ever since, but I haven't forgotten how much of a total biznatch she was.

Anyway, life goes on, even after surviving douchenozzle co-workers. I successfully finished my third year of law school and graduated. Thanks to my earlier choice to go to a less expensive school, and thanks to frugality, my summer work and part time work, and my wife's full-time work, I was very fortunate to graduate with less than $40,000 in student loans. I spent the summer after graduation studying for the bar exam, and then I worked part time contract gigs until the bar results several months later, and I passed! I started a small firm with a law school buddy, and I paid off all of my debts within a year. Things are going well. My firm is small, and I'm admittedly not making the big bucks yet, but I'm turning a profit, growing, and having a lot of fun. Life is good. I'm living well.

Oh, yeah, Asswipe . . . what ever happened to her?

Well, she graduated with over $150,000 in debt. Not a big deal, especially if one hails from a such a prestigious law school, right? I mean law firms will practically be begging you to even consider letting them hire you for that six figure salary. Perhaps. But you need to pass the bar first.

Asswipe didn't pass the bar exam, that stupid (literally) wenchhole.

How do I know? I simply checked her state's bar passage list available to the public online. Her name was not on the list.

Asswipe, with all of her prestige and superiority and condescension, is now unemployed, unemployable (at least as an attorney), and racked with at least $150,000 of student loan debt.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!

FUCK YOU, ASSWIPE!!!!!! FUCK YOU!!!!!!

I have resisted the temptation to contact her to let her know that I know she failed. Instead, I've chosen to live well and enjoy my hard-earned success while she enjoys her $150,000 of worthless prestige that accrues at 6.8% interest.

Fuck you, Asswipe.

My firm is small, and I'm admittedly not making the big bucks yet, but I'm turning a profit, growing, and having a lot of fun.  Life is good.  I'm living well. 

Oh, yeah, Asswipe . . . what ever happened to her?

Well, she graduated with over $150,000 in debt.  Not a big deal, especially if one hails from a such a prestigious law school, right?  I mean law firms will practically be begging you to even consider letting them hire you for that six figure salary.  Perhaps.  *But you need to pass the bar first.*  

Asswipe didn't pass the bar exam, that stupid (literally) wenchhole.  

How do I know?  I simply checked her state's bar passage list available to the public online.  *Her name was not on the list.*

Asswipe, with all of her prestige and superiority and condescension, is now unemployed, unemployable (at least as an attorney), and racked with at least $150,000 of student loan debt. 

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!

FUCK YOU, ASSWIPE!!!!!!  FUCK YOU!!!!!!

I have resisted the temptation to contact her to let her know that I know she failed.  Instead, I've chosen to live well and enjoy my hard-earned success while she enjoys her $150,000 of worthless prestige that accrues at 6.8% interest.  

Fuck you, Asswipe.

1rcexq,5,2013-11-24,I am so happy right now!,OlgaY,beyondthebump,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1rcexq/i_am_so_happy_right_now/,"Hey fellow ex-bumpers! 

I have been reading for a few days in this subreddit and finally decided to post. My son was born September 3rd this year, but that's not were I wanted my story to begin. It's a wall of text and I am not even sure what I am looking for.

My SO and I had a very rough 2012 and we hoped 2013 would be better. We had just moved to a new city after some unlucky things had happened. We didn't have any money left, we have been ripped off by stupid decicions, stupid people and some bad luck alltogether. So we were trying our best to stay sane (I failed) and find our way back on our feet. 

It didn't go so well. My transition to the local university failed, my SOs jobhunt went ok as he found some promotion and I also had found an internship (unpaid) and a small job which provided us with just enough money to survive. As you can imagine, we were in a situation we never wanted to be. Plus, I wasn't able to make friends in the new city because I was in a very dark place emotionally due to the stress. I felt pretty lonely, exhausted from two jobs and stressed out about the fact that we struggled financially. 

Then there was that positive pregnancy test. OH GOD NO. This year was supposed to be perfect. This year was supposed to be all sunshine, fun and happiness. NOT NOW. I freaked out - and to be honest, reddit, I seriously considered abortion. Luckily for us you can only get an abortion after counceling and thinking things over for at least 3 days in Germany. My SO was so supportive of me - he never pressured any decision upon me, but I really wanted to know, what he wanted. Finally he admitted he'd actually love to go through it. To being a daddy. Needless to say, that was it for me.

So being pregnant added up to our relaxed situation. I felt constantly like crying, like I was failing life because I couldn't give my baby what it needed. I messed up my internship and at work too because I was so stressed out all the time. Plus, my SO lost two jobs and has been unemployed since May. He still has a hard time finding work. Additionally, I felt like I was left out: all my friends went partying, traveling the world, finishing their bachelor degrees and starting their masters (I'm 25) - That's not possible for me right now, and some of those aspects won't be in a long time. Yay, another part to feel depressed about while there's precious life growing inside me! Luckily all our friends and family chipped in and helped us out big time. We got financial support from wellfare and the government which we still have to come by. But it turns out to be enough: we're young and have never had a lot of money to spend. We started to really appreciate the German system. Our midwife was a great help, too. 

I was so scared all the time that I couldn't handle it all. That a baby on top of all that mess would be too much. Don't babies cry all the time, puke and shit and don't let you sleep?! I knew NOTHING about babies, even though I was majoring in Pedagogy (oh the irony). 

September 3rd. It was a long procedure, I was in labour for 10 hours in a birthing-center (Geburtshaus) with no medications. And finally there he was. So tiny. So curious. So *perfect*. I'm tearing up right now. 

Reddit, he really IS perfect. After everything we were going through I was blessed with the perfct baby. He laughs a lot, he sleeps well, he learns so fast. While I still feel like I'm missing out on all the fun things you do in your 20s, I couldn't be happier. Sure he cries sometimes and there are times he refuses to fall asleep at nighttime, but it's rare. And compared to all the stories I hear my son is definitely ""beginners""-level. Parents tell me they are jealous of how uncomplicated he is. If they knew! Would they take the WHOLE package? I have never felt so much love and joy towards anything. I'm thankful and optimistic the rest of the situation will turn out fine too. I will find friends. My SO will find a job. And I will go back to studying and finish my bachelor. 

Thank you for reading!

The following is adapted from ""The Tightwad Gazette III""  http://www.amazon.com/The-Tightwad-Gazette-III-Alternative/dp/0679777660

1.  Can we do without it?
2.  Does it do more than required?
3.  Does it cost more than it's worth?
4.  Can we do what it does with things we already have?
5.  How often will we use it?
6.  Where will we store it?
7.  Will using it be more work than we're part to want to do?
8.  How many ways can we use it?
9.  Have we checked with people who own one and with consumer ratings?
10.  Would I be smarter to resist and put the money toward another goal?

Stopping to think before making purchases has helped me to:
1.  Realize that my current winter coat is sufficient.
2.  Realize that my current wardrobe will, when combined different ways, be sufficient for my internship and teaching next semester.  
3.  Realize that I can invite friends over to watch a movie rented from RedBox instead of paying for theater tickets.  
4.  Realize that I can work at home and (actually) get more work done. 

What are some other ways that you have stopped impulse purchases?"

At first it was very convenient as we lived in the same apartment complex, but since she has graduated it is not as easy. We are not long distance, but the ease of access was nice.

She works 9 - 5 as a graphic designer at a marketing company and is in a complex situation as far as living in a couple different places (sleeps at grandma's, showers at sister's, eat's with whoever). This makes her schedule tight.

I manage a retail store at a high volume mall, I am full time student, and an intern at a recording studio. This means my hours are long and often are sporadic. 

We usually find a way to see each other a couple times a week. On the weekend, I try (usually successfully) to open my hours to spend the day with her. Unfortunately, she prefers to go to the city to drink and party. This is something that 1. I can't do being a 20 year old and 2. I don't want to do seeing as I'm not a social person. 

We have been recently hitting a lot of roadblocks. Staying in on a saturday night while my girlfriend cuts off contact and drinks in the city with people I don't know is a recipe for a lot of anxiety. I've told her this yet she insists it is how she has fun. 

I have come to the conclusion that I am not living up to her expectations. She would rather go out then be with her boyfriend on time he requested off for her. The amount of times we have sex has dropped significantly and 2 of the 3 times this month, she has fallen asleep during sex. 

How do I talk to her about this without it becoming confrontational? I want to fix this, seeing as I have mentioned breaking up and she does not want that option. She wants to be with me, I know this to be true. I just don't know how to fix our situation

I have discovered some new aspects of my life I never knew existed.

I am J.H. the fourth. My great-grandfather was from Russia and made a lot of money with a family business. I was born in Pennsylvania. 

My mother is German, her grandmother was from Germany. My mom was born in Florida. My parents met in France (how cliche), but not in a romantic way. My father was in his late twenties and my mother was in her early twenties. My father is in the armed forces and when he wasn't deployed he was doing business, so that's why he was in France. My mom was just in France visiting family. My dad was sitting at a cafe having lunch before a business meeting and he saw my mom making out with her then boyfriend, who was drunk. He slapped her and my dad got up and told him to leave her alone. There was a fight my dad eventually won, and he had to cancel his meeting. My mom also called the cops on him and they all spent the night in jail together. My mom was so mad, and as soon as they were released (her then now ex boyfriend had to stay) she went off on my dad. My dad was a smooth operator though, she doesn't know how but he got her to have lunch with him and then they just hit it off.

Fast forward, they're married and in Russia, my mom is pregnant. Here's where things get fucked up. My mom is pregnant with me and my twin brother. According to my dad's side of the family, you can only have one boy. My mom and dad moved to Pennsylvania because that's where my aunt lived (she was married and ended up having a son about 4 years ago before she died a bit after, so it was just my uncle and cousin). My mom has us both but the tradition still stays, my brother (T.H.) is put up for adoption. They had my sister a couple years later.

I grew up my whole life not knowing I had a brother. My mother died two years ago (she was diabetic and would rather live a Hedonistic lifestyle than take care of herself). I have a step-dad who had two sons and a daughter with my mom but I don't see them much. My dad retired from the armed forces and moved back to Russia a couple years earlier. I'd been living with my friends and my sister still lives in England with her boyfriend. She wants no part in our family but still keeps in touch with me. 

Now my life was kind of hard. I was homeless for a week, I was a ""scene"" kid in high school (lol), and the city I lived in wasn't exactly the safest. I got into some fights and had a lot of sex and almost got shot once. Anyway, I've had a few jobs (barista, cashier). I moved in with my uncle after my mom died but he ended up hanging himself after I graduated so I've been raising my cousin. I lived with my dad for a bit and took online college classes and then I moved to Florida with my grandmother (mom's side) and am interning at a CVS to be a pharmacist (and still taking college classes online). 

Several months ago my grandmother, a closeminded Catholic, kicked me out of her house because I am gay. So now I live with a friend and her family and am getting ready to move to New York to live with my boyfriend after my internship. I'm still raising my cousin. My grandmother called me a bit after she kicked me out to tell me about my brother. I told my sister about it and she looked into it. I told my dad and he claimed he didn't know. 

My sister eventually found T.H. after a long search, and we found out he still lives in Pennsylvania, and after a Skype session with her he agreed to come down to meet me. My sister has bought a plane ticket to come here and meet him too. I've seen pictures of him and he looks like me, but with longer and lighter hair, and his eyes have light brown in them (mine are pale green). I haven't talked to him yet though, I haven't been able to bring myself to it yet. 

When I turn 21 I will inherit half a million dollars, and even though my brother was never part of our family, he will too. My dad claims to know nothing about my brother, yet my brother is also inheriting money from my family? Yeah, that's not suspicious and obvlous. My sister gets nothing because she is a female. My family is pretty fucked up.

Anyway, I'm going to be meeting my brother in a month. I get so nervous thinking about it I physically shake. I've had a brother this whole time I've never known. Someone who looks just like me running around. I'm also excited, Reddit. I can't wait to compare our lives and everything. I feel like he had the better life to be honest. 

So thanks for reading, I just really needed to get all this off my chest.

tl;dr: Had a fucked up life and a twin brother I never knew about, family is fucked up too. Needed to tell Reddit my story."
1rg82n,5,2013-11-25,Really torn about the future.,NightBane,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rg82n/really_torn_about_the_future/,"Hello, all.

I'm writing this because I'm confused, and I need help. I would express this to my friends, but they would think that I'm doing this for the attention. So, here I am, posting this here.

I'm 23 years old. But I've already hit a point in time where it feels like I've hit a mid life crisis. Let me put into perspective that I'm grossly anti-social, save for the occasional LAN party that I go to every month.

I'm worried and sad because I'm failing two of my courses and the semester is almost over. So I'm struggling with feelings that I feel that I can't do it. I need to stick to something to get ahead. I need to do something, and this is it. I don't want to fail, but I'm doing the best I can to stay afloat.

I feel like I'm learning so little compared to the other students. Where others are getting great marks on quizzes, I'm failing all major tests and it's killing me. I'm probably not even going to pass.

The fact that I'm very lonely doesn't help this feeling either. I'm very paranoid of my friends, and what they think of me. I know I'm not the best friend because of how quiet I am or how little I can relate to people, but I try.

It's funny, only a month ago I was happy about getting an internship, and the next I'm suffering from suicidal thoughts because of school marks and struggling with classes.

I feel like talking to my friends would only hurt me more because there's something that keeps me from opening up. I feel the people that would know this would cut me out completely. It has happened before. But there's a void there that refuses me to relate or talk to anyone normally anymore.

A long time ago, I had a relationship that I've never been able to recover from. I was truly happy and I loved her so much, too much. When she broke it from me, I haven't felt the same about anyone else since.

It's.. Difficult.

My pain is causing me to drive myself away from others because I feel so deviated and distraught that I don't know what to do. I feel like a void has drifted between everyone I know and talk to and love. I feel that if I failed these classes this would be my breaking point. My life is looking very dismal right now, and I need help."

I need a filter that will give me dry cake, or as close to possible as I can get, while still have all of the fluid going to the fluid outlet. Right now, I either get all of the solids in the solid outlet, but all of the fluid goes with it.

Does anyone have any experience that could help?

1rf4go,2,2013-11-25,Creating a blog editor?,dmchale92,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1rf4go/creating_a_blog_editor/,"I had a job interview earlier this week that I thought was for an intern position. It appears to be for a full-time Software Engineer position. I made it through the first three interviews, and the president of the company said that if hired they want me to build a blog editor module using ExtJS. The final step is putting together a PPT presentation on the features of different open-source content management systems in regards to blog editing and presenting it on the 27th, if that goes well I'll start work on the 2nd.

Trouble is, I'm not sure where to start with this presentation, in terms of content and length, or how I'm going to proceed as the sole developer of a blog editor module if I do get the job. Is this something somebody relatively new to programming can reasonably accomplish?"
1rexyq,4,2013-11-25,"24, depressed since I've been about 14. Need to vent. Maybe advice.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1rexyq/24_depressed_since_ive_been_about_14_need_to_vent/,"I've been meaning to write something like this for a long time. I've told about this to another person, though I doubt that he will be able to help me. I think no one will, because my depression stems from my bodily issues, and I can’t get over them, which is why it will never go away.

I’ve been balding since I was 14. At first I thought that shedding at this age is normal, my female barber told me the same thing. I knew about grandfather on my mother’s side who also went bald, so no reason to be upset about this since it’s barely in my control, right? When my hair loss progressed I started feeling really insecure about my image, seeing as my male peers had heads full of hair or more “gracious” balding pattern (I have “horseshoe” type).

I’ve started researching online treatments for male pattern baldness, tried those less expensive, which obviously didn’t help much. I couldn’t afford those more expensive. At this point I’ve started to research on how to compensate my lack of hair. I’ve found several methods:

1. Hit the gym. Now a little bit about my body. I’m approximately 180cm and 60kg. I’ve tried eating a lot. Doing programs mostly found on the internet. Once again, I don’t have a lot of money, which is why I can’t afford any of those fancy workout enhancers. Now instead of flat chest I have some muscles defined, but still weight as much as before.

2. Grow a manly beard, mustache (insert facial hair type). Women dig beards. Easy to say for someone who can actually grow them. At my age a miserable soul patch and virgin mustache is all I can get.

3. Embrace who you are and whatever hand you’ve been dealt. I just can’t do it. 

I have psoriasis. Anyone who has been afflicted with this devastating condition knows the implications. It wouldn’t be much of a problem if it were present somewhere on my body, where it couldn’t be seen. Unfortunately I have it on my scalp. At this point it’s almost entirely covered in red patches and scars, It’s gone so bad that now it’s directly below my hairline. In conjunction with my balding, it looks terrible.

My head has a very unpleasing shape. I have some birthmarks all around my face. To say I'm unsymmetrical and unatractive would be a grave understatement. 

I may have some underlying blood disease. I seem to have strange, bleeding and itching rash on my body, bleeding gums and nose. I know I should probably have it checked out, but I can’t bring myself to do it. Since so much is already inherently wrong with my body, what’s the point?

I can’t seem to find a decent job. Paid internships are all I can get. I blame my appearance, but my depression contributes too. I have suicidal thoughts, though I’ve never acted on them, and I don’t plan to do that in my near future. I don’t take any pills and I don’t harm myself. I do know however, that if that’s how my life will look like for the rest of my days, I will definitely end my own life. It just pains me to see young, attractive people falling in love, forming new friendships, getting good jobs, enjoying their lives. I don’t enjoy mine. I think I never will.

I suck with women and as a result 21 years of my life I've been single and alone.  One reason why I have never had a girlfriend is my lack of social skills.  With those lack of social skills I also have no friends either. 

I see shit on reddit like /r/gonewild, /r/realgirls, and /r/happygirls and it just pisses me of and makes me sad at the same time that I will probably never experience that.  The feeling of having someone there by my side.  The thrill and enjoyment of sex.  The fun of having your other half there.

I used to flip shit on craigslist until I was forced out of the market due to so many people doing it.  I checked back in on it today and apparently one fucker that flagged my ads all the time has gotten to the point where he's making 6k a fucking month.  He brags about that shit on youtube.  What. The. Fuck.  I barely made a grand in 4 months of that shit. 

School isn't doing so hot.  I may have had a chance at an internship interview but I need money to pay bills and I would have had to quit my current job to pick it up.  College is supposed to be the time of your life before you sell your soul to a career and have no fun at all.   

Life is just grinding to a halt.  I'll probably end up a poorfag scraping by paycheck to paycheck.  Masturbating and cruising 4chan and reddit for hours on end. 

Its cold as fuck these days too.  I wake up pissed off.  I get out of the shower pissed off.  I get pissed off sitting in a cold car on the way to work.  Fuck the cold.  Fuck this shit.

End of summer of 2012, a fellow intern sexually assaulted me while we were drunk, and I blamed myself not fighting him with more than just words. The guilt ate me up. I told my then-boyfriend a week later that I cheated on him. He broke up with me, and I accepted it. One-two punch to the heart.

I didn't tell anyone; I still blamed myself for first the cheating, then the break-up. But I needed to be around friends, and my friends meant to end senior year of college with consecutive days of alcohol. I drank and drank. I blacked out on the weekends and cried.

I was slutty. I needed to prove to myself that sex didn't matter, because my assailant said so while he played with my body. I wanted control again. I wanted to feel loved. I got a fuck buddy. I started falling for him. We ended it. Went out to bars with my friends. Still cried a lot. Got drunk and made out with friends of friends. Got drunk and flaunted my sexuality and pushed love away every time it came up. Drank some more to make it stop hurting.

Fuck. I'm so fucking sorry. I fucked your boyfriend last November. We were both so drunk. There's nothing else I would rather take back in my stupid fucking life but I can't and I'm so fucking sorry.

We were all friends since freshman year, but your boyfriend and I didn't talk the next four or five months. He hid on campus and in your apartment. I drifted away from you too. I was still unstable from the events of the summer. I thought it was his place to tell you, like I told my ex. He never told you. I knew what the right thing was, but I thought it would be right for him to tell and I didn't know what to do, so I swept it under the rug. I wrapped myself in alcohol and parties.

I started to get better. My wounds closed up. I started seeing someone who cared about me, and he wanted to know everything. I laid out all my baggage. He helped me stop drinking so much. He reminded me that I still had things to fix. My conviction grew, and I texted your boyfriend that you deserved to know. Begin massive text debate about blissful ignorance and being hurt by the truth/losing trust in the world. You were such a happy person. I'll admit that your boyfriend swayed me, but in the end either he was going to tell you, or I was. He wanted to be the one to tell.

That was in July. He planned for a long time. He finally told you yesterday (I wish it hadn't been so close to your birthday), and you called me today.

I know I'm a massive piece of shit. You can tell me all you want about how I'm not a good person. I've swallowed that and swallowed that for months. I've been there, I've lived it. You never deserved to be hurt like this. What I did was unfair to everyone, especially you. I sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I'm sorry I dared show my face to you afterward. But I still like to think that you would have rather known than not. I have no idea what your boyfriend told you yesterday, but at least you finally know that it happened. 

You can take all of our mutual friends. You can smear my name across the web. I figure it's justice. I want you to do whatever you have to to feel okay again. I'm so sorry.

Readers, please be kind.

(very long),Internally_Combusted,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rdtvx/i23_m_wasam_casually_pursuing_a_girl21_f_when_my/,"I'll start off with a bit of background. I was working in a deli while finishing up my undergrad when I started dating a co-worker. Our relationship was a whirlwind of love and everything was perfect. After a little over a year of dating I graduated, got a great job, we moved in together and we got engaged in June of 2012. Everything was going so well. We got a long fantastically, agreed on all of the big life decisions (kids, finances, life goals, etc). We also had great communication and had a healthy amount of conflict that was generally talked out without escalating very much. 

Unfortunately, in a very short amount of time she spiraled into a deep depression. I had experience with depression as a S/O from a previous gf and I had learned a lot about how to deal with it. I tried everything to support her for six months but she adamantly refused to get any real help to deal with the depression outside of trying to go out and stay busy with friends which never worked for more than just a temporary distraction. Our sex life completely disappeared and she showed me very little to no affection at all for the entire six months which obviously takes its toll. 

It became clear to me in early January that she had no desire to be in the relationship anymore but felt to guilty to break it off because she had really pushed to get engaged (to be clear I asked her because I wanted to get married and was truly ready but she made it clear that that is what she desired). I confronted her one night when I got home from work and told her I thought she didn't want to be with me anymore and that I had no intentions of trapping her in a relationship because she felt guilty for wanting to leave. There was a lot of crying on both sides but at the end of the night we were no longer together. She was still not making very much money at the time and really had no where to go due to her parent's being in the middle of a home renovation so I told her she could stay for a while to get back on her feet. Ironically enough, she started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and actually started dealing with her depression during this time. This continued for another 6 months of which we were basically roommates that never saw each other. It was torturous and I was unable to move on so I confronted her again and told her I needed her to move out because I couldn't mentally handle it anymore. She didn't put up a fight and worked with her parents who helped her find and pay for a place within a few weeks. This was in July of this year. 

Shortly after she moved out I had a rebound that lasted for about a month and was a lot of fun. It was great for my confidence and I started getting my personal life back together as well as getting recruited by the most prestigious firm in my industry. I was on top of the world.

In January after my ex and I had broken up but were still living together a very attractive girl (We'll call her S) had started interning where I was working. I was assigned to help S learn and review her work. We clicked immediately. S, like me, is naturally flirtatious and I ate up the attention because it was just what I needed. It never went anywhere beyond the workplace flirting. I was in no place, emotionally, to even casually date someone and the nature of our working relationship would have made it highly inappropriate. After her time as an intern was over I didn't keep in touch.

I should also mention that I went back for my masters in January of 2013. Well I started my summer classes in June and, sure enough, S was in one of my classes. We started talking again and over the course of the Semester began to hang out as friends. We had a lot of fun together and we are both always looking for spontaneous adventure. I was very attracted to her but she had a few red flags that I was still evaluating so I hadn't made a move. S is very driven, smart, and has a very strong personality with just the right amount of mischief. These are all things I am very attracted to. However, she has also been spoiled by her parents, shows signs of being manipulative, and is quite materialistic. The manipulation and materialism are pretty much deal breakers for me in the long-term but I was just looking for something casual and fun. Through various conversations S had also made it clear that she was not looking for any kind of committed relationship so I decided to feel it out further and see what would happen. Things were moving along nicely and I decided I was going to move in one weekend. That is until I get a text from out of nowhere from my ex that Friday...

She texted me to apologize for how everything ended and thank me for supporting her unconditionally and just being a good man through it all. I told her there was no need to apologize and that sometimes circumstances are just out of our control. I left it at that thinking that she was drunk or something. The next day I got a follow up text saying that she was wondering if we could still be friends and if I wanted to get coffee on Sunday. I gave some thought to whether this would be a good idea or not and decided that I would be fine to hang out with her. We met up for coffee and it felt like old times. It wasn't awkward at all. She seemed a lot happier than I had seen her in a long time. We talked about how our families were doing and began catching up on our own lives. I casually mentioned that I had a date later that night and she didn't skip a beat in the conversation. We ended up heading to a brewery and the night became a lot more flirtatious. Long story short I ended up canceling on S and sleeping with my ex that night. Honestly, it was incredible and there were some old feelings that surfaced. We both agreed that we were not getting back together right then and we were just going to start out as friends again. 

I also felt terrible for cancelling on S so I told her that my ex had come back in the picture and that my ex and I had needed to talk about some things and that is why I cancelled (I left out that we slept together). I also told her that we weren't back together but I wasn't sure what was happening exactly and that I didn't have any intentions of leading her on while I figured this out. S took this in stride and said we should just continue being friends for now. I began to hang out with my ex quite a bit lately. It has been strictly as friends and we have not slept together again. I have also been hanging out with S and it is clear she is sending me sexual signals, as if to say ""You can have me if you want to."" without putting too much pressure on it. 

This leads me to my dilemma. Part of me wants to see what can come of me and my ex given a little time because I know she is compatible for the long term. However, I am also unsure if anything will happen with my ex because she isn't giving me any additional signs that lead in that direction. The other part of me just says, ""Fuck it, have fun with S for now and just see where it takes you."" I don't know what to do and I just want to have some outside perspective to bring clarity to my thoughts.

**tl;dr**: Casually pursuing a girl (we'll call her S) that I like but am unsure of dating when my ex-fiance contacts me. My ex and I  have a wild night followed by an understanding that we are just friends and now I am not sure whether I should continue pursuing S or try to work through things with my ex-fiance."

I'm 18 years old, turning 19 tomorrow (no party for obvious reasons). The time I spend not at work as an IT intern is spent alone in my room. Whenever I'm around people I feel very uncomfortable/ try to avoid people and I get very nervous and sometimes even black out in conversation. But when I'm alone I just want to be around someone. I don't really have any friends, just a few acquaintances. Apart from pretty terrible anxiety I also have mild autism. not that bad, it just makes it even harder to talk to people. I can deal with having no friends, but goddamnit I want a bf... How the hell is someone like me ever supposed to find someone who wants to deal with a social miracle like me? I feel so hopeless... The furthest I got was installing one of those gay dating apps, but I was too scared to upload my picture so I removed the app.

Can anyone help me? I don't want to be alone"

1rilht,5,2013-11-26,[UPDATE] My girlfriend (21F) wants to move in with me (21M) after we graduate from college. I don’t think I’m ready.,capeofhorn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1rilht/update_my_girlfriend_21f_wants_to_move_in_with_me/,"From my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qvtge/my_girlfriend_21f_wants_to_move_in_with_me_21m/): Girlfriend of 1.5 years wants to live together after se graduate from college. I love and care about her, but I don't think I'm ready yet.

UPDATE: So I decided to tell my girlfriend how I felt about our plans after graduation. 

We previously talked about our future, and I agreed on impulse that we should live together (a mistake that's biting me hard in the ass). 

A few weeks went by, and I became more uncomfortable with the idea. I wasn’t ready to move in with her because I’m not sure where I’ll be after my summer internship ends. Meanwhile, she's started looking for jobs in various cities where I've applied. 

To me, she’s ready to follow me anywhere. From my previous post, I mentioned her apartment lease in our college town ends in July. After that, she can go anywhere. 

So I decided to talk to her about this over the weekend. I started the conversation, saying it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to live together right out college. She was not happy about it. Her reaction made me panic, and I couldn't articulate my thoughts well. This led to an uncomfortable conversation that ruined our night. 

Now, she's angry with me and thinks this is the beginning of a breakup, which is not the case. 

I still love her, but I’m not ready to make plans to move in together because I don’t know what’s going to happen after the summer. I’ve talked to several people about this, and they said I should let her know that I’m not comfortable. 

My concern is how do I address her willingness to move wherever I find a job? I want to have my own place for a bit and be comfortable with supporting myself (without my parents) before I live with my girlfriend. I don’t want to make the mistake of moving in with her too soon and resenting her. 

I’m heading to her apartment later this afternoon for a face-to-face conversation. Any suggestions on how I can fix the situation as best as possible would be awesome. 

**tl;dr**: I told my girlfriend I didn’t think it would be a good idea for us to live together right after graduation. She’s not happy about it and thinks this is a breakup waiting to happen. I’m going to meet with her this evening to talk about it. "

1rifqt,5,2013-11-26,"Bombing Step 2 NBMEs after prepping for a long time, need help modifying my study schedule, any advice would be golden",bombingstep2nbmes,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1rifqt/bombing_step_2_nbmes_after_prepping_for_a_long/,"Hi guys,

So I am really in bad shape, and I am not sure what to do. I actually post on here on a semi-regular basis, but I am so embarrassed I created a throwaway account for my problem. I recently took 2 NBMEs (Form 6 and Form 2) and got the lowest score possible on both: 10/600. The reason I feel so bad is because I have been prepping for about a year and a half, so obviously I am doing something wrong. 

I cancelled my exam and pushed it back about 6 months. I'll give you guys a breakdown of exactly what's going on, hopefully somebody can help me figure out what's going on.

Background:
I am an IMG who basically is starting from ground zero. I had awful teachers and I never read reference books. I just memorized what I needed to get through. Stupidity in hindsight, but that's the situation I am in now, I 100% blame myself and I am trying to fix the situation as best as possible now. Also, I am taking CK before Step 1, which I thought would be a smart move at time. 

Timeline:
-I took an online Kaplan CK course for 4 months and went from about 25% on their initial evaluations (shitty I know), to hitting a little over 50% on their final exam. 65% is the marker they set to get around a 220 on CK.

-I then had an internship at my home school for a year, I brought all my Kaplan texts and read my them during my rotations. We don't really do anything during our intern year, just a lot of paperwork, so I always would whip out my book during the downtimes and tried to match any cases I saw with my textbook. I was a really bad student during medical school, I didn't know shit, but during my internship I was able to answer most of the questions the teachers asked because I had a decent base from my course, so my confidence level was pretty high at the time. 

-I finished about half of UWorld during the second half of my internship. I did the other half a couple months after my internship. My average is about 35-40% on my first round. I believe 65% means your in good shape.

-Took a Form 6 with extended feedback and got 10/600. That broke down to about 88 questions right and 100 questions wrong out of 188.

-Freaked out and took a 1 month DIT course. I thought it was very beneficial at the time. Then I reread all the ""Education Objectives"" for all the UWorld questions which took about 3 weeks. While rereading the education objectives, I put them in Anki and created about 3000 cards, along with retyping all the quizzes from DIT into a question format. Reviewed them for about a month.

-Took Form 2 and got 10/600 again! This is with about a 2 month gap in between each form. I didn't bother to Google the answers, so I don't know my actual breakdown. This was about 2 weeks ago. I got really down, cancelled my exam, and I am now piecing my life back together to get my shit back together. I was studying about 7 hours/day for the last 3 months, didn't touch a book for about a week after my NBME, and then slowly I am up to 4 hours a day now trying to get back up to speed. 

-So right now I have about 3 months before my CK live course starts. I am rewatching videos, matching the subsection with UWorld questions and starting Kaplan QBank brand new. I know Kaplan wasn't helping me beforehand, but it's the best I can think off to remedy my situation. I also used Firecracker when it was in beta during my intern year, finished half of it, and cancelled my account afterwards. I am restarting it again, the spaced algorithm helped me retained a ton of info, hopefully that will help.

My biggest problems:
-I am having issues with being able to evaluate myself in terms of assessments, I don't know if the NBMEs are super valid, or not. These forms were written in 2006, so they are pretty old, I don't know how much that contributes to my lack of scoring well.

-I have no Step 1 base, which means I look up a lot of stuff on Wikipedia and piece things out and the material in Kaplan is detailed enough to get you through CK. I didn't think it was a problem, until I started bombing my NBMEs, now having second thoughts. I'll still finish up CK since I am in the middle of it. At the beginning of my prep, I thought this would be a great strategy to get through CK and then have a running start for studying for Step 1 to somewhat compensate for not studying like a normal medical student previously.

Sorry for the long post. All my older friends from my school say they just studied UWorld for 2 months and got a 230, which may be true since they finished Step 1, but they are equally dumb so I doubt it. Some of them didn't even match anywhere, so they obviously are the wrong people to talk to. I am out of options, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR I bombed 2 NBMEs after studying for 1.5 years, need advice on what to do"

check this out.

this story does not start out about you and i, but it ends there in a big way. 

driving back from an long-ago flings's place in San Antonio in a beat up old tacoma, i was going over the great time that we had over the weekend. i had loaded up some music and was really cruising that old familiar stretch of 37. we had spent a day watching three god-like West Coast grunge and alternative bands of the era. to say the least, it was a great show. to expound, she had her tits painted for $10 (who the fuck charges for this service i have no idea) and, like many of the women in the south Texas heat that day, were running around topless in a metalhead stoner's paradise of all the different kinds of booze and smoke only a gigantic party like that could provide. it had been a while since i had run around all day with a friggin' chub like that.

my head was still reeling from the drugs, my ears still ringing from the music a whole day later. i was on a cloud, a new level, right? oh yeah. it was great. our second awesome meeting over the period of a few weeks with much chatter on the phone between. excitement, planning, probing for personality. 

its a drive from Corpus to that part of San Antonio, and i wasn't making much money to make it very often, but i was willing to eat a lot of Ramen to do it.

i had no idea that her father was a real estate tycoon and lived in the Dominion up on the north end of town. when i got to the street there was a huge gate with a guard. i told them where, they buzzed her up, and in i went. woohooo! nobody is stopping meee!!! haha! that was a great feeling itself. when i got to the gigantic door of this freaky castle of house and she let me in, and right away i was introduced to her insanely cagey parents who were extremely nice to me. these people really laughed at my cracks about them being loaded. she gave me the grand tour, from the back yard that would rival the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to a movie theater in the basement, the best part for me was when showed me her studio where she was drawing - get this - Mickey Fucking Mouse. i don't mean as a hobby. this chick was an art student at UCLA and intern at Universal Studios who could really fucking *art*. she told me but when i saw it in person she had to physically close my mouth for me.

i did one thing right by taking it slow for once. she was amazing and i am sure she was the best thing to ever happen to someone. she was someone that any man with eyes on earth would get jealous about, and she's probably been related to more than a couple of busted noses in that crazy hostile south Texas party lifestyle going on at the time. from what i remember, she had a pretty heart too, but nothing like the deadpan impact yours has made on mine. something was bothering me about her on that ride home and i just could put my finger on it. when i found out what that feeling was i nearly killed myself on the drive home that sweltering Sunday night.

i met her at a party. i wasn't always a guy who could do something like that. i had to genuinely apply my intellect to picking up women because i didn't have the looks and build to do it like alot of the other guys around me so easily. it took practice, patience, and perseverance. when i thought it paid off i was elated to have finally met someone. a real life of the party kind of girl who literally had it all. 

when i say ""do something like that"" i am probably giving myself a little too much credit. being an obnoxious party animal i love to have fun on the rocks, tell crazy stories, and do all your drugs and then some. make no mistake, she picked me because i would never have approached someone like her unless i was brimming with liquid courage. i am standing there telling some stupid story and she's just eating it up, laughing all the way through and really giving me that eye. i can't believe what i am watching as guys come up to her and she bats them away, telling me to ""please, go on!"".  later we are in a dark corner of the yard going at it as people are leaving the party. we close down the house on the couch even later with another couple watching movies, and pass out in each others arms without doing anything too risky. we exchanged numbers and what not, almost instantly making plans for a bash in San Antonio.

i went to work all month like that Cialis guy with eager anticipation of what awaited us at this huge concert. and when it was all over and i started back home, i had a psychological break going down the highway, crashing hard from a weekend of intense partying. why though? i'm a fucking trooper and i am having a mental problem right now? wtf? this is where it gets bad and relevant to you and i.

there i am watching the mile markers go by, welling up uncontrollably with one invasive thought running through my head after another.

there is no way in hell this chick will ever have anything to do with me because i had an STD. i haven't tested positive, and i don't have any symptoms, but somehow i know i have had way too much unprotected drunk sex not to have at least *something* lurking in my blood. this swam around in my head as i called myself out for being so stupid and irresponsible, impatient even, and incredibly wrong for not taking care of beforehand. i was young too. i felt like i lost it all. i felt like i could never be with someone like that, never, ever have a wonderful family, beautiful children, a real life with a real future because i had poison for blood. i felt like i had wasted my entire life on a couple hours with strippers in a cocaine induced trance. no - i knew it and this is why i was yelling ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" over and over to myself, shrieking the names of children that i had subconsciously picked out for that of my own future brood. i yelled so loud and for so long that by the time i got back to corpus i had no voice left whatsoever. i was psychologically destroying myself, beating myself to death with my own past, and could not make the flood of anger, frustration, and sheer rage and contempt for myself and all of humanity go away the entire ride home. i hated myself for even touching her, hated myself for being an egotistical asshole who thought a woman could never hurt me again.

it lasted for weeks. i was terrified of myself. that psychopath in me was in control again and i had no way of getting past him without getting in to be tested. i couldn't figure out how to come out and say that i was worried about this, so i finally snap and blow her off by completely scaring her away. i wrote her a nasty email with all kinds of things in it that a girl of her upbringing could never even begin to understand let alone think nicely of. ignore those calls, boy, you better ignore those calls boy or there will be hell to pay. except, i was already there. there was only one thing left to do and that was to go get tested to assess the damage, to figure out what my options would be for the rest of my life. that was the longest morning of my life. it was also kind of funny in retrospect. if you know something about me you know i've always got time for a joke.

the nurse, a woman and not bad looking either, told me to drop 'em and hold it out. she had this huge q-tip and i was cringing. i don't know why, force of habit when told to drop 'em by a woman, fuck i don't know, i start taking off my boots. i almost have my pants off when she turns around and asks what i am doing and that i only need to hold IT out, i don't need to get naked in there. nerves i guess. what a riot though.

two weeks of insomnia later i get a letter in the mail saying to go by the clinic for my results. i call them and demand an answer, and they say come in and they hang up. what am i gonna do? i go in. i wait. i look at people in the room with the same stupid and terrified look on their face as mine, and i wait. when the time comes... i am clean? FUCK ME RUNNING! i told that nurse i nearly kissed her and would have if it had been equally good news about something else not about unprotected sexual contact.. i mean, what in the fuck! i was prepared to move to Tibet and here i am with a new lease on life. i was kicking myself for chasing her off like that, but at the same time i was too happy and liberated to beat myself up any longer. i missed out on an opportunity of a lifetime in exchange for dealing with my own demons.

and 15 years later here i am, driving down those same south Texas highways under nearly the exact same goddamn circumstances, wondering what i'm going to have to prepare for this time. but its ok. i have been here before, and soon enough i'll know what i need to do. this is a big step in the aftermath of the tornadic lifestyle i've lived. this time, it's not my own doing that has me worried. its the doing of someone i loved and trusted. someone who has all that i hold dear in her possession.

its going to be hard for me not to fall on my knees when i see you for doing this with me. if i am clean, i am all yours, and we are going to live for the fulfillment of our happiness. if i am not, i don't know how i could look at you because i'm in love with the foundation we have if not who you are outright already. despite my dark early adulthood, i am a grown man now and i remember, and today try to live by, the things my west Texas country upbringing has taught me. i can't think for one second that there would be any other way for this to go. 

where i have failed you here is in that i should have put these pieces together sooner before i went out on that limb, and i fucking hate myself for it not thinking of it even though i knew in the back of my drugged up mind that i was forgetting something, something critical to the conversation. this is what drugs do to people. they confuse, hurt, anger, and ultimately destroy everyone around them. i can't believe this is happening all over again, but under such tragic circumstances that i have some really, really dark thoughts resurfacing from the old days. i can turn them off, i've done it before. the worst part is that even though i've been trounced by women in the past, i think i would have to tap into my psychotic tendencies in order to alleviate the burden that leaving you would place on my own heart. i wish i had something for you in that regard, but i don't right now and i am afraid that it's already happening. i think i'm already trying to push you away.

but not this time. please, please not this time... you have it all, everything i want in a woman and more. if you didn't i would still be milling about in here in the dark, ready for part four of my fucked up life to happen to me, instead of making it go out there and happen myself.

optimism is driving every breath i have right now. if ever there was a time to start getting religious, its now.

See you soon, *Nicole*.

1rhmxv,5,2013-11-26,"he sent me straight to hell for it, too",[deleted],UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1rhmxv/he_sent_me_straight_to_hell_for_it_too/,"YOU will want to read the rest of this one because its going to come up in a future conversation, like these wonderful letters have been, and it will ease tension knowing that some ground has been covered beforehand. the inevitability here for me is so palpable that i can do nothing else but key up another throwaway and spill it in hopes that you may find it some day soon. you were talking about things being hard to say for fear of rejection? 

check this out.

this story does not start out about you and i, but it ends there in a big way. 

driving back from an long-ago flings's place in San Antonio in a beat up old tacoma, i was going over the great time that we had over the weekend. i had loaded up some music and was really cruising that old familiar stretch of 37. we had spent a day watching three great bands: QOTSA, Audioslave, and finally - the best concert I've ever seen - Jane's Addiction. my god that was a great show. she had her tits painted for $10 and, like many of the women in the south texas heat that day, were running around topless in a metalhead stoner's paradise of all the different kinds of booze and smoke only a gigantic party like that could provide. it had been a while since i had run around all day with a friggin chub like that.

my head was still reeling from the drugs, my ears still ringing from the music a whole day later. i was on a cloud, a new level, right? oh yeah. it was great. our second awesome meeting over the period of a few weeks with much chatter on the phone inbetween. excitement, planning, probing for personality. 

its a drive from Corpus to that part of San Antonio, and i wasn't making much money to make it very often, but i was willing to eat a lot of ramen to do it.

i had no idea that her father was a real estate tycoon and lived in the Dominion up on the north end of town. when i got to the street there was a huge gate with a guard. i told them where, they buzzed her up, and in i went. woohooo! nobody is stopping meee!!! haha! that was a great feeling itself. i got to the door of this freaky castle of house and she let me in. right away i was introduced to her insanely cagey parents who were extremely nice to me and really laughed at my cracks about them being loaded. she showed me her studio where she was drawing - get this - mickey fucking mouse. i don't mean as a hobby. this chick was an art student at UCLA and intern at Universal Studios who could really fucking paint. she told me but when i saw it in person she had to physically close my mouth for me.

i did one thing right by taking it slow for once. she was amazing and i am sure she was the best thing to ever happen to someone. she was someone that any man with eyes on earth would get jealous about, and she's probably been related to more than a couple of busted noses in that crazy hostile south Texas party lifestyle going on at the time. from what i remember, she had a pretty heart too, but nothing like the deadpan impact yours has made on mine.

i met her at a party. i wasn't always a guy who could do something like that. it took practice, patience, and perseverence. when it paid off i was elated to have finally met someone. a real life of the party kind of girl who literally had it all. 

when i say ""do something like that"" im probably giving myself a little too much credit. im an obnoxious party animal and i love to have fun on the rocks. make no mistake, she picked me because i would never have approached someone like her unless i was filled to the brim with liquid courage. im standing there telling some stupid story and she's just eating it up, laughing all the way through and really giving me that eye. later we are in a dark corner of the yard going at it as people are leaving the party. we close down the house on the couch even later with another couple watching movies, and pass out in each others arms without doing anything too risky.

i went to work all month like that cialis guy with eager anticipation of what awaited us at the concert. and when it was all over and i started back home, i had a psychological break going down the highway, crashing hard from a weekend of intense partying. why though? i'm a fucking trooper and im having a mental problem right now? wtf? this is where it gets bad and relevant to you and i.

there i am watching the mile markers go by, welling up uncontrollably with one invasive thought running through my head after another:

there is no way in hell this chick will ever have anything to do with me because i had an STD. i haven't tested positive, and i don't have any symptoms, but somehow i know i have had way too much unprotected drunk sex not to have at least *something* lurking in my blood. this swam around in my head as i called myself out for being so stupid and irresponsible, impatient even, and incredibly wrong for not taking care of beforehand. i was young too. i felt like i lost it all. i felt like i could never be with someone like that, never, ever have a wonderful family, beautiful children, a real life with a real future because i had poison for blood. i felt like i had wasted my entire life on a couple hours with strippers in a cocaine induced tranced. no - i knew it and this is why i was yelling WHY, WHY, WHY over and over to myself. i yelled so loud and for so long that by the time i got back to corpus i had no voice left whatsoever. i was psychologically destroying myself, beating myself to death with my own past, and could not make the flood of anger, frustration, and sheer rage and contempt for myself and all of humanity go away the entire ride home.

i snap and blow her off by completely and utterly scaring her away. i wrote her a nasty email with all kinds of things in it that a girl of her upbringing could never even begin to understand let alone think nicely of. ignore those calls, boy, you better ignore those calls boy or there will be hell to pay. except, i was already there. there was only one thing left to do and that was to go get tested to assess the damage, to figure out what my options would be for the rest of my life. that was the longest morning of my life. it was also kind of funny in retrospect. if you know something about me you know i've always got time for a joke.

the nurse, a woman and not bad looking either, told me to drop 'em and hold it out. she had this huge q-tip and i was cringing. i don't know why, force of habit when told to drop 'em by a woman, fuck i dont know, i start taking off my boots. i almost have my pants off when she turns around and asks what i am doing and that i only need to hold IT out, i dont need to get naked in there. nerves i guess. what a riot though.

two weeks of insomnia later i get a letter in the mail saying to go by the clinic for my results. i call them and demand an answer, and they say come in and they hang up. what am i gonna do? i go in. i wait. i look at people in the room with the same terrified look on their face as mine, and i wait. when the time comes... im clean. praise the fucking lord. i mean, what in the fuck i was prepared to move to tibet and here i am with a new lease on life. i was kicking myself for chasing her off like that but at the same time i was too happy and liberated to beat myseful up any longer.

and 15 years later here i am, driving down those same highways, wondering what i'm going to have to prepare for this time. but its ok. ive been here before, and soon enough i'll know what i need to do. this is a big step in the aftermath of the tornadic lifestyle i've lived. this time, it's not my own doing that has me worried. its the doing of someone i loved and trusted. someone who has all that i hold dear in her posession.

its going to be hard for me not to fall on my knees when i see you for doing this with me. if im clean, im going to live for the fulfillment of our happiness. if im not, i don't know how i could look at you because i'm in love with the foundation we have if not who you are outright. despite my dark early adulthood, im a grown man now and i remember, and today try to live by, the things my west Texas country upbringing has taught me. i can't think for one second that there would be any other way for this to go.

if i'm clean, im yours. if i'm not, im so sorry, but i can never talk to you again and i should have put these pieces together sooner and i fucking hate myself for it. this is what drugs do to people. they confuse, hurt, anger, and ultimately destroy everyone around them. i can't believe this is happening all over again but under such tragic circumstances that i have some really, really dark thoughts resurfacing from the old days.

optimism is driving every breath i have right now. if ever there was a time to start getting religious, its now.

See you soon, *Nicole*.

I have taken two semesters of Java so I am not a beginner, but also not intermediate. 

Could anyone give me tips on where I can find some resources to review major topics? I know to practice my programming and I plan to do that on DailyProgrammer, but I am looking for some place I can review major topics like data structures, algorithms etc. without having to search everything up in my textbook.

Thanks"
1rhfp5,100,2013-11-26,"""Hello.""",PackinSteel,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1rhfp5/hello/,"A few years ago, I signed up and was trained as a volunteer for a suicide/crisis hotline. I originally did this because it counted as an internship, but after a season of being there for about 15 hours a week, I decided to stay and go in once a week. I enjoyed it. 

I took Sunday nights there, the third shift which was from 6 PM to Midnight. I'm not sure if all hotlines are the same, but the layout of mine went like this:

Basically, its a small apartment looking-room. You walk in and right in front of you is a small couch, a coffee table, and a TV. Past that is a desk facing a small window with the telephone (for the hotline) and a computer to use as a source of resources in case someone needs shelter or food. Mainly for people about to be homeless or sadly, most veterans who called. 

If you were to walk left of the 'living room' and the desk with the phone, you would be in the kitchen. Fridge, oven, coffee pot, table. Further down the hall leading away from the kitchen are the offices for the director and paid staff. 

When you worked a shift, you did it alone. Its just you and the phone. Usually during the week, the paid staff would be in their offices, but because I always did late shifts, it was only me. I didn't mind this as some nights would be 'slow' and I would simply watch some TV, cook, read, and use the computer. Of course when the phone rang, I was down to business. 

The office itself was a 'secret' room in a doctors office. Because it's a hotline for crisis', confidentiality is huge. I could never tell anyone the address of the place or any caller's actual first name. The building was small, one floor and we were at the end of the hall which looked like the door to a janitor's closet. 

Anyway, yeah, I didn't mind being here. I liked helping and it was nice to sort of seclude myself for a little. 

One night I get in and there's a note on the desk from last night. ""Private number calling every hour on the hour. Doesn't say anything but hangs up. Just letting you know, - Deb""

We have a caller ID set up only because if someone calls and it's a super serious situation where we have to call the police, we have a number to use. Sometimes I would have to call someone back and it was helpful to have this on hand. 

I turn on the TV, start a pot of coffee when the phone rings. I walk over to look at the ID and there it is: ""PRIVATE""

""Crisis Hotline. How can I help you?""

*click*

Whatever. Wouldn't be the first time someone called privately and hung up. 

7 PM. I'm on Facebook and talking to some friends. Phone rings and I glance over. ""PRIVATE""- I sigh, knowing what this is. 

""Crisis Hotline. How can-"" and someone clears their throat so loud that it cuts me off. Silence. I say, ""Hello?""- *click*- Now I'm kinda annoyed. 

8PM. Watching TV, eating a snack and there it is. Phone rings. PRIVATE. 

Answer with my usual greeting. The person has not hung up yet, but no one is talking. ""Hello? Can I help you?""

He makes some noise, like a soft grunt. Hangs up. Little freaked out now, as I glance out the window and its dark. This place was in the middle of nowhere, among the woods, no lights in the parking lot, and a small gas station across the street that I could never tell if it was closed for good. 

9PM. Same damn thing. Calls, I answer, he makes some noise, and hangs up. The persistence of this is kinda creeping me out and my imagination is a little wild now. 

Before 10 PM hits, I look at my call files and laugh to myself about how this guy is the ONLY person calling me tonight. Every shift requires you keep a call log: Write down the type of call (silence or hang ups), Name (if you got one), the time they called and hung up, and a description. 

And here's mine: Silence/PRIVATE/Hangs up before speaking. Across the board. 

10 PM. PRIVATE. I let it ring a few more times before I finally answer. 

""Crisis Hotline. How can I help you?""

""Hello."" *click*

Now, I can't explain the tone of this voice and I hope I'm not making it sound silly. But it was a very deep, raspy, ""HEL-LO"". Smokers voice, I guess. It just spooked me because it was so loud. Why the fuck is this guy calling like this. 

11 PM. On the dot. I refuse to answer, but we don't have an answering machine to this phone so it rings FOREVER. I pick it up and hang up because my mind is racing for no real reason. I don't want to know what happens next. The idea of how secluded this place is, the station across the street, I'm the ONLY car in the parking lot, and the hallway leading out of this place feels like its a mile long. Phone rings again. PRIVATE. I answer. 

Before I can even say anything, ""HEL-LO"" *click*- My heart is pounding. I hate the sound of this dude's voice. I was praying someone would call, an actual crisis, just to keep my mind off things. I hated having to write down these calls because I had to think about it some more. 

The last hour seems like an eternity. I thought about just up and leaving before my time was up, but... what if someone else called? I don't want to risk that nor do I want to get in trouble. Whatever, it's just some weirdo calling. I'll be in my car and heading home soon anyway. I've been here for over a year at this point, whats the difference?

Before it hits midnight, I close everything down prematurely. Clean up the kitchen, file my papers away, leave a note about this dude calling, and write in my time for next week. Hit the lights and I'm putting my books in my backpack when the phone rings. Fuck.

PRIVATE. 

This time I simply answer, ""Hello?""

""GOOD-NIGHT"" *click*

Sprinted to my car and got the fuck out of there. "

1rgwqq,12,2013-11-25,For fellow single dudes...,APleasantCry,christiannofap,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiannofap/comments/1rgwqq/for_fellow_single_dudes/,"I saw a couple of comments on this lately and thought I'd write out my thoughts on it, which have changed recently.

My good friends know that I've always been a romantic, so for the better part of my adult life, I've obsessed about finding a girlfriend. That obsession, of course, made it just about impossible to actually get one because of all of the pressure I put on myself.

A few years ago, I finally got my first girlfriend, but it came at a pretty terrible time. I had drifted from God after moving across the country and fell for the cute, new intern at the office I was working at. Two and a half years later, having lost my virginity and making bad decisions left and right, I finally had to end it after renewing my relationship with Christ.

That relationship taught me a lot about myself and what I really wanted. Sure, having sex may have felt great, but the whole time, I knew it was wrong. That lingering guilt ate at me for a long time. Over the past six months post-relationship, I've learned what I really want: a beautiful, young woman who loves God more than me.

Now I'm back to where I started: how do I get a girlfriend?

Part of the problem I believe many of us have is that we're not asking the right question. It's not about finding a girlfriend, but about **preparing yourself to be a good boyfriend** (and consequently, be a good man). Lasting relationships are ones that are built on people who've waited for God instead of forcing things because of impatience or selfishness. And be honest: your desire to find a girlfriend before you're ready is selfish. If you were to get one, like I did, chances are you'd hurt yourself AND hurt her because your mind still hasn't healed from all of the porn you've looked at.

Purposefully delaying gratification and learning self-control are some of the hardest things I've ever had to learn. But they're worth it, and they prepare you for more than just a life without porn. They prepare you for a life of righteousness and living through the Spirit.

I always remember reading about the fruits of the spirit ([Galatians 5:22-23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205&amp;version=NIV)) and seeing that self-control was last. I always thought it'd be impossible to conquer. Earlier this year, though, I made a commitment to stop PMO altogether. I knew it'd be hard and that it'd take a long time, but years? Yes. It could take years. But don't give up! If there's anything I've learned in trying to do this, it's to never give up. Never quit, never give in. Always keep pressing forward.

I think one of the more important, daily prayers we can pray in this struggle is to ask God for patience and self-control. Patience to wait for your mind and body to heal from this addiction, and to understand that it's a process. You're going to fail, but don't stop getting up. Self-control to not just *not* look at porn, but also to learn to help others and help yourself. Be proactive in your battle. Self-control can be both positive and negative. Negative in terms of us NOT doing bad things (not looking at porn, not lusting), and positive in terms of us making the decision to DO good things (encouraging others, praying before going to bed and right after you wake up, digging into the Word daily).

So while I know what it's like to desire another person so much that your heart aches, you can't make that your life's focus. It has to be God, first and foremost. The sooner you learn to accept that and grow in your love for God, the sooner He'll reveal the one who's right for you. Pray God to increase your love for Him, and to shift your desire from women to God.

For me, I've made a promise to God that I won't pursue anyone romantically until I've reached AT LEAST 90 days of being PMO-free. In speaking to my good friend and pastor, he believes God will honor that covenant, and I'm hopeful He will, too. But on His timing, and not mine.

Praying for all of you struggling in this battle! No matter how many times you fail, He loves you, and if you ask for forgiveness, He'll forgive you. Learn to lean into God's grace continually."
1rgr49,235,2013-11-25,"[FR] I thought sex was being thrown at me, my friends perspective was slightly different. F-Close",ChampionPanda,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1rgr49/fr_i_thought_sex_was_being_thrown_at_me_my/,"Despite being a few months into the school year, out of the blue I decided that I deserved to enjoy myself and party tonight. My friend invites me over for drinks and about an hour in a girl walks in. Let's call her Ellie. The first night I met Ellie I had my eyes on her. I gathered just enough courage to ask for her name and everything was going well. At the time my only goal was to possibly get her number. Unfortunately the host of the party asked me for a favor and when I got back she was making out with some random guy. I wasn't to butt hurt about it and just shook it off and ended up just socializing the rest of the night.    
    
Next week was a Halloween party, the only difference was I was heavily intoxicated and I just made a fool out of myself the entire night. Unluckily I ran into Ellie again, I could barely hold myself together and just stumbled all over the place. Somehow she and I got locked outside of the apartment complex and just started talking again. We ended up just talking, but mostly about the cold weather. Eventually her friend came down with some guy, and we walked to her friends apartment. Even though we were in the same place we didn't speak a word to each other the rest of the night. On the bright side the guy that her friend brought down was an anime junkie so we talked about anime and I made a new friend.    
    
Well it's Friday night, and i've got zero plans. I text my buddy to see what's up. He's throwing a small get together, and i'm actually quite excited. I didn't expect anything that night, I just wanted to relax and hang out with my friends. As opposed to the other parties, this time I decided I wasn't gonna drink heavily. Instead I decided on just having fun. Unexpectedly Ellie and her friend walk in. I was still kind of embarrassed about how I acted like an idiot on halloween, but I decided to just set it aside and brush it off. For the first time, I had small talk with her completely sober. While everyone else was drinking we just casually talked. Eventually everyone at the get together got drunk hungry and left in search for some late night munchies. Ellie and I were alone, and without any hesitation I caressed her cheek towards me and started making out with her. This was short lived when everyone came back and saw her lying on top of me. At this point it was almost 2am and people started heading out. Ellie's friend insisted that I come with them to her apartment, and in my head I was relieved that I would be sleeping on a couch rather than a floor. When we got there I started to make myself comfortable and lied down on the couch. Meanwhile I over hear Ellie asking if she could sleep on the bed. Ellie and her friend go to her room and I just lied down staring at the ceiling. Ellie's friend walked out with a blanket and I thanked her for it, but then something unexpected happened. She told me to go to her room. I was genuinely confused, and I walk in to be greeted to Ellie lying down on the bed. I was dumbfounded and lied down. I asked her if I could take my pants off (seriously I can't sleep in jeans, it's too damn uncomfortable.) and told me to make myself comfortable. She scoots in closer and starts asking me questions. She asked if I was a virgin and I answered honestly, she laughed and told me she was too. She turns around and starts making out with me. I'm still really confused, and she asked me if I had a condom. I told her I didn't, and she stops gets up and asks her friend if she had a condom. I covered my eyes like a nine year old boy watching a rated R film. I was slightly embarrassed, but her friend was happy to give her a condom. I had no idea I was going to lose my virginity that night. One thing that stuck out was while we were having sex she paused and said ""You're a really nice guy, I hope you don't expect this to turn into some sort of relationship."" I laughed and told her I already had an internship lined up after graduation and I would have to move to the west coast. The morning wasn't awkward at all, I wasn't sure if I should has kissed her on my way out, but I just hugged her and told her ""Next time I see you, i'll think of that one time I saw you naked."" She laughed and I left. That entire night I felt like sex was literally thrown at me.    
From what my friend said I was on a roll. Apparently I was making all the girls laugh throughout the entire night. I didn't realize it at all. I didn't think I had everyones attention, I was simply just trying to have fun and not give a fuck. I'm not sure if he was trying to flatter me, but he said that I could have gotten any girl I wanted that night. It was just weird hearing it from his perspective. But yeah, I guess i'm better at attracting girls without dousing myself in alcohol.    
    
... and I still didn't get Ellie's number.

1rgp1n,19,2013-11-25,Have I become her pseudo-boyfriend?,notyourboyfriend2013,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1rgp1n/have_i_become_her_pseudoboyfriend/,"Apologies in advance for the long post

We've known each other for a few years, but in the past six months we've gotten a lot closer. At the beginning of summer she hung out at my house for about a week. There were one or two other people who came over as well, but she'd often stay after they left so we could work on stuff for a group we're in (she'd sometimes stay over until 3 AM). She went abroad for the summer so we didn't talk much other than a few emails and Facebook posts. We used to hang out before, but in the past few months it has really increased. 

We went from seeing each other once or twice a week (usually with a group of other people) to seeing each other almost every day, many times just the two of us. She started working out with me 3-4 days a week and we often get dinner after (just the two of us) and then go play video games or watch TV at my place (sometimes with my roommate, but more often just us). We've started texting pretty much daily, and it's become pretty much an expectation that we hang out on breaks from college. She has left some videogame stuff at my place and is borrowing my DVDs. 

I've also noticed some changes in our relationship in the last few months. There's been a lot more innuendo, a ton more inside jokes, a little bit more physical contact (once we spent an entire workout tickling each other), she's started telling me much more personal stuff, acts much more open and uninhibited around me than with other people, a bit more flirty, etc.

She's already making all sorts of plans around us in the future (she wants me to teach her programming next semester, was thinking of getting a summer internship in a faraway state so we could hang out when I travel there for the summer, was disappointed that I was going abroad for a month since she was going to be home and wanted to hang out, etc.)

The thing is, she has a boyfriend of 5 years. They've been on the rocks for a while, and she's been complaining about him a lot and tells me how she wants to break up with him. But then sometimes when we're hanging out she'll mention how he spent the night last night, or how she's unsure if she'll break up with him, and once in a while she'll even invite him to hang out with us. All I can say is that if 
I were her boyfriend, I would be very uncomfortable with how close we've become and the stuff we're doing together. Obviously she hasn't cheated on him (and she's not the type who would), but the more I think about it the more uneasy this all makes me. 

A ton of people have asked me if we are dating. Heck, even her sister who has never met me and lives on the other side of the country now knows who I am. She has other guy friends that she's hung out one-on-one with, but not nearly as much (and she said she views one of them as a “brother”). I recently found out from a mutual friend that she had “feelings” for me about a year ago. But I don't think she does any more. 

Recently I realized that I'm pretty much in love with her. We get along great, have similar senses of humor, shared intellectual interests, a lot in common, similar values, etc.  But when I think about how our relationship has evolved recently, it made me think that I'm just pining for her and hoping she'll come around and feel the same way, while she's using me as a pseudo-replacement for her failing relationship. I care about her deeply and enjoy her friendship, but it just seems like what we have (whatever it is) isn't very healthy for either of us, and I should start distancing myself from her as soon as possible. What do you all think?

**tl;dr Girl and I have started hanging out much more, and I think I'm becoming her pseudo-boyfriend because her relationship is falling apart**

That being said I don't really know any non-JVM languages other than basic syntax. I've never had an internship but i've been a comp sci tutor for the last 3 years. I also have a minor in mathematics. 

My concern is that really I have no idea what i'm going to do when I get out of college.  To be honest I got into programming because it was interesting and fun not for thinking of a career. I've done a few project, games, simple interpreters for languages, calculators. None of them are on github or anything like that, just on my computer. I would love to design my own programming language.
Do I have a decent shot at getting a good job, and if so how should I be preparing myself and what should I do?"

I'm in need of it :(",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1rl18e/22f_with_a_21m_when_do_you_think_its_time_to_walk/,"Im a 22[F] and my bf[M] 21 of 3 years are going through a really hard time. this summer I moved to his home state to be with him for 6 months (internship opportunity). I only moved so that I could be with him ( I had other job offers), and at the last minute, 12 days prior to coming to his home state, he told me he decided to go to california to get a job there, knowing full well that I was in his home state waiting to be with him. That caused us to start fighting all the time, I resented him for making me believe it was ok to move 12 hours away from home to be with him, and it made me feel bad about myself like I wasnt good enough to even consider staying for. 

This summer was hard and we continously argued and he ended up hooking up with another girl over there. I read their text messages (he let me) and they had a full on relationship, he told her how happy she made him and he even introduced her to his family. When the summer was over he came back to where I was and said it was all a mistake and it meant nothing. In the texts I read he was badmouthing me to her, saying how i was a needy girlfriend and how his family doesnt like me, it goes on and none of it was positive. But every time I bring it up he said it meant nothing 

So.. the trust between us is completely shattered and I just want to know When I should just walk away from it all, I feel like the relationship has been me just making sacrifices for him and him not returning the favor. I learned a completely different language just to be with him ( he is deaf and doesnt talk so we use ASL), and that took me almost a year to do of taking classes and spending months practicing sign language, I gave up every college vacation to go to his home state 12 hours away and be with his family for 3 years (thanksgiving, christmas, my birthday, new years, spring break, etc) and that took a toll on my family getting a little frustrated because I was never around and he never wanted to come to my family's for any holidays. I gave up a lot of friends to be with him, he made me stop talking to all of my ex's who I was friends with. Basically I have given up so much time, energy, friendships, and money to be with him and make him happy and he tells me he wants to change but I never see him doing anything different. 

I dont know if I love him anymore or I just hate the idea of being alone ....

TL;DR - When do you think its time to walk away from a relationship? Dating a guy for 3 years who has cheated on me, and shows no signs of improving no matter how much I tell him what I want. I dont like walking away from something thats broken ... but when is enough... enough? "
1rku3x,6,2013-11-27,REQUEST Trogdor got into our baggage while packing for thanksgiving and ate some Adderall.(repost from my account older than 90 days),xchriswhitex,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1rku3x/request_trogdor_got_into_our_baggage_while/,"Backstory. I feel weird doing this but me and my fiance are both in our mid 20's(24 and 25) putting ourselves through school, i rely on tightly budgeted loans and she uses minimal loans and works part time. But she rescued a german shepard/vizsla/pit mix. The vet told the original owner to put him down during his newborn visit because he had an umbilical hernia/ his testicles were in his abdomen and he had a bad leg. But he was too adorable to let this happen to. We have gotten everything fixed besides his leg but he is now able to go on day hikes with us without major complications besides his limp getting a little worse. His leg is next on our agenda but that takes time to save for.

Well yesterday amidst packing for our trip home for thanksgiving, we ran to the store for some last minute supplies, in less than 30 minutes he had gotten into my bag and destroyed my adderall bottle along with probably 10 capsules. He was rushed to the vet but required an overnight stay with a 200 dollar deposit which is all of the money we had to our name, the rest of the bill is due today when i go pick him up any minute now. I'm not sure what its going to be but i will gladly post the bill when i return. All i have is almost 100 dollars i got yesterday afternoon from selling games to a buddy and coinstaring all of the change we had in the house. I really don't know what to do. I'm panicking. I feel weird asking for help, but I have no one to turn to, all of our friends and family are in similar financial situation. I have a paypal account if anyone can help, like i said i will gladly post the bill as soon as i get home if needed. And if there is any money left I can do the math to distribute it back proportionally or I can put it towards getting his leg treated so he can get outside and really exhaust his energy without hurting himself. His couped up energy is the reason we think he chews stuff up from time to time. Any help is much appreciated and will be paid forward when I finish school if not sooner. Thank you.

1rk4vu,5,2013-11-27,My story so far,nefuratios,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1rk4vu/my_story_so_far/,"I started playing video games at the quite young age of 5 when my father bought me a Commodore 64. He actually bought himself the C64 to learn programming but he never got around to it so the C64 became our family's gaming machine. Since we were living in a communist state of Yugoslavia at that time I had little to no knowledge of consoles and handhelds of that time and the first time I saw a Game Boy was in a Swedish magazine's ad. Then the Yugoslavian war of 1992 started so the French UNPROFOR base was established in my town and since my mother was an interpreter for them we had access to their duty free shop where my mom bought me a Game Boy. I was eight years old then. I mention the war because it's directly tied to the reason why I became so addicted to video games. For the whole four years of the war's duration I played my Game Boy, every day and every night using an oil lamp. Batteries were really cheap then so that wasn't a problem. That's how gaming became a reality escape mechanism from all the monstrosities I was witnessing daily. The war ended and that's when I first got a SNES. The games for SNES were incredibly expensive, like $130 US, so I didn't get many games for it, mostly RPGs since they lasted the longest (I have to mention Secret of Evermore and Terranigma as my favorite SNES RPGs, and yes I finished Link to the past and played Secret of Mana but those never really stuck with me).   After the SNES I got a N64 which was my last console because gaming  became just to expensive for my family since the N64 games were also about $100 US. That's when I switched to the glorious PC master race:) and never looked back. The games were much cheaper, at least in my country, there were tons of western RPGs and point and click adventures, games that all the consoles at that time lacked. I was pretty addicted at that point, all I could think about was gaming. I couldn't wait for school or a night out with my buddies to end so I could go home and start an all night gaming session. My grades suffered, I went from a straight A student to graduating High School with a B. I was socially awkward and introverted, didn't like talking to people and just waited for all the events to pass so I could go home and play games. I realized I had a problem when I was in my twenties. I thought about it long and hard and finally decided to give away my PC. I just gave my $800+ PC to my buddy and was done with it. Soon after I lost my virginity at the age of 22:) I was gaming-free for a few years and my life was amazing, I had more friends, didn't have trouble talking to people or picking up women, I was all around incredibly more confident. The addict in me didn't sleep though, and after a couple of years I impulsively bought a new PC. The cycle started again, my college grades suffered, instead of graduating college in four years, it took me six. My relationship got worse, I sometimes thought about games while we were making out, it was just insane. I barely managed to finish my legal internship and save my relationship by selling my PC but I was still stuck with other forms of gaming such as casual on my work laptop and mobile on my phone. I finally realized that it was all in my head and I would never be able to break the cycle with some external act like giving away or selling my PC, I had to change form the  inside. What brought me around was my girlfriend who literally screamed at me that I needed to change in order to be a normal person and a  functioning member of society. At first I thought what every gamer would, that she was crazy, but it hit me hard when I saw my buddies getting jobs, married, having children while I was 30, stuck at home, unemployed, with my 31 year old girlfriend. It just snapped in my head, I just said no more,  stopped gaming in any way, started studying for the bar exam and I just hope that I wasn't too late. Gaming was not a fun hobby for me, it was a mean of total escape from reality caused by the war time in my country when I had to game to stay sane. Maybe, one day when I have my life in order, I will start again but I sincerely hope I won't feel the need to."

It's been nearly 4 years. She moved out of town, about an hour away for sport medicine related major. I stayed in town and went into computer engineering.

Lately, the past year or so - maybe less - it's been tougher and tougher. Since she moved to college this fall it's been the hardest 3 months by far. I still have so many feelings for her, but from her to me it's like shes just bored with me or something.

In school, I started my freshman year in college last year in computer engineering - all is well, got good grades. Only bad effect of college was I am not particularly social and that field doesn't particularly promote it. I never went to (nor do I still) go to any parties. Never got invited cause I never knew anyone. Sophomore year comes around and holy fuck, the amount of stress this semester is overwhelming and I have no idea what to do. I dropped a course because of bad grades, and my other 3 courses now arent doing anything good for my grades either. Honestly, I don't know that this is what I want to do with my life, however I'm terrified of changing because I have no idea what I would do. So that on top of my relationship is stressing me out to no end. The SO love love lovesssss her field, and shes living in the dorms, and shes like the most outgoing person of all time - opposite of me. She has loads of friends and its like I can feel the distance separating us, more than physically - emotionally, and I've broken down and cried more than once. 

On top of that, I honestly don't have any really good friends I can talk to. There is a possible one and a maybe second that I would be comfortable even opening up to. I wish I had my own friends, but most all of my friends are the closest friends of my GFs

I hate that I'm not social at all. I hate that I'm a fattie (BMI probably 25-30 range I would guess) but tell myself I don't have the time for working out and dieting because of school and work.

The only thing I really feel I have going for me is that I like my job - I'm an IT intern at a building that is right across the street from school so I get free parking, good pay, and a simple job.

All I want is to get in shape, be doing a career that I enjoy and understand, have my current SO fall back in love with me, have friends who are real friends, and just be happy and not so damned stressed all the time.

Uhh sorry for ranting, I guess you can ask questions if I was unclear, basically I just let my brain and hands explode words onto here because it helps me calm down... In fact I would love to answer questions or hear your suggestions... Thanks"

1ro87x,3,2013-11-28,Me [22 M] with my long time friend [22 F]. I'm debating whether to start a relationship with someone who has different religious beliefs.,millivolt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ro87x/me_22_m_with_my_long_time_friend_22_f_im_debating/,"I am trying to decide if I should start a relationship with one of my oldest friends.

A few things before I get into the narrative:

I'm very slow with romance. I've never had a girlfriend, and I've only ever dated two girls. I attribute this to me having ""better things to do"", since I have always been a very dedicated student. I just started grad school. I'm the type who likes to plan things out. I don't like starting something unless I have a good idea of what I'm getting into. I don't like to ""mess around"". If I start something, it's going to be with someone I care about, and it's going to be for the long haul. I'm also an atheist, which is, unfortunately, relevant.


She is a very conservative person (not politically).  She's had a couple of relationships before, but I wouldn't say any of them got particularly serious. She's deeply religious (Christian), as is the rest of her family. She isn't interested in anything but serious relationships, either.


We're both virgins, if that's not already clear.


We've known each other since 2nd grade or so, and we became close friends in 8th grade.  We went to different high schools, but I ended up taking her to her senior prom (not because I liked her, but because she needed someone to go with). Following high school, I went to college while she took a church internship abroad. We've liked each other at different points, but due to our different lives leading us different places, it has never timed out right. On top of that, I had always been unable to relate to her faith in God, even when I was a Christian. To me, it was ""the one thing"" that made her wrong for me. At the beginning of the narrative, she doesn't know this, and she doesn't know that I'm an atheist.

---
Now the narrative (I don't know what's relevant or not, so I'm just putting it all down):

About 6 months ago, she called me (after a long while of not talking) and told me that she was having doubts about her beliefs. I told her I had gone through the exact same thing. When she asked me what happened, I decided to tell her the truth about what I believed. I did it in a respectful way. She was shocked to learn this, and a bit saddened to learn that I had kept it from her for years. My main point throughout the conversation was that she shouldn't stop questioning her beliefs, because that makes you a stronger person, whether or not it causes you to change your beliefs. I tried to remain impartial and level-headed, despite the fact that I wanted her to change her beliefs.


Nothing really came of it. She didn't change her beliefs. All it really did was get me to start thinking about her romantically again. Still, I was having trouble with the whole faith issue.


This past summer, we had the opportunity to spend time together, and it became abundantly clear to me that she liked me. At one point, I told her that I refused to have conversations about ""us"", because I was going to move across the country to go to grad school in a few months, and I didn't want to start a relationship right before I put it under the stress of long distance. However, time won me over, and I decided that we should have ""that conversation"" after all.


I told her that I liked her, and she told me that she really liked me (it was obvious that her feelings were stronger). I told her that we should start dating. She told me that she would love that, but she couldn't, because of the faith issue. I totally agreed with her on that point. I explained that I didn't think my beliefs would change anytime soon, and we both decided that a relationship was a bad idea.


One day, she told me that she wanted to do something when she gets off of work at 9pm. I couldn't think of anything to do at that time. On the spur of the moment, I say ""let's go to the beach"". I had just inadvertently set us up on our first date.


Things got a bit romantic. We held hands and cuddled (first time I had ever done that). When I dropped her off at her house that night, I wondered what I had done. I called her the next morning to apologize, and she told me not to. She said that she was pretty much in love with me, that she didn't care anymore, and that she just wanted to be with me. I had my reservations, but she managed to convince me to start dating her. I started dating her 2 days later. 


On our second date, we kissed (I had never done that before, either). I realized that I had been missing out. But it didn't keep me from feeling guilty the next day. For some reason, I felt like I was doing the wrong thing. I talked to one of my friends about it, and he told me that I should give it time, and that it was just ""buyer's regret"".


We went on another couple of dates. Usually (I think) dates consist of getting to know the other person. The thing was, we already knew each other. So basically, it was just escalating our physical relationship. On the third date, she told me that she wants me to talk to her father about dating her. Recall, she and her family are religious and conservative. I initially had no problem with this, and I agreed to meet him at the end of the week.


However, over the course of the next couple days, I realized that I couldn't do it. I wasn't scared, but I knew that I couldn't explain the relationship to him, because I couldn't explain it to myself. I couldn't see it going anywhere as long as we had different beliefs, and I wasn't interested in a fling or a ""friends with benefits"" type thing. I told her all of this, and then finally managed to convince her that we needed to end it. We spent one last night together, and agreed that that was it.


After I moved across the country, we started talking again, and soon we were right back where we left off. But I started to feel guilty again. 


I guess I need to explain my guilt. She is very much in love with me, and while I have told her I loved her (and believed it), I know that I don't feel the same level of connection with her that she does with me. So I guess I feel like I'm leading her on/taking advantage of her. More importantly (and this might be what is causing the ""leading on"" feeling), I know that I'm clouding her ability to think and decide her beliefs for herself. I want her beliefs to be consistent with mine, but I don't want it to be because I won't be with her otherwise. It feels like I'm emotionally blackmailing her.


At one point, she even said that she would ""take whatever I gave her"" (up to and including sex).  This disturbed me, because her sexual purity is part of her *identity*, and it directly contradicts everything she has ever told me about what she believes a relationship before marriage should be (I have no issues with premarital sex, per se).


So I told her that I wanted to stop talking altogether, until she figured herself out. I did it as nicely as I could, but she didn't react well. She told me something that stuck with me: she said that if I caused her to lose her faith (and thereby ruin her relationship with her family), she would blame me. 
This convinced me that I was doing the right thing.


I have had very little communication with her since then.


But I'm starting to question myself. Is my guilt unfounded? I know she has a right to decide things for herself, but she's saying things that make me think she isn't thinking clearly.  And I don't know if she meant what she said about blaming me.

---

**tl;dr**: I'm an atheist. She's a Christian. She's head over heels for me, and I feel like it's causing her to start to lose her faith, which both she (and her family) would blame me for. But I'm concerned that I'm missing out."

In October I began speaking with different accounting firms and managed to get interviews at two other Big 4 firms and three regional firms in the area. Two of the three regional firms gave me full time offers and one of the Big 4 firms gave me an audit internship offer. I decided to go with the internship offer because I still do not know if I am 100% sold on accounting as a career yet, and audit seems like it would be a better fit for me. 

So I just wanted to come on here and tell all the interns who didn't receive an offer that there is still hope. You are bright, intelligent, and a wanted commodity. Never give up!"

This most recent example highlights some failures and problems that I've experienced. If this is something that interests you, please read and comment. This is NOT a thread for ""real"" time travel dreams.**

This is my very first post on reddit, and I'm looking for advice from people who are in a similar position in terms of years LDing or experience overall. I would like to clarify that none of this thread is embellished, role-playing, or fiction. I am a sceptical person who sincerely believes that LDing can be explained and explored scientifically, and I hope that by relaying these experiences to you we can bring about greater awareness and understanding of more advanced explorations of our subconscious mind.

I've been Lucid Dreaming on and off for about three years now. I tend to turn to Lucid Dreaming for periods of a few months at a time, especially during times of stress as a means of escapism. I've never been at the point where I can just LD on demand, but if I really set my mind to it then there's a very good chance I can have one in a given night. I have had quite substantial success with dream creation, which I mostly credit to empirical, methodical, systematic approaches to Lucid Dreaming.

First and foremost, I am not claiming to have time-travelled. Nor am I claiming that it is possible to obtain a window into the past that is in any way literal or objective. What I would like to tell you about are some experiences that have really blown me away - dreams in which I have used my lucidity to create an ""alternate past"". 

Over the holidays, I will be returning to my family home, where I can obtain my ""back-catalogue"" of dream journals and write about the others in more detail. Until then, I will only be posting about dreams that I have documented whilst at Law School. Last night featured the most notable of these dreams that I have yet experienced, which I will tell in the style of a first-person, present-tense contiguous narrative for the sake of simplicity (other experienced LDers will understand what I mean when I say that the narrative is not particularly linear).

&gt;I'm sat on a train, surrounded by several family members. It's a clear day, in what I can only assume is summer - a blue sky hangs over a Spartan landscape of green hills. As the dream ""begins"", I have that familiar but ineffable feeling of lucidity that somehow tells me *you're in control*. My younger sister asks where the train is headed, and with a nod to my grandparents, seemingly oblivious to the notions of cliché, I tell her ""to the height of World War II - to 1943"". The countryside rapidly warps into a more weathered, autumnal landscape, and even the motion of the train alters to reflect its steam-powered nature.

&gt;As the train passes under an unfinished motorway, my sister asks why so many people were opposed to the creation of the UK motorway system. As always with my sister, I begin to trot out a superficial explanation, but then stop and remember that we didn't start building motorways until at least the fifties. It was at this point that I knew the dream was not behaving exactly how I had intended.

&gt;I arrive in a currently unidentified city with my sister and parents. I decide that if this dream is to remain stable, I should not perform any drastic interventions in my environment, and ""play along"" with the forties theme to keep it as realistic as possible. We proceed to a bar, where a live band is playing on electric guitars, something that I note is anachronistic. My parents persuade me to ""not make a fuss"", and we quietly settle into a stall. I remove my phone from my pocket, and wonder what all of these people would think of a device that could store thousands of songs and images. My parents note that the technological advances that come out of the Second World War are what make devices like this possible.

&gt;My sister jokingly asks what people in the 1940s would think of One Direction. Immediately, the band leaders begin playing a song that, although I don't recognise upon waking (and was probably unrecognisable in my dream), is recognised by the dream characters as being by One Direction. Out of nowhere, Johnny Cash proceeds to start swearing at the stage, joined by Elvis and several other ""old-timey"", but still anachronous musicians.

&gt;We then rapidly left the bar to find all of the pedestrians on the street outside using mobile phones, and it was then apparent that my attempts at recreating 1940s Britain were rapidly deteriorating. We stumble across a building having its signs currently mounted, which I immediately note as belonging to my University. I mentally note that this is an improvement, but that I keep visualising buildings that are older than my original target date of 1943 - these buildings were erected during Britain's post-war reconstruction period.

&gt;The dream is becoming increasingly hazy. I dash into a shop, scanning the newspaper headlines. One reads ""Mumps vaccine developed"" - probably due to my tutor's mention of a few students contracting mumps in the past few weeks. I visualise a laboratory, and find myself in an old building surrounded by well-dressed researchers.

&gt;""You've arrived just in time"", an elderly man in spectacles says as he walks towards me, ""you're the intern who's going to be doing the lab work for me today?"". I instantly recall my work experience as a research assistant at a medical school, during which I had the rather tedious job of adding nutrients to hundreds of Petri dishes. They stuck me in front of a microscope, and I had the task of finding an ""egg"" in the solution (I am fully aware that mumps is not a parasitic disease, but I was playing along). I was comparing numerous, tiny spheres of differing size and texture to find the egg of this parasite, which we would isolate and use in the creation of a vaccine (again, this must sound ridiculous to biochemists).

&gt;Upon successfully isolating this microscopic egg, the dream faded back into the newsagents, and I was stood once more holding the newspaper. A tall, older man in an overcoat tells me that no matter how hard scientists try, people will always be sceptical of science. Our tendency towards simplistic, primitive or supernatural explanations of complex problems is the greatest obstacle to humanity (or something along those lines). ""Yes!"", I exclaim, ""where, or rather, when I come from, there was a fear that the vaccine causes autism"". 

&gt;I then quickly realised my mistake in revealing to another dream character that not only was I lucid, but that I was not from the same era as the other dream characters. But this did not matter to this dream figure. Beforehand, there was always an ominous sense of instability every time I witnessed an anachronistic aspect of the dream, but this time the dream seemed weirdly stable - it was almost as if I had been directed to *this particular event*. Fittingly, the dream ended here.

This dream may have underwhelmed you, and I apologise that it does not feature all of the frills of some other entries that I've read here. But for me, it raises so many questions - why did I have so much difficulty in recreating a *real place in time* when I've had such ease creating totally fantastic spaces? What is it about dreams that makes realism so difficult? Why did anachronistic objects or concepts affect the dream ""stability"", and make me feel like I'm about to wake up? Why did older men play such a strong role as dream guides in this instance when leading dream figures are, in my experience, normally young men and women of approximately my age? Why did I not even think to use any of my normal dream powers - flight, strength, telekinesis (despite lacking the requirement at any point to do so)? 

If anyone has any explanations, theories, or similar experiences, I would love for you to offer them in the comments. If you have anything to say or ask about my experience, then please feel free to do so too.

1rq23e,2,2013-11-29,FR: The Hypocrisy of My Game,Pugilanthropist,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1rq23e/fr_the_hypocrisy_of_my_game/,"Hey Seddit!

Long time no chat.  

I've had an interesting problem come up and I wondered if some folks here might be able to relate and share their own perspective on my dilemma.

Game has changed my life.  Both in a positive and a negative sense.  In a positive: getting women is damn easy and getting laid is just something that happens now.   Granted, most of the women are not quite up to the standards I want, so there's still work to be done in that regard.

In a negative: I can't go out without thinking about how to pull, how to get the k-close, how to get the f-close.   And it creates that oh so familiar now roller coaster of emotions: the dizzying highs of success, the depressing valleys of failure.  

But that's not my issue right now.

My issue is this: as much as I'm addicted to this game, I've found a girl that seems to crack the cold shell that abundance mentality and outcome independence built into my being.   And so, the old familiar demon known as ""feelings"" return to haunt me once more.

Here's some context to the story:

A year ago, I met this girl, and I was immediately smitten.  And, I suspect, she took a liking to me as well.  But the circumstances were complicated:  I was in a managerial position, and she was applying to be one of my interns.  I told her, very firmly, I don't mess around with people that work for me, having made that mistake before.  And so, as hard as it was, I let her go.   And in the process, one of my subordinates ended up dating her and they ended up in a relationship.   To make matters even worse, at the time, I was staying at the subordinate's house, so when he left to see her, I knew, and I lost sleep in the process.   

They ended up breaking up, I told her I couldn't handle being friends.   She was hurt.  We reconnected, I couldn't stop talking to her.  But that's another story.

Let's speed up to the present.

The night after Halloween, I had a party at my house.  Lots of friends came by, several girls that I had been practicing a ""slow burn"" technique on, and a few new girls.   One new girl who was a stunner, a recent graduate of my former college, and this one, who we'll call Trouble.

We had jello shots, we had lots of handles of alcohol, and so I did what a good party host should do: black out.

The recent stunner and I connected (but that's yet another story) and things were progressing well, when in my drunken state I ran into Trouble.  Now here's the weird part: I saw Trouble standing talking to another guy, and I left stunner and just went to talk to her.   Didn't kino, didn't try to pull a move, just tried to *talk* to her.

Naturally, stunner didn't appreciate this and stomped off.   Que sera sera.

But Trouble and I went out for dinner the Friday afterwards.  We had one of those conversations you don't have that often, and I started to accept that this girl wasn't quite like the others.

However, in the process, she told me that we couldn't date.   Namely, I had too many issues and she'd worked extensively on her own.   She has a good deal of baggage, herself. 

But, the heart wants what the heart wants.

We ended up kissing as we left to meet my work friends, and we agreed that dating probably wasn't a good idea.   However, going out with the work friends was also not a terribly good idea, because, as she told me, ""I'm going to be looking for a replacement Pug tonight.""  And she was.   Even among my friends.

This only played into my old insecurities, so I told my friends ""look, I'm not saying you can't hook up with her, but I can say that I wouldn't be ok with it.""

And, amazingly, my friends followed the ""bros before hos"" rule.

But that set off red flags for her, only confirmed her suspicions of why us being in an actual relationship could be very much a bad thing.

Nonetheless, the heart wants what the heart wants.

A few days later, I found out a friend of mine passed away.  She was only 35.   This was the first time I'd ever really dealt with death beyond the ""grandparent age"" variety.   

Trouble came over to console me, and we cuddled and kissed some more.   She asked me before if I needed her.  I said ""I don't know if I need you, but you're my favorite person to have around.""

She told me that was the most romantic thing anyone had ever said to her.

About a week later(one week ago), she came over again early in the morning.   And this time, things progressed considerably.  We had plans to meet earlier in the evening, but she ended up getting into a serious conversation with her sister about childhood trauma.   There's an interesting story in that, in that I almost went a little RP and told her that the way she kept postponing our date was unacceptable.

Then I found out about the childhood trauma aspect and that made me realize I was being a little unreasonable.

But at any rate, I digress.

She ended up coming over.   And the first thing she did was take off her clothes before getting into bed with me.   She didn't want to have sex because she told me that she uses sex to detach from people.   This seems possible given the whole smorgasbord of issues she has, and she saw that there could be something serious between us.   But she just lied there, naked with me, talking for hours on end, sometimes kissing, sometimes giggling, sometimes revealing deep dark secrets about herself that I wish I never knew.

And then she left.  And texted me an hour later telling me she already missed my bed.

All good so far, right?  Possibly a little fishy about the non sex issue, but that could also just be more of my issues rising to the surface.  Here's where my question stems from: 

Before she left, she asked me if it would be all right to see one of my friends to help tutor her for her Calculus.   She also admitted that I'd been right: she did have a little crush on him.  But, in her words, it pales compared to what she feels for me.

I told her, that I'd be fine with it.  Mainly because I knew I wouldn't be able to stop her from doing whatever she wanted to do.

In addition, she confessed to me that she saw something with me and was worried that if we went down that road, it might last a very long time.   And, again, her words: she wants to be young and free for a little while longer.   She framed the conversation that it would give me time to work on my issues and then when we were both ready, we'd see where this went.

Before I left town for Thanksgiving, I got a text from the friend she has a crush on telling me that he's going to indeed tutor her on Calculus.  He promised me it would be platonic.

And last night, I found out they were both together for Thanksgiving at a mutual friend's family get together.

And that brings us to now.

So here's my issue.  I've learned too much about the nature of women and the world in general.  As a result, I don't trust women when it comes to fidelity, and various moments with this girl only add to that suspicion.   I trust my friend ... to a degree.  I know that if a girl whom you're attracted to starts to make a move towards you, you lose your rationality and get swept up in the moment.

So there's that aspect.   On one level, if I'm completely honest with myself, I don't want him to fuck her before *I* do.   Maybe that's the all too real frailty of pride, but it's there.

On the next level is this: I *like* being single.   Just this past Wednesday, I was having my lower lip chewed by an attractive local at our ""Black Wednesday"" pub crawl.   I have several other girls at varying levels of ""we're-going-to-fuck""-ness back in the city and across the country.   And finally, I live in San Francisco, where the sexual liberation movement is alive and well.

So yes, I too want to be young and free a little longer.   At least part of me does, and therein lies the rub.

Part of me just wants her and just wants to be with her.

And that's the part that made me write this post.  I wanted it to be short, but my verbosity took hold of me.

I wish I could just be completely aloof and numb to this girl, like I have so many others.  I wish I could freeze her out when she makes her vaginal power-play (if that's what it is) and do all the various tricks I know to seduce her, make her forget her mental barriers, and enjoy some wonderful casual sex.   And finally, I wish I could simply ""next"" her if she continues to be more trouble than she's worth.

But I can't.   

I like this one.   And that scares me.

So I don't know if I'm asking for advice, if I'm asking for consolation, but I know I'm asking for something.

Just again, I don't know what.

TLDR: fuck feelings."
1rprnx,2,2013-11-29,Brown Plain Cap-Toe Oxfords too formal for Business Casual? Other considerations for the brown oxford.,LiNZero,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1rprnx/brown_plain_captoe_oxfords_too_formal_for/,"I'll start off with some** background info on my situation**:

I'm a student intern at a software development lab that has a business casual dress code. However, most people dress casually unless they're managers. People say that one should dress for success, so I'm trying to steer my outfits towards something like [this](http://putthison.com/post/226048581/academicstyle). I bought a pair of [Stacy Adams Prescot](http://www.amazon.com/Stacy-Adams-Mens-Prescott-Oxford/dp/B00C4P12HO) 2 months ago. I've enjoyed wearing it, my girlfriend liked the change from Converse to leather shoe. I intend to replace this shoe with the Oxford. Will probably wear it during bad weather, or to let the oxford rest.

**Questions:**

Lots of posts recommend to get brown shoes for business casual. I've been looking for a pair of quality leather shoe and I seem to prefer plain cap-toe oxfords over wingtips(broquing in general actually). I like how ""not busy"" and ""sleek"" the plain cap-toe oxford is. I understand that Oxfords in general are considered formal. Is it too formal to be worn for business casual? 

So far pants I have is dark jeans, fairly dark khaki chinos, washed maroon chinos. Is it appropriate to wear such brown cap-toe oxfords with them?


My wardrobe is quite abysmal admittedly. I intend to add navy and charcoal wool trousers and chinos into my wardrobe. Are there any other pants/colours that would go well with a brown oxford?

Lastly, what shade of brown is the best for a first brown shoe? I think versatility is key. I think my main colour scheme will be Navy and Grey Scale accentuated with some coloured acessory(such as a tie). I am considering this from [Meermin](http://www.meermin.es/ficha_articulo.php?id=2034). I am also considering this from [Herring](http://www.herringshoes.co.uk/product-info.php?&amp;brandid=6&amp;shoeid=7364). I've seen a lot of Chestnut/Walnut coloured shoes but I am afraid it be too ""loud""/contrast too much with the dark colours I intend to wear.

I've been working in the commerce department as an unpaid intern, and now I have finally gotten a job and some real money (miracle considering the lack of a budget in federal govt) so I finally have the means to buy my cap and gown.  

SO, the bookstore is closed right now and I see that it says there was a ""first come first serve"" policy, and it opens back up after December 1st.

Will I be able to buy my cap and gown in time? Will I be able to get my ""cum laude"" with honors thing that goes around my neck?  

I will be calling immediately on Monday (Thanksgiving break everything is closed till Monday), but I'm kind of mad I can't do it online right now.  It's not online, I checked.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, all of the winter commencement directions just mention the bookstore as the source of the cap and gown, then once you go on the website there is absolutely nothing mentioned regarding graduation.

Thanks!

As the internship is 40 hrs/week unpaid and I am currently trying to pay off my student loans, I don't have a lot of money to offer in terms of rent. However, I am a fun, responsible college grad with lots of experience living with roommates. I am extremely respectful and diligent in the home. I'd love to help out around the house daily with any cooking, cleaning, chores, and child/pet care in exchange for a place to stay. I am a great cook and I've been nannying and babysitting over 10 years. 

My internship hours will have me there 5 days a week anywhere from 7:30-5 so I will be out of the house during those times. I'll be looking for a part-time job to work in the evenings so I'll most likely be out of the house then as well. 

I don't need much. No tv, bureau, or private bathroom necessary. All I really need is a bed and maybe use of the washer/dryer occasionally. I don't mind sharing a room. I'm happy to offer references and a background check. 

Please contact me if you may have an available room or if you'd like to inquire about more info.

1rojh1,6,2013-11-28,Just diagnosed with type III Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction. Anyone else here in the same boat?,gasolinerainbow,ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1rojh1/just_diagnosed_with_type_iii_sphincter_of_oddi/,"Hey, guys. I hope everyone is feeling okay today. 

I had my gallbladder out in February of this year after experiencing a few months worth of pain attacks, but unfortunately the surgery didn't stop the attacks - in fact, they may have actually gotten worse since the surgery. Ever since then I have been experiencing near-constant stabbing or aching pain on the right side of my abdomen, which sometimes worsens into a pain attack which...is the worst thing I have ever felt, hands down, and I have been through some pretty ridiculously painful things in my life. It is absolutely a 10 on the pain scale.

The worst part of the attacks isn't even the pain, though - it's how humiliatingly debilitating they are, and how unpredictable. About a month ago I had a horrible one when I was out to dinner with my mother - I excused myself to the bathroom when I felt like it was coming on, and within 10 minutes I was lying on the floor of the bathroom bawling in pain and, eventually, throwing up. It was horrible. Even last week, at my college internship, I had an attack - I ended up making up some excuse about running an errand and going to the bathroom of the coffee shop across the street to suffer, I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of my boss. The triggers for my attacks are...not consistent - the only thing that triggers an attack every time is codeine, otherwise they just seem to come out of nowhere.

I have some medical knowledge, and I figured out that this was probably sphincter of oddi a while ago - however, this week I finally got in to see a good gastroenterologist (I had previously seen my GP and my gallbladder surgeon but they wanted another opinion), and he confirmed the diagnosis. He does want to do an endoscopy on me in a week or so to do some biopsies and make sure there's nothing else going on (an ulcer, coeliac, etc), but he's certain that I have some level of sphincter of oddi going on, even if it's not my only problem. 

I am not even sure about how to feel - I am no stranger to health problems, I have suffered with severe mental illness (PTSD) for about 10 years now, and I have had assorted other health issues on top of that, but never chronic pain before. Like I said, I have a very high pain tolerance, but it is still not nice to be in pain 24/7, and the disruptiveness of the attacks is very distressing. I am afraid the SOD will get worse and start to involve my pancreas, too.

The gastroenterologist prescribed me amitryptaline (10mg) to control the pain - having dealt with mental illness, this is not the first time I have been prescribed amitryptaline, and this is a much lower dose than I got last time...but I am still a bit worried about it making me sleepy or causing weight gain. He also gave me a nitroglycerine spray to use under my tongue in the event of an attack - but apparently this will dump my (already chronically low) blood pressure and give me an awful headache, so I guess it won't make the attacks less disruptive, just less painful. 

Anyway....that is where I am at right now. Has anyone else struggled with SOD before? Or taken these drugs? I would love to hear anyone's stories. Thank you for letting me vent. &lt;3"

-after grandfather died he gave her a ride to the airport and they exchanged numbers
-next day I didn't send her a text and went out with some friends because she was acting like she needed space the night before to commemorate her grandfather and when she found out she stopped talking to me for a month... but apparently starting going out with this other guy
-Fast forward a couple months, I get a high paying internship in oil and gas and she comes crawling back... He has called her at night multiple times... she says that he is calling to talk about his issues with other girls that he's dating for advice and shit.
-I told her to get on facebook and show me her message history since she wanted to look through all my text messages (it was only fair) and there was a picture of them two out at dinner (she later told me her mom took the picture of them)... and yet they're still just friends. She said her sister brought someone along for the dinner so she wanted to bring along a friend and that he is just a really good friend who was there for her. After I saw the picture she told me that she deleted the conversation since then because I was freaking out about nothing... makes no sense.
-she told me never to contact him, even though she changed the privacy settings on her facebook so I can't see this guy's facebook anyways... and even if I could contact him I wouldn't.
-She is talking about going back to Disney over winter break because her sister has to have someone with her on the drive over there and she wants to go back for summer even though it has nothing to do with her degree and I will be working near her home town for my internship over the summer which would make seeing each other very convenient.
-Won't answer calls from the guy in front of me and tilts her phone away from me when she is texting him.
-Lastly she went out drinking with them and she knows how many people the guy has had sex with because he told her when he got drunk one night... Yet she is trying to tell me they never hooked up.


I'm wondering what I should do about this... It's not like I'm jealous, I don't even really know what the guy looks like because I can't find him on facebook... I just think she is lying and that would be an indicator that she is back in the relationship for money if she was heartless enough to use her grandfather passing away as an excuse to go fuck some random guy when she is states away from me and I can't do anything to try and comfort her... Basically do you all think I should get out? I tried talking to her about it multiple times and every time she blows up on me and says that I need to stop worrying about the past and stop trying to control her friendships because they are innocent unlike mine. Me and her are currently working on getting back together and I'm not sure if this fear is based in reality, and if it is, how I should go about fixing it or if I should just walk away."

I figure my best bet is to ask actual people living in Cincinnati, so that's what I'm doing here: how would you sell me the idea of living in Cincinnati? Like, what do you like about it, don't like?

That's a pretty open ended question. I have some more specific ones too.

I won't ask where to live because lots of people seem to ask that, but what about where do people hang out, preferably around my age (21-29)? Is there like ""a street"" where everybody hangs out, like some college towns? Or is it all spread out? If I wanted to go out drinking with friends, could we take the bus/taxi to the bar and then back for a reasonable amount?

Is it a safe city for a single girl? I've never lived in a big city before.

How much could I reasonably expect to pay for a 1 bedroom apartment in a nice and safe neighborhood, with a nice kitchen, and located close by to shops like a grocery store and a gym?

How hot or humid does it get in the summer? How cold in the winter? How can I learn how to drive in the snow since I've never done it and will need to go to work?

Just a warning. I dont *think* he wants to kill anyone, but he is big, buff, and his orgasm almost killed me, so dont hold back on the fire power.

1rrr7h,86,2013-11-30,An old guy's story,seabass4507,snowboarding,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/1rrr7h/an_old_guys_story/,"So it all started as I was growing up in the 80s. I was a skater kid, my heroes were all the old school guys like Lance Mountain and Neil Blender. I was never very good at skateboarding, but the counterculture and creative expression aspects drew me in from early on.

I think I went to the local skate shop every single day from 4th to 6th grade. One fall day they were playing a video by a company called Winterstick. What they were doing in the video was called snowboarding and it reminded me of the time I tried to sled the backyard hill standing up. Soon enough they had snowboards for sale in that shop, but I remember that $280 price tag taunting me from the tip of that board. I mentioned it to my mom, then I kind of forgot about it.

Then Christmas came. We weren't poor, but there wasn't a lot of extra money going around at that time. My family doesn't get extravagant Christmas gifts, ever. It never happened before that year, and hasn't happened since. When I came downstairs that Christmas the first thing I saw under that tree was my Burton Elite 140. I don't think I opened another gift, because I spent the rest of the day tumbling down the sledding hill in my back yard.

It was blue, had a swallowtail, a tiny metal fin on the bottom and the binding straps were nylon and fastened with big buckles. I remember wearing hiking boots the first few times, but not Sorels. The snowboard was probably too short for me, the bindings were set way back, and the highbacks were high to the point that I had bruises on my calves. That first time on a real ski resort was frustrating, but exhilarating. We had to call ahead to make sure they allowed snowboarding. I think I saw one other snowboarder that day, and we kind of nodded knowingly at one another. He was another skater kid, probably two years older than me, we were both pretty much first timers. This was before you could easily rent a snowboard. You had to kind of commit to it by buying a board before you tried it. I went maybe 5 or 6 times before the season ended that year.

The next season, a couple of my friends got snowboards and we had a little posse that tried to go every weekend that winter. By the end of the season I was linking turns, doing small jumps, riding most of the terrain at our local ski area. Since we were kind of the first kids in our area doing it. Even by the end of that season, there were only a handful of people snowboarding compared to the hordes of skiers. We would pop off of cat-tracks and think they were huge kickers. I wanted to do 180s, but my swallowtail kept me from landing backwards with any success. I read every Transworld Snowboarding mag from cover to cover, called all the companies for free stickers, scoured video stores for snowboard videos, I couldn't get enough. 

Just prior to the next season, Snowboarders In Exile came out. I think I broke my dads VCR playing that tape so many times. It was such a game changer. I loved Chris Roach's style. I mowed lawns all summer for money to get a Sims Halfpipe board just like Chris. Complete with those horribly uncomfortable Sims bindings. Neon straps. I duct taped padding to them to make them tolerable. Because we had a two season headstart on pretty much everyone, we were the best kids on the hill, we would have to find jumps because the ski areas hadn't started building parks yet. We snowboarded as much as we could that season. If we couldnt afford lift tickets, we would hike up and build a jump in the backcountry. No-grab 360s, 180s, Methods, Stalefish, Mutes, Non-Ironic Nosegrabs, Tailgrabs, RoastBeefs, Tuck-Knees, Cross-Rockets. Most importantly we felt like we were in on the ground floor of a huge movement. Snowboarding was clearly not just some weird fad like the monoski. It was a very cool scene at first, snowboarders bonded together over their burgeoning sport. Everyone encouraged eachother, helping each other get better and push the sport's boundaries. Nobody criticized each others style or clothing, because it hadn't been homogenized yet, we were still trying to decide what was cool.

Over the next few years snowboarding exploded and with guys like Palmer, Hetzel, Farmer, Salaznek and Ranquet leading the pack, it was definitely in full counterculture mode. Being a snowboarder came with a stigma. You were a ""punk"". Skiers inexplicably hated you, maybe for slumming up what was kind of an elitist sport. After a while though, a commercial element started to creep in. From 3 or 4 board companies, hundreds popped up. Kemper, Nitro, Ride, Morrow, Gnu as well as ski companies that started making boards like K2 and Elan. This is when styles started to show, people widened their stances, cut the tips off of their boards, and water proofed the biggest pair of jeans they could find.

We watched movies like Pocahontas, Creatures Of Habit, Roadkill, The Garden and Project Haakonsen and tried to emulate what those guys were doing. I was never a pipe guy like Brushie, and I was too tall to be technical like Iguchi, so I tried to ride with power, speed and style like Jamie Lynn. Which is harder than you might think. I remember thinking that after highschool was done, I would move to Mammoth to become a pro. I'd give myself to the arbitrary age of 24, if I wasn't pro by then I'd get a real job or go to college.

By the time high school was over, my close friends that I grew up riding with had all gradually stopped riding as much, but I still had the itch, so I found a new group of guys to ride with that pushed each other to get better. Local ski areas were starting to build parks, halfpipes went from being hand shaped ditches to using cats and eventually pipe dragons. I moved to Mammoth the November after graduating highschool. Most of my friends went off to college, I basically moved to Mammoth by myself, and though I met some really cool people there, being 18 in a ski town can be really lonely. There wasn't a day that passed that I didn't debate quitting my lift op job and driving down 395 back to the people I knew and loved. But I wanted to be a pro, I had to stick it out. I watched TB2 daily, the Jamie Lynn part in that was awe inspiring.

This was 1994, before Mammoth became the pro snowboarder Mecca. It had great natural terrain, but they hadn't really caught on with the park and pipe thing yet. We had to drive to June for that. So on days that weren't powder days, I would drive to June and try to improve my park skills. Fortunately, I was there on an epic record snow year, there was powder almost every day. My park skills progressed a bit, but not as much as my cliffs and powder skills. I was doing FS and BS 540s over big gaps, big BS 180 grabs, tweaked out Jamie Lynn methods off cliffs. I made it to May, the snow started to melt and I came back to my home town.

The next few years everything blew up for me. At the beginning of the next season, a board sponsor contacted me, he knew one of the guys I grew u riding with, he gave me some free stuff and invited me on their team trips. I also got sponsored by a local shop. I wasn't making any money, but free stuff and lift tickets is a huge deal to a kid like me. I worked nights delivering pizza and rode as much as I could. I'd ride icy/slushy parks 4-5 days a week with some really good riders. The legendary Mack Dawg videos came out, Stomping Grounds, Simple Pleasures, Decade as well as The Whiskey Videos. The ante was upped, shit went from flat 720s to backside rodeo 900s seemingly overnight. I tried to keep up though, I was known for big slow 360 BS and FS tailgrabs, switch BS mute 180s, BS Method 180s, Jamie Lynn style methods over big gaps, FS Stale 540s, FS indy 720s. I started dabbling in inverts, backflip method BS 180s, landed a handful of 90 Rolls and FS Rodeos and one BS Rodeo. (one under-rotated BS Rodeo I landed my crotch squarely on the knuckle of a pretty big jump)

This is where things started to change for me. It became less fun. Most of the kids I'd see at ski areas would have a shitty attitude. There was no snowboarder unity anymore. It was like a cool-kid fashion show. When people found out I was sponsored, they'd immediately try to prove themselves better than me. I started doing competitions around this time, and the cool kid attitude at those were a huge turn off as well. It was real cliquey. (if you're interested I can tell you the story of losing to Shawn White when he was half my age and half my height) Looking around ski areas, it was probably 60-40 snowboarders. Snowboarding was now the dominant winter sport, but the counterculture that I loved was losing it's edge as well as its camaraderie. The other guys I rode with stopped calling it riding/boarding and started calling it training. People started getting hyper critical of other riders. Guys like Ranquet and Roach were no longer the leaders of the sport, it was all about the Super Teams like DC and Forum. This is when there was an influx of what I called Snow Jocks. Kinda alpha male types, who thought that snowboarding was about physical aggression and brought their shitty attitude with them to the mountain. I blame the whole ""extreme!"" marketing trend.

So I think I was about 20 when I tore my rotator cuff. It was the beginning of the 1996-1997 season. There was a decent sized table top, I over-rotated a back flip. I was still 10 feet up when I finished my flip, so I threw my hands up to stop my momentum tearing the rotator cuff in my left shoulder and landed almost upside down on the landing. It was my first major injury from snowboarding. The recovery time was 6 weeks minimum. So I enrolled in some art classes at the community college to fill my time. I came back later that season, but my heart wasn't in it. I just didnt want to hurt myself again. Throwing myself off of icy park jumps and spinning and flipping in the air didn't seem like fun anymore. I think this lack of confidence caused me to come up short on a rather large Snow Summit jump nicknamed Wiseman, shattering my left ankle. I was done for the season. It was the first time since I was in 8th grade that I rode less than 20 days in a season.

During the off season, I was offered an internship at a design studio, which turned into a job. I tried to ride as much as I could the next season, entered a couple contests on the weekends. Didn't do well. Decided that my newfound passion for design had overcome my waning passion for snowboarding. So I called off my dream of being a pro snowboarder 3 years prior to my age 24 deadline. Called my sponsors and told them I was quitting. They didn't understand, people don't call and say ""Please dont give me free stuff anymore"" I told them to give my spot to some kid who wants it more than I do.

I'm 37 now, a rather successful graphic designer, looking back fondly on that time of my life. Wondering what my life would be like if I didnt over-rotate that flip. If I had the chance though, I wouldn't change a thing.

So now I see kids doing triple corks in the X Games and cant help but feel a little bit of pride that I was part of the beginning of that. I somehow had a part in progressing the sport to it's current state. I still enjoy watching the videos. Especially Travis Rice and Nicholas Muller, those guys ride with speed and style. Although I'm not a fan of the street stuff, I do appreciate it for what it is, I would just hate to think thats all some of those kids do. As far as X Games halfpipe, I'm not a fan of how homogenized the competitions have become and how Shawn White can do the same run as someone else, but his is somehow better because hes Shawn White. It might just be the nostalgia speaking, but I think snowboarding has kind of lost it's edge, I don't think it'll stay that way forever though. Some up and coming Szabo/Ranquet/Roach types will reclaim it eventually.

I still ride on occasion, maybe 10 days a season, but rarely get that stoked feeling I used to get. Unless it's a powder day, I'll ride in the mornings until it gets crowded, then have a beer or two at the lodge and go home around noon. Its kind of depressing that I can barely hit medium sized jumps anymore, and Im getting worse every time. I still love doing big Jamie Lynn style methods on a heelside hip though.

I don't know what the point of all this is. Part history lesson, part ""Don't give up on your dreams"" speech, part, ""Get a job, hippie!"" speech. I guess it's mostly ""Do what you enjoy until you don't enjoy it, then find something else you enjoy.""

TL;DR I used to snowboard alot, now I just stroke my beard

edit: wow, my first gold! Thanks!"
1rrn7b,1,2013-11-30,I wish I never met her.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rrn7b/i_wish_i_never_met_her/,"Valentine's Day. I slept in, skipped my classes, and that night hung out with a friend. That night I met a girl. I spent most of the night at that girl's place. It was exciting and terrifying and totally not how I thought my day would go. I had been with girls before but this was different. It felt more ""adult"" in a lot of ways.

But I fucked up about two weeks later. I was so, so wrong in how I handled that situation. The particulars of it don't matter anymore, but it blew my semester to hell. Academically I was fine, but personally I shut down. I stopped going to mass, driving away my best friend for the rest of the semester. I became insufferable to be around. I was afraid to go back to the place I met her because I figured I would see her, and I didn't want that.

Things got better, slowly. I went back to that place, and I saw her two or three times after the fact, but it never became a big deal. I'd dwell on her the rest of the day, maybe, but I had more or less moved on. Going home for the summer and shutting myself off from people helped. I got my head straight, finally.

The first few weeks of this semester went well. Mid-September, though… that's when things started going downhill. I went out with a girl I knew from long ago, and over the course of the date she admitted to fooling around with multiple married men. I don't really look favorably upon cheating or any kind of emotional manipulation, so I hauled ass and left her alone. While she's texting me - ""Come back, I'll explain, I'll pay for your dinner,"" as if that'll help – I run into that girl from Valentine's Day. I almost physically ran into her because I was distracted by my phone, but I caught myself and when I looked up I saw on her face a look of contempt that still gives me a rotten feeling in my stomach when I think about it. 

I didn't process it at the time. I got out of her way and kept walking. The rest of the night went surprisingly okay, but the look on her face haunted me. I remember it more clearly now than I do her look of interest during our first encounter. It only reinforced how terrible I felt about the situation to begin with. Everything I thought I had settled in my mind started rising from the depths.

Time passes. I go out on two quasi-dates with this perfectly nice girl that I simply had no chemistry with. Attractive (10/10, in my book), charming, easily the most dateable girl I have met, but it wasn't quite there, and I felt downright troglodytic in her presence and I don't want to put another girl through that. (I learned the hard way that girls tend not to like guys who need to have their hand held through their insecurities. On a more general level, unattractive appearance + unattractive behavior = disqualified from romantic pursuits. I accept my fate.)

My mindset changed as the semester dragged on. I've struggled to find work. I had this internship opportunity that could have made my life, but I bombed the second interview. I would see *her* every now and then, but never at that original place. And each time I would think about her the rest of the day, playing back that night we spent together and my astronomically retarded behavior afterward. This, coupled with the fact that she's probably living a happy and sexually satisfying life (I haven't so much as kissed a girl since) and doesn't waste a single thought on my pathetic ass, doesn't really help my low self-esteem.

I have been thinking about her more lately, and about that situation and how stupid I was. How stupid I am. I mean nothing to this girl, and have meant nothing to her since I lashed out at her, and all for good reason. I have had no desire to reach out to her and apologize, not because I'm not sorry, but because doing so, especially after so much time has passed, would be a truly desperate gesture. I'd be surprised if she remembers my name.

I deactivated my Facebook account after I learned that this girl is friends with one of my instructors this semester. I don't know the details of their friendship, or even if it's a real friendship as opposed to the convenience of Facebook. But that triggered a kind of irrationality that I knew I had to escape. Blah blah, they talked about me months ago, blah blah, my instructor dislikes me and somehow it has affected my grade in the class (it hasn't, as far as I can tell), blah blah. Then I have other thoughts, like what if the girl (or the instructor or whoever else is connected with this particular person) reads this post, and blah blah I'm a pathetic little shit who can't get over something that happened nearly ten months ago, I'm so lame, blah blah.

I feel like a child whenever I think about her, because I know she doesn't think about me and, if she knew about half the anxiety this has put me through, she'd probably laugh in my face. Or maybe she would say she has no hard feelings and I should move on. I don't fucking know. I'm so caught up in who this person was at that particular time in my life that I can't stand to look another girl in the eyes. My self-esteem is shit, and I deliberately shut down opportunities to befriend girls (not that those opportunities come often) because I'd rather avoid it altogether than be such an enormous annoyance again. My circle of friends has shrunken as it is. I feel more alone than I did when I started college, and I graduate in a matter of weeks.

And, you know, if she sees this, or if anybody who knows me sees this (people I consider friends would definitely know who I am based on these details; acquaintances might piece it together), then I've been exposed as a man-child. Not that that was groundbreaking news to begin with."
